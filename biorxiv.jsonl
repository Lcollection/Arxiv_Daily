Recently, a second map restricted to essential genes was created using CRISPRi-induced loss-of-function alleles. Here, the two maps are compared to understand their similarities and differences. Both maps showed significant overlap with protein-protein interaction databases and identified a shared set of interacting genes, although the specific gene pairs differed between approaches. Notably, the RH map exhibited strong overlap with genome-wide association study (GWAS) networks, while the CRISPRi map did not. These findings demonstrate how gain- and loss-of-function alleles reveal distinct yet complementary genetic interaction landscapes.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we solve this enigma by addressing this question through the identification of an indispensable, co-dependent regulatory circuit formed between FOXA1 and the SAM pointed domain containing ETS-family transcription factor (SPDEF). Using integrative multi-omics analyses of patient tumors and experimental models, we demonstrate that this circuit functions as the master guardian of the HER2-positive luminal state. It executes this role via two distinct, essential mechanisms: it directly binds regulatory elements to drive high-level expression of the ERBB2 oncogene, and it simultaneously preserves epithelial identity by suppressing a latent program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, the FOXA1/SPDEF circuit promotes the expression of the transcriptional repressor TRPS1, which in turn antagonizes the pro-mesenchymal activity of the TEAD/YAP complex. Our findings define a central regulatory node that couples lineage fidelity to oncogenic output in HER2-positive cancer, revealing the FOXA1/SPDEF-TRPS1 axis as a critical determinant of tumor plasticity and a potential therapeutic target for overcoming resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

We analyse intracranial EEG (sEEG) recordings of patients suffering from pharmaco- resistant epilepsy with postictal aphasia. We study the Functional Connectivity (FC) between different cortical sites in a time- and frequency-resolved manner, representing each recording as a time-varying, multilayer network (dynamic multiplex). We studied in particular: the rate of overall reconfiguration of links from one frame to the next, or dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) speed; and the stability of network modules through time, by means of a dynamic modular Allegiance (dA) analysis. The combination of these two approaches allows identifying states of \"Functional Connectivity flow\" (beyond connectivity states), defined as epochs in which network reconfiguration occurs with comparable speed and degree of spatio-temporal coordination. Our unsupervised analyses reveal then that high-frequency dFC is slowed down in a long postictal phase lasting well beyond the ictal episodes themselves. Furthermore, a pathological state of slow and poorly structured network flow consistently co-occurs with episodes of aphasia symptoms annotated by the clinicians. In conclusion, our multiplex network dynamics description cast light on functional mechanisms of postictal cognitive dysfunction at the level of individual patients.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

New studies show that mitochondria critically regulate the phenotypic adaptability of macrophages. To determine whether these organelles play similar roles in shaping microglial phenotype, we generated transgenic crosses to accurately visualize and manipulate microglial mitochondria. We find that brain-region differences in microglial attributes and responses to aging are accompanied by regional differences in mitochondrial mass and aging-associated mitochondrial remodeling. Microglial mitochondria are also altered within hours of LPS injections and microglial expression of inflammation-, trophic-, and phagocytosis-relevant genes is strongly correlated with expression levels of mitochondria-relevant genes. Finally, direct genetic manipulation of microglial mitochondria alters microglial morphology and leads to brain-region specific effects on microglial gene expression. Overall, this study advances our understanding of microglial mitochondria and supports the idea that mitochondria influence basal microglia phenotype and phenotypic remodeling that takes place over hours to months.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we constructed a fine-scale recombination map leveraging whole-genome data from domestic chickens, encompassing both contemporary commercial breeds and the wild progenitor, the Red Junglefowl (RJF). Our analysis revealed the rapid evolution of the recombination landscape within and across chicken populations, with significant variation in recombination coldspots and hotspots, particularly in commercial breeds. The occurrence of coldspots and the disappearance of hotspots are closely associated with selective sweeps.Contrary to prevailing observations in most species, we observed a weakly negative correlation between recombination rates and the frequency of introgressed ancestry from other RJF subspecies.

However, kinetic variants with ultrafast or slow off-kinetics are needed to broaden the spectrum of applications from monitoring rapid synaptic glutamate transients to mesoscale imaging of brain activity. Here we report binding-site variant S72T (iGlu3Fast) optimised for reporting fast glutamate release at individual sites with a fluorescence dynamic range of 57 and a decay t1/2 of 2 ms in solution, ~5-fold faster than iGluSnFR3. In contrast, variants D25A and D25R (termed iGlu3Slow1 and iGlu3Slow2, respectively) presented with slow off-kinetics (decay t1/2 43 ms and 30 ms, respectively, at 20oC), while retaining high dynamic ranges (48 and 65, respectively). These values were reduced when expressed in HEK293T cells, glutamate dissociation from iGlu3Fast slowed to a decay t1/2 of 6.9 ms, while decay t1/2-s of 115 and 234 ms were measured for iGlu3Slow1 and iGlu3Slow2, respectively. The slow decay rates in cells were in accordance with reduced Kd-s in the range of 200 microM for iGlu3Fast and 6.4 and 8.4 microM for iGlu3Slow1 and iGlu3Slow2, respectively. 2-photon imaging in organotypic hippocampal slices reported spontaneous activity with high sensitivity by both iGlu3Fast and iGlu3Slow2. Strikingly, different kinds of glutamate transient were detected by the fast- and slow-decay sensors indicating that the rapid kinetics and increased fluorescence dynamic range make iGlu3Fast an excellent candidate for imaging high-frequency glutamate release at synapses while iGlu3Slow2 has the potential for mesoscale imaging of brain activity to record global events with high sensitivity.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

While generally well tolerated below 40 {degrees}C, in rare cases fever can abnormally elevate neural activity and induce seizures in neurotypical children aged 2-5 years. This study investigates the mechanisms by which neuronal activity is maintained and stabilized during exposure to fever-range temperatures. Recordings of layer (L)4-evoked spiking in L2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) of mouse somatosensory cortex revealed four outcomes as temperature increased from 30 {degrees}C to 36 {degrees}C and 39 {degrees}C (fever-range): neurons remained inactive, stayed active, ceased activity, or initiated activity. Roughly equal proportions of neurons ceased or initiated spiking, making the subset of STAY PNs, those that remain active across temperatures, crucial for maintaining stable cortical output. STAY PNs were more prevalent at younger postnatal ages. Their firing stability was supported by a distinct ion channel composition, including the thermosensitive channel TRPV3, which enables continued spiking by adjusting depolarization to meet spike threshold. Intracellular blockade of TRPV3, but not TRPV4, significantly reduced the proportion of STAY PNs and suppressed spiking at 39 {degrees}C. Moreover, in Trpv3 -/-  mice, temperature increases to 39 {degrees}C reduced both spiking and postsynaptic potential amplitude, and these mice exhibited a delayed seizure onset. Together, these findings suggest that TRPV3 contributes to the preservation of cortical activity during fever.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined how perceptual ratings relate to spectro-temporal and vocal parameters of pseudowords across eight meaning domains. We largely replicated our previous findings for shape, while observing different patterns for other domains. Using a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm, we compared 4095 combinations of twelve acoustic parameters (3 spectro-temporal and 9 characterizing vocal quality) to find the optimal combination associated with sound-symbolic ratings in each domain. We found sound-symbolic mappings linked to domain-specific combinations of acoustic parameters. One spectro-temporal parameter, the fast Fourier transform, contributed to all domains, indicating the significance of time-varying spectral properties for sound-symbolic judgments. We applied the KNN approach to generate shape ratings for 160 real words.

Moreover, we provide primer evidence suggesting that transcriptome states are inherited, dynamically interconvert and determine phenotypic output upon a variety of biological cues, not as a result of transcriptional shifts, but rather through yet unidentified post-transcriptional mechanisms. Remarkably, among phenotypically divergent clonal cell populations enriched in subsets of transcriptome states, we identified a peri-nuclear cytoplasmic structure (Signal Integration Portal - SIP) where state-specific lncRNAs, proteins harbouring intrinsically disordered regions and various active signalling pathways converge.

There is a pressing need for tools that allow automated analysis of convergent mutations. In response to this need, we developed ConvMut, a tool to analyze genetic sequence data to identify patterns of recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To this end, we exploited the granular phylogenetic tree representation developed by PANGO, allowing us to observe what we call deltas, i.e., groups of mutations that are acquired on top of the immediately upstream tree nodes. Deltas comprise amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. ConvMut can perform individual protein analysis to identify the most common single mutations acquired independently in a given subtree (starting from a user-selected root). Such mutations are represented in a barplot that can be sorted by frequency or position, and filtered by region of interest. Lineages are then gathered into clusters according to their sets of shared mutations. Finally, an interactive graph orders the evolutionary steps of clusters, details the acquired amino acid changes for each sublineage, and allows us to trace the evolutionary path until a selected lineage. Other unique tools are paired with the main functionality of ConvMut to support a complete analysis, such as a frequency analysis for a given nucleotide or amino acid changes at a given residue across a selected phylogenetic subtree.

We measured mutation rates for repeat length instability, quantitatively modeled the per-generation action of mutations, and observed the corresponding long-term behavior shaping the repeat length distribution. We found that short repetitive sequences appear to be a straightforward consequence of random substitution. Evolving largely independently, longer repeats (above roughly 10 nt) emerge and persist in a rapidly mutating dynamic balance between expansion, contraction and interruption. These mutational processes, collectively, are sufficient to explain the abundance of long repeats, without invoking natural selection.

Whilst reversal learning has been strongly linked to the orbitofrontal cortex, its dependence on the primate dlPFC, and its rodent analogue the medial PFC (mPFC), is less clear. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that the mPFC may be required for reversal learning if the reversal is demanding. Furthermore, even if the mPFC is not required, mPFC disinhibition may impair reversals, because it may disrupt processing in mPFC projection sites. To test these hypotheses, we combined bi-directional manipulations of mPFC GABAergic inhibition, using intracerebral drug microinfusion and chemogenetic/DREADD methods, with reversal testing on a food-reinforced two-lever discrimination task in rats. First, we induced mPFC functional inhibition and disinhibition, by microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol or antagonist picrotoxin, respectively, and examined the impact on early reversals (reversals 1-3) and well-established serial reversals (reversal 5 onwards). Using classical performance measures and Bayesian trial-by-trial strategy analysis, we found that mPFC muscimol impaired early, but not serial, reversals, increasing perseveration and impairing exploratory (lose-shift) behavior at reversal 2. In contrast, mPFC picrotoxin impaired serial reversals, reducing exploratory (lose-shift) and exploitative (win-stay) behavior. Second, to inhibit mPFC GABAergic neurons, we expressed the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in these neurons; chemogenetic mPFC disinhibition by activation of hM4Di also impaired serial reversal learning, primarily disrupting exploitation. Our findings suggest that mPFC hypoactivation and disinhibition disrupt distinct aspects of reversal learning by different mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Starting with magnetic resonance images of brains of a newborn ferret, a fetal macaque, and a fetal human, we construct two-layer physical gel brain models that swell superficially in a solvent, leading to folding patterns similar to those seen in vivo. We then adopt a three-dimensional continuum model based on differential growth to simulate cortical folding in silico. Finally, we deploy a comparative morphometric analysis of the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico surface buckling patterns across species.

Connexins are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body and are implicated in a wide range of processes. The permselectivity of connexin hemichannels for small neurochemicals remains poorly understood. By coexpressing genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for ATP, glutamate and lactate with a range of connexins, we examined the ability of different hemichannels to permit release of these compounds under physiological conditions and in response to physiological stimuli (small changes in PCO2 and transmembrane depolarisation). We found that some connexin hemichannels were relatively non-selective (Cx26, Cx32, Cx43, Cx31.1) allowing passage of ATP, glutamate and lactate. By contrast other connexin hemichannels (Cx36, Cx46 and Cx50) were highly selective. Cx36 and Cx46 hemichannels allowed release of ATP, but not glutamate or lactate. The size of the permeating molecule cannot be the sole determinant of permselectivity. By contrast, Cx50 hemichannels permitted the release of lactate and glutamate but not ATP. We also found that the nature of the opening stimulus could alter the permselectivity of the hemichannel -for some of the relatively non-selective connexins, hemichannel opening via depolarisation was ineffective at allowing release of lactate. By performing a mutational analysis, informed by the differential selectivity of the closely related Cx46 and Cx50 hemichannels, we found that the charge on the N-terminus and N-terminus-TM2 interactions are key contributors to permselectivity for ATP.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

This study investigates how neural oscillations influence decision network models of competing cortical columns with varying intrinsic and emergent timescales. Our findings reveal that decision networks with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses are more susceptible to oscillatory modulations. Higher in-phase oscillation amplitude reduces decision confidence without affecting accuracy, while decision speed increases. In contrast, anti-phase modulation increases decision accuracy, confidence and speed. Increasing oscillation frequency reverses these effects. Changing oscillatory phase difference gradually modulates decision behaviour, with decision confidence affected nonlinearly. Moreover, neural resonance can further enhance modulatory susceptibility for network with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses. These effects decouple decision accuracy, speed and confidence, challenging standard speed-accuracy trade-off. These phenomena can be explained by excitatory neural populations contributing more to in-phase modulation, while inhibitory neural populations to anti-phase modulation. State-space trajectories' momentum swinging with respect to network steady states and decision uncertainty manifold further provide insights into the neural circuit mechanisms.

R.", "abstract": "Due to the favorable chemical properties of mirrored chiral centers (such as improved stability, bioavailability, and membrane permeability) the computational design of D-peptides targeting biological L-proteins is a valuable area of research. To design these structures in silico, a computational workflow should correctly dock and fold a peptide while maintaining chiral centers. The latest AlphaFold 3 (AF3) from Abramson et al. (2024) enforces a strict chiral violation penalty to maintain chiral centers from model inputs and is reported to have a low chiral violation rate of only 4.4% on a PoseBusters benchmark containing diverse chiral molecules. Herein, we report the results of 3,255 experiments with AF3 to evaluate its ability to predict the fold, chirality, and binding pose of D-peptides in heterochiral complexes. Despite our inputs specifying explicit D-stereocenters, we report that the AF3 chiral violation for D-peptide binders is much higher at 51% across all evaluated predictions; on average the model is as accurate as chance (random chirality choice, L or D, for each peptide residue). Increasing the number of seeds failed to improve this violation rate. The AF3 predictions exhibit incorrect folds and binding poses, with D-peptides commonly oriented incorrectly in the L-protein binding pocket. Confidence metrics returned by AF3 also fail to distinguish predictions with low chirality violation and correct docking vs. predictions with high chirality violation and incorrect docking. We conclude that AF3 is a poor predictor of D-peptide chirality, fold, and binding pose. Finally, we propose solutions to improve this model.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Benchmarked against SNP-SELEX data for six TFs (SPIB, ELK3, ETV4, SF-1, PAX5 and MEIS2), the FoldX-based strategy showed good agreement with experimental allele preferences. Interestingly, differences in AF3's interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) score aligned even more closely with SNP-SELEX results, generally surpassing energy-based metrics. Application to known disease-associated variants recapitulated most reported effects for TFs including NKX2-5, GATA3 and USF2A-USF1. In these examples, considering both {triangleup}ipTM and FoldX energies proved more reliable than either metric alone. While less accurate than state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, this work demonstrates that structural modelling can yield interpretable insights into how non-coding variants influence TF binding.

However, urban green infrastructures (UGIs) can influence the distribution of disease vectors, potentially affecting vector-borne diseases (VBDs). UGIs may provide new suitable environments for urban vectors, while also creating opportunities to mitigate VBD risks through predation, competition, and dilution effects. This article examined the relationships between UGIs, vectors, and associated pathogens, impacting both human and animal health, highlighting knowledge gaps and identifying research priorities to support VBD risk mitigation measures and to guide smart urban planning and design. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in three databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science). Selected articles involved (i) any aspect of a urban vector system, (ii) in UGIs, and (iii) statistical analysis of the effects of UGIs on VBD risk. Methods employed to characterize UGIs and VBDs were described and the identified impacts were summarized by vector group. Results: Among the 98 articles reviewed, most addressed mosquito-pathogen systems (66), tick-pathogen systems (29), and few other vector-borne pathogen systems (3), with studies often confined to a single city or several cities within the same country and focused on one vector group. Urban vegetation generally appeared to heighten the risk of tick-borne diseases. In contrast, the influence of UGIs on the risk of mosquito-borne diseases varied depending on the vector system and on the environmental and climatic context. The diversity of indicators used to assess UGIs and VBD risks may affect the observed impact on VBD risk. Conclusion: Given the increasing popularity of urban greening, it is crucial to investigate its potential implications for public health, and thereby urban planning decisions. However, the lack of standardized protocols complicates the accurate assessment of the effects of UGIs on the risk for VBD emergence and transmission and consequently, on potential mitigation measures.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

This is particularly challenging during repair of repetitive genome regions for which non-allelic sequences can errantly be used as templates. Here, we develop a model to study spontaneous DNA damage and repair that occurs at repetitive protein coding genes of the S. pombe flocculin family. We observe that genes encoding most members of this protein family constitutively reside at the nuclear periphery by virtue of their close proximity to binding sites for the CENP-B like protein, Cbp1. Tethering via Cbp1 to the nuclear periphery enhances the stability of the flocculin genes against intragenic recombination and restrains intergenic recombination between homoeologous repeat-encoding sequences. The LINC complex component Kms1 also antagonizes both intragenic and intergenic recombination at the flocculin genes as well as microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ).

While the identifiability of phylogenetic trees and level-1 networks, those with non-overlapping reticulation cycles, has been previously established, less is known about more complex network topologies. In this work, we extend identifiability results to broader classes of networks that include pairs of tangled reticulations. Our main result establishes that binary semi-directed level-2 phylogenetic networks are generically identifiable under the Jukes-Cantor model, provided they are triangle-free and strongly tree-child. We also strengthen existing identifiability results for level-1 networks, showing that the number of reticulation nodes is generically identifiable under the Jukes-Cantor model. In addition, we present more general identifiability results that do not restrict the network level at all and hold for the Jukes-Cantor as well as for the Kimura-2-Parameter model. Specifically, we demonstrate that any two binary semi-directed networks that display different sets of 4-leaf subtrees (quartets) are distinguishable. This has direct implications for the identifiability of a network's reticulated components (blobs). We show that the tree-of-blobs of a network, the global branching structure of the network, is identifiable, as well as the circular ordering of the subnetworks around each blob, for networks in which edges do not cross and taxa are on the outside.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

They are predicted to be relevant genetic architectures for local adaptation in the face of gene flow. However, pinpointing the underlying traits and functional mechanisms under selection remains challenging. The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida harbors several large polymorphic inversions, of which the Cf-Inv(4.1) inversion displays a latitudinal cline of frequencies along the North American Atlantic Coast, suggesting a putative role in adaptation along the eco-climatic gradient. To investigate this hypothesis, we designed a molecular marker for karyotyping and studied natural and experimental populations from North America and Europe. We confirmed that this inversion is also polymorphic in Europe, and displays parallel latitudinal clines across continents, providing strong indirect support that Cf-Inv(4.1) is under natural selection along similar environmental gradients. We found that Cf-Inv(4.1) had a significant impact on egg-to-adult survival and fecundity under different thermal conditions. However, no effect on cold tolerance could be determined using supercooling point and chill coma recovery time. We speculate that fitness associated with Cf-Inv(4.1) is shaped by subtle life-history differences whose relative advantage depends on climate. While our experimental approaches provided insights into genotype-phenotype associations, it is worth noting that selection acts on the overall fitness, involving complex sets of traits. This is especially relevant for inversions linking hundreds of genes. This multi-gene property also explains why inversions are frequently involved in repeated parallel adaptation to environmental gradients, as demonstrated here in the seaweed fly.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Dyads spontaneously converged on distinct stable strategies along the cooperation-competition spectrum, forming three similarly sized groups: cooperative, intermediate, and competitive. Despite the behavioral complexity, our computational model, which incorporated travel path minimization, sensorimotor communication, and recent choice history, predicted dyadic decisions with 87% accuracy, and linked prediction certainty with ensuing dynamics of spatiotemporal coordination. Further modeling revealed how sensorimotor factors, such as movement speed and skill, shape distinct strategies and payoffs. Crucially, we quantify the cost of cooperation, demonstrating that in many dyads prosocial tendencies outweigh the individual benefits of exploiting skill advantages.

Understanding the genetic architecture of such correlations is important for predicting the selection response of populations. Exploration in fishes is a behavioral trait by which individuals may find habitats with better foraging and growth opportunities that subsequently improve their fitness. For example, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), all individuals originate in spawning rivers where females lay eggs, but some juveniles migrate to small tributaries which are not spawning areas but provide favorable habitat patches for young salmon. The increased growth in these nursery streams may facilitate earlier sexual maturation, implying a potential correlation between exploration and maturation traits. In this study, by sampling juveniles from two wild populations in the large Teno River catchment in northernmost Fennoscandia, we tested the genetic association between exploration behavior with nursery streams across four SNPs that span a 70-kb long genomic region with a major effect on age at maturity variation. Three of these SNPs are missense mutations in the vgll3 and akap11 genes, and one SNP tags a putative regulatory region with the strongest association with the age-at-maturity trait. We show that the exploration behavior was linked to the genomic region in one of the two studied populations. However, the genetic association was substantial in the missense SNP located in the akap11 gene, which is farthest away from the vgll3 SNPs and previously ruled out as being linked to the age at maturity. We also detected a marginal interaction effect between SNPs in the vgll3 gene and akap11, indicating a potentially complex genetic architecture underlying the trait variation. Our results suggest that exploration and age at maturity are co-inherited within the same haplotype block, but we find no evidence for direct causality.

Animal studies have shown that vasomotor activity contributes to coherent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. However, in humans, detecting this contribution non-invasively remains challenging due to the limited spatiotemporal sensitivity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to vasomotion. Given that prior studies have identified ICAS as an informative conditional lesion model of vasomotor and hemodynamic impairments in humans, we investigated whether vasomotor dysfunction affects interhemispheric BOLD coherence at ~0.1 Hz. Using a multi-modal fMRI framework integrating resting-state fMRI with quantitative mapping of cerebral blood volume, blood flow, oxygen metabolism, and BOLD time lag, we compared BOLD coherence between patients with unilateral ICAS and healthy controls. Frequency-specific analysis revealed significantly diminished interhemispheric BOLD coherence at ~0.1 Hz across canonical resting-state networks in ICAS patients, while ultra-slow (<0.05 Hz) coherence remained largely preserved. This reduction was spatially widespread and particularly pronounced in watershed areas, i.e., border zones between major vascular territories, associated with significantly increased lateralization of cerebral blood volume (p < 0.01). Notably, coherence-based FC patterns at ~0.1 Hz were heterogeneous within watershed areas but homogeneous outside, suggesting an interplay between compensatory mechanisms and vasomotor impairment. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that frequency-resolved, region-specific analysis can capture 0.1 Hz-specific oscillatory signals and detect subtle alterations in interhemispheric FC, offering a non-invasive biomarker for early cerebrovascular dysfunction, particularly in ICAS.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we assessed the algal symbiotic characteristics of the nudibranch Spurilla braziliana. Histological analyses revealed limited branching of the digestive gland and the presence of intact Symbiodiniaceae cells within lysosome-rich epithelial digestive cells. Metagenomic profiling further showed a complete absence of Endozoicomonas--bacteria typically linked to Symbiodiniaceae symbioses--in this species.

We assess temporal trends in mammal species descriptions (1990-2025) using four proxies of comprehensiveness - counts of examined specimens and compared taxa, number of pages (only from the Methods/Results sections), and number of evidence lines (i.e., analytical tools and techniques). Using generalized linear models, we assessed how these proxies are explained by factors associated with species' biology, geography, and taxonomic practice. Most new species derive from tropical regions, particularly rodents and bats, reflecting global discovery hotspots. Descriptions have grown more rigorous over time, with expanded specimen sampling, broader taxonomic comparisons, and integrative methods. However, disparities emerge along geographic and biological axes: descriptions from temperate regions incorporate more evidence lines, while small-bodied and tropical species (especially bats) remain understudied due to sampling biases and resource limitations. Body size inversely correlates with description length, as smaller species often require advanced diagnostics. Species-rich genera show greater comprehensiveness, likely due to heightened diagnostic scrutiny. Our findings highlight progress in taxonomic rigor but underscore persistent gaps tied to geography, body size, and accessibility of analytical tools. Addressing these disparities requires targeted investments in local capacity, equitable collaboration, and accessible methodologies to strengthen global taxonomic infrastructure and support conservation priorities.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

We introduce ProtSEC (Protein Sequence Embedding in Complex Space), a novel approach that encodes each amino acid as a unique complex number derived from the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. By modeling protein sequences as complex signals and applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), ProtSEC generates embeddings in the complex space. Unlike PLMs, ProtSEC requires no pre-training on large protein sequence datasets and operates independently of any pre-trained models. Our benchmarking demonstrate that ProtSEC achieves a 20,000-fold reduction in runtime and an 85-fold improvement in memory efficiency compared to popular PLMs (e.g., esm2_3B, esm2_35M, prot_t5, prot_bert). Depending on the task, ProtSEC demonstrates either superior or comparable accuracy to PLMs in sequence similarity search, sequence classification and phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

While bacterial alkane monooxygenase AlkB catalyzes the terminal hydroxylation of aliphatic esters with excellent regioselectivity, the molecular principles of substrate recognition and selectivity of this integral membrane enzyme are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the substrate scope and engineered the medium-chain alkane monooxygenase from Marinobacter sp. (M_AlkB) for the terminal hydroxylation of linear and branched esters of fatty acids and alcohols. For the first time, we demonstrated the stereoselectivity of AlkB towards prochiral substrates containing terminal gem-dimethyl groups, leading to the corresponding chiral beta-methyl primary alcohols in good optical purity (51-79% ee). The hydroxylation products can be further derivatized to chiral diols and lactones. Substitution of the highly conserved active site residue F169 to leucine increased the activity towards short and medium-chain esters up to two-fold. While the wildtype enzyme does not accept long-chain substrates, activity towards n-dodecyl acetate could be unlocked by reducing the size of the tryptophan residue 60 situated in the putative substrate tunnel. Substitution of the peripheral I238 with valine increased activity regardless of the chain length of the substrate. Our results lay the groundwork for the establishment of a whole-cell process for the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of linear and branched esters, leading to valuable bifunctionalized products.

Grazing and selectivity were evaluated considering prey trophic mode and size as food quality descriptors in copepod diets and compared with microzooplankton grazing. Copepod ingestion rate on eukaryotes ranged from 3.4 to 138 ng carbon (C) ind-1 d-1. Diet was dominated by mixotrophic (5-89%) and heterotrophic (0- 84%) prey, with autotrophs contributing 2-17%. Nanoplankton provided the highest C intake to copepods (62-99%) rather than more abundant picoplankton (0.8-38%). No measurable reduction in chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration occurred from copepod grazing through food removal, suggesting a possible trophic cascade, although gut content revealed ingestion of 0.8 g Chla ind-1 d-1. Copepods showed moderate selection for picoplankton (E=0.3) over nanoplankton, perhaps due to faster consumption of nanoplankton by microzooplankton or ingestion of picoplankton aggregates. Ingestion of 15N (nitrogen)-labelled prey indicated indicated copepod consumption of protistan consumers or small metazoans. We found significantly greater (~5-fold) copepod N consumption when using 1-2 m 15N-prey (Synechococcus), compared to <1 m sized prey (Prochlorococcus). Microzooplankton grazing on eukaryotes (0.07-2.5 d-1) and prokaryotes (0.3-2.1 d-1) greatly exceeded copepod grazing. Microzooplankton diet consisted mainly of heterotrophs (25-59%) and mixotrophs (13-41%), with lower autotrophic contribution (12-33%) of more nano- (95-98%) than picophytoplankton (2- 5%) ingested. Overall, microzooplankton removed most of daily production (111%) in contrast to 7% for copepods.

In mice, exposure to an obesogenic high-fat and sugar diet (HFD) resulted in social recognition memory deficits, a process that is dependent upon hippocampal area CA2 and oxytocin signaling. HFD-fed mice had stronger inputs onto CA2 pyramidal neurons that led to increased action potential firing, without altering intrinsic properties or inhibitory transmission. Chemogenetic CA2 inhibition rescued HFD-induced social memory deficits, confirming the role of CA2 hyperexcitability in these effects. In CA2, oxytocin receptor activation resulted in membrane depolarization, spontaneous action-potential firing and permitted endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity in control diet-fed mice, but not HFD-fed littermates. In a concentration-dependent manner, oxytocin restored potentiation of excitatory responses and allowed for endocannabinoid plasticity at CA2 inhibitory synapses as well as social memory deficits in HFD-fed mice.

It is unclear how such efficient learning is possible, since existing computational models of spatial navigation require far more experience to achieve comparable performance and do not attempt to explain the evolving structure of animal behavior during learning. To inform a new algorithm for rapid learning of navigational goals, we took inspiration from the reliable structure of behavior as mice learned to intercept hidden spatial targets. We designed agents that generate behavioral trajectories by controlling the speed and angular velocity of smooth path segments between anchor points. To rapidly learn good anchors, we use Bayesian inference on the history of rewarded and unrewarded trajectories to infer the probability that an anchor will be successful, and active sampling to trim hypothesized anchors. Agents learn within tens of trials to generate compact trajectories that intercept a target, capturing the evolution of behavioral structure and matching the upper limits of learning efficiency observed in mice. We further show that this algorithm can explain how mice avoid obstacles and rapidly adapt to target switches. Finally, we show that this framework naturally encompasses both egocentric and allocentric strategies for navigation.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

We improved gene calling of 12% of giant virus genomes by accounting for alternative and custom genetic codes, enabling more accurate identification of protein-coding genes. Database mining uncovered endogenous viral elements in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, spanning algae, fungi, and parasitic protists highlighting that giant virus integration is both widespread and evolutionarily persistent. Orthologous clustering of 2.5 million proteins identified 135,998 orthogroups representing comprehensive metabolic capabilities, such as enrichment of genes involved in aromatic compound degradation (commonly associated with bioremediation) in Algavirales genomes.

Mutations in TP53 occur in various ways which can result in p53 null tumor cells as well as in tumor cells highly expressing missense, gain of oncogenic function p53 proteins. Gain of function p53 proteins not only lose wild type p53 pro-apoptotic and DNA repair functions, but gain novel oncogenic functions. We hypothesize that directly targeting missense mutant p53 instead of downstream pathways has substantial advantages. Analogues of curcumin have been reported to bind mutant p53 to accomplish this goal. In this report, we studied a series of novel molecules derived from the curcumin backbone. We identified a particularly active curcumin analogue, AKT-100, and demonstrate binding to mutant p53 proteins to reinstate p53 wild type functionality. This agent exhibits impressive cell killing in multiple ovarian and serous endometrial cancer cells at concentrations ranging from 100-300 nM. AKT-100 is also synergistic with the PARP inhibitor olaparib and with chemotherapy by inhibiting alternative DNA repair mechanisms associated with resistance to standard therapies. RNA sequencing demonstrates the reactivation of wild type p53 genes associated with normal cell cycle regulation (induction of CDKN1A encoding p21 and GADD45A), apoptosis (induction of PMAIP1 encoding Noxa and DR5 encoding Death Receptor 5), and the inhibition of DNA replication and repair in cancer cells.

Analyses uncovered three main clusters that are geographically distinct. A further three clusters containing fewer isolates were also geographically separated, two of which had particularly large SNP distances compared to the majority of other Welsh isolates, suggesting independent introductions of M. bovis strains that are not endemic to Wales.

Placenta-derived exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) mediate inter-organ communication and may contribute to neurovascular injury, but their role in maternal brain dysregulation remains unclear. Methods: We performed systems-level bioinformatic analyses of 12 differentially expressed exomiRs (6 from early-onset and 6 from late-onset preeclampsia) to assess their potential impact on brain homeostasis. Target interactomes were examined for functional enrichment, subcellular localization, and network complexity. ExomiR targets were integrated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles from preeclamptic women with neurological symptoms. We further evaluated regulation of blood?brain barrier (BBB) components and mapped spatial expression of target proteins across brain regions and cell types relevant to neurovascular function. Results: Early- and late-onset preeclampsia exomiRs displayed distinct interactomes and biological signatures. Early-onset exomiRs were linked to RNA metabolism, oxidative stress, and endothelial stability, whereas late-onset exomiRs were enriched in nitrogen metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport. Integration with CSF proteomics revealed convergence on dysregulated proteins, including MAPK8, RTN4, and YWHA family members, involved in inflammation, neurodegeneration, and axonal inhibition. Several exomiRs targeted BBB-related proteins (CLDN2, TJP1, EFNA5), suggesting coordinated barrier disruption. Spatial mapping localized these targets to endothelial cells, astrocytes, interneurons, and pyramidal neurons, implicating altered synaptic and glial regulation. Conclusions: Preeclampsia-associated exomiRs may impair maternal brain homeostasis through coordinated regulation of neurovascular, inflammatory, and synaptic pathways. These findings identify candidate molecular mediators of preeclampsia-related neurovascular dysfunction and potential biomarkers for maternal brain injury.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Increased and/or chronic activation of this critical pathway has been implicated in obesity, with hypothalamic neuroinflammation linked to dysregulation of energy balance. TN-783 is an investigational, CNS-penetrant, small-molecule NLRP3 inhibitor that potently suppressed inflammasome activation across multiple in vitro assays. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, only TN-783, and not the peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor TN-101, produced progressive and sustained weight loss, underscoring the requirement for central target engagement. Weight loss was driven by a persistent reduction in food intake across both acute and chronic phases, without altering energy expenditure. This effect was further characterized by selective reduction of fat mass, with minimal impact on lean tissues. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inhibition attenuated DIO-induced hypothalamic neuroinflammation and partially reversed obesity-associated molecular changes based on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the hypothalamus. Beyond monotherapy, TN-783 enhanced the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide by amplifying weight loss, reinitiating weight loss after semaglutide effect had plateaued, and maintaining the weight loss benefit after semaglutide withdrawal. Discontinuation of TN-783 resulted in reversal of both weight and feeding effects, indicating that its therapeutic activity requires ongoing target engagement rather than permanent remodeling of metabolic pathways. Collectively, these observations support central NLRP3 inhibition as a distinct and promising approach for obesity treatment, offering robust induction and sustained maintenance of weight loss while preserving reversibility.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Using a comprehensive cohort with ante-mortem functional neuroimaging and post-mortem molecular data from the same participants, we mapped individual, whole-brain E/I imbalances through biophysical modeling. E/I ratios in regions supporting higher-order cognitive functions were significantly associated with cognitive performance and decline, with mediation by global neuropathological burden. We also observed a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between E/I ratios and neurofibrillary tangle severity, peaking at the limbic stage (Braak III-IV) in 14 brain areas, including the bilateral hippocampus and superior frontal gyrus. In addition, we identified 89 genes and 101 proteins that predict regional E/I ratios, with pathways related to synaptic signaling and immune response overrepresented. The generalizability of these molecular predictors was confirmed in two independent cohorts, achieving good classification performance for neuropathology severity and AD dementia. Lastly, the estimated E/I imbalances in AD aligned with whole-brain distributions of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, suggesting that spatial cellular organization contributes to vulnerability to neuronal dysfunction.

These nanosized particles carry a diverse cargo and can play key roles in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we investigated the production, composition, and host cell interactions of EVs secreted by the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain N315, one of the most widely studied clinical isolates. To mimic infection, EVs produced from RPMI supplemented with 10% LB were purified by size exclusion chromatography, and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and electron microscopy. N315 EVs contained a diverse molecular cargo, selectively enriched, and including proteins, lipoproteins, DNA, RNA, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan. Protection assays and confocal microscopy confirmed the intravesicular localization of RNAs and proteins. N315 EVs were recognized by multiple host pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) in human MG-63 cells, located at the cell surface (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6), within endosomes (TLR3, TLR7, TLR4) and in the cytoplasm (NOD2). EV exposure promoted the selective upregulation of these PRRs, activated the NF-{kappa}B and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1b, IL6, and CXCL8. N315 EVs were internalized via a dynamin-dependent endocytosis mechanism and trafficked to late endosomes, where RNA cargo release occurred. Importantly, inhibition of EVs uptake altered cytokine gene expression, confirming that internalization is required for immunomodulation. This work provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of interaction of S. aureus EVs with host cells and sheds light on the fate of EVs and their cargo once internalized by cells.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

One such effector, RidL, is known to inhibit retrograde trafficking by interacting with the retromer complex via its N-terminal domain. Here, we identify a second function of RidL mediated by its C-terminal domain, which directly binds to the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 and related large GTPases. In vitro, RidL reduces Drp1 GTPase activity and disrupts its oligomerization. During infection, RidL localizes to mitochondria, enhances the accumulation of Drp1 and the outer membrane protein Tom20, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics and function. Moreover, in L. pneumophila-infected cells, RidL promotes phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616, leading to Drp1 activation and mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings establish RidL as a bifunctional effector that targets both the retromer complex and Drp1 through distinct domains.

A.; Tzeng, J.; Nigam, R.; Wang, T.-Y.; Chou, T.-F.; Semlow, D. R.", "abstract": "During replication-coupled DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, fork reversal is thought to enable the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway to resolve the ICL through nucleolytic incisions. Subsequent fork restoration then allows nascent DNA strand extension past the lesion. Although these fork remodeling events are crucial for ICL repair, their regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we use cell-free Xenopus egg extracts to investigate fork dynamics during ICL repair by the FA pathway. We find that the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase is activated concomitantly with fork reversal and promotes resection of the reversed fork intermediate. This resection depends on the coordinated activities of the EXO1 and DNA2 nucleases. Our data indicate that EXO1 initiates 5' to 3' resection of nascent lagging strands in the regressed arm, while DNA2 performs 5' to 3' resection of recessed lagging strands. We further show that the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) during ICL repair results in ATM hyperactivation, reversed fork over-resection, and formation of aberrant end-joining products, indicating that PP2A counteracts ATM signaling to constrain reversed fork resection. Taken together, this work implicates reversed forks as substrates for ATM activation and reveals a phospho-regulatory circuit that governs reversed fork processing during ICL repair.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

We asked whether incorporating image memorability as an additional optimization objective could improve ANN-brain alignment. Models optimized for memorability explained additional, non-overlapping variance in IT responses beyond that captured by recognition-optimized networks, indicating that memorability and recognition rely on partly independent dimensions of IT representation. Notably, these models also exhibited fewer non-brain-like units, bringing their representational geometry closer to that of IT. Furthermore, networks jointly optimized for both objectives were more predictive of human memorability than memorability-only models, while maintaining their alignment with human object recognition performance patterns. Together, these findings suggest that IT encodes multiple representational goals and that models trained solely for recognition provide an incomplete account of ventral stream computation.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Because glutamatergic dysregulation has been implicated in both cannabis effects and psychosis vulnerability, we examined whether brain glutamate relates to dimensional symptoms as a function of cannabis use across the psychosis spectrum. Seventy-nine participants--typically developing controls, clinical high-risk individuals, and patients with psychosis--completed dimensional clinical assessments, detailed cannabis surveys, urine toxicology, and ultra-high-field 7T 1HMRS quantification of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamate levels. Linear models assessed the main and interactive effects of ACC glutamate and cannabis use on positive and negative symptoms. Self-reported cannabis use showed strong concordance with urine toxicology. Cannabis use was associated with higher positive and negative symptoms. Independently, higher ACC glutamate predicted greater positive and negative symptoms. Notably, lower glutamate levels were associated with higher positive symptoms in cannabis users. Exploratory analyses suggested interactions for depressive and manic symptoms, indicating that glutamatergic abnormalities may amplify the overall severity of cannabis-related symptoms. Sensitivity analyses revealed lower ACC glutamate in psychosis patients--especially cannabis users--highlighting diagnostic group differences and reinforcing the link between cannabis exposure and glutamatergic dysfunction. These findings implicate ACC glutamatergic dysfunction as a transdiagnostic correlate of symptom burden, particularly in those with psychosis who are cannabis users.

A key innovation allowing for widespread study of antigen-specific B cells was the development of fluorescent antigen probes for use with flow cytometry. Initially these studies were mostly focused upon B cells specific for a variety of model antigens, but over the past decade focus has shifted towards the study of B cells specific for antigens from pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Influenza virus. Importantly however, these types of approaches have been used for hundreds of different antigens and could be used for thousands more. Unfortunately, studies of B cells specific for an antigen of interest are not easily searchable on current publication databases since these assays are often a small portion of a larger publication. To overcome this, we built a searchable database of studies analyzing antigen-specific B cells by flow cytometry using fluorescent antigen probes that is located at www.immunology.virginia.edu/Taylor/Bcell/Database.php. Using this database, we assessed the number of publications per year revealing rapid growth in the use of this approach in recent years.

Here, we quantified FMR1 somatic variation in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with FXTAS (n = 6) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS, n = 2) by applying amplification-free, targeted, long-read sequencing. This approach uncovered remarkable somatic mosaicism in repeat size and methylation in FXTAS, including somatic expansions and contractions which were not resolvable with traditional approaches. For example, in FXTAS, we identified somatic expansions to over 6000 base pairs in length as well as contractions to below the pathogenic range. We also identified unexpected patterns of methylation mosaicism on pre and full mutations. On the other hand, we replicated prior findings suggesting differential CGG expansion on the active X-chromosome in XX females. Finally, we examined the above cohort for expansions in 19 additional disease-associated repeat loci. Remarkably, we identified additional expansions in 5 out of 8 affected individuals, in FXN and RFC1.

This study investigated whether CBD alleviated withdrawal symptoms in a rat model of opioid dependence. Sprague Dawley rats (N = 100, 50% female) were administered escalating doses of morphine across 10 days (10-50 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily). Following abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal outcomes were evaluated across acute (38-hr) and protracted (up to day 7) timepoints. Rats were treated with pure CBD (10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (sesame oil; 1 mg/ml) daily, beginning 14-hrs after their final morphine or saline injection (n = 8-9 per sex/group). Withdrawal severity was assessed through physical measurements of body weight, food intake, and somatic signs (e.g., body shakes, diarrhea), and pain sensitivity, as well as measurements of anxiety-like behaviors in the protracted phase. Compared to non-dependent controls, morphine-dependent rats had decreased body weight and food intake, showed greater somatic signs, and had increased pain sensitivity that peaked in acute withdrawal (38-hr). Oral CBD did not affect physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal nor protracted anxiety-like behaviors. These data indicate that CBD alone may have limited effectiveness for treating opioid withdrawal.

Outcome-guided behavior requires (a) representations of stimulus-outcome associations and (b) inferring the current value of options when making decisions. Here, we test whether these two functions are differentially supported by the posterior (pOFC) and anterior (aOFC) parts of the lateral OFC, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to selectively disrupt activity in functional networks centered on the pOFC and aOFC during a two-day outcome devaluation task.

Yet, the specific contributions of variants in genes encoding these transporters to neurological disease remain to be fully understood. Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful genetic model for uncovering such mechanisms, particularly through studies of mutants that display temperature-sensitive (TS) behavioral phenotypes. In a forward genetic screen, we identified a mutant line that exhibited TS convulsions along with progressive, age-dependent neurodegeneration. We mapped the mutation to Nckx30c, specifically within the transmembrane ion-binding region of this K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Characterization of this mutant, together with a second Nckx30c allele, revealed TS convulsions, impaired locomotion, a markedly shortened lifespan, neurodegeneration with age, along with structural defects at larval and adult neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Gene expression analysis confirmed that Nckx30c levels were reduced in heads of Nckx30c loss-of-function mutants. Tissue-specific manipulation revealed that knockdown of Nckx30c in neurons recapitulated the TS convulsions, locomotor defects, and shortened lifespan phenotypes.

However, the cell type-specific and temporal roles of p75NTR in AD progression remain unclear. Here, we report that conditional knock-in of functionally impaired p75NTR variants lacking the death domain ({Delta}DD) or transmembrane Cys259 (C259A) specifically in forebrain excitatory neurons of 5xFAD mice significantly attenuated multiple AD-associated pathologies, including amyloid plaque accumulation, gliosis, neurite dystrophy, as well as learning and memory deficits. Hippocampal amyloid plaque burden was reduced to levels comparable to those in whole-body knock-in mice. Strikingly, delaying introduction of p75NTR variants until advanced disease stages produced comparable beneficial effects, and rescued behavior performance in cognitively impaired animals. These findings suggest that blunting p75NTR function can have beneficial effects even during symptomatic stages of AD, offering a potential therapeutic approach complementary to passive vaccination.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic.

G.; Mayer, A.", "abstract": "Endosomes generate tubulo-vesicular carriers to redistribute proteins between plasma membrane, Golgi, and lysosomes. These transport routes employ distinct combinations of sorting nexins with complexes such as Retromer or Retriever. We now show that, while Retromer associates with the PROPPIN WIPI1 to form the previously described CROP complex, Retriever associates with WIPI2, forming CROP2. WIPI2 integrates into Retriever-dependent coat complexes, since it interacts both with the Commander subunit CCDC93 and its cognate sorting nexin SNX17. CROP and CROP2 are exclusive in their physical associations and pathway selective. Whereas CROP2 is required for endosomal exit of {beta}1-Integrin, it does not affect CROP-dependent cargos, such as EGFR or GLUT1. Vice versa, CROP is not required for {beta}1-Integrin trafficking. WIPI1 and WIPI2 rely on similar molecular features. They use the same FSSS motif to bind to Retromer and Retriever, respectively, and an amphipathic membrane-inserting a-helix, which conveys membrane fission activity to PROPPINs. This suggests that Retromer and Retriever coats integrate distinct PROPPIN isoforms to promote fission of the respective endosomal carriers formed by them.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

When transiently implanted into the peritoneal cavity of immunocompetent mice with ALF, the human ELT improves survival, treats hepatic encephalopathy and promotes liver regeneration, without requiring immunosuppression.

Once the liver regenerated, the ELT is explanted, leaving the subjects cured. Macroencapsulation prevents rejection by shielding the organoids from the host immune system, and minimizes the risk of tumorigenicity.

Using the adenine-induced chronic kidney injury (AdKI) murine model, we identified that AdKI induces dysregulated glucose metabolism in bones and kidneys via in vivo and ex vivo metabolic tracing. Ex vivo 13C-metabolic tracing of osteocyte-enriched femora revealed accelerated citrate production from [1,2-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-glutamine in AdKI mice. These metabolic changes were observed together with increased circulating citrate and Slc13a5 overexpression in bones from AdKI mice. Thus, to explore the role of citrate in AdKI, we utilized mice harboring a loss of function mutation in the citrate importer SLC13A5 (Slc13a5R337*/R337*). Mutant mice displayed elevated osteocytic citrate production, and elevated circulating citrate, without significantly worsened AdKI-related bone loss. Coincident with this, Slc13a5R337*/R337* mutant mice were significantly protected from loss of kidney function with attenuated AdKI-induced nephrolithiasis. We also confirmed that Slc13a5 is highly expressed in cortical bone compared to the kidney, suggesting the effect of the mutation is mediated by SLC13A5's function outside the kidney. Altogether, this study finds that accelerated osteocytic citrate production in CKD is associated with protection of kidney function, and modulation of citrate handling may be a site for therapeutic intervention in CKD.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Outcomes were assessed using live imaging, immunostaining, and RNA sequencing. Cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and spontaneous calcium transients declined as injury severity increased.

While the reaching task is specified at the endpoint, such task objectives become implicit at the level of joints. A fundamental question is whether planning and control of joints is solely in the service of the endpoint or whether they also include joint trajectories. Using Spearmans correlation and zero crossings, we found differential kinematic signatures of control between shoulder and elbow joints in contrast to the wrist joint. However, the extent of control among joints was substantially diminished compared to the endpoint. Further, when such control measures were compared to the subspaces of inter-trial joint exploration, we found that online control at proximal joints, such as the shoulder and elbow, were significantly associated in regulating the task space, while control at the wrist (distal) joint was associated in regulating joint redundancy in null space. These results suggest that null space is not entirely uncontrolled as per the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis but selectively controlled by some distal joints. Additionally, across different directions, either the shoulder or the elbow contributed dominantly towards the movement of the endpoint while the other joint was lagging and that this strategy reflected in our kinematic measures of online and trajectory control. Taken together, this study shows how the selective implementation of a leading joint in task space and a lagging joint in null space can enable the control of multi-jointed movements and attenuate the problem of joint redundancy.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

What evolutionary pressures shape this diversity? Given the role of the hippocampus in spatial mapping, the greater spatial navigation demands of larger home ranges may drive selection for more hippocampal neuron. Using data from 342 species, we crossed home range and population density data with cortical and hippocampal neuron counts predicted from clade-specific brain scaling laws to examine whether home range scales universally with estimated hippocampal neuron numbers across mammals. We confirm that home range scales universally with the inverse of population density across species and increases with body mass and metabolic rate. However, home range does not scale universally with hippocampal or cortical neuron numbers. Rather, scaling relationships differ by clade, such that carnivorans and cetartiodactyls traverse home ranges over 1,000-fold larger than primates with equivalent hippocampal neuron numbers. These findings persist across data subsets controlling for study method, duration, and temporal scope. Numbers of hippocampal neurons are thus not limiting to spatial navigation in the wild, calling into question adaptationist explanations for the evolution of more hippocampal neurons based on a supposed need for increased spatial processing capacity. We propose that home range is determined primarily by population density, mediated by field metabolic rate and diet. The diversity in hippocampal neuron numbers across mammals, in turn, arises as a byproduct of clade-specific scaling of numbers of cortical neurons which we suggest is contingent on energetic opportunity, not on navigational or other cognitive demands.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Recent techniques have employed neural network models to solve the localization problem for various use cases and data setups. These approaches, however, make underlying assumptions that make it difficult generalize the results past their original training setups. In this work, we present a transformer-based model for single- and multi-source localization that is specifically designed to deal with difficulties that arise in EEG data. Hundreds of thousands of simulated EEG measurement data are generated from known brain locations to train this machine learning model. We establish a training and evaluation framework for analyzing the effectiveness of the transformer model by explicitly considering the source region density, noise levels, drop out of electrodes, and other factors. Across these vast scenarios, the localization error of the transformer model is consistently lower than the other classical and machine learning approaches.

This reprogramming process involves global DNA demethylation, changes in nuclear morphology as well as remodeling of repressive histone modifications. Here, using combined cytological and Hi- C based methods, we reveal that following the epigenetic reprogramming and concomitant with their commitment to gametogenesis, pre-meiotic gonadal germ cells are characterised by a unique chromosome and genome architecture. This involves separation of individual chromosomes and anchoring of centromeres at the nuclear periphery, reduction of interchromosome interactions and disentangling of chromosome ends. Furthermore, genome-wide contact mapping documents striking remodeling of 3D genome architecture across all observable levels including disruption of topological associating domains (TADs), loss of detectable loops and reduced active-active compartment interactions. We further show that the diminished TADs correlate with the reduced levels of CTCF thus providing a unique in vivo physiological model to understand genome folding principles. Finally, we show that primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs), derived from embryonic stem cells, do not exhibit the same chromatin organisation as embryonic germ cells suggesting that the 3D genome remodeling accompanies acquisition of meiotic competency. Collectively, our findings uncover the existence of a unique chromatin architecture in premeiotic male and female gonadal germ cells and document that alongside global DNA demethylation, the germline epigenetic reprogramming involves erasure of memory at the genome architectural level through a complete re-organisation of the 3D genome.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

A key genomic change associated with this process was likely the acquisition of the therian-specific paternally expressed 10 (PEG10) from a metavirus, as Peg10-null mutant mice exhibit early embryonic lethality due to the absence of both the spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth layers in the placenta. PEG10 encodes a GAG-like open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and a POL-like ORF2, and produces two proteins, PEG10-ORF1 and PEG10-ORF1/2 fusion proteins, via the -1 frameshift mechanism conserved in retroviruses and metaviruses. Here, we demonstrate PEG10-ORF1 plays an essential and distinct role in labyrinth development. Mice lacking ORF1 but retaining the ORF1/2 protein initially developed normally in both embryos and placentas; however, later exhibited underdevelopment of the placental labyrinth's complex microarchitecture, accompanied by mid- to late gestational growth retardation and lethality. These severe defects are most likely attributable to dysregulated development of labyrinth trophoblast precursor (LaTP) cells. Beyond its essential role in early placental formation, we previously demonstrated that the DSG protease domain within PEG10-ORF1/2--a metaviruse-derived feature--is critical for maintaining fetal capillaries during late gestation. Thus, PEG10 fulfills multiple indispensable functions in placental formation and maintenance by exploiting a metavirus-derived multi-protein and -peptide production system, despite being a single gene.

T.", "abstract": "Protein identification by mass spectrometry is a pivotal step in proteomics. Numerous methods have been developed to securely and effectively identify proteins derived from experimentally detected peptides by mass spectrometry. The dominant approach is based on the assumption that each experimentally identified peptide can be matched with a peptide included in a database of peptide sequences, generated by in silico digestion of proteins with a specific proteolytic enzyme. In this way, the protein containing the peptide can be identified. In a more advanced approach, the proteins and their in silico digested peptides in the database are transformed into theoretical mass spectrometry spectra, and search engines match the experimentally obtained spectra to these theoretical spectra generated from protein and peptide sequences. We developed an alternative method for protein identification using Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs) and the Uniquome, termed as Uniquome-Based Protein Identification Method (UB-PIM). According to this method, instead of searching for peptides in the database of in silico_digested peptides, we search for CrUPs within the experimentally obtained peptides by mass spectrometry. If a peptide contains at least one CrUP, it can be directly correlated to the protein from which the CrUP is derived. Because of the unique nature of CrUPs, peptides obtained by MS can securely and uniquely identify the protein of origin. This provides a reference space in which even single-peptide identifications can achieve high specificity, reducing the ambiguity caused by shared or homologous sequences and improving the interpretability of MS data. Furthermore, UB-PIM can be applied to any type of peptide and is effective with both Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) and Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) approaches, as well as with top-down and bottom-up proteomics.

Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) with the chemotherapeutic, temozolomide (TMZ), is the standard GB treatment; yet recurrence often occurs. GB is organized hierarchically with a small population of radiation-resistant glioma-initiating cells (GICs) that self-renew and drive tumor growth. Importantly, RT can induce a subset of cells from non-tumor-initiating into glioma-initiating cells (iGICs). Both GICs and iGICs contribute to tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. Thus, without effective elimination of non-tumorigenic GB and prevention or targeting of GICs, a cure is unlikely. The objective of this study is to identify small molecules that block RT-induced phenotypic conversion to occur. Method: We conducted a high-throughput screen of NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) compounds with evidence for crossing the blood-brain-barrier. To identify stem-like or reprogramming of cells, we transduced GB cell lines representing each TCGA subtype to express a fluorescent reporter for proteasomal activity that distinguishes non-tumor-initiating cells from GICs. We tested CTEP agents at 10 different concentrations in combination with radiation. Results: Our results identified selumetinib as a candidate compound that effectively prevents radiation-induced phenotype conversion. Furthermore, in combination with radiation, selumetinib decreased stem cell maintenance in GICs with differential effects on viability in non-tumorigenic cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that repurposing FDA-approved compounds alongside current therapies may effectively target the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of GB.

The rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), is expressed in both the liver and intestine. While the liver is well established as the primary site of ketogenesis during fasting, the intestine's role in nutritional hyperketonemia from dietary MCFAs is unclear. Methods: To achieve nutritional hyperketonemia, we orally administered medium-chain (C8:0) triacylglycerol (MCT) oil to control and liver- and intestine-specific Hmgcs2 knockout mice and measured {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}-OHB) levels in the portal vein and systemic circulation. MCFA-driven {beta}-OHB production was also assessed in primary murine hepatocytes and human and murine intestinal cell lines. Expression of enzymes involved in MCFA oxidation and ketogenesis was analyzed using publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from human and mouse tissues. Results: In MCT-treated mice, {beta}-OHB levels increased four-fold in systemic circulation and statistically more (six-fold) in the portal vein, the latter suggesting intestinal contribution to systemic hyperketonemia. However, circulating {beta}-OHB increased similarly in control mice and those lacking intestinal Hmgcs2. RNA sequencing data of human and mouse tissues showed that medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, enzymes required for MCFA activation, are scarcely expressed in intestinal cells. Consistently, cultured intestinal cells failed to produce {beta}-OHB from MCFA (octanoic acid, C8:0), unlike hepatocytes, which produced substantial levels of {beta}-OHB when treated with MCFA. Finally, MCT-induced nutritional hyperketonemia was completely abolished in mice lacking hepatic Hmgcs2. Conclusion: Nutritional hyperketonemia from dietary C8:0-MCFA is mediated by the liver, not the intestine, which appears to lack the enzymes to activate MCFAs. In addition, the common practice of measuring metabolites or other factors in portal vein blood as a readout for intestinal contribution must be used with caution.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

The first was 3D reaching with either an inertial challenge or the need to use a stick-like tool. The second required participants to write with their dominant and non-dominant elbows. We applied a novel geometric analysis to quantify movement-trajectory shape. We show that (1) tool-use unmasks markedly inferior control in the non-dominant arm, and this is because it imposes the need to generate unfamiliarly shaped movement trajectories; and (2) there is no general dominant limb motor control advantage, only task-specific experience or practice.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited disease that is characterized by lethal ventricular arrhythmias stemming from myocyte dysfunction. ACM is associated with considerable subepicardial fibrosis and inflammation with right ventricle predominance. Most cases of gene positive ACM are caused by a desmosome protein mutation, with plakophilin-2 (Pkp2) mutations being most common. We hypothesized Pkp2-deficiency in epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) contributes to fibro-inflammatory signaling and ACM pathogenesis. Methods: We developed transgenic mice that lack Pkp2 in cardiomyocytes (PKP2-cKO) or in both cardiomyocyte and EPDC (PKP2-ceKO) via the tissue-specific expression of tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. Non-myocyte populations were isolated 21 days post-tamoxifen injection for single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and echocardiography were used to interrogate cardiac physiology and cellular composition. Results: We identified a population of epicardium-derived fibroblasts characterized by the expression of Ccl2, Ccl7, Thbs1, and Ptx3 that accumulated upon Pkp2 deletion. While pro-inflammatory EPDCs are found in PKP2-cKO mice, they become significantly enriched in PKP2-ceKO mice. Pro-inflammatory fibroblasts acquired the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), correlating with elevated Senescence Associated (SA)-{beta}gal staining in the right ventricle. Gene expression, flow cytometry, and histological data also revealed an exaggerated inflammatory response in PKP2-ceKO mice, that progresses from right to bi-ventricular predominance. Importantly, macrophages and B cells accumulate in both PKP2-cKO and PKP2-ceKO mice compared to controls. Antibody-mediated B cell depletion delays the early inflammatory and fibrosis response but did not significantly alter end-stage cardiac physiology. Conclusion: Pkp2 deletion in EPDC facilitates the emergence of a fibro-inflammatory phenotype that may contribute to ACM pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition is essential for developing targeted therapies. Among these mechanisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in IVD cells, influencing key processes such as extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis, inflammatory signalling, and cellular senescence. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which transport miRNAs between cells, represent a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. However, the composition of their miRNA cargo across different stages of disc degeneration remains inadequately characterized. We isolated EVs from primary human IVD cells derived from non-degenerate, mildly-degenerate, and severely degenerate tissues, and performed small RNA sequencing to profile their miRNA content. Bioinformatic analyses revealed enrichment in pathways related to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, inflammation, and cell cycle regulation. Notably, let-7b-5p and miR-100-5p were among the most abundant miRNAs and were significantly lower in EVs from degenerate discs. Functional assays demonstrated that transfection of IVD cells with let-7b-5p or miR-100-5p mimics individually suppressed IL-1{beta} expression at both mRNA and protein levels, confirming their anti-inflammatory roles. Strikingly, co-delivery of both miRNAs enhanced suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduced senescence-associated p16 expression, and upregulated TIE2 mRNA, indicating synergistic effects in promoting a regenerative cell phenotype. These findings highlight the regulatory roles of EV-enriched let-7b-5p and miR-100-5p in modulating inflammation and senescence in IVD cells, and underscore the potential of miRNA-loaded EVs as cell-free regenerative therapies for disc degeneration.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

This focalized allostery requires correlated motion between protein backbone dihedral angles that are separated by distances many times longer than the scale of electrostatic interactions. What physical properties of folded proteins enable such long-distance information sharing despite thermal noise is unclear. To address this question, we introduce a Variable-Well Dihedral (VWD) model Hamiltonian which removes dependence on chemical details and forces, instead only tuning the degree of nonlinearity of purely local interactions within a densely-packed polymer. We show that tuning the physical parameters of the model gives rise to focalized allostery in so far that doing so increases the discreteness of the internal degrees of freedom, with real proteins occupying the highly discrete regime.

Biomarker-guided therapy is increasingly useful in oncology, yet biomarker discovery remains complicated by the large number of molecular features that make it difficult to distinguish causal determinants from spurious associations. To address this challenge, we combined functional genomic screening, proteomics, and drug sensitivity profiling to discover response biomarkers for a number of therapies used in the treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas (PTCL). First, we used genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 interference screens in PTCL cells under drug treatment to identify a shortlist of genes whose knockdown directly increases or decreases drug sensitivity. Next, we profiled drug responses across a diverse panel of 30 PTCL cultures and, from the shortlist, identified genes whose protein abundance correlated with drug sensitivity. Genes detected by both approaches are causal determinants of drug response and correlates of drug response across the panel of lymphoma cultures, making them promising candidates for predictive biomarkers. Basal expression of the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1 was a strong predictor of pralatrexate sensitivity, consistent with its role as the primary transporter for pralatrexate uptake. Simulated clinical trials predicted that biomarker-guided patient selection could improve the power to detect significant benefit of adding pralatrexate to frontline chemotherapy in PTCL. These findings illustrate how the causal insights of functional genetic screens can augment correlative studies to identify biomarkers of drug response, and suggest the potential for precise use of pralatrexate for PTCL.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

TRPM2 channels in immune cells (immune TRPM2) are believed to facilitate chronic pain by indirectly promoting immune-inflammatory responses. Whereas TRPM2 in sensory neurons (neuronal TRPM2) acts as a warmth sensor critical to sense innocuous warm temperatures. However, neuronal TRPM2 mediates the warmth sensitivity of less than 3.5% of sensory neurons. The functions of the vast majority (42%) of TRPM2+ neurons are unknown. Here we show that neuronal TRPM2 functions as a pain sensor responsible for directly transducing acute and chronic pain independently of immune TRPM2. Both chronic arthritis pain and neuropathic pain were markedly reduced in TRPM2-knockout mice, and the pain deficit was recapitulated by sole deletion of neuronal TRPM2. However, immune and inflammatory responses were largely similar between wild-type and neuronal TRPM2-deficient mice. Moreover, antagonizing joint TRPM2 rapidly reversed chronic arthritis pain without affecting joint inflammation. Mechanistically, TRPM2 is activated by PGE2 and IgG immune complex (IgG-IC) through GalphaoA and FcgRI coupling, respectively, independently of conventional signalling messengers. Consistently, acute pain induced by PGE2 and IgG-IC was abolished in TRPM2 mutant mice. We conclude that neuronal TRPM2 is a convergent direct pain transducer independently of inflammation, representing an appealing target for alleviating chronic pain.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Infection with YF17D was detected in primary human blood monocytes and conventional dendritic cells (DCs) and in monocyte-derived DCs but was highly restricted by type I IFN. Blocking IFNAR signaling in YF17D-infected PBMC from vaccinated donors resulted in increased activation of YF17D-specific CD8+ T cells. Consistently, peak IFN-alpha plasma levels correlated inversely with the CD8+ T cells response in YF17D vaccinees. Loss of function experiments demonstrated a dominant role of retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) for type I IFN induction and restriction of YF17D. The type I IFN response was mediated by 5' tri- or diphosphate dsRNA intermediates that are formed during YF17D infection. In vivo proximity labelling (IPL) of RIG-I and next-generation sequencing confirmed interaction of RIG-I with YF17D-dsRNA in infected cells.

Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables gene expression profiling at cellular resolution, most gene network inference methods operate at the tissue or population level, thereby overlooking regulatory heterogeneity across individual cells. Recent approaches, such as Cell-Specific Network (CSN) and its extension c-CSN, attempt to construct gene networks at single-cell resolution, providing a more detailed view of the regulatory logic underlying individual cellular states. However, these methods remain limited by high false positive rates due to indirect associations and lack of directionality or causal interpretability. To address these issues, we propose the Cell-Specific Causal Network (CSCN) framework, which infers directed, cell-specific gene regulatory relationships by explicitly modeling causality. CSCN combines causal discovery techniques with efficient computation using kd-trees and bitmap indexing to perform conditional independence testing, yielding sparse and interpretable causal graphs for each cell that effectively suppress indirect and spurious associations. We demonstrate through simulations that CSCN significantly reduces false positives compared to existing methods.

Yet these mutations are strikingly mutually exclusive, pointing to a convergent downstream mechanism. We hypothesized this would be reflected in the AS transcriptome. By analyzing transcriptomes of 395 patients with clonal myeloid disorders and 64 healthy donors, we found most AS alterations to be mutation-specific. However, a robust subset, enriched in the retained intron (RI) program, was shared across mutants. These RI events were bidirectional but highly concordant, and mirrored the effects of SRSF1 loss. SF-mutant states induced hypophosphorylation of RS domains in SRSF1, reducing its function. This arose from an altered AMPK-AKT balance impairing the AKT-SRPK1-SRSF1 axis. A common upstream trigger was activation of DNA damage response (DDR) by transcriptional R-loops, which increased AMPK signaling and reduced AKT activity. Pharmacologic DDR activation recapitulated reduced AKT/SRPK1 activity and SRSF1 hypophosphorylation, while relieving DDR restored SRSF1 phosphorylation and corrected RI defects. Thus, beyond cis-acting, mutation-specific changes, SF-mutant cancers share a trans-acting, stress-driven AS signature wherein DDR signaling rewires SRSF1 activity impacting AS.

Results: We identify TGF beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1 or MAP3K7) as an aberrantly activated kinase in human and mouse PDAC tissues that is associated with T cell dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 with Takinib, or genetic deletion of MAP3K7 in autochthonous p48 Cre;TP53flox/flox;LSL KRASG12D GEMM, enhances intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cell infiltration and renders immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) effective. Mechanistically, TAK1 inhibition induces DNA damage and cytoplasmic DNA leakage, which activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS STING) DNA sensing pathway, triggering inflammatory responses that promote adaptive immune cell infiltration. At the molecular level, TAK1 phosphorylates Ephrin Receptor A2 (EphA2) at Serine 897, which in turn phosphorylates RAD51 at Tyrosine 315, a key DNA repair protein involved in homologous recombination. Conclusions: We uncover TAK1 as a critical mediator in maintaining genomic integrity and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target to induce an inflamed TME that sensitizes PDAC to ICB.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Accumulating evidence indicates that intra-tumoral bacteria can influence tumor biology and contribute to therapy resistance in several cancer types, including pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Despite these findings, whether intra-tumoral bacteria play a role in modulating response and resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma remains largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the contribution of intra-tumoral bacteria to osimertinib resistance, thereby providing new insights into resistance mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic strategies. Methods: Bacteria previously identified in lung cancer tissue samples were cultured in liquid growth medium, and their preconditioned medium (PCM) was collected. PC9 cells were treated with PCM in the presence or absence of osimertinib to screen for bacteria capable of mediating resistance. Cell viability was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. To investigate potential mechanisms, Western blotting and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation arrays were performed. Control groups included cells treated with osimertinib alone, PCM alone, or vehicle. Statistical analyses were conducted using t test as appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Data represent mean +/- standard deviation from at least three independent experiments. Results: The addition of PCM from Chryseobacterium indologenes restored cell viability in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with osimertinib. PCM exposure markedly increased insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation levels. PCM did not enhance cell viability when IGF1R was silenced or inhibited with linsitinib, demonstrating the essential role of this pathway. Proteinase K treatment abolished the ability of PCM to protect cells from osimertinib, and removal of proteins potentially interacting with IGF1R further diminished its efficacy. Finally, PCM also conferred resistance to osimertinib in patient-derived EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the intra-tumoral bacteria C. indologenes may significantly influence sensitivity to osimertinib or impart resistance in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma by activating the IGF1R signaling pathway.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Since its inception five decades ago, many variations of the brain slice preparation method have emerged. While all variations are currently used by many labs throughout the world, no study has comprehensively examined the impact of these variation on the quality of the acute brain slice preparation. In this study, we comprehensively examined the effect of animal sacrifice methods (decapitation or transcardial perfusion) and cutting solution (normal or sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid) on brain slice preparation. Neuronal population was quantified by immunohistochemistry against various neuronal markers. Neuronal dynamics was evaluated by in vitro electrophysiology using two acute epilepsy models-zero-magnesium and 4-aminopyridine. To modulate the stress incurred in acute brain slice preparation, we administered antioxidants or HIF-1 inhibitor, chrysin, to the cutting solution. The method of brain slice preparation significantly affected the quality of the brain slice preparation. In general, the combination of transcardial perfusion and sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid produces the optimal brain slice preparation. This is evidenced by a preservation of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in slices prepared with this combination. We subsequently found that this loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons significantly influenced the genesis and dynamics of induced acute epileptiform activity. The slices with preserved inhibition had less successful induction of acute epileptiform activity and a seizure-like event that is typical of those induced in brain with preserved inhibition. Finally, we found that loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons during brain slice preparation is primarily due to oxidative damage. Limiting oxidative stress is an effective neuroprotection strategy to prevent loss of inhibition in brain slice preparation. In conclusion, consideration of brain slice preparation method is crucial in preserving inhibitory GABAergic neurons and the degree of inhibition in ex vivo acute brain slice preparation.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

The upper respiratory tract (URT) represents the primary access point for respiratory viruses, where initial host infection occurs. Vaccine-mediated URT mucosal memory responses can control infection, prevent transmission and limit viral evolution. However, vaccines against respiratory viruses predominantly have systemic administration routes that elicit strong responses in the circulation to prevent severe respiratory disease, but do not effectively block infection and onward community transmission. To overcome the limitations of systemic vaccination alone, we present a novel intervention combining systemic vaccination with targeted non-antigenic inflammatory stimulation of the URT, to induce vaccine-specific immune responses in the URT mucosa. Using SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a test case, we demonstrate for the first time, that intranasal coadministration of exogenous IFN-alpha; as a targeted inflammatory URT signal, alongside systemic vaccination, induces vaccine-specific T-cell responses in the URT.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

However, the use of meta-omics to link enzyme function directly with complex, community-level phenotypes remain largely unexplored. To overcome this gap, we developed a novel framework that integrates ecological concepts by microbial community perturbation with association analysis to a targeted phenotype. Specifically, we introduce a hypothesis-free bait and switch strategy demonstrated through salt marsh soil microcosm pulse experiments to detect and characterize novel enzymes responsible for chitin degradation. Soil microbial communities were baited with shell compost, a chitin-rich substrate, to trigger community succession toward chitin degraders and gene upregulation of chitinases. A switch was then employed, by addition of glucose, inducing rapid downregulation of genes putatively responsible for chitin degradation. Results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to identify functionally important enzymes, in this example, 48 hours after chitin addition. The bait and switch community perturbation provides a framework for discovery of polymer degrading enzymes present in complex microbial communities and serves as a proof of concept applicable for linking enzyme function with emergent community level phenotypes.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

However, factors beyond bacteria, such as bacteriophages (phages), may also play a critical role in FMT's success. We aimed to evaluate the preservation of the phage community (phageome) along the FMT production process following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), and the engraftment of the phages in patients receiving FMT to treat rCDI. Samples from one donor were used to test the need for amplification and to compare spin-column versus magnetic bead purification. Then, sixteen samples, from four donations of a second healthy donor, were collected at various production stages - fresh, frozen, homogenized, and encapsulated - for phageome analysis. The phage community profiles of three patients before, at 14, and 60 days after FMT were examined to evaluate donor phage engraftment. Phages were detected in all sample types, and samples clustered by donation, indicating that the pre-processing steps did not significantly alter the phage profile. The recipients' phageome prior to FMT was characterized by low diversity, each recipient being dominated by a different phage. In contrast, the profile 14 days post-FMT demonstrated the engraftment of donor-derived phages, which persisted at 60 days. Most were predicted to be temperate phages of the Caudoviricetes class infecting members of the Clostridia bacterial class, and Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae bacterial families. Our findings suggest that the CHUV production process for oral FMT capsules preserves the phage community and that donor phages successfully engraft in recipients. Further larger-scale studies and intervention trials will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential of phages in FMT's efficacy.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Canonically, EBV positive tumors display latent gene expression programs that are difficult to target pharmacologically. To overcome this hurdle, lytic reactivation therapies have been developed based on HDAC inhibition with limited mechanistic studies. We therefore characterized the impact of pan-HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat, and class I HDAC inhibitor, nanatinostat, on the growth, survival, and lytic reactivation of four EBV-positive cell lines: P3HR1-ZHT BL, Jijoye BL, IBL-1 immunoblastic lymphoma, and de novo infection derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). All lines were sensitive, enabling us to define ranges of sensitivity within which to use single cell approaches to assess early EBV lytic gene expression, cell cycle state, and apoptosis. We observed that each EBV-positive model of malignancy responded uniquely to the same HDAC inhibitors and that lytic reactivation was successful in only a small percentage of the cell population. To elucidate the potential role of host factors in preventing successful lytic reactivation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the P3HR1-ZHT BL line treated with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat. We observed that abortive lytic cells, or cells that do not successfully progress through the lytic cycle, upregulated genes downstream of NF-{kappa}B activity. Additionally, genes involved in immune signaling including the CD137/CD137L signaling axis, were upregulated in abortive lytic cells.

To date, all characterized members of this family are activated by small, unmodified peptide pheromones that mediate bacterial signaling. In the human commensal Streptococcus salivarius, the RRNPPA sensor ComR controls both competence (DNA transformation) and predation (bacteriocin production). Here, we reveal that ComR can be dually activated by its cognate peptide (XIP) and a distinct class of small organic molecules. A targeted screen of ~200 organic compounds identified hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPAA), a bacterial dysbiosis byproduct accumulating in human fluids, as a potent inducer of ComR. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that HPAA and structurally related carboxylic acids derived from bulky hydrophobic amino acids bind the pheromone-accommodating pocket, leading to ComR activation. Strikingly, while XIP-mediated activation is transient and regulates both competence and predation, HPAA induces a sustained, predation-oriented response. Furthermore, we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen, produces sufficient (H)PAA quantity to trigger bacteriocin production in S. salivarius, revealing a previously unrecognized chemical interplay between oral microbiota members.

However, their role in dual-host viruses within the mosquito vector is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) macrodomain by mutating the active site asparagine 24 (N24). In both mammalian and mosquito cell lines, these enzymes rapidly acquired compensatory mutations at aspartate 31 (D31). We show that while N24 mutations abolish ADP-ribosylhydrolase catalytic activity and reduce folding stability, ADP-ribose binding remains intact. Furthermore, the D31 compensatory mutations do not markedly rescue catalytic activity or folding stability. Structures of the compensatory mutant macrodomains suggest the importance of ADP-ribose binding, rather than ADP-ribosylhydrolase catalysis as the selective pressure driving their accumulation. In mammalian cells, viral mutants bearing the catalytic and compensatory mutations replicated less efficiently than wild-type virus in interferon-competent cell lines. However, their replication remained unaffected in mosquito cells. In Aedes mosquitoes, macrodomain mutations had disparate impacts, either reducing or enhancing infectivity and transmission depending on the specific mutation and viral lineage.

E.", "abstract": "Background & Aims: Ethanol affects lipid metabolism through multiple pathways, leading to fatty liver development in most ALD patients. Recent studies have highlighted the role of calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, in liver inflammation and fibrosis. Calpain activity is regulated by its essential subunit, Capns1, (calpain-4, Capn4), which stabilizes and modulates the activity of its catalytic isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain-2. This study investigated calpain's impact on lipid metabolism in ALD. Approach & Results: Six-week-old C57Bl6/J mice were injected with rAAV8 vectors encoding Capn4 shRNA or control vectors. After four weeks, mice underwent a 10-day period of ad libitum ethanol consumption, followed by a single gavaged ethanol administration on day 11. Following Capn4 knockdown, microvesicular steatosis was attenuated. While triglycerides and free fatty acids levels showed no significant changes, cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the ethanol (EtOH) group with Capn4 knockdown. Cpt1a expression increased significantly in the EtOH group with Capn4 knockdown. Western blot analysis revealed increased Cleaved-HMGCR to Pro-HMGCR ratio in Capn4 knockdown mice, suggesting reduced HMGCR activity and suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis. LXR expression was mainly increased in the cytoplasm in the EtOH group, and following Capn4 knockdown, it was relocalized to the nucleus via its activation. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis suggests that Capn4 knockdown contributes to the reprogramming of ethanol-induced disruptions in metabolic and homeostatic pathways, primarily those involving cholesterol metabolism.

Here, we identified SUGP1 (SURP and G-Patch Domain Containing 1) in BmE (a unique model cell system with a complete piRNA biogenesis pathway) as a key splicing factor that functions in piRNA biogenesis. Through CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockdown in cultured cells combined with RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, and IP-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), our results reveal that SUGP1 deficiency disrupts piRNA accumulation, alters mature piRNA length distributions, and activates transposon expression. Immunofluorescence and Western blot (WB) analyses further demonstrate that SUGP1 interacts with Y-box protein (YBP), which is key regulators of RNA metabolism. Functional validation in Drosophila SUGP1-RNAi lines highlights evolutionary conserved and species-specific roles of SUGP1 in piRNA maturation. Collectively, our data uncover a dual role for silkworm SUGP1 in coordinating YBP-dependent piRNA biogenesis, thus elucidating a novel mechanistic framework for piRNA pathway regulation.

Beyond this fundamental role, NDKs exert pleiotropic effects in many cellular processes, including cell development, signal transduction, differentiation, tumor metastasis, and gene expression. The quaternary structure of NDK is typically hexameric-organized as a trimer of dimers in eukaryotic cells and in many prokaryotes-though in some species it can also be found as a tetramer (a dimer of dimers). Here, we report the crystal structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae NDK (SpNDK) in its apo state (1.2 [A]) and in an ADP-vanadate-bound state (3.4 [A]). In both structures, SpNDK adopts a hexameric assembly and the fold of each monomer is highly conserved compared to NDKs from other organisms. A notable feature is the extended Kpn-loop, which plays a key role in stabilizing the hexamer. Interestingly, the thermal stability of SpNDK was remarkably high ({approx}75 {degrees}C), a surprising feature given the mesophilic lifestyle of S. pneumoniae. Unexpectedly, size-exclusion chromatography revealed that SpNDK exists as an equilibrium mixture of hexamers, dodecamers, and higher-order supramolecular assemblies, and this was further confirmed by mass photometry. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we solved the 3D structure of the hexameric state at 2.47 [A] resolution, and resolved dodecameric assemblies of the protein.

Using the minimal Mfn1 construct with the GTPase domain and helical bundle 1 (HB1) connected by Hinge 2, we engineered FRET pairs by incorporating a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor and a metal ion acceptor. For each state of the catalytic cycle, we measured tmFRET with fluorescence lifetimes and determined distance distributions, which can capture complex structural heterogeneity. Our distance measurements for the GDP-bound state matched predictions from the atomic resolution structure, establishing that the same open state, with GTPase and HB2 domains far apart, exists in solution. Our findings reveal that the previously reported transition state is not a single closed state in solution. Rather, the distance distributions indicate that the presence of GDP+Pi results in an equilibrium between the open and closed state. For the first time, we capture the GTP-bound and nucleotide free states of Mfn1.

RNA sequence and structure have been implicated, but how they direct C9orf72 RAN translation, particularly the rate-limiting, multi-step initiation phase, remains unclear (6-10). We applied single-molecule biophysics to a reconstituted human translation initiation system and tracked fluorescently labeled ribosomes and initiation factors in real time. We show that RNA G4C2 repeats and sequence context alter initiation factor dynamics after ribosomal scanning, generating a kinetic bottleneck in the commitment to initiate at a near-cognate CUG start codon. Our model of C9orf72 RAN translation provides a mechanistic framework for how repeat expansions change underlying translation dynamics and may be broadly relevant to other disorders that involve RAN translation.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Phosphorylation of Ser225 reconfigures the regulatory loop and reshuffles salt bridges, priming SK1 for membrane engagement and catalytic activity. We identify a previously uncharacterized catalytic intermediate with a distinct conformation and a highly dynamic lipid-binding loop 1 (LBL-1), sensitive to potent inhibitors such as PF-543. These inhibitors not only stabilize non-catalytic states but also induce LBL-mediated dimerization, blocking membrane binding and substrate access.

Comparing laboratory-reared and wild-caught individuals is essential for understanding how environmental history shapes neural and sensory traits and for assessing the ecological validity of laboratory findings. Despite this, relatively few studies have taken this approach. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to compare ABR thresholds and ABR wave characteristics between laboratory-reared and wild-caught prairie voles. ABR recordings show that, similar to other semi-fossorial rodents, M. ochrogaster exhibit a hearing range of 1 - 46 kHz with peak sensitivity around 8 to 32 kHz. However, wild-caught prairie voles displayed significantly lower ABR thresholds at 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 kHz compared to laboratory-reared prairie voles. There were significant differences in interpeak latency between both tested groups, with laboratory-reared prairie voles showing faster interpeak latency responses than wild-caught voles. However, there were no differences in amplitude ratios between groups. Laboratory-reared prairie voles showed faster normalized latencies and higher relative amplitude of the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the ABR than wild-caught voles. There were no significant differences in ABR thresholds, interpeak latency, amplitude ratio, normalized latency, and relative amplitude between the sexes.

We simultaneously recorded neuronal spiking and local field potentials from the dorsal hippocampus (CA1 and dentate gyrus) and limbic subcortical nuclei (supramammillary nucleus (SuM) and lateral septum (LS)) in freely behaving rats across the sleep-wake cycle. During quiescent states (non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep and quiet wakefulness), sharp-wave ripples dominated hippocampal activity and produced fast, top-down excitation, with large population surges locally in CA1 and DG, and more modest but significant activation in LS and SuM, whereas dentate spikes elicited smaller state-invariant responses. Conversely, in the bottom-up direction, epochs of high-discharge SuM activity were associated with slower, state-dependent activation of hippocampal populations that was larger in wake than in sleep, revealing distinct temporal scales and state dependence for reciprocal pathways. During activated, theta-enriched states (rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and active wakefulness), spike-field coupling revealed circuit-wide theta coordination. In active wakefulness, SuM bursts produced brief inhibition of CA1 spiking while theta oscillations organized a multiregional firing sequence around the theta cycle trough; yet SuM neurons were not significantly phase-locked. In REM sleep, this pattern inverted, with only SuM neurons significantly phase-locking to theta waves, and preferred firing near the theta cycle peak. Together, these findings identify state-dependent, bidirectional coordination between hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, characterized by ripple-locked top-down hippocampal output during quiescent states and SuM-mediated bottom-up modulation that reconfigures under theta during activated states.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Existing models posit that LPS turnover only occurs via passive dilution during growth-dependent OM expansion, restricting adaptive LPS turnover, especially in nutrient-limited conditions. Here, using innovative pulse chase LPS metabolic labelling techniques in combination with super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli maintains OM homeostasis through continuous removal of pre-existing LPS and insertion of new LPS, even during stationary phase. We show that newly inserted LPS localises at discrete sites across the OM, remaining spatially segregated from pre-existing, background LPS. These observations challenge established OM organisational principles, suggesting an insertion-trapping mechanism can maintain LPS-rich clusters independent of a thermodynamically-driven phase separation. Time-lapse super-resolution imaging, biochemical assays, and nanoparticle tracking collectively reveal that OM vesicle (OMV) release mediates background LPS clearance. Our findings reveal bacteria have the capacity to remodel their surface architecture through OMV-mediated LPS turnover in a growth-independent manner.

However, under agitated cultivation, cellulose producing strain (Cel +) often transition to non-producing mutants (Cel -), restricting scalability and hindering widespread use. Agitation-associated shear stress, elevated oxygen levels, and genetic mutations have been linked to the emergence of the Cel- phenotype. A genome-wide investigation that considers population heterogeneity and dynamics is essential to reveal the mutational landscape and evolutionary processes driving this phenotypic shift. Results: Over successive rounds of agitated cultivation, the strain transitioned to a planktonic state, losing BC production. Whole-genome sequencing revealed both structural variations (SVs) and non-structural variations (NSVs). Contrary to previous reports, SVs, including insertion sequences (IS) mediated junction events, did not affect genes related to BC synthesis. Instead, the accumulation and positive selection of NSVs, such as frameshift and replication slippage events, in key BC-related genes, strongly correlated with the loss of cellulose synthesis. Conclusions: This study provides the first genome-wide population-level analysis revealing mutational dynamics underlying the BC phenotypic switch in Komagataeibacter spp. under agitated conditions. We show that BC-related gene mutations are not solely driven by SVs, with NSVs emerging as equally critical contributors. Furthermore, the genomic evidence implicates broader involvement of quorum sensing and cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate signaling, suggesting both genetic and regulatory factors underlying the disruption of BC synthesis. These findings highlight the importance of examining genetic heterogeneity with population to understand phenotypic adaptation for strain improvement strategies for scalable BC production.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

In this study of the summated poxvirus genome sequence database, we report that while only a weak negative correlation exist between viral coding densities and genome sizes, we detected a strong positive correlation between the number of assigned open reading frames (ORF) and genome sizes. We observe an inflection point at a genome size of 229kb, above or below with the percentage of genes encoding secreted proteins increasing with genome size, and the percentage of predicted cytoplasmic proteins decreasing with genome size. Additionally, we observed a weak positive correlation between the potential of transcript overlap that would be expected to generate dsRNA and genome size.

With a purposely designed human platelet targeted lipidomics platform which detected more than 550 platelet and releasate lipid species encompassing >30 lipid classes/subclasses, I presented in this study major changes to platelet lipidome triggered by acute and prolonged thrombin and collagen stimulations. I have demonstrated that overall lipid release from platelets was suppressed by collagen at the acute phase, a phenomenon that to my knowledge has yet to be reported.

However, the etiology of pulmonary vascular endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, an established precursor to PVD, is incompletely understood but may involve abnormal blood flow patterns, hypoxemia, and polycythemia. Hypothesis: Utilizing an ovine Glenn model, we hypothesized that non-pulsatile pulmonary blood flow (PBF) induces pulmonary vascular EC dysfunction, independent of hypoxemia or polycythemia. Methods: Seven lambs (6-8 weeks old) underwent a Glenn procedure. Eight weeks later, Glenn and age-matched controls were studied. The response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (Ach) was determined in isolated pulmonary arteries (PA). Nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling was determined in right lung tissues. Indices of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were determined in PA endothelial cells (PAECs). Comparisons were made by unpaired t-test and ANOVA. Results: There were no differences in age, hemoglobin, or oxygen saturation between groups. Mean PA pressure and left PA flow were higher, and right lung blood flow was lower in Glenn lambs compared to controls (p<0.05). All other baseline hemodynamics were similar. Glenn PAs had impaired relaxation to Ach. Glenn lung NO metabolite levels (NOx) and eNOS protein were lower, and ET-1 levels and prepro-ET-1 protein were higher than controls (p<0.05).

A.", "abstract": "In visually complex and dynamically changing environments, humans often face the challenge of filtering out salient stimuli that are presently irrelevant to their tasks. Recent evidence suggests that through repeated exposure to search arrays containing salient color singleton distractors, individuals can learn to divert their attention away from such salient but irrelevant stimuli, even before they capture attention. However, the mechanisms underlying such attentional suppression remain unclear. The current study examined trajectories of singleton distractor representations during visual searches to address this gap. Using multivariate pattern analyses on EEG data (N = 40), we found that singleton distractor representations underwent a rapid inversion approximately 200 ms into the search. These inverted representations were coded in a shared subspace with target representations, but in a reversed orientation, presumably to downweight their salience in the spatial priority map. Target locations were consistently enhanced compared to non-singleton distractors, while singleton distractors were suppressed. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapid representational transformation underlying salient distractor suppression at the onset of visual search. The rapid inversion of pop-out singleton distractor signals resulted in an inverted arrangement of target and distractor representations in a shared neural subspace, which facilitates subsequent read-out of both target enhancement and distractor suppression signals in the computation of spatial priorities to successfully guide search.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

At the molecular level, machine learning models identified the inflammatory response and regulators of circadian rhythms as key cellular predictors of AD. These signatures were reflected in specific cell types: microglia transitioned to a pro-inflammatory state, while inhibitory neurons within sleep- and circadian-regulating hypothalamic subregions showed the most profound transcriptional alterations, including disruptions in ligand-receptor interactions and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.

Voxel-wise analyses reveal increased activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula during interoceptive attention (attending to one's heartbeat) compared to exteroceptive attention (attending to auditory white noise). Layer-specific analyses further demonstrate that this difference in activity is significantly higher in upper compared to lower cortical layers.

RNA sequencing data from normal livers and patients with early silent ALD and severe AH were analyzed. -diversity indices and Percent Shannon Diversity of a gene, which refers to this gene's contribution to total Shannon entropy were calculated. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways determined by differentially expressed genes (DEG) and DSD approaches. ALD significantly decreased hepatic transcriptome -diversity correlating with increased relative contribution of select genes. These changes were driven by lower abundance gene expression loss. DEG and DSD analyses showed overlapping genes and canonical pathways, but DSD also identified novel genes and pathways not highlighted by DEG. Importantly, DSD more effectively identified differences between preclinical ALD and AH severity stages. ALD decreases hepatic transcriptome heterogeneity, favoring pathways associated with organ damage or damage response. Preclinical and clinical ALD led to differential heterogeneity patterns that may provide new disease insights. DSD analysis identified enriched pathways missed by standard DEG analyses, potentially yielding novel insight into disease mechanisms and biomarkers.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

We previously demonstrated that the benzoxaborole compound AN3661 inhibits the endonuclease activity of CPSF3 in Cryptosporidium hominis, likely by disrupting pre-mRNA processing, which in turn limits parasite growth. In this study, we further explored its mode of action and found that a specific mutation (Y385N) in CPSF3 of C. parvum confers strong resistance to AN3661. Interestingly, this mutation does not affect the parasites sensitivity to two other benzoxaboroles, AN13762 and AN7973, which are also thought to target CpCPSF3. All three compounds interfered with mRNA processing in C. parvum, consistent with inhibition of CPSF3 complex activity, and showed parasiticidal activity, especially during the late stages of merogony, blocking parasite egress. Two of them also impaired gamogony. In T. gondii, AN7973 remained effective against several strains carrying mutations within TgCPSF3 that confer resistance to AN3661 and AN13762, suggesting that it might represent an alternative chemotype targeting CPSF3 with the potential to overcome resistance. Notably, AN7973 successfully controlled severe infection in susceptible mice challenged with the AN3661-resistant C. parvum strain carrying the CpCPSF3Y385N mutation. Finally, we extended the known antiparasitic spectrum of AN3661 and AN7973 to include Eimeria tenella and Giardia duodenalis, two important pathogens in veterinary and human health. Altogether, our findings refine the understanding of CPSF3-targeting benzoxaboroles, identify alternative chemotypes with the potential to bypass resistance, and support their potential use in combination therapies to delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistance.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Over 15 days, both live and one of the heat-killed treatments maintained photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), whereas placebo-treated corals exhibited significant thermal stress-induced decline. 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiling showed enrichment of putatively beneficial genera (e.g., Terasakiispira spp., Pseudoalteromonas spp.), and untargeted metabolomics resolved treatment-specific metabolic signatures that differed among consortia and between live and inactivated formulations. These molecular fingerprints illuminate specific underlying protective mechanisms and host microbiome interactions under heat stress.

A.", "abstract": "Host associated microbiota play essential roles in regulating digestion, nutrient acquisition, immunity, and xenobiotic metabolism. Disruption of these communities is linked to numerous diseases and health defects though causal mechanisms underpinning these associations remain unclear in most cases. Gnotobiotic zebrafish provide a scalable low-cost in vivo model that is increasingly used to resolve causality in host-microbiota interactions. However, reliance on live diets limits the use of gnotobiotic zebrafish to early life stages where body systems and microbial communities are incompletely developed. As a result, many important host-microbiota interactions may be unable to be studied in this model system. Here we tested a simple method for long-term husbandry of gnotobiotic zebrafish using gamma-irradiated chow diets and evaluated effects on growth, gene expression, and microbial community composition. In conventionally reared animals, gamma irradiated diets did not affect growth or survival and only modestly impacted microbial community composition and diversity. In contrast, gnotobiotic zebrafish maintained on sterile irradiated diets for 55 days post fertilization were smaller, weighed less, and exhibited aberrant genes expression profiles relative to controls. These genes were enriched for pathways, related to immune response, xenobiotic metabolism, organ development, liver function, and lipid metabolism, with many expression patterns linked to the abundance of specific microbial taxa. Together, these findings establish a practical protocol for long-term maintenance of gnotobiotic zebrafish and extend the utility of this model to study microbiome-dependent effects on host physiology, and development beyond early larval stages of life.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

These transparent fibers, featuring a 175m inner diameter, 25m wall thickness, and an approximate molecular weight cutoff of 30kDa, possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. This amphiphilic nature helps maintain a potent lumen structure even in dry, open air, enabling precise handling and orientation of small specimens prior to resin polymerization and eliminating the need for remounting. The protocol includes specimen transfer using wire loops, microwave-assisted chemical pre-fixation, dissection on a soft silicone substrate with micro-scissors, and manipulation of hollow fibers using insect pins. This approach preserves the identity of individual specimens throughout processing. During ultramicrotomy, the fiber serves as a visual guide, enhancing alignment and reproducibility of sectioning. As proof of principle, we demonstrate well-preserved ultrastructural features in chemically fixed, microwave-assisted resin-embedded C. elegans specimens. This method offers a robust and reproducible alternative to conventional gelatinous media encapsulation, particularly suited for TEM analysis of scarce or small biological samples.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

Red-light responsive tools enable multiwavelength applications and allow greater biological tissue penetration with reduced toxicity. Current red-light tools are primarily based on phytochromes, large dimeric proteins with a structurally complex mode of interaction with their binding partners. Here we introduce a small red-light-only responsive system composed of a GA domain (6 kDa) that binds to a CBCR GAF domain (17 kDa) with a Kd ~1-5 M to form a 1:1 complex in the dark. Red light causes dissociation of the complex by causing a >25-fold decrease in binding affinity. The CBCR GAF domain reverts to the dark state with a half-life of ~1 min and the complex reforms. Structural analysis using NMR measurements combined with molecular docking and dynamics simulations shows that the binder interacts with the GAF domain and senses isomerization of the bilin chromophore at a site that overlaps the critical tongue domain of phytochromes. This system provides a small, simple red-light-only optogenetic tool that can operate to control protein-protein interactions in vitro and in living cells.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

S.; Marsh-Armstrong, N.; Sanz, E.; Quintana, A.; Simo, S.; La Torre, A.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central hallmark of many optic neuropathies, yet the mechanisms linking intrinsic metabolic stress to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we developed conditional transgenic models targeting the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufs4 in the retina. Broad deletion of Ndufs4 in the retina resulted in vision loss, progressive RGC degeneration, and pronounced immune activation before overt RGC death. Strikingly, depletion of myeloid cells significantly preserved RGCs, demonstrating that inflammation is not simply a downstream consequence but a participant in the degeneration process. To further distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we generated a mosaic model in which only subsets of retinal cells lacked Ndufs4. In this paradigm, the degeneration first appeared selectively in mutant regions, suggesting that mitochondrial impairment within RGCs is necessary to initiate vulnerability. At later stages, however, the degeneration extended beyond mutant territories, highly suggestive of a propagation through non-cell autonomous processes. Together, these findings support a model in which mitochondrial dysfunction creates the conditions for neuronal vulnerability, while immune responses govern the timing and extent of cell loss. This framework explains the consistent co-occurrence of metabolic deficits and neuroinflammation in optic neuropathies and highlights the importance of their interactions in disease progression. By clarifying the intersection of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, this work advances our understanding of RGC degeneration and provides a conceptual basis for deciphering pathogenic processes across diverse optic neuropathies.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

However, the cellular programs orchestrating these multiscale adaptation remain poorly defined, partly due to the absence of analytical tools integrating gene-cell-tissue scales. Here, we present CausaLink, a cross-scale causal mapping framework that predicts how altered gene expression propagates through gene-cell-tissue networks by integrating time-course transcriptomic and tissue morpho-mechanical data. We constructed a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of 11,143 proximal pulmonary artery-derived cells from C57BL/6J mice across five developmental stages (P2, P10, P21, P42, and P84), revealing dynamic lineage transitions and transient mesenchymal population specifying into fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells from P2 to P21. Using this framework, we identified Mgl2? macrophages as central regulators promoting lumen expansion while preventing pathological wall thinning or thickening. To validate these predictions, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial assembloid enriched in MGLhigh macrophages. In this model, MGLhigh macrophages supported lumen enlargement while maintaining overall wall thickness and induced formation of an adventitia-like fibroblast layer that recapitulated approximately 80% of the native adventitial fraction with balanced collagen-elastin remodeling.

However, the dependency on sequencing depth severely restricts the reliability and accuracy of existing Hi-C tools, especially in single-cells. To address this issue, we introduce a novel computational framework based on the mean first passage time (MFPT) in Markov chain theory, which transforms chromatin contact matrices into a robust, distance-based representation. We demonstrate that MFPT representation is inherently insensitive to sequencing depth. Leveraging this transformation, we develop STRIDE (Spatial Topological Representation of Interaction Distance Evaluation), a parameter-free metric for library similarity. STRIDE is resilience to sparse and noisy data, insensitive to technical variabilities, and facilitates unsupervised embedding from single-cell Hi-C, enabling accurate delineation of cellular states and developmental trajectories. In conclusion, as a reliable computational framework for sparse and noisy data, STRIDE may serve as a base for wide range single-cell 3D genome analysis that used to be inconceivable.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms by which vascular contributions such as CAA contribute dementias such as AD are not well understood. This is due in part to the lack mouse models that develop robust CAA, hampering our ability to develop therapies that target vascular deficits. To address this, we have explored the use of distinct genetic contexts to enhance the face validity of mouse models for AD. We have previously identified the WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain as a model that shows increased susceptibility to CAA in the presence of the APP/PS1 amyloid driver, compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Here, we now perform an in-depth characterization of WSB.APP/PS1 and its WSB wild type (WT) counterpart, assessing male and female mice, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age (M). We show that WSB.APP/PS1 mice show mild CAA at 8M, with robust CAA being apparent at 14M. Transcriptional profiling showed strong correlation to AMP-AD gene expression modules highlighting the human relevance of WSB.APP/PS1 mice and predicted white matter deficits at 14M that was confirmed by immunofluorescence. PET/CT showed blood flow and metabolic deficits, and modifications in small vessel morphology in 8M WSB.APP/PS1 compared to WSB WT mice. We tested whether cerebrovascular reactivity deficits in WSB WT mice may underly the susceptibility to CAA, but interestingly, they did not show age-dependent decline in reactivity that was observed in B6 mice. Finally, using an allelic series of humanized apolipoprotein E (APOE), we show that APOE4 increased the extent of CAA in WSB.APP/PS1 mice, compared to APOE2 and APOE3, but in a sex-dependent manner.
