Existing literature on its ligand binding mechanism lacked sufficient evidence to univocally assign the kinetic type of binding mechanism for GlnBP: ligand binding prior to conformational change, i.e., an induced fit or the conformational selection, in which the ligand binds the matching conformation from a pre-existing ensemble. Since such mechanistic questions are relevant for our fundamental understanding of how this and other biomacromolecules regulate cellular processes, we here revisit the question for GlnBP. We present a biochemical and biophysical analysis using a combination of calorimetry, single-molecule and surface-plasmon resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that both apo- and holo-GlnBP show no detectable exchange between open and (semi-)closed conformations on timescales between 100 ns and 10 ms and that ligand binding and conformational changes in GlnBP are correlated. A global analysis of our experimental results suggests that the conformational selection model is only compatible with GlnBP for the extreme scenario of very fast conformational exchange between the open and closed states on timescales <100 ns. In contrast all data remains compatible with an induced-fit mechanism, where the ligand binds GlnBP prior to conformational rearrangements. Importantly, our work demonstrates that it is an intricate task to identify the type of kinetic binding mechanism and that this requires not only a sufficient set of data, but also an integrative experimental and theoretical framework to address the question. Based on this concept, we propose that various protein systems, for which so far only insufficient kinetic data are available, should be revisited.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The strength of covert attention fluctuated rhythmically around 11 Hz. A shift of attention from one alternative to another tends to occur at the trough of this oscillation, presumably enabling comparisons. These shifts further reset the attentional oscillation. By contrast, at the peak of the oscillation, attention tends to increase the focus on the currently sampled alternative, presumably deepening processing of that alternative. We propose intrinsic attentional oscillations as a core mechanism governing the flexible sampling of decision alternatives.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

It remains unknown, for instance, how much of the vast uncharted landscape of far-from-natural sequences encodes the familiar ensemble of natural folds in a fashion consistent with the laws of biophysics but seemingly untouched by evolution on Earth. The scale of sequence perturbations required to access these spaces exceeds the reach of even gold-standard experimental approaches such as directed evolution. We surpass this limitation guided by the innate capacity of protein language models (PLMs) to explore sequences outside their natural training data through generation and self-feedback. We recast PLMs as probes that explore into regions of protein \"deep space\" that possess little-to-no detectable homology to natural examples, while enforcing core structural constraints, in a novel sequence design approach that we term \"foldtuning.\" We build a library of foldtuned PLMs for >700 natural folds in the SCOP database, covering numerous high-priority targets for synthetic biology, including GPCRs and small GTPases, composable cell-surface-receptor and DNA-binding domains, and small signaling/regulatory domains. Candidate proteins generated by foldtuned PLMs reflect distinctive new \"rules of language\" for sequence innovation beyond detectable homology to any known protein and sample subtle structural alterations in a man- ner reminiscent of natural structural evolution and diversification. Experimental validation of three markedly different fold targets; the tyrosine-kinase- and small- GTPase-regulating SH3 domain, the bacterial RNase inhibitor barstar, and the peptide hormone insulin demonstrates that foldtuning proposes protein variants that express and fold stably in vitro and function in vivo. Foldtuning reveals protein sequence-structure information at scale outside of the context of evolution and promises to push forward the redesign and reconstitution of novel-to-nature synthetic biological systems for applications in health and catalysis.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we employed a multi-pronged approach involving large-scale data mining, extensive fractionation of AspN- and trypsin-digested proteomes, and both label-free and TMT labeling. We identified 471,196 peptides from 22,479 proteins, including 32,110 isoform-specific peptides, providing direct evidence for 2,442 AS events using Araport11 annotation. Expanding the search to include unannotated intron retention (IR) events revealed 91 additional novel IR events, bringing the total to 2,533, many predicted to alter protein properties. This data also contributed to refinement of gene model annotation. Quantitative comparison between wild-type plants and the AS mutant acinus pinin revealed that IR regulates transcript and protein abundance in a non-linear fashion. Phenotypic assays confirmed functional outcomes of these molecular changes, including reduced chlorophyll content, impaired growth, and increased anthocyanin accumulation.

We recently investigated the variations in cellular metabolism and antioxidant responses in primary bovine vascular endothelial cells (BAECs) under different energetic substrate conditions in vitro, specifically glucose or galactose. In this context, pharmacological agents may affect cells differently depending on their energy metabolism status. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effects of diphenyl diselenide ((PhSe)2), a redox-active molecule known for its prominent cardiovascular effects, on redox-bioenergetic cellular pathways under glycolytic or oxidative conditions in BAECs. Under glucose conditions, (PhSe)2 positively impacted mitochondrial oxidative capacity, as assessed by respirometry, and was associated with changes in mitochondrial cellular dynamics. However, these changes were not observed in cells cultured with galactose. Although (PhSe)2 induced the nuclear translocation of the redox sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in both glucose and galactose media, Nrf2 remained in the nuclei of cells cultured in galactose for a longer duration. Additionally, activation of another redox sensitive transcription factor, forkhead O3 (FOXO3a) was only detected in galactose media. Notably, (PhSe)2 induced the expression of genes controlling mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and glutathione synthesis and recycling in glucose media, whereas its effects in galactose media were primarily focused on glutathione homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings underscore the critical influence of cellular metabolic status on the antioxidant capacity of redox-active molecules such as (PhSe)2.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

All repair mechanisms must successfully negotiate the local chromatin environment in order to access DNA. For example, nucleosomes can be repositioned by the highly conserved Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. In Caenorhabditis elegans, NuRD functions in the germline to repair DSBs - the loss of NuRD's ATPase subunit, LET-418/CHD4, prevents DSB resolution and therefore reduces fertility. In this study, we challenge germlines with exogenous DNA damage to better understand NuRD's role in repairing DSBs. We find that let-418 mutants are hypersensitive to cisplatin and hydroxyurea: exposure to either mutagen impedes DSB repair, generates aneuploid oocytes, and severely reduces fertility and embryonic survival. These defects resemble those seen when the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway is compromised, and we find that LET-418's activity is epistatic to that of the FA component FCD-2/FANCD2. We propose a model in which NuRD is recruited to the site of DNA lesions to remodel chromatin and allow access for FA pathway components. Together, these results implicate NuRD in the repair of both endogenous DSBs and exogenous DNA lesions to preserve genome integrity in developing germ cells.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Using our framework, we largely outperformed human annotators in error and speed. LSTM performance improved with challenging training instances, and remained robust even with modest sample sizes. LSTM also outperformed YOLO, highlighting the critical role of temporal sequence information in behavioural analysis. 4.

Here, we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, and calcium imaging to identify a single cluster of neurons, defined by co-expression of Chrna3 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 3) and Cckar (cholecystokinin 1 receptor), that is preferentially expressed in the right nodose ganglia of rats and mice. This neuronal population also expresses several genes implicated in digestive signaling, including Glp1r and Sctr, consistent with a gut-innervating subtype.

We collected an extensive dataset of cat (of either sex) V1 responses to stimuli covarying in orientation, direction, spatial frequency, and TF to assess the extent of motion selectivity. We show that preferred TF is mostly uniform across the cortical surface. Yet, in over half of V1, the preferred direction is reversed with changing stimulus TF, revealing four distinct map motifs embedded in V1's functional architecture. Similarly, despite the lack of spatial modulation for the preferred TF map and the lack of invariance for the preferred direction map, we found using convolutional neural networks that direction, TF and stimulus speed can be accurately decoded from V1 responses at all cortical locations.

Here we take an integrative biophysical and structural approach to uncover molecular diversity in {beta}-arr coupling to the neuromodulatory metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), prototypical, dimeric family C GPCRs. We find, using a new single molecule pulldown assay, that mGluRs couple to beta-arrs with a 2:1 or 2:2 stoichiometry via a combination of tail and core interactions. Using single molecule FRET analysis, we also find that {beta}-arr1 stabilizes active conformations of mGluR8. Cryo-EM structures of mGluR8 alone or with either G proteins or {beta}-arr1 reveal transducer-specific mGluR8 active states and, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, define the positioning of mGluR8-bound {beta}-arr1, supporting a steric mechanism of mGluR desensitization involving interactions with both subunits and the lipid bilayer. Finally, combinatorial mutagenesis enables the identification of a landscape of homo- and hetero-dimeric mGluR/{beta}-arr complexes, including mGluR/{beta}-arr1/{beta}-arr2 megacomplexes, providing a framework for family C GPCR/{beta}-arr coupling and expanding the known range of GPCR/transducer coupling modes.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

However, common approaches to sperm tracking require sample dilution and shortening the time window of observation (less than 1 to 2 seconds) to avoid tracking errors that occur when sperm cross paths. The post-ejaculatory lifespan of sperm can exceed several hours to days in some species, and long-term adaptive changes in motility pattern may be an important distinguishing factor for predictive modeling of sperm fertilizing competence. Improving the predictive value of computer assisted semen analysis will require accurate tracking of sperm trajectories over physiologically-relevant time scales and at the high cell densities typically found in semen.

Remarkably, sequential antibiotic use shifted these paths from divergence to convergence, driven by extinction of resistance mutations when switching to effective antibiotics exhibiting collateral sensitivity. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that evolved lineages shifted away from the wild-type state, with fewer cells exhibiting high ribosomal gene counts, a signature consistent with persistence, while also uncovering lineage-specific expression differences that suggest distinct underlying mechanisms.

These results indicate that efficiency of B cell priming, and not complexities in Env-guided affinity maturation, is the primary obstacle to V2 apex bNAb elicitation in SHIV-infected macaques and identify specific HIV-1 Envs to advance as novel vaccine platforms.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

J.; Sussel, L.; Wells, K. L.", "abstract": "Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism for generating protein diversity by producing distinct isoforms from a single gene. Dysregulation of splicing that affects pancreatic function, and immune tolerance has been linked to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Next-generation sequencing technologies, with their short read lengths, are limited in their ability to accurately detect splice variants. Long-read sequencing technologies offer the potential to overcome these limitations by providing full-length transcript information; however, their application in single-cell RNA sequencing has been hindered by technical challenges, including insufficient read lengths and higher error rates. Furthermore, cell types that produce high levels of a single transcript, such as islet endocrine cells, can obscure identification of lower abundance transcripts. In this study, we optimized a protocol for single-cell long-read sequencing in pancreatic islets to improve read length and transcript detection. Our findings demonstrate that 5' library preparation protocols outperform 3' protocols, resulting in better transcript identification. Furthermore, we show that targeted depletion of insulin transcripts enhances the detection of informative reads, highlighting the utility of transcript depletion strategies. This optimized protocol enables isoform-specific gene expression analysis and reveals differential transcript usage across the various cell types in pancreatic islets. By leveraging this approach, we gain deeper insights into the transcriptomic complexity and cellular heterogeneity within pancreatic islets.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we identified E4BP4 as a transcriptional repressor that prevents obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative dysfunction by inhibiting ceramide synthesis in brown fat. Specifically, E4BP4 interacts with PRDM16 to repress Cers6 mRNA expression and consequently reduces C16:0 ceramide levels by binding to a 65 kb upstream enhancer region of the Cers6 gene. Notably, the preservation of mitochondrial integrity in BAT by E4BP4 gain-of-function improves systemic glucose homeostasis, independent of weight loss.

Our combined in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that their ATP-driven polyphosphate polymerase VTC converts cytosolic Pi into inorganic polyphosphates (polyP), which it transfers into the vacuole lumen. Luminal polyphosphatases immediately hydrolyse this polyP to establish a growing reservoir of vacuolar Pi. Product inhibition by this Pi pool silences the polyphosphatases, caps Pi accumulation, and favours vacuolar polyP storage. Upon cytosolic Pi scarcity, the declining inositol pyrophosphate levels activate the vacuolar Pi exporter Pho91 to replenish cytosolic Pi. In this way, acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-regulated buffering system for cytosolic Pi, which the cells can switch between Pi accumulation, Pi release, and high-capacity phosphate storage through polyP.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Little is known about repair of pathways/circuits after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in disruption of connectivity. Here we utilize a mouse model of diffuse traumatic axonal injury (Impact-acceleration TBI) in order to explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and synapses were genetically labeled via AAV transduction, while anterograde and transsynaptic tracers were used to mark terminals and postsynaptic cells. Functional connectivity and visual integrity were assessed by monitoring c-Fos expression following light stimulation and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (pVEPs). Our findings demonstrate that, although TAI results in approximately a 50% loss of RGC axons and terminals, surviving RGCs undergo collateral sprouting, a form of compensatory branching of surviving axons, that restores terminal density to pre-injury levels. Transsynaptic tracing and c-Fos mapping confirmed the reestablishment of connectivity, which was also associated with significant improvements in visual function as measured by pVEPs. Interestingly, the recovery process exhibited sexual dimorphism, with female mice showing delayed or incomplete repair. Moreover, collateral sprouting proceeded normally in Sarm1 knockout mice, evidence of some independence from Wallerian degeneration. Our findings show that collateral sprouting may be an important mechanism of circuit repair in TAI and may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Visualization of the efficiency of these therapeutics through in vivo mHTT quantification rises in importance. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mHTT aggregates, it is critical to characterize the in vivo kinetic profile of newly identified mHTT binders to assess their translational application. Here, we report the evaluation of [11C]CHDI-009R, a PET imaging radioligand with higher affinity and selectivity for mHTT aggregates than previously reported radioligands, in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type (WT) littermates at 9 and 3 months of age. [11C]CHDI-009R displayed high stability in plasma and brain, which was reflected in brain kinetics as demonstrated by rapid uptake followed by relatively slow elimination. Kinetic modeling and volume of distribution VT (IDIF) indicated the radioligand's ability to quantify mHTT aggregation at 9 months of age with clear genotype differentiation (p<0.0001).

The Rosetta software, which provides diverse physics-based methods for designing sequences, exploring conformations, docking molecules, and performing analysis, has proven invaluable to this field. Nevertheless, Rosetta's aging architecture, monolithic structure, non-open source code, and steep development learning curve are beginning to hinder new methods development. Here, we introduce the Masala software suite, a free, open-source set of C++ libraries intended to extend Rosetta and other software, and ultimately to be a successor to Rosetta. Masala is structured for modern computing hardware, and its build system automates the creation of application programming interface (API) layers, permitting Masala's use as an extension library for existing software, including Rosetta. Masala features modular architecture in which it is easy for novice developers to add new plugin modules, which can be independently compiled and loaded at runtime, extending functionality of software linking Masala without source code alteration. Here, we describe implementation of Masala modules that accelerate protein and synthetic peptide design. We describe the implementation of Masala real-valued local optimizers and cost function network optimizers that can be used as drop-in replacements for Rosetta's minimizer and packer when designing heteropolymers. We explore design-centric guidance terms for promoting desirable features, such as hydrogen bond networks, or discouraging undesirable features, such as unsatisfied buried hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, which we have re-implemented far more efficiently in Masala, providing up to two orders of magnitude of speedup in benchmarks.

Commonly, models of working memory maintain information such as hues or words by forming memory attractors through structured connectivity. However, real-world information can be novel, making it infeasible to use predefined attractors. In addition, most models-with or without attractors-have focused on maintaining binary categories instead of continuous information in each neuron. In the present study, we investigate how the brain might maintain working memory representations of arbitrary novel patterns with graded values. We propose an unstructured, rate-based network model in which each neuron has multiple dendrites. Each dendrite shows bistable activity, which qualitatively captures the conductance-based dynamics in the corresponding spiking model and emulates fast Hebbian plasticity. This network can flexibly maintain novel graded patterns under various perturbations without fine-tuning of parameters. Through analytical characterization of network dynamics during the encoding and memory periods, we identify different conditions that yield either perfect memories or several types of memory errors. Our analysis reveals a functional separation for network neurons into two groups with distinct behaviors.

Existing approaches that measure phylogenetic information often rely on predefined topologies or heuristic criteria, limiting their generality and interpretability. Here, we introduce a novel, topology-agnostic framework for quantifying site-wise phylogenetic information using sparse learning via Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. By modeling site log-likelihoods as predictors of the tree likelihood across a large ensemble of random topologies, our approach isolates the minimal subset of sites that meaningfully contribute to phylogenetic signal. We validate the method using both simulated and empirical mammalian datasets, demonstrating that Lasso-selected sites yield topologies nearly identical to those inferred from full alignments. For computational efficiency, we show that a simple entropy-based proxy (Shannon H [&ge;] 0.5) approximates Lasso results with high fidelity, enabling rapid site-level assessments. Importantly, our definition of phylogenetically informative sites provides an objective metric that can serve as a gold standard to evaluate commonly used alignment filtering tools.

One key unresolved issue is whether prefrontal cortical outputs to motor-related subcortical regions carry predominantly motor commands or mixed sensory-motor signals. Retrograde optogenetics offers a powerful way to interrogate such projection-defined circuits, but its use in non-human primates has been limited. Here, we applied retrograde optogenetics in awake macaques to directly test the functional organization of the corticotectal projection from the frontal eye field (FEF) to the superior colliculus (SC). We asked whether FEF output to SC is motor-dominant or reflects sensory-motor convergence. Optical activation of this pathway evoked robust, contralateral saccades and selectively modulated reaction times, demonstrating its causal role in saccade generation. Optogenetically tagging FEF neurons projecting to SC revealed a heterogeneous population of visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons. This diverse output converged predominantly onto motor-related neurons in the SC. These findings support a visuomotor convergence model and resolve long-standing questions over the composition of FEF outputs.

We found a significant age-induced decrease in hippocampal neuro-androgen levels by going from 3m to 24 m using mass-spectrometric analysis. The hippocampal levels of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) dramatically decreased from 17 nM T and 7 nM DHT at 3 m to 17/100 nM T and 7/15 nM DHT at 24 m.

Androgen receptor AR was moderately decreased but estrogen receptor ER was not decreased with aging. The 25% decrease in the spine density with aging may be due to a balance between considerably decreased T and DHT levels (spine decrease factor) and remained moderately high E2 level (spine increase factor) in the 24m hippocampus.

Their soma is located sub-ependymally and they have a dendritic-like process that ends as a bulb (the so-called apical process; ApPr) inside the CC. It remains unclear how this unique anatomical organization, with the soma and the ApPr located in different extracellular environments, relates to their function as a multimodal sensor of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. One of the main physiological features of CSFcNs is a prominent spontaneous electrical activity mediated by PKD2L1 (or TRPP2) channels, a non-selective cation channel of the TRP family. PKD2L1 channels have a high single-channel conductance (around 200 pS) and can be modulated by protons and mechanical forces. In this work we investigate PKD2L1 channel sensitivity to pH and its effects on CSFcNs excitability. We demonstrate that PKD2L1 spontaneous activity generates not only phasic inward currents, but also a tonic current, both of which are modulated bidirectionally by pH with a high sensitivity around physiological values. By combining electrophysiology (direct recordings from intact and isolated ApPrs) with optical methods (laser-photolysis of protons) we further show that functional PKD2L1 channels are specifically localized in the ApPr. The spatial segregation of PKD2L1 channels, along with their biophysical properties (high single-channel conductance and pH sensitivity) and the ApPr's unique membrane properties (very high input resistance) renders CSFcN excitability exquisitely sensitive to PKD2L1 modulation.

Located circumferentially at the anterior chamber angle where the iris meets the cornea, the AHOP comprises the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC), which together regulate intraocular fluid drainage. Malformation of this pathway leads to elevated intraocular pressure, painful ocular enlargement, and retinal damage that can result in blindness. While single-gene mutations account for approximately 25% of PCG cases across diverse populations, most molecular causes remain unknown and are likely due to rare or complex genetic factors. Progress in identifying these mechanisms has been limited by a lack of detailed gene expression data during AHOP development. To address this gap, we generated the first single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from developing AHOP tissue, using rat eyes at three key stages of TM and SC formation.

While there have been extensive studies of microcystin-LR by oral route exposure, we have turned our attention to inhalation route exposure due to the recent findings of microcystin-containing lake and sea-spray aerosol. We have shown inflammatory outcomes in the airways of mice and in human cell culture models after microcystin aerosol exposure, and have found a consistent molecular patterns similar to those of Type 1/Type 17 driven neutrophilic asthma. Here we address the hypothesis that MC-LR will increase the inflammatory mediators of neutrophilic asthma leading to worsening symptoms. This is tested and characterized in both in vitro and in vivo models. We found that asthma symptoms and molecular signatures of inflammation are both worsened by MC-LR exposure in a mouse model of neutrophilic asthma. We found that 3D human airway cell culture models reconstructed from asthmatic donor cells are similarly affected, however healthy donor cells are nearly unaltered by comparison. Aggregating these findings with RNA sequencing data from all models, we developed a hypothetical molecular mechanism which relies on MC-LR mediated amplification of existing inflammatory signaling. We test this in a human reporter cell line of NF-{kappa}B activity and further demonstrate the mechanism by inhibitor testing. This study sheds light on the risk to asthmatic patients living near or recreating on affected bodies of water. Beyond asthma, we believe this study provides crucial insight into the findings over the last 40 years concerning disparate outcomes of MC-LR exposure as the result of exposure will be dependent on the signaling state of the tissue upon exposure.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

G.; Yoon, R.; Eissa, T.; Kilpatrick, Z.; Josic, K.", "abstract": "How do recurrent neural networks (RNNs) internally represent elapsed time to initiate responses after learned delays? To address this question, we trained RNNs on delayed decision-making tasks of increasing complexity: binary decisions, context-dependent decisions, and perceptual integration. We analyzed RNN dynamics after training using eigenvalue spectra, connectivity structure, and population trajectories, and found that 1) distinct dynamical regimes emerge across networks trained on the same task whereby oscillatory dynamics support precise timing, and integration supports evidence accumulation, 2) a population-wide representation of time and decision variables emerges rather than dedicated sub-populations to tracking time and other task-specific variables; and 3) the neural trajectories align only with the output weights near decision points, as shown by trajectory readout correlations, revealing task-driven coordination of precisely timed task representation and readout. These results show that RNNs can use either integration or oscillations to represent time, and highlight how structured connectivity enables diverse solutions to temporal computation problems, consistent with biological principles of degeneracy and functional redundancy.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Applied to epithelial sheet migration driven by MAPK/ERK, our approach quantitatively predicted single-cell movement from local chemical and mechanical cues. Examination of the learned equations further indicated that cells process environmental signals by computing their spatiotemporal derivatives.

In this study, we focused on previous experimental studies showing that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, a model organism for studying protist behavior, exhibits the ability to adapt to chemical environments. We propose a possible dynamic mechanism underlying this habituation, reproducing reported experimental observations with accuracy. By refining a mathematical model that was as simple as possible and based on non-specific biochemical processes within cells, we clarified a plausible mechanistic framework. Based on these results, we examined the similarities and differences between this framework and previously proposed habituation models of single-cell movement and animal neural-circuit regulation.

Yet, determining the functional consequences of acetylation for a given protein represents a considerable challenge. For instance, lysine residues are subject to various posttranslational modifications, rendering interpretation of mutational studies difficult. The genetic code expansion technology enables site-specific incorporation of acetyllysine (AcK) into proteins, but the applicability of AcK is limited, as within cells, the acetyl group is removed by deacetylases. Here, we show that site-specific incorporation of the non-hydrolyzable AcK analog ketolysine (KeK) and the trifluoroacetyllysine (TFAcK) into ubiquitin closely resembles the structural and functional effects of AcK incorporation. Furthermore, AcK and KeK can be efficiently incorporated into the tumor suppressor p53 in cells. However, whereas AcK becomes deacetylated, KeK, and also partially TFAcK, remains stable. Accordingly, incorporation of KeK, but not AcK, affects p53-mediated transcription. Thus, we propose that KeK is the AcK surrogate of choice for studying acetylation of a given protein in cells. Moreover, we show that the trifluoro modification is a functional surrogate of AcK but with a different chemistry, leading to a distingushed enzymatic processing.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

To test this idea, we directly visualized the dynamics of PolA/D at active replication forks via single-molecule imaging in Xenopus nuclear extracts. Surprisingly, we find that neither PolA nor PolD is stably tethered to the eukaryotic replisome. Instead, lagging strand synthesis occurs distributively and entails the recruitment of new molecules of PolA and PolD to facilitate the synthesis of new Okazaki fragments.

Disease states often disrupt cue-driven and self-paced actions in distinct ways, underscoring separable neural mechanisms. Such differences could arise from specialized circuits dedicated to each action mode or shared neuronal populations that shift their dynamics across contexts. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a task in which mice performed a lever press either spontaneously or in response to a cue, enabling direct comparison of internally and externally triggered movements. Two-photon calcium imaging in dorsolateral striatum revealed subpopulations of neurons tuned to the cue, movement, or post-movement periods. One cluster was consistently active around movement regardless of context, yet population dynamics diverged prior to action. Support vector machine decoding and subspace analyses revealed distinct context and action components within the same population. Both D1- and D2-SPNs contributed to both subspaces, with D1-SPNs more active at the time of the sensory stimulus. These results show that context shapes dynamics in shared action-encoding neurons within striatal circuits, suggesting that different initiation contexts are funneled into a common action space that flexibly supports movement execution.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

However, this rigid-body fitting problem is challenged by complex scoring landscapes and the non-differentiable nature of standard structural similarity metrics like TM-score, precluding their direct use in modern gradient-based optimization pipelines. We present LieOTMap, a novel, fully differentiable framework for cryo-EM fitting. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we parameterize rigid-body transformations on the Lie algebra se(3), which provides a minimal, singularity-free representation of the motion. Second, we formulate a loss function based on the Sinkhorn divergence, a differentiable proxy for the Optimal Transport (Wasserstein) distance. This loss function serves as a robust, geometrically meaningful surrogate for non-differentiable scores, allowing us to leverage powerful gradient descent optimizers to navigate the search space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LieOTMap by fitting the apo-state structure of E. coli GroEL (PDB: 1aon) into the ATP-bound state cryo-EM map (EMD-1046). Our method successfully navigates a large-scale conformational change, achieving a highly accurate final RMSD of 3.08 Angstrom with respect to the ground-truth structure (PDB: 1GRU).

As some GLA variants attain similar levels of residual activity but result in a range of phenotypes, our aim is to understand factors influencing phenotypic variability. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) is a stress response mechanism activated by multiple forms of mitochondrial dysfunction including accumulation of misfolded protein. As mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported, we investigated intracellular levels of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) by western blotting in 27 FD patients: 11 N215S (7 males) and 16 non-N215S (7 males) vs 4 heathy controls (HC, 3 males and 1 female). Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21), and Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) were also measured. Clinical outcomes explored included the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), the Age-Adjusting Severity Scores (AASS), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and left ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI). Globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) data was available for a subset of participants. Hsp60 showed no significant differences between groups (males FD: 0.29 vs HC: 0.11, females HC: 0.26 vs FD: 0.19 Hsp60/LC), however, differences among FD patients were noted. While some had over 2-fold that of HCs, others had less than half of HCs despite genotype and gender. When analysed in terms of severity scores, the N215S group with higher levels of Hsp60 corresponded with a milder phenotype. LVMI and eGFR also seemed to improve with higher levels of Hsp60 only for this group. In terms of FGF-21 and GDF-15, lower levels showed a trend with higher Hsp60 levels and LVMI in the N215S group. To conclude, our findings suggest a potential role for mtUPR activation, as evidenced by intracellular Hsp60 levels, in modulating cardiac and renal manifestations in Fabry disease. These preliminary associations highlight the need for longitudinal studies to validate Hsp60 and mitokines as biomarkers of disease progression, aiming to inform personalized approaches that improve outcomes across Fabry disease phenotypes.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Using transient perturbations of somatosensory input across postnatal development in mice, we identify three discrete life stages that exert lasting effects on adult behaviour. Perturbation during postnatal days 8-12 selectively increases adult sensitivity to dynamic touch. The same manipulation during days 13-17 produces persistent deficits in motor coordination. Perturbation during days 18-22 instead results in lifelong impairments in skilled locomotion. These findings reveal that somatosensory circuits undergo multiple phases of refinement, each aligned with the changing functional needs of the developing organism.

Although several neural mechanisms have been proposed to support this capacity, it is not yet clear how the brain makes such predictions. A compelling hypothesis is that the brain pre-activates a sensory template of a predictable stimulus before it appears. In a recent study, Demarchi et al. had participants listen to sequences of sounds with different levels of predictability. For some sequences, participants could anticipate the next sound (in regular sequences), for others not (in random sequences). Using magnetoencephalography recordings and machine-learning methods to decode sounds from brain signals, Demarchi et al. concluded that auditory predictions pre-activate tone-specific neural templates before the sound onset. In our reanalysis of their data, we demonstrate that their results can be fully explained by a bias induced by the structure of the sequences: because the most likely stimulus also happens to be physically close to the previous one, spurious higher-than-chance decoding performance arises before the sound onset. We provide general criteria to assess whether a study is affected by this confound and requires a reexamination.

This effect was most pronounced with image primes, face targets, and right visual field presentations. Under unconscious priming, no such effects were observed. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we applied a Drift Diffusion Model, which revealed that conscious priming selectively enhanced the efficiency of evidence accumulation and introduced a pre-decisional bias for identity decisions, with no reliable change for category decisions.

The microbiome was profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing, with analyses of microbial diversity, composition, differential abundance, and mediation of SES-caries associations. Saliva exhibited greater observed and Shannon diversity than plaque (both p < 0.01), with significant compositional differences (adonis p < 0.001). In saliva, alpha diversity was reduced with age, secondary education, low income, ownership of a healthcare card, and caries presence (all p < 0.05). SES explained greater variation in saliva than plaque composition, with associations for income (R{superscript 2}=3.8%, p<0.01), education (R{superscript 2}=2.0%, p<0.01), and caries (R{superscript 2}=2.2%, p<0.01).

Mediation analyses showed 75.6% of the income effect on caries was mediated by microbiome shifts (ME=0.28, SE=0.32), compared with 21% for education (ME=0.03, SE=0.02). Socioeconomic disadvantage has a significant impact on the oral microbiome, influencing caries risk through income-related microbial dysbiosis.

We here quantify the biomass, with an estimate of uncertainty, over the last 25 years based on a large dataset of commercial landings. By accounting for the number of boat-landing events, we can account for the variation in effort over this period. Our analysis indicates that cod biomass has been reduced by more than 80% from a peak in 2004-2005 to 2018. After 2018, the biomass was further reduced below 10% of the previous levels, but these estimates are more uncertain.

It is an ecologically demanding species that requires clear water of fast-flowing rivers for diving and foraging, and riverside cavities for nesting. Technical and logistical challenges have restricted sampling and research to few genetic studies so far. The genetic results consistently revealed a low genetic diversity and high inbreeding in the species. Besides, the lack of a reference genome has precluded deeper evolutionary and conservation genetic analyses for the species. We generated the first high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly for Mergus octosetaceus using PacBio HiFi long reads and Arima Hi-C data from a female specimen. The assembly is 1.25 Gb in length, is highly complete, scoring 98.9% of BUSCO completeness, and includes both sex chromosomes (Z and W). Annotated repetitive elements comprise 18.94% of the genome, with evidence of recent activity, particularly among LINEs and LTRs retrotransposons. We also produced and annotated the complete mitochondrial genome, identifying 37 genes and the control region. Comparative synteny analysis with other Anatidae species revealed strong chromosomal conservation, with several inversion events in macrochromosomes. Demographic history reconstruction indicated fluctuations in effective population size, with significant reductions overlapped by major temperature changes, highlighting potential climate sensitivity of this lineage. This reference genome provides a fundamental resource for M. octosetaceus, enabling insights into genome evolution, chromosomal dynamics within Anatidae, and past population history.

Coating with 30 kDa PLL enhanced antibody loading efficiency by modulating membrane permeability and reduced vesicle surface charge, facilitating endocytic uptake while preserving antibody activity. The resulting polymersomes exhibited no detectable cytotoxicity and enabled efficient aerosol-based pulmonary delivery to lung epithelial cells in vitro.

To address these limitations, we develop KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility, KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and biomarker-based subgroup analyses.

The multi-subunit initiation factor eIF3 plays central roles in PIC assembly, stabilization, and scanning. Within eIF3c, residues 166-266 lie immediately N-terminal of the folded PINT/PCI domain and encompass the reported eIF1-binding site in human eIF3c. This segment is not visible in PIC Cryo-EM structures, except for a small helix contacting eIF1, and is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Here we report the near-complete backbone and partial side-chain NMR assignments for the eIF3c 166-266 fragment in solution. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is consistent with an intrinsically disordered protein region. Several amide resonances were broadened at 25{degrees}C but recovered at 5{degrees}C. Secondary structure propensities derived from chemical shift index (CSI) analysis, together with amide 1H chemical shift temperature coefficients (CSTCs), confirm that the protein is disordered, while the CSI analysis also indicates the presence of short segments with modest -helical or {beta}-strand propensity. Three conserved FLKK motifs fall at junctions of these transient structural elements, with Motif 3 located in the subsegment showing slightly greater propensity for transient structure.

To address these challenges, we developed and integrated a semi-automatic sEEG contact localization and labeling pipeline within Brainstorm, an open-source software platform for multimodal brain imaging analysis, widely adopted in the neuroscience community with over 50,000 registered users and an active online user forum. The software has been supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for over two decades. The pipeline presented in this paper performs three key steps: (1) import and apply rigid co-registration of post-implantation Computed Tomography (CT) or post-CT with pre-implantation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (pre-MRI), (2) post-CT image segmentation and semi-automatic detection of sEEG contacts using GARDEL, which has been integrated as a Brainstorm plugin, and (3) automatic anatomical labeling of contacts using standard and commonly used brain anatomy templates and atlases. Integrating this pipeline into Brainstorm brings the best of both worlds: GARDEL's automation and Brainstorm's multimodal data compatibility, and rich library of visualization and advanced analysis tools at both sensor and source level.

Vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) are often observed to play a role in the epithelial cells located at the margins of 2D cultures. However, their role in 3D collective cell behavior remains underexplored. Here, we investigate how induced vimentin expression affects 3D multicellular architecture and mechanics in luminal breast cancer cells (MCF-7) that ordinarily express keratin intermediate filaments only. We find that vimentin expression significantly alters 3D cell cluster morphology, inducing protrusions and increasing boundary fluctuations. Furthermore, cells in vimentin-expressing clusters show enhanced, more stochastic migration. In addition, these clusters exert stronger and localized traction forces on the surrounding matrix, indicating increased cell-matrix interactions. Transcriptomic analysis corroborates these biophysical findings, revealing upregulated gene expression for cell migration and matrix adhesion, and downregulated cell-cell adhesion genes. Our results demonstrate that VIFs are critical in modulating 3D multicellular collective morphology and dynamics, promoting invasive-like behavior by enhancing cell migration and cell-matrix interactions.

In this study, we investigate the optimal CRISPR memory size by combining steady-state immune models with dynamical antigenic traveling wave theory to obtain both analytic and numerical results of coevolutionary dynamics. We focus on two experimentally supported phenomena that shape immune dynamics: primed acquisition, where partial spacer-protospacer matches boost acquisition rates, and memory size fluctuations, where a short-term increase in memory size drives population dynamics. We find that under primed acquisition, longer optimal arrays benefit from maintaining multiple, partially matching spacers. In contrast, dynamic memory fluctuations favor shorter arrays by amplifying the fitness advantage of acquiring a few highly effective new spacers. Together, our results highlight that memory optimality is not fixed, but instead shaped by the interaction of acquisition dynamics and population-level immune pressures.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Rapid screening of MP-1 mutants in a combined approach using model membrane and cell-based biological assays, has led to the identification of a number of derivative peptides with enhanced selectivity for cancer-like membrane models and breast cancer cell lines and provided insights into the mechanism of membrane disruption and cell death.

Using parasite-purified tubulin, we determined structures of P. falciparum microtubules by cryo-electron microscopy. Parasite-specific sequences change the tubulin dimer structure, thereby modifying drug susceptibility and polymer mechanical properties. Within the P. falciparum microtubule, lateral contacts are smaller but stronger, and the lattice is stiffer than in mammalian microtubules.

Our approach employs the 3D interaction (3Di) alphabet to convert local residue geometries into compact, 20-state discrete representations. Using ProstT5, we enable bidirectional translation between amino acid sequences and 3Di representations, facilitating sensitive homology detection and structure-guided sequence generation. We construct a latent sequence landscape by combining 3Di-based alignments with direct coupling analysis (DCA) and variational autoencoders (VAE), unifying tasks such as clustering, annotation, and design. This integrative framework enhances the detection of coevolutionary signals and enables rational sampling of structural variants, even without functional labels. We demonstrate the utility of our method across diverse protein families, including globins, kinases, and malate dehydrogenases, achieving improved contact prediction, homology inference, and sequence generation.

Here, we detect hallmarks of these misfolded states across hundreds of proteins by integrating E. coli proteome-wide limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry with structural datasets of protein native structures. Proteins containing native NCLEs are twice as likely to misfold, predominantly in regions where these NCLEs naturally occur. Surprisingly, the chaperones DnaK and GroEL do not typically correct this misfolding, except in the case of essential proteins. Statistical analysis links this differential rescue activity to weaker loop-closing contacts in the NCLEs of essential proteins, suggesting misfolding involving these loops is easier to rectify by chaperones. Molecular simulations indicate a mechanism where premature NCLE loop closure, prior to proper placement of the threading segment, leads to persistent misfolded states. This mechanism explains why, in the mass spectrometry data, proteins with NCLEs are more likely to misfold and misfold in NCLE regions. These results suggest widespread NCLE misfolding, that such misfolded states in non-essential proteins can bypass the refolding action of chaperones, and that some protein sequences may have evolved to allow chaperone rescue from this class of misfolding.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

However, the performance for folded RNA structures was not specifically explored. In this study, we present a benchmark of the OPC water model on three different RNAs with highly intricate tertiary structures - the ribosomal L1 stalk RNA-protein protuberance, the mini tetraloop-tetraloop receptor (miniTTR-6) folded RNA, and the GAAA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor homodimer. We compare the OPC performance against SPC/E, TIP3P, OPC3, and TIP4P-EW along with the common OL3 AMBER RNA force field (FF). We found substantial effect of the water model on simulation behavior. For all three systems, we observe large-scale unfolding of the RNA, and even loss of the L1 stalk protein-RNA interface, when simulated with the OPC. In contrast, the simulations are entirely stable with the three-point water models. The underlying cause seems to be the higher affinity of the OPC waters to H-bond donor and acceptor groups of the RNA, disrupting the native solute-solute interactions. An identical issue can be observed also for the similar and widely used TIP4PD water model combined with the DES-Amber RNA FF. Our findings suggest that caution is warranted when using the four-point OPC and TIP4PD water models for simulations of structured RNAs.

In this work, we develop a general mathematical framework based on the linear noise approximation (LNA) to quantify intrinsic fluctuations around the mean expression levels in a single-cell GRN motif with nonlinear cooperative regulatory couplings. The genetic toggle switch (TS) and TS coupled with positive autoregulation, as illustrative examples, exhibit both continuous and discontinuous transitions (bifurcation) between low- and high-expression states driven by nonlinear regulation. We demonstrate that LNA captures both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We find that the LNA performs well in capturing the inherent stochasticity in both monostable and bistable regimes. Still, deviations arise near bifurcation points: fluctuations are enhanced near criticality in continuous transitions, while finite-size effects dominate discontinuous transitions, analogous to critical phenomena in statistical physics.

F.", "abstract": "A sampling-based method that can identify stable (replicable) clusterings of cells for data presented as UMI counts is described. The structure of the processing pipeline is conventional: filter and transform counts, restrict to data for highly variable genes, reduce dimensionality, and cluster cells. Divisive (binary) hierarchical spectral clustering is used. We propose what may be a novel method to map a clustering tree to a set of nested clusterings. For spectral clustering, non-zero affinities are defined for points that are k-nearest neighbors (k is an input parameter). The affinity equals the inverse of the distance between the points. This led to exploration of the variation of the distance between points (that represent cells in low-dimensional Euclidean space) that are k-nearest neighbors. Variation can be large, ranging over three orders of magnitude for one data set studied. This may have implications for other clustering schemes. Given a set of points, Ng, Jordan, and Weiss' algorithm is used to divide it into two clusters. Repeating for each daughter cluster and its descendants generates a clustering tree. Because the algorithm splits a set of points into two subsets, the points are mapped to two-dimensional Euclidean space for clustering. The clusters' separation is measured by a quantity, H, calculated in two dimensions, which is formally identical to the F-statistic, equal to the between-cluster sum of squares divided by the within-cluster sum of squares, scaled by degrees of freedom. The larger H is, the greater the separation between the clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a node of the clustering tree. Dividing a set of points into two subsets corresponds to defining two daughter nodes. Assign the length of the branch between a node and each of its daughters to equal 1/H. That is, the larger the separation between the daughter clusters, the closer they are (viewed as nodes) to their parent node in the tree. Nodes' distances from the root define the mapping of the tree to a set of nested clusterings. Analysis is performed for all cells and for multiple pairs of complementary samples of cells. For a given number of clusters, each sample's clustering and clusters are compared to those of the full data set (restricted to the sample). If differences are small for all samples, the clustering may be considered stable. The method supports single-factor batch correction.

Sixty-two Indonesian highly trained junior badminton players were tested over two sessions for body height, weight, fat mass, and body mass index (BMI), as well as balance, reaction time, hand grip strength, counter movement jump height, linear and non-linear sprint times, and anaerobic sprint and multistage fitness test performances. Traditional (one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests) and alternative statistical approaches (magnitude-based inferences) as well as effect size (ES) calculations were applied for statistical analysis. Regarding age-related differences, in males, U17 players had a statistically significant and most likely higher BMI (p = 0.001; ES = very large), as well as statistically significant and most likely superior CMJ height, linear sprint performance, fatigue index, and relative peak power than the U13 players (p [&le;] 0.003; ES = large to very large). In females, U17 players had a statistically significant and most likely higher BMI and body fat mass (p [&le;] 0.002; ES = large to very large), as well as statistically significant and very likely inferior non-linear sprint performance and relative peak power than the U13 players (p [&le;] 0.005; ES = large).

However, the molecular determinants governing tumor cell susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity remain incompletely understood. Here we employed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screening to systematically identify cancer cell surface regulators of NK cell killing across multiple cancer types. Using a comprehensive surfaceome-focused library, we screened human and murine cancer cell lines co-cultured with NK cells, identifying both known and novel ligands that modulate NK cell cytotoxicity. Our screens revealed established factors including CD43 (encoded by SPN), while uncovering previously uncharacterized regulators such as CD44, PDPN, and Siglec-1/CD169. Validation through complementary cDNA overexpression and genetic knockout approaches confirmed that disruption of CD43, CD44, PDPN, and Siglec-1 significantly altered cancer cell susceptibility to NK killing both in vitro and in humanized mouse models. Analysis of clinical datasets show that expression of identified factors correlates with patient survival outcomes in an NK-context dependent manner supporting their therapeutic relevance. Most notably, our mechanistic studies demonstrate that CD43-mediated NK cell resistance operates independently of its previously proposed interaction with Siglec-7 on NK cells. Furthermore, we find that targeting CD43 on either NK cells or engineered T cells substantially enhances their cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines. These results establish gain-of-function screening as a powerful approach for discovering immunoregulatory surface proteins and identify multiple promising targets for enhancing NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using the IR Biotyper(R) emerges as a rapid and accessible typing alternative. This study evaluated the performance of the IR Biotyper(R) in discriminating P. diazotrophicus outbreak isolates, compared to cgMLST. Eight epidemiologically relevant isolates, including two from a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) outbreak and four from a hemodialysis clinic, along with two outliers, were analyzed. Its identification was confirmed by API20E, MALDI-TOF MS, nifL gene qPCR, and WGS. Both cgMLST, based on 7,755 conserved genes, and the FT-IR. Spectroscopy by IR Biotyper(R) were used for clonal typing, with the spectral cutoff empirically determined based on known clonal isolates. Both methodologies demonstrated remarkable agreement in detecting clonal clusters. The two TPN outbreak isolates showed 23 allele differences (ADs) by cgMLST and consistently clustered according to the IR Biotyper. Similarly, the four isolates from the outbreak at hemodialysis clinic formed homogeneous clusters by both methods (5-27 ADs by cgMLST). The outlier isolates were consistently discriminated. FT-IR spectroscopy (IR Biotyper(R)) proved promising and complementary to cgMLST for typing P. diazotrophicus in outbreak scenarios, offering a rapid and cost-effective alternative for detecting clonal events.

In this study, MPs have been determined in genetic soil horizons to a maximum depth of 140 cm along four transects that encompass various land uses (managed and unmanaged) in Fars Province, southwest Iran. Soils have also been characterised in terms of texture and chemistry using established methods. With little contemporary or historical application through agricultural practices, MPs were dominated by fibres of various colours and sizes and polymeric construction (mainly polyamides, polyesters and polyolefins), with remaining particles largely consisting of sheet-like fragments. MP abundance (up to about 200 per kg of dry soil) and size were heterogeneously distributed throughout the region and with respect to soil depth, regardless of land use, with inverse correlations with soil particle size observed at two locations. We infer that atmospheric deposition is the principal source at the soil surface and that MPs that evade erosion are able to readily migrate downwards to depths extending to at least that of the lowest horizon sampled. Migration appears to be independent of particle size or density and is likely driven by percolating precipitation but facilitated through bioturbation and soil cracking during dry periods. The persistence and vertical migration of MPs in soils may have adverse impacts on subterranean ecosystems and ground water quality.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in ~200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development.

Clonal dynamics revealed that persister subpopulations first responded to treatment but persisted and expanded during minimal residual disease, ultimately leading to tumor recurrence. Pre-treatment melanoma populations diversified into four conserved persister states characterized by stress-like, lipid metabolism, PI3K signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling programs associated with adaptive resistance. Spatial transcriptomics showed the organization of these adaptive programs and a complex signaling network of autocrine and paracrine interactions among persister subpopulations.

Whether such optimization of energy expenditure also governs standing balance remains unclear because its energetic cost has not been systematically quantified across a range of natural postures. Moreover, because standing is often the resting state from which most walking begins, the optimization of posture may also reflect the energetic demands of initiating gait. In this study, we use a combination of indirect calorimetry and musculoskeletal simulations to characterize the energetic cost of standing and gait initiation across natural standing postures and investigate whether humans optimize energy expenditure under these conditions. In Experiment 1 (N = 13), we measured metabolic cost at preferred and six different prescribed whole-body orientations. Energy expenditure was lowest at a slight anterior orientation (1.15{degrees}) and increased monotonically with whole-body angle, rising twice as fast posteriorly compared to anteriorly. This asymmetry challenges the common modeling simplification that effort is symmetric and linear or quadratic with lean angle. Furthermore, participants preferred body orientations (1.50 {+/-} 0.73{degrees}) with similar energy expenditure to the minimum-cost orientation but with significantly more postural variability, suggesting that strict postural regulation was not necessary for energy-optimal control. In Experiment 2 (N = 20), participants initiated forward and backward walking from preferred or prescribed lean orientations. Participants did not alter their standing posture before expected gait initiations in the forward or backward direction, consistent with musculoskeletal simulations showing that leaning further in the anticipated direction did not significantly improve gait initiation time or energetic costs. Together, these findings suggest that postural strategies optimize energy efficiency when permitted by the demands of movement readiness. Our study quantifies the energetic cost landscape that governs human postural control, challenges widely used inverted pendulum estimations of this cost, and offers an empirical foundation for developing more accurate simulations of posture and energy expenditure.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Lipoxin B4 (LXB4), an endogenous lipid mediator produced by retinal astrocytes, has been shown to suppress glial reactivity and directly protect RGCs. This study investigated whether LXB4 modulates TRPV4-driven M&uumlller glial activation and inflammation and whether M&uumlller glia themselves contribute to this retinal lipoxin pathway. Methods: Ocular hypertension (OHT) was induced in mice via a silicone oil model, and reactive M&uumlller glia were isolated via magnetic sorting for transcriptomic analysis. In vitro, primary and immortalized M&uumlller glia were treated with a TRPV4 agonist with or without LXB4. Glial reactivity was assessed by flow cytometry, immunostaining, qPCR, and western blotting. LC--MS/MS-based lipidomics was used to quantify lipoxin pathway metabolites, and single-cell RNA-seq was used to examine transcriptional responses to LXB4 treatment. GFAP and TRPV4 expression was evaluated via immunohistochemistry in retinal sections. Results: RNA bulk sequencing analysis and qPCR revealed that M&uumlller glia express both 5- and 15-lipoxygenase. Lipidomic analysis confirmed that the lipoxin pathway is functional and that M&uumlller glia endogenously produce LXB4, establishing this essential cell type as a source of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective LXB4 in the retina. TRPV4 activation induced a reactive glial phenotype characterized by increased GFAP and IL6 expression, increased STAT3 phosphorylation, and increased production of lipoxins, suggesting that biomechanical stress simultaneously triggers both gliosis and protective lipid signaling. Treatment with LXB4 suppressed TRPV4-induced gliosis in vitro by downregulating IL6 and inhibiting STAT3 activation, and in vivo by reducing the expression of Stat3, Il6, and TNF during OHT while attenuating TRPV4 upregulation in M&uumlller glia. Conclusion: M&uumlller glia are a significant source of LXB4 in the retina. This neuroprotective M&uumlller glia pathway is amplified during chronic TRPV4 activation to counter-regulate gliosis. The findings support targeting of the TRPV4-lipoxin pathway as a potential approach to protect against OHT-induced neurodegeneration in glaucoma.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Here, by testing hedgehog orthologs of known coronavirus receptors, we identify hedgehog aminopeptidase N (APN) as a functional receptor for EriCoVs. Analysis of 94 APN orthologs indicates that EriCoVs have a limited host range, primarily utilizing hedgehog APN and, to a lesser extent, APN from certain felids, shaped by specific determinants at the virus-receptor interface. Cryo-EM reveals an APN-binding mode distinct from those used by alpha- and deltacoronaviruses. Functional assays indicate that hedgehog transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) enhances spike activation and promotes pseudovirus entry. Neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD and APN were developed and could effectively block EriCoV pseudovirus entry and propagation.

Here, we investigated the role of Anthrax Toxin Receptor 2 (ANTXR2/CMG2), a receptor that controls the turnover of COL6, in skeletal muscle. We show that ANTXR2 is mostly expressed by fibro-adipogenic precursors and that its deficiency in ANTXR2 null (Antxr2-/-) mice leads to a premature and irregular COL6 accumulation in intramuscular connective tissue. This results in tissue stiffening and gradual, non-functional muscle hypertrophy, marked by impaired locomotion and myopathic signs.

However, maltose consumption varies naturally among Saccharomyces eubayanus strains isolated from different host trees, such as Quercus and Nothofagus. To identify the genetic determinants underlying these phenotypic differences, we performed bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using an F2 offspring derived from QC18 (Quercus-associated) and CL467.1 (Nothofagus-associated) strains. QTL mapping identified two significant genomic regions on subtelomeric loci of chromosomes V-R and XVI-L, each containing complete MAL loci composed of MAL32 (encoding maltase), MAL31 (transporter), and MAL33 (transcriptional activator) genes. Comparative polymorphism analyses identified mutations in MAL32 and MAL33 of QC18, including frameshift mutations resulting in premature stop codons. Functional validation demonstrated that the heterologous expression of MAL33ChrV from CL467.1 fully restored maltose utilization in QC18, indicating the functional presence of MAL33 cis-regulatory sequences and MAL32 and MAL31 genes in QC18. While structural protein predictions identified truncation and impaired functionality in the maltose-responsive activation domain of Mal33p from QC18, overexpression of QC18's own MAL33ChrV allele also improved maltose metabolism, suggesting dosage-dependent transcriptional limitations rather than complete functional loss. These results indicate that allelic variations in the maltose-responsive activation domain of Mal33p lead to differences in maltose consumption between strains. We hypothesized that reduced maltose metabolism in QC18 is an adaptive response to the distinct sugar composition in Quercus robur bark, contrasting with the starch-rich environment of Nothofagus pumilio. These findings highlight subtelomeric MAL gene diversity as a reservoir of evolutionary plasticity, representing a key evolutionary mechanism that influences maltose adaptation among natural Saccharomyces isolates.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Although \"correlation does not imply causation\" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are frequently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation. Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI: (1) How reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony? (2) What are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations? (3) To what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions? We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

However, conventional mRNA cancer vaccines are limited by the low immunogenicity of tumor-associated and neoantigens. We addressed this limitation by formulating a modular, liposome-based mRNA cocktail comprising three distinct mRNAs encoding tumor antigens, the co-stimulatory molecule CD80, and membrane-tethered IL-2. Administration of this mRNA mixture transforms somatic cells into designer antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vivo, that simultaneously express the antigen, a co-stimulatory molecule, and a cytokine. These designer APCs activated tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells more effectively than mRNA encoding the antigen alone and elicited robust anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, substituting IL-2 in the mRNA mixtures with membrane-tethered IL-12 led to the expansion and differentiation of endogenous antigen-specific Th1 helper T cells in vivo. Importantly, this platform activated NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T cells in both human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) in vitro and in HLA-A*02:01-transgenic mice, highlighting its translational potential.

Two major types of adipose tissue (AT) can be distinguished that differ substantially in their physiological function and vascularization: white AT (WAT), which is the major energy storage and brown AT (BAT), which is highly vascularized and dissipates energy [1-5]. While ECs from these depots likely contribute to adipose function, their characterization has been hindered by technical limitations in isolation and culture. Here, we establish a protocol for isolating and expanding ECs from murine BAT and WAT, enabling transcriptomic and functional analyses across depots. We demonstrate that freshly isolated BAT-ECs express depot-specific gene signatures, including Rgcc, Cdkn1c, Tcf15, Meox2, and Efnb1, several of which are dynamically regulated during cold-induced BAT activation. These findings reveal novel BAT-EC markers and highlight specialized endothelial programs that may support thermogenesis. However, we also uncover that culturing BAT-ECs profoundly remodels EC identity. Transcriptomic profiling shows that BAT-ECs rapidly downregulate BAT-specific markers and acquire features resembling WAT- and lymphatic ECs. This dedifferentiation is accompanied by signatures of proliferation, adhesion remodeling, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While these changes present challenges for maintaining depot-specific identity in culture, they also provide a framework to better interpret experimental outcomes and to investigate EC plasticity. Taken together, our study delivers a novel isolation and culture protocol for adipose ECs, defines BAT-EC markers, and demonstrates how culture conditions reshape their identity.

In this study, we examine the dynamics of cell division during larval growth and metamorphosis in the larvae and early juveniles of the phoronid Phoronopsis harmeri, using EdU incorporation, anti-phospho-histone H3 immunostaining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and electron microscopy. Early larval development is characterized by widespread proliferative activity across ectodermal and mesodermal tissues, which becomes progressively compartmentalized as the larva matures. Two structured ring-shaped posterior proliferative zones, pre- and post-telotrochal, emerge within the telotroch and persist through metamorphosis, supporting both larval elongation and the juvenile development of ascending gut branch. In contrast, the metasomal sac and future adult trunk epidermis expand via broadly distributed epithelial proliferation, without forming a localized growth zone. This suggests that P. harmeri combines conserved features, such as a posterior growth zone, with lineage-specific innovations in regional growth. In addition, we identify atypical mitotic characteristics in this species, including unconventional metaphase organization and signs of interkinetic nuclear migration in larval epithelia.

However, the effects of disrupted circadian rhythms on bone remodeling remain largely unknown. Here, we show that one of the core circadian regulators PER1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis by upregulating genes involved in inflammation. The conditional knockout of Per1 in osteoclasts and related cells resulted in decreased bone mass in the femurs of mice, along with increased osteoclasts and decreased osteoblasts. Osteoclastogenesis was also promoted by Per1 depletion in vitro with 17 downregulated inflammatory genes. Eight of these genes were known to promote or inhibit osteoclastogenesis depending on the stage of osteoclastogenesis and the presence or absence of infection. The knockdown of three of these genes, which were involved in the inflammasome pathway, promoted osteoclastogenesis, mirroring the effects of Per1 knockout and offering a mechanistic explanation for the Per1-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. These results were not observed following the depletion of a paralog Per2. Per1 knockout mice maintain general circadian rhythms, unlike arrhythmic Per1/Per2 double knockout mice. This gives credence to Per1 as a selective target for therapeutic interventions without disrupting the circadian rhythms.

Emerging evidence suggests that mechanical forces act alongside molecular signals to orchestrate tissue patterning, yet how these diverse inputs are integrated remains poorly understood. The zebrafish posterior lateral line offers a powerful in vivo model for studying how cellular behaviors and mechanosensitive signaling are spatiotemporally coordinated during organogenesis. Here, we identify the transcription factor Sox2 as a key regulator of lateral line morphogenesis, influencing the positioning, size, and number of neuromasts, the sensory organs of the lateral line. Loss of Sox2 leads to increased lateral line primordium cell proliferation, disrupted rosette assembly, and smaller neuromasts positioned more posteriorly along the body axis, while Sox2 overexpression produces opposite phenotypes. Sox2 functions in part by repressing Yap/Taz signaling in the primordium. Reduced Yap/Taz activity results in more anterior neuromast deposition and premature termination of primordium migration. Furthermore, we show that as the primordium expands through cell-proliferation, increased cell-junction tension activates Yap/Taz, thereby influencing lateral line development. Reducing overproliferation in sox2-/- embryos diminishes the elevated Yap/Taz activity, supporting a model in which Sox2 limits proliferation to suppress Yap/Taz signaling and ensure proper primordium morphogenesis.

Compositional data analysis was employed to explore associations among the three movement behaviors. Results: (1) The relative distribution of 24-h MBs was significantly associated with inhibition, shifting, and updating (all p < 0.001), with a model explanatory power > 10%. The explanatory power was the highest for inhibition (16.3%).

Mechanistically, these tumor cells mimic the stem cell niche by secreting the BMP ligands Dpp and Gbb, but at reduced levels, resulting in moderate BMP signaling activation in adjacent GSCs. Such BMP signaling activation is sufficient to repress bam transcription, thereby blocking GSC differentiation.

The Drosophila bipectinata species complex (D. bipectinata, D. malerkotliana, D. parabipectinata, and D. pseudoananassae) provides a valuable system to study the speciation paradigm, since, all the twelve F1 hybrid males are sterile, the precise stage of spermatogenic failure differs among crosses. Here, we integrate cytological, transcriptional, and regulatory sequence analyses to examine the basis of sterility in this sub-complex. Cytological assays revealed that hybrid testes exhibit developmental arrest at different spermatogenesis stages, covering from reduced primary spermatocytes to absence of individualized sperm. Quantitative RT-PCR of seven spermatogenesis genes--aly, bam, sa, dj, topi, can, and Mst98Ca--showed significant downregulation among hybrid males relative to parental species, linking transcriptional misregulation with observed phenotypic defects in spermatogenesis. To test whether regulatory divergence underlies this misexpression, we analyzed ~1-2 kb promoter regions of five genes (aly, bam, sa, dj, and topi). Motif scans using FIMO identified several lineage-specific turnover of transcription factor binding sites, also PWM-delta analysis revealed substantial interspecific differences in predicted binding strength for many key testis transcription factors. These results demonstrate that HMS in the D. bipectinata complex is consistently associated with spermatogenic arrest and misregulation of genes essential for germline proliferation, meiotic progression, and spermiogenesis. The concordance between expression changes and promoter divergence supports a role for cis-regulatory evolution in hybrid dysfunction, while also leaving open the contribution of trans-acting factors.

In bats, which are natural reservoirs for diverse viruses, several ISGs exhibit lineage-specific evolutionary adaptations, reflecting unique immune strategies. While previous research has typically focused on individual ISGs or broad-scale genomic analyses, here, we conducted an evolutionary analysis of type I IFN-upregulated genes across diverse bat species to elucidate the forces shaping the full repertoire of their ISG responses. Our results reveal that key components of bats antiviral signaling, including viral dsRNA sensors, PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation enzymes, and cytokine/chemokine signaling molecules, have been recurrent targets of strong positive selection. Notably, immune sensors such as TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 show adaptive changes in their RNA-binding domains, suggesting modified viral recognition. Members of the PARP family exhibit repeated selection in both macro and catalytic domains, consistent with intense host - virus conflict and immune modulation. Strikingly, chemokine genes - especially CXCL10 and CXCL16 - and their receptors display some of the strongest and most 26 concerted selection signatures, particularly in ligand-binding loops, consistent with arms-race coevolution potentially driven by viral mimicry. Several positively selected genes have pleiotropic functions in tissue repair, inflammation, and tumor control, suggesting that some of these adaptations may influence several physiological pathways. Altogether, our findings uncover a bat-specific antiviral architecture shaped by concerted adaptive evolution, highlighting a balance between viral control and immune tolerance, likely underlying bats' exceptional resilience to disease.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Understanding genomic adaptations during antimicrobial therapy in patients infected with this pathogen is crucial for preventing therapeutic failure. Here we investigated the population diversity and evolution of P. aeruginosa collected longitudinally from six patients who evolved MDR infections. Serial P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (n=63) and culture-enriched metagenomic populations (n=39) were collected and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The resulting data were used to characterize and compare the species composition, multi-locus sequence types (STs), and resistance-associated mutations present within each sample type. Single-isolate sequencing showed that each patient was infected with a single P. aeruginosa strain that accumulated mutations and became increasingly antibiotic-resistant over time. Mutations in genes associated with {beta}-lactam resistance, including ampC, ftsI, and oprD, arose over time and corresponded with changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in single isolates. Species profiling of culture-enriched metagenomic populations revealed that all samples contained P. aeruginosa, but several also contained additional Gram-negative pathogens. Metagenomic analysis of culture-enriched populations identified resistance-associated mutations at variable frequencies, many of which were not identified in single isolates from the same sample. In some cases, resistance-associated mutations initially detected at low frequency rose to fixation after antimicrobial treatment. Overall, this study shows that population-based metagenomic sequencing effectively captures within-patient genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa during antimicrobial therapy, and could aid in the detection and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations in this pathogen.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

S.; Bacquet, C. N.; Montgomery, S. H.; Keller, A.; Merrill, R. M.", "abstract": "Sexual dimorphism in foraging behaviour is widespread in insects and may arise from differences in nutritional demands, sensory systems, or cognition. In Heliconius, pollen-feeding is an evolutionary innovation among butterflies that supports extended lifespans and sustained reproduction. However, how foraging behaviour varies between the sexes and how it relates to sexually dimorphic traits remains poorly understood. We investigated sex-specific foraging strategies in wild Heliconius himera, a highland specialist from southern Ecuador, using field surveys and DNA metabarcoding. Females carried more pollen than males, consistent with higher nutritional demands. Yet both sexes used similar plant richness and composition, indicating that differences reflect foraging effort rather than shifts in plant choice. Gut samples revealed greater pollen diversity and a more consistent community profile than proboscis samples, suggesting they better capture cumulative foraging history. To place these behavioural differences in a sensory context, we quantified sexually dimorphic sensory traits. Males had larger eyes and more ommatidia, whereas females had larger mushroom bodies, brain regions that support associative learning and memory. These patterns are consistent with sexual dimorphism reported across Heliconius and may contribute to the observed sex differences in pollen foraging. Our findings highlight how sex-specific foraging differences may arise from effort on shared floral resources and co-occur with divergent sensory and neural investment, offering insights into the ecological basis of intraspecific variation in pollen use.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

While many studies suggest that decisions and movements follow common economic principles and can be jointly regulated to maximize reward rate, recent findings indicate that these two processes can also be decoupled or modulated in compensatory ways. This variability raises the question of whether decision-action coordination reflects an optimal strategy aimed at maximizing reward rate, or rather a flexible but suboptimal adaptation to contextual constraints. To address this issue, we trained three macaque monkeys to perform a reaching-based foraging task. The observed adjustments in decision-action coordination of the three monkeys are consistent with the pursuit of a strategy that approximates the theoretical optimum of reward intake rate at the single trial level. The present findings indicate, both behaviorally and theoretically, that coordination between decision and movement is required to optimize behavior in economic terms.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Intellectual disability (ID), which has diverse causes, including Cereblon (CRBN), impairs duration discrimination. CRBN-related ID, link to abnormal cognitive behaviors, may disrupt both perception and behavior during duration discrimination. However, cross-species behavioral strategies, their variation with ID, and associated behavioral indices remain unclear. Here, humans and wild-type (WT) mice with typical intelligence, and CRBN knockout (KO) mice with ID, performed an auditory duration discrimination task with Long (10 s) and Short (2 s) cues. All groups distinguished stimulus durations, but latency-based strategies diverged. KO mice showed impulsivity and divergent responses at both individual and group levels, whereas WT mice and humans consistently delayed their responses by ~2 s to the Short cue length, reflecting inhibition and convergent responses. In typical intelligence models, latencies for both stimuli clustered between 2--5 s, while in ID model depended on stimulus duration. Duration perception is a conserved cross-species capacity, while task-specific cognitive strategies are intrinsically preserved though variation emerges with ID. We suggest that latency indices dissociated inhibition from impulsivity, and convergence from divergence. We further suggest that CRBN-related ID preserves perceptual understanding but disrupts the shared behavioral language of typical intelligence.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

While ab3A and ab10A exhibit tuning changes shared with the non-pest relative D. biarmipes, ab2B and ab4B display species-specific adaptations in D. suzukii. These changes result not only from receptor sequence divergence but also from novel innovations: receptor co-expression in ab3A and partitioned expression of Or67a paralogs in ab2B and ab10A.

Microglia metabolic flexibility enables rapid adaptation to environmental changes, yet the full extent of their metabolic capabilities and influence on neuronal metabolism remains unclear. While microglia predominantly rely on glucose oxidative metabolism under homeostatic conditions, they shift toward glycolysis upon proinflammatory activation. In this study, we investigated microglial metabolism and its impact on neuronal metabolic homeostasis using isotope tracing with stable carbon 13C-enriched substrates and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Primary microglia were incubated with 13C-labeled glucose, glutamine, or GABA in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to assess metabolic adaptations upon an inflammatory challenge. Additionally, neurons co-cultured with quiescent or activated microglia (either with LPS or amyloid-{beta}) were incubated with 13C-enriched glucose to examine microglia-neuron metabolic interactions. Our findings confirm that microglia readily metabolize glucose and glutamine, with LPS stimulation slightly changing the glycolytic activity, as indicated by subtle changes in extracellular lactate. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that microglia take up and metabolize the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, suggesting a novel metabolic function. Furthermore, microglial presence directly influences neuronal metabolism and neurotransmitter homeostasis, highlighting a previously unrecognized aspect of neuron-microglia metabolic crosstalk. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into microglial metabolism and its role in neuronal function, with implications for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases in which microglial metabolism is dysregulated.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

We also discovered developmental remodeling of the anterior circuit, which leads to the pruning of larval synapses, establishment of a second pathway that activates additional interneurons, and lateralization of the circuit.

Additionally, a data-driven machine learning algorithm was used to partition our sample into three groups who showed Delayed, Typical, and Advanced trajectories of language development. These groups reliably differed on several assessments of language ability during infancy and toddlerhood. Using a priori brain regions involved in adult language processing, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed broad age-related increases in functional synchrony and specialization throughout the infant language network. Additionally, the Delayed group showed several atypical patterns of functional connectivity with language regions. Importantly, the magnitude of connectivity differences consistently predicted later language scores at two-year outcome across several different language assessments.

These movements redirect the high-acuity region of the retina toward objects of interest, thus selecting information based on location. Here, we show that saccade amplitude provides a separate and complementary form of selection, effectively filtering visual information by spatial frequency rather than location. Specifically, a reduction in saccade amplitude attenuates post-saccadic visual sensitivity in an amplitude-dependent range of low spatial frequencies. This effect is highly robust, so that even minute changes in saccade size considerably affect visibility. We show that this phenomenon arises from the way the magnitude-dependent kinematic characteristics of saccades transform the visual world into a spatiotemporal flow: post-saccadic visibility closely follows theoretical predictions based on the spatial information that saccade transients convey within the temporal bandwidth of retinal sensitivity. Thus, saccades not only guide selection based on location, but also filter visual information based on content, actively shaping perception.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we conducted a large-scale fMRI study with 179 participants performing a variant of the two-step task. Using both cluster-defined subgroups and computational parameter estimates, we found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes model-based and model-free value signals differently depending on individual strategy use. Model-based value signals were strongly linked to the degree of model-based behavioral reliance, whereas model-free signals appeared regardless of model-free behavioral influence. Leveraging the large sample, we also addressed a longstanding debate about whether model-based knowledge is incorporated into reward prediction errors or if such signals are purely model-free. Surprisingly, ventral striatum prediction error activity was better explained by model-based computations, while a middle caudate error signal was more aligned with model-free learning. Moreover, individuals lacking both model-based behavior and model-based neural signals exhibited impaired state prediction errors, suggesting a difficulty in building or updating their internal model of the environment. These findings indicate that model-free signals are ubiquitous across individuals, even in those not behaviorally relying on model-free strategies, while model-based representations appear only in those individuals utilizing such a strategy at the behavioral level, the absence of which may depend in part on underlying difficulties in forming accurate model-based predictions.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The precise innervation patterns and response properties of SSNs are determined in part by specialized interactions with resident skin cells. One such interaction involves the preferential ensheathment of some SSNs by epidermal cells, an evolutionarily conserved intercellular interaction that regulates SSN morphogenesis and mechanical nociceptive sensitivity in Drosophila. The morphogenetic events during ensheathment resemble phagocytic engulfment, therefore we hypothesized that phagocytic receptors mediate molecular recognition of neurites to induce ensheathment. From a screen of epidermally expressed phagocytic receptors we found that the nimrod receptor gene Draper (Drpr) functions in epidermal cells to promote ensheathment. Endogenous Drpr accumulates at sites of epidermal ensheathment but not at epidermal contact sites with unensheathed neurites. Furthermore, overexpressing Drpr increased ensheathment selectively on neurons that are normally ensheathed, suggesting that molecular recognition by Drpr accounts for the specificity of ensheathment. Indeed, we found that an extracellular reporter for the Drpr ligand Phosphatidylserine (PS) accumulates at sites of ensheathment, and that preventing extracellular PS exposure by overexpressing the PS Flippase ATP8a blocked ensheathment. We additionally found that Orion, which encodes a chemokine-like protein that bridges Drpr-PS interactions, is required for sheath formation. Finally, we found that increasing ensheathment by overexpressing Drpr enhanced nociceptor sensitivity to mechanical stimulus. Altogether, these studies show that Drpr acts in epidermal cells to mediate molecular recognition events that drive ensheathment of neurites marked by extracellular PS.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

However, investigation of cortical and subcortical brain changes during this time have been limited by small sample size and have generally examined the brain at the level of predetermined regions of interest. The recently developed Fast Efficient Mixed-Effects Algorithm (FEMA) allows for increased computational speed using mixed-effects models applied at the voxel or vertex level, as well as across multiple regions of interest. Methods: We extended the existing FEMA framework to represent predictors using natural spline basis functions, enabling us to model nonlinear trajectories of brain structure as a function of age. We then applied this model to the The Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (22,651 observations from 10,521 unique subjects aged 9.00-17.77) to study the age-related trajectories of tabulated cortical and subcortical volumes, vertexwise cortical thickness and surface area, and voxelwise volume assessed using the Jacobian. Models are reported separately in males and females. Results: Global volume variables, including total subcortical gray matter volume, peaked near 13 years in females and 15 years in males. Vertexwise cortical surface area followed an inverted U-shaped curve, whereas vertexwise cortical thickness followed a monotonic decrease during the age range studied. Voxelwise imaging analysis revealed regional differences in age trajectories at the subregional level. Discussion: The results of this work replicate and extend prior findings related to adolescent brain development, and illustrate distinct spatiotemporal patterns of structural changes in subcortical regions.

Both modalities recapitulate major neuroanatomical divisions, yet the lipidome shows distinctive features: a pronounced white-gray asymmetry, a smooth neocortical rostrocaudal gradient, and limbic-specific lipid clusters absent in transcriptomic space. Using regression against gene-expression principal components and two null models (random and anatomy-aware), we define three data-driven classes of lipid-gene relationships: Synchronizers (10%) tightly coupled to gene programs, Anchors (67%) predictable at levels expected from gross anatomy and cell-type composition, and Drifters (23%) largely transcription-independent. A simple geometric framework unifies these patterns: after centering and normalization, molecular profiles lie on a hypersphere where two interpretable coordinates -- polar latitude relative to transcriptome-defined white/gray poles and nearest-gene angular distance -- jointly index coupling; an analytical null quantitatively explains the observed scaling.

FAM171 is a family of three type-I transmembrane domain cell surface proteins (FAM171A1, FAM171A2, and FAM171B) expressed in several human tissues and especially enriched in the brain. Recent findings suggest that FAM171A1 transduces signals between the cell surface and the cytoskeleton. Genetic evidence links FAM171A1 to multiple cancers and FAM171A2 to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. Despite multiple connections with severe human diseases, no information is currently available on their neuronal expression, their structure, or oligomerization. Here we show that, structurally, the monomeric ectodomains of human FAM171A1 and FAM171A2 has a new architecture with a novel combination of two domains. Furthermore, their ectodomains oligomerize to form an equilateral trimer. In addition, the ectodomain of FAM171A1 has the propensity to form larger trimer-trimer assemblies at high concentrations. In the adult mouse brain, Fam171a1 and Fam171a2 mRNAs are broadly distributed in the hippocampus, with predominant expression in excitatory neurons and additional expression in inhibitory neurons. At the protein level, mouse Fam171a1 and Fam171a2 are mainly localized to the hippocampal neuropil, suggesting localization to neuronal processes. Together, these results provide novel insights into the structure and oligomerization of the extracellular domain of FAM171A1 and FAM171A2, suggesting important roles in ligand binding and signaling.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Using a 96-well screening platform, and two rounds of re-screening, we tested a kinase inhibitor library and identified 5 compounds that protected HD ISPNs from mutant huntingtin (mHTT)-induced toxicity. Among these, we prioritized the PKC-/{beta}1 inhibitor GO6976, which rescued HD ISPNs from mHTT toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Further, we found increased phosphorylation of PKC- and PKC-{beta}1 in HD cells and tissues, while their overexpression was toxic to HD ISPNs. Knockdown of PKC-/{beta}1 protected the neurons, and both isoforms interacted and colocalized with HTT.

The nuclear receptor NR4A1 emerged as a key regulator within the inflammatory response of several immune diseases by regulating immune cell activation. In this study, we investigated the role of NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of brain resident and peripheral immune cells after cerebral ischemia. Here, we show that NR4A1 mediates an anti-inflammatory and damage-limiting effect after stroke. This effect is largely mediated by neutrophil recruitment and importantly, NR4A1 activation with its ligand Cytosporone B improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage. Modulation of NR4A1 is therefore a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of the nuclear receptor NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of peripheral and brain resident immune cells after cerebral ischemia and its consequences for stroke outcome. We demonstrate that NR4A1 ablation augments neutrophil activation and CNS recruitment within days after stroke thereby increasing infarct size, CNS inflammation, neuronal damage and deteriorating functional outcome. This effect is mediated via modulation of cell-intrinsic neutrophil function and maturation as illustrated by neutrophil-specific NR4A1 ablation and mixed bone-marrow chimera experiments. Notably, the NR4A1 agonist Cytosporone B reduced CNS neutrophil infiltration, infarct size and functional outcome after stroke in a bicentric preclinical stroke trial, demonstrating that NR4A1-mediated control of neutrophil reactivity is amenable to pharmacological modulation. In humans, NR4A1 expressing neutrophils are present in the peripheral blood of stroke patients and neutrophil NR4A1 expression correlates with improved long-term outcome after 3 months. Furthermore, NR4A1 expression in brain parenchyma neutrophils is negatively correlated with neuronal cell loss, illustrating a role of NR4A1 in regulating neutrophil mediated neuronal cell death in human stroke. Together our data reveal the nuclear factor NR4A1 as a brake of intrinsic neutrophil activity controlling neutrophil-mediated brain inflammation and neurotoxicity in stroke which may serve as a novel therapeutic target to limit inflammation-associated augmentation of ischemic damage after stroke.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a hub for stress processing and receives dense noradrenergic innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary noradrenergic nucleus in the brain. The relationship between LC activity and cognitive/behavioral function during fear conditioning has been described as an inverted U, in which moderate LC activity, and subsequent NE release, is required for adaptive coping to threats, while hyperactive LC-NE signaling drives maladaptive behavioral responses. We used fiber photometry to measure NE signaling in the mouse BLA during acute behavioral responses to escapable and inescapable stressors, and then used an optogenetic approach to stimulate the noradrenergic terminals in the BLA at different frequencies to evaluate effects on coping behavior and cFos expression in the LC-BLA circuit. We found that low-frequency stimulation of the circuit inhibited both passive coping and BLA neuronal activity, while high-frequency stimulation had the opposite effect; the behavioral effects were not mediated by sex, but the cFos effects were specific to males. This study represents an expansion of the inverted U framework to encompass LC-BLA signaling driving acute behavioral responses to stress.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The newly developed App Knock-in models address many of these limitations. Here, we provide the first in-depth characterization of hippocampal cell populations and AHN across different ages in the novel AppSAAKnock-in (AppKI) mouse model. Our findings reveal that AppKI mice show no early deficits in excitatory dentate granule cells or inhibitory interneurons at 2 and 4 months, but significant loss of both populations emerges by 6 months of age. We also identified a progressive decline in AHN with the survival of newborn neurons being impaired first at 4 months, followed by a deficit in proliferation at 6 months. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to enriched environment, a form of hippocampus-engaged exploration, robustly enhances AHN in AppKI mice, primarily by promoting survival.

Deletion of exon 52 disrupts the expression of two dystrophins found in the brain (Dp427 and Dp140), and is eligible for therapeutic exon-skipping strategies. We previously demonstrated that a single intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting exon 51 of the Dmd gene could restore 5% to 15% of Dp427 expression. This treatment reduced anxiety and unconditioned fear in mdx52 mice, improved fear conditioning acquisition, and partially improved fear memory tested 24 hours later. To improve the restoration of Dp427 and induce a long-lasting therapeutic effect, we employed a vectorized approach using an AAV-U7snRNA vector to deliver antisense sequences to the brains of mdx52 mice. We evaluated two AAV serotypes known for their brain transduction efficiency (AAV9 and RH10) and two delivery routes, intracisterna magna and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections, to maximize brain targeting. Based on GFP expression data, we selected the AAV9 capsid and a bilateral ICV delivery route. Using this approach, we demonstrated that ICV administration of AAV9-U7-Ex51M induced exon 51 skipping and restored Dp427 expression in the brains of adult mdx52 mice, though with significant variability among individuals. While a few mice showed high Dp427 expression levels, the average restoration was limited to approximately 6% to 12%. In conclusion, inducing exon skipping in the brains of adult mdx52 mice using the vectorized AAV9-U7 approach was less effective than synthetic ASO treatment and did not improve the emotional behavior of mdx52 mice.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Motived by this, we characterized the time-evolution of the fMRI response in humans. At some cortical locations the fMRI response peaked at the pial surface but in others it peaked within the cortex, likely due to the sparsity of large pial vessels and the dense capillary bed in middle cortical layers.

Experimental studies have struggled to address these issues because of technical challenges and a lack of methodological consistency. Here, we present a comprehensive computational model of auditory peripheral and brainstem neural populations to investigate how ITDs and ILDs are encoded by LSO and MSO. We developed a spiking neural network with realistic tonotopic organization and biologically consistent synaptic connections. We tested responses to pure tones and white noise from different locations under three cue conditions: human-recorded head-related transfer functions, isolated ITDs, and isolated ILDs. LSO neurons showed realistic ipsilateral-preferring responses across different stimuli, with cue dependency varying by tone frequency, while white noise responses were driven mostly by ILDs. MSO responses showed heterogeneous tuning, with contralateral preference for low-frequency tones, which got lost for higher-frequency ones, and white noise response driven by ITDs. We further validated two experimental findings: (1) removing MSO inhibition abolished contralateral tuning, and (2) varying the timing between excitation and inhibition produced large shifts in tuning, highlighting the importance of synaptic timing for ITD coding.

We evaluated GPT-4's emotion ratings using three natural socio-emotional stimulus datasets: two video datasets (234 and 120 videos) and one image dataset (300 images). We found that GPT-4 can predict emotions of human observers with high accuracy. The multivariate emotion structure (correlation matrices of emotions' ratings) converged between GPT-4 and humans and across datasets indicating that GPT-4 ratings for different emotions follow similar structural representations as the human evaluations.

Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI.

We recorded neuronal activity in the motor cortical area of three parkinsonian non-human primates and examined the influence of tACS-induced electric fields on neural firing patterns. We found that weak extracellular electric fields first disrupt beta-band spike timing patterns by changing the preferred spiking phase of neurons but eventually reestablish neural entrainment with altered phase preferences when electric fields are high.

However, degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), a non-traumatic, age-related pathology characterized by spinal cord compression, often leads to motor and sensory impairments that make standard task-based fMRI paradigms challenging to perform or execute. To overcome this, we implemented an fMRI paradigm using direct electrical stimulation to the median nerve to evoke neural responses in both motor and sub-motor spinal cord pathways. In this study, 23 DCM and 23 aged-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent two task-based spinal cord fMRI sessions with direct, median nerve stimulation to the right upper limb. Motor thresholds were determined on an individual basis by a thumb/finger twitching, and sub-motor thresholds were set to be 15% underneath motor with no visible twitching. Blood Oxygenation Level Depended (BOLD) signals were analyzed across the C5-C8 cervical spinal cord segments. HCs demonstrated increased activation during motor vs sub-motor stimulation (1155 vs 496 voxels; +7.1%), whereas DCM patients showed reduction in activation with higher stimulation (1028 vs 1220 voxels; -2.2%). This activation pattern was consistent across the cervical spinal segments, with HCs peaking at C7 (sub-motor: 328 voxels, motor: 608 voxels), which is consistent with median nerve input for forearm and hand. While DCM responses were altered, with sub-motor differentially maximized at C6 (406 voxels) and abnormal recruitment at C5 (112 voxels) and C8 (198 voxels). Spatially, HC responses were focused in the gray matter (GM) and bilateral, whereas DCM responses showed reduced GM localization and were more ipsilateral. Furthermore, we saw spikes in sub-motor DCM deactivation at the overall (3032 voxels) and C6 root level (1500 voxels) that were greater than the other conditions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of median nerve stimulation as a task-based paradigm for assessing spinal cord function in those with spinal cord compression. Group level differences between DCM patients and age-matched HCs showed spatial and quantitatively distinct patterns across stimulation thresholds and spinal segments.

In this study, we first investigated the linearity of the task-evoked negative BOLD response (NBR) with respect to stimulus duration. Then, we obtained the shape of the HRF from each region of the DMN, using an in-house developed unbiased and robust iterative deconvolution technique. Our results demonstrated that each region of the DMN represented a unique HRF, which was not only substantially different from the HRF of the positive BOLD signal, but also different from the HRF extracted from the other DMN regions. We replicated these findings using different fMRI datasets with distinct task paradigms. When comparing the HRF across DMN sub-regions and across tasks, our results demonstrated a significantly higher inter-regional variability compared to inter-task variability. Furthermore, our performance correlation analysis illustrated that the HRFs in the DMN sub-regions extracted by our iterative FIR method were not biased by the task performance level. Altogether, we demonstrated the linearity of the NBR, introduced a robust HRF extraction approach to obtain a distinct HRF for each DMN sub-regions, which were different from the HRF of the positive BOLD signal.

We used adaptive design to test four FDA approved drugs (azithromycin, erythropoietin, caffeine, melatonin) concurrently and determine which best combined safety and efficacy. Methods: Seven-day-old (P7) rats underwent hypoxia-ischemia (HI; right carotid ligation + timed 8% O2 exposure); some experiments included pre-treatment with agents that induced inflammation, and some included post-HI brief moderate hypothermia. Sensorimotor and neuropathology measures were incorporated into a Composite Score that also accounted for deaths. Outcome was initially evaluated at P21 and in confirmatory studies at P35. A pre-specified Bayesian algorithm with futility and efficacy stopping rules was devised to analyze emerging data and adjust subsequent animal allocation among drug groups. Results: In all models either azithromycin or erythropoietin (EPO) offered superior neuroprotection at P21 and the other was 'runner-up'. Caffeine and melatonin conferred modest neuroprotection in pure HI but were quickly eliminated in hypothermia-treated HI. At P35 azithromycin and EPO outcomes were generally similar. Conclusion: These results support azithromycin or erythropoietin as candidate neuroprotective agents and warrant future studies in large animal neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia models.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Although not a core symptom, excessive mind-wandering (MW) is commonly associated with the disorder and may contribute to symptoms as well as performance deficits observed in these patients. The main aim behind the present study is to better characterize MW and its impact on performance measures as well as on neural activity in adults with ADHD. Twenty-eight medication-naive ADHD patients and 28 healthy controls were matched on sex, age, and level of education; they completed a prolonged Go/No-Go sustained attention task including thought-probes to detect episodes of MW. Analysis of EEG data focused on P100, P3b, and CRN event-related potentials reflecting early visual, attention allocation, and performance monitoring processes, respectively. MW, particularly spontaneous MW, was more frequent in patients and linked to a more severe ADHD symptomatology. A differentiated negative impact of MW on performance was noted in both groups: speed and variability of patients' reaction times and accuracy in controls were affected. If the same perceptual (P100) and attentional (P3b) impairments were evidenced in both groups during MW, then the impairment of the performance monitoring (CRN) process was exclusively highlighted in ADHD patients (as revealed by a state x group interaction). Taken together, these results extend the understanding of the cognitive and neural processes associated with increased MW in patients and suggest performance monitoring as a potential key mechanism underlying specific MW-related impairments in ADHD.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Objective: Spreading depolarization is a phenomenon underlying various neurological conditions, including epilepsy. Researchers have suspected that local tissue oxygenation breakdown induces spontaneous SD. In this study, we investigated the relationship between spontaneous epileptic seizures and SD, with a focus on the role of local tissue oxygenation during the transition from seizure to SD. Methods: We applied a long pulse voltametric method to characterize local tissue oxygenation and extracellular space volume in the hippocampus of freely moving epileptic rats (male 6, female 3). Recordings were performed during the normal state of vigilance, spontaneous seizures, and seizure-associated SD events, as well as during their transitions. Results: No significant breakdown in local tissue oxygenation of HC was detected before SD onset during the seizure-to-SD transition. In contrast, a decreased ECS volume in the HC was observed before SD onset during this transition. Significance: Using a novel electrochemical approach in freely behaving rats with intact cerebral autoregulation, we demonstrate that ECS shrinkage, rather than breakdown of local tissue oxygenation, plays a leading role in SD initiation during seizure to SD transition. These findings refine our understanding of the mechanisms driving seizure-related SD and suggest that ECS dynamics may represent an important therapeutic target in epilepsy and other SD-associated neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

J.; Jonnal, R. S.", "abstract": "Water movement in the living human retina and its regulation are important components of the tissue's structural integrity, optical properties, and homeostasis. In the outer retina there is a continuous flow of water from the subretinal space, through the retinal pigmented epithelium, and into the choroid. This flow is disrupted acutely in disorders such as retinal detachment and central serous retinopathy, and is also known to reduce dramatically with age and age-related macular degeneration. Optoretiongraphy is an emerging technique for measuring neural function in the retina by monitoring nanometer-scale deformations of the membranes of photoreceptors. These deformations have been hypothetically attributed, in part, to osmotic shifts that cause water to move into and out of the photoreceptor outer segment after light stimulation. In the present work, we describe a method for measuring changes in the lengths of the cone outer segment and subretinal space in parallel and results showing that light stimuli change the volume of the subretinal space. These results are consistent with earlier ex vivo measurements of its light-induced hydration. The magnitude of the latter changes depend on the rate of water clearance from the subretinal space, and thus may serve as an indicator of the health of the water transport system. In addition, they may help us understand the mechanisms underlying the photoreceptor optoretinogram. These findings add to a growing understanding of the ways in which light exposure leads to transient reconfigurations of the outer retinal layers lasting milliseconds to hours.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Using restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), we examined associations between adiposity and brain microstructure in a cross-sectional sample of 159 children aged 4-7 years, including 81 with ADHD and 78 typically developing (TD) peers. We focused on RSI-derived measures of restricted diffusion-specifically restricted normalized isotropic (RNI), directional (RND), and total (RNT) signals-as indicators of cellular density in subcortical and cortical regions implicated in reward and salience processing. Body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, and obesity status were assessed. Higher BMI, but not other adiposity measures, was significantly associated with increased RNI in the right insula, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and putamen, as well as increased RNT in the right insula and pallidum. These findings suggest early microstructural alterations in reward-related circuits, consistent with theories of diet-related neuroinflammation. Contrary to hypotheses, ADHD diagnosis did not moderate the associations, and anthropometric profiles were similar between groups. This suggests a shared neural pathway linking early adiposity and brain structure, independent of diagnostic status. Our findings replicate and extend prior work in older children, highlighting BMI as the most sensitive marker of obesity-related brain differences in early childhood. These results underscore the potential of RSI as a tool for identifying early neural risk markers of obesity and inform future efforts to design preventive interventions during critical developmental windows.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

M.; Marre, O.; Palmer, S.", "abstract": "Efficient coding theory postulates that a sensory system maximizes information between its response and the input, yet it is unclear if a different measure of optimality that takes into account output function might give a better fit to neural data. The sensory processing delays in many systems suggest that the maximization of predictive information is a reasonable objective function for driving fast, effective downstream behavior. We introduce a one-parameter family of optimal encoding distributions based on how far out in time a population of retinal ganglion cells is optimized to predict future stimuli. Analyzing the population response to a moving bar stimulus with rich temporal correlation structure identifies which particular optimal encoding best describes the neural activity. This allows for the discovery of how far out in time the retina is predicting, instead of simply testing for optimality at one timescale. As stimulus statistics change, so too does the time scale of prediction that best matches the population response. Focusing on this optimal timescale, the neural code can be evaluated in terms of classic efficient coding theory, revealing that the code also shows a peak in how these predictive bits are allocated in the population response repertoire. The stimulus has a fully controlled set of temporal statistics, but is still complex enough to show behaviors like starts and stops, constant motion, and motion reversals. Its tractable statistical structure allows for an information theoretic account of computations like motion anticipation and the retina reversal response in terms of the maximization of predictive information.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

M.; Langleben, D. D.; Wiers, C.

Many datasets collected to investigate a specific SUD include participants with co-morbid SUDs. While most studies treat comorbid SUDs as covariates of no interest, these covariates also contain untapped information. This is particularly relevant as cannabis use disorder (CanUD) has become increasingly prevalent and co-morbid with other SUDs that have been more thoroughly studied. While treatments have been established for multiple SUDs, none have been approved for CanUD, although naltrexone (NTX) has been associated with reduced use. Here, we conducted a retrospective secondary analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with primary opioid use disorder (OUD) with co-morbid CanUD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), or cocaine use disorder (CocUD), while controlling for opioid use. All participants underwent imaging prior to receiving a therapeutic dose of long-acting intramuscular NTX (Vivitrol), an approved treatment for OUD and AUD but not for CocUD, and again two weeks post-administration. At baseline, OUD individuals with co-morbid CanUD, AUD, or CocUD exhibited distinct functional connectivity (FC) alterations compared to those with OUD-only. These differences were greater in younger participants and primarily involved the default mode network. Following NTX administration, FC differences between the co-morbid CanUD and OUD-only groups globally diminished. A similar FC response to NTX was observed in the parietal, subcortical, sensory, and cerebellar networks in the co-morbid AUD group. In contrast, little change in FC was observed in co-morbid CocUD. These findings, combined with prior evidence that NTX reduces cannabis use by dampening the experience of reward, suggest NTX may hold promise as a treatment for CanUD.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

J.; Duarte-Guterman, P.; Galea, L.", "abstract": "Background: The hippocampus undergoes extensive cellular remodelling throughout life in response to multiple biological factors that shape its structure and function. Aging represents a fundamental driver of brain changes, with the hippocampus being particularly vulnerable to age-related concerns that contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease risk. Reproductive experience, including pregnancy and motherhood, triggers profound hormonal fluctuations and metabolic demands that are increasingly recognized as major modulators of brain plasticity, yet represent an understudied and often paradoxical dimension of neurobiological variation. Although reproductive experience and aging are each known to influence biology across the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, their independent and interactive effects on cellular composition have not been systematically examined using quantitative approaches that can resolve cell-type-specific changes. Methods: We performed cell type deconvolution using Single-cell deconvolution of cell types (SCDC) on bulk RNA-sequencing data from female rat hippocampus, comparing nulliparous and parous females across young/older ages (7 month or 13 month old Sprague-Dawley rats, parous: 30 days or 6 months after giving birth) and dorsal/ventral regions. We harmonized 201 cell type annotations from three single-cell reference datasets into 23 biologically coherent categories utilizing female only data. Three-way ANOVA was used to identify independent and interactive effects. Complementary analyses (random forest, PCA, DESeq2) identified parity-associated transcriptional signatures. Cell-specific functional enrichment was performed by weighted gene set enrichment meta-analysis across multiple pathway databases and metrics. Results: Age emerged as the dominant factor affecting hippocampal cellular composition, significantly altering 6 harmonized cell types, particularly impacting microglia and oligodendrocytes. Regional effects were more extensive, affecting 9 harmonized cell types, while age x region interactions were minimal affecting two harmonized cell types. Critically, parity exerted independent effects on three cell populations: dorsal CA3 pyramidal neurons (p=0.0086-0.010 across two datasets) and SST interneurons (p=0.029) both showed 15-25% decreases, while astrocytes increased (p=0.022). Cell-type-specific pathway analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms with enrichment for protein degradation pathways in CA3 pyramidal neurons (GSK3B and BTRC:CUL1-mediated degradation; ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Cyclin D), neuroinflammation pathways in astrocytes, and GABAergic signaling disruption in SST interneurons (signaling receptor activity; GPCR ligand binding). Conclusions: Reproductive experience selectively remodels hippocampal cellular architecture through distinct, cell-type-specific molecular programs that operate independently of age and regional factors. These findings show parity as a critical biological variable requiring consideration in neuroscience and aging research and suggest specific cellular targets for understanding how reproductive history influences brain function.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

While existing analytical methods often break time into discrete events, the stages and underlying representations involved in stimulus-response (S-R) transformations within time-continuous, complex environments remain only partially understood. Encoding models, combined with deep neural networks (DNNs) for feature generation, offer a promising framework for capturing these neural processes. While DNNs continue to improve in performance, it remains unclear whether these advances translate into more accurate models of brain activity. To address this, we collected fMRI data from participants (N = 23) as they played arcade-style video games and applied DNN-based encoding models to predict voxel-level brain activity. We compared the prediction accuracy of features from three DNNs at different stages of development within our encoding model. We show that the most advanced DNN provides the most predictive feature space for neural responses, while also exhibiting a closer hierarchical alignment between its internal representations and the brains functional organization. These results enable a more fine-grained characterization of time-continuous S-R transformations in high-dimensional visuomotor tasks, progressing along the dorsal visual stream and extending into motor-related regions.

This study investigates the potential of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-TMS) as a novel non-pharmacological adjunct therapy by targeting a key pathological mechanism of HIE: a persistent, pathological increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, or hypoxic long-term potentiation (hLTP). Using a neonatal mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia, we administered a single session of LF-TMS shortly after the hypoxic event. We then evaluated its effects on synaptic function via slice electrophysiology and on brain injury volume using serial MRI. Our results show that hypoxia-ischemia induced a significant and lasting synaptic potentiation in the brain's penumbral region. A single LF-TMS treatment successfully reduced this elevated glutamatergic response to control levels, suggesting a therapeutic mechanism similar to long-term depression (LTD) by regulating AMPA receptor redistribution. Furthermore, LF-TMS provided significant neuroprotection, as demonstrated by a reduction in the volume of the ischemic core and penumbra 48 hours after the injury. LF-TMS did not alter excitability in sham-treated mice, confirming its safety as a targeted intervention for pathological conditions without affecting normal brain function.

When the SVV is measured in darkness while the observer is roll-tilted, it shows substantial biases. At tilts larger than 45{degrees}, the bias is attractive, that is, the visual indicator appears vertical when rotated toward the observer. At smaller tilts, however, a repulsive bias is observed. The attractive bias has been explained within the Bayesian framework as the effect of a prior for upright posture. The repulsive bias has so far been considered anti-Bayesian, suboptimal, or as the result of uncompensated ocular counterroll. Here we show that both biases can be explained within a purely Bayesian model. More specifically, the repulsive bias at small roll-tilts is a consequence of the known tilt-dependent variability of the SVV, which is hypothesized to reflect different levels of sensory noise of the otolith organs. We thus provide a solution to a century-old question of why there is a repulsive bias in vertical perception.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

This fundamental question has major implications for neuroscience and medicine, as stimulation outcomes remain highly variable even when identical parameters (\"how\") and target sites (\"where\") are used. Such unpredictability undermines reproducibility, limits clinical reliability, and forces current protocols to rely on empirical trial-and-error rather than principled, evidence-based strategies. Mounting evidence suggests that the brain's state prior to stimulation--a crucial \"when\" factor--shapes responses, yet the most reliable predictive markers remain unknown. Here, we systematically characterize the links between pre-stimulus (spontaneous) activity and post-stimulus (evoked) responses using simultaneous high-density EEG and stereotactic EEG from 36 epilepsy patients across 379 sessions (21,800 stimulations). We show that large-scale neural dynamics robustly predict stimulation outcomes, with a subset of measures--particularly network synchronization, functional connectivity, and spatiotemporal signal diversity--consistently forecasting responses across sessions. Whole-brain activity enhanced prediction compared to local assessments, and predictability varied across networks, being strongest in sensorimotor and visual regions.

Here, we test this model in mice performing a free-response perceptual decision-making task that disambiguates prior-driven and sensory-driven decision strategies. Acute administration of psilocybin or ketamine significantly slowed decision times and improved accuracy. Behavioral modeling that combined drift diffusion and GLM-HMM frameworks revealed that these changes were mediated by increased decision thresholds and a marked shift into sensory-engaged cognitive states. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping identified a distributed decision-making network, with psychedelics selectively modulating cortical and subcortical nodes. Calcium imaging in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key region for integrating priors and sensory inputs, revealed preserved decision-related selectivity under psychedelics, while exhibiting reduced neuronal correlations, i.e. population-level signatures of weakened top-down influence and relaxed priors.

Nocturnal insect migrants are often considered to use the Earth's geomagnetic field for navigation, yet the underlying mechanisms of magnetoreception in insects remain elusive. We developed an indoor experimental system to investigate the integration of geomagnetic and visual cues in the seasonal orientation of a globally distributed pest moth, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), a highly invasive species which in the past decade has colonized almost all potentially habitable regions of the globe. Our results demonstrate that fall armyworms require both geomagnetic and visual cues for accurate migratory orientation, with visual cues being indispensable for magnetic orientation. When visual and geomagnetic cues are placed in conflict moths become disoriented, although not immediately, indicating that sensory recognition of the conflict requires time to process. We also show that the absence of visual cues leads to a significant loss of flight stability, which likely explains the disruption in orientation. Our findings highlight the essential and conserved role of visual cues in maintaining stable magnetic orientation in nocturnal migratory moths.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

While sympathetic and sensory nerves have been individually implicated in cancer progression, whether and how these systems interact to drive pain and tumor growth has remained unclear. Here, we integrate prospective human data with reverse-translational mouse models to reveal that cancer-induced nerve injury unveils crosstalk between sympathetic postganglionic neurons and trigeminal sensory afferents in the tumor microenvironment. In patients, circulating norepinephrine (NE) correlated with spontaneous pain and perineural invasion, identifying a potential sympathetic contribution to disease burden. In mice, aggressive non-immunogenic OSCC tumors evoked spontaneous nociceptive behaviors, elevated tumoral NE, and sensory nerve injury marked by ATF3 expression and hyperexcitability. Tumor-associated sensory neurons acquired adrenergic sensitivity through 1-adrenergic receptor plasticity, while sympathetic neurons exhibited plasticity characterized by sprouting, altered gene expression, and heightened excitability, creating a maladaptive feed-forward loop that amplified nociceptive signaling. Disrupting this sympathetic-sensory communication by sympathectomy or selective ablation of TRPV1 sensory fibers reduced tumor growth, sympathetic tone, and spontaneous pain like behaviors, although sensory adrenergic sensitivity persisted. Together, these findings establish that reciprocal sympathetic-sensory plasticity and crosstalk in the tumor may fuel both OSCC progression and neuropathic like pain. Targeting this peripheral neuroplasticity may offer a translational strategy to limit tumor growth and alleviate pain.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

This study examined whether auditory stimuli affect the pupil light reflex (PLR), a parasympathetically driven response to light, in autistic and non-autistic children. Pupillometry was used to measure responses to visual-only (V), auditory-only (A), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli in 72 children aged 6-14 years (34 non-autistic, 38 autistic). We hypothesized that auditory input would attenuate pupil constriction in non-autistic children and that this cross-modal modulation might differ in autism, reflecting altered sensory-autonomic functioning. Across groups, results revealed a consistent pattern: auditory stimuli elicited pupil dilation, visual stimuli evoked constriction, and simultaneous audiovisual stimuli led to attenuated constriction relative to visual-only trials. This attenuation lends support to prior findings of multisensory attenuation of the PLR. Time-binned analysis revealed a group effect during the 500-1000 ms post-stimulus window: autistic children showed significantly more positive baseline-corrected pupil responses across conditions (i.e., less constriction in V/AV and greater dilation in A), suggesting group differences in the dynamic trajectory of the pupil response. Contrary to expectations, autistic and non-autistic children did not differ significantly on peak constriction or constriction latency within visual conditions. Findings support the presence of cross-modal modulation of the PLR in both autistic and non-autistic children and suggest that auditory signals influence early-stage visual-autonomic processing similarly across groups. Pupillometry may provide a promising, noninvasive tool for probing sensory-autonomic interactions in autism.

However, determining optimal input currents for focal stimulation remains challenging, and different mTMS systems have not been systematically compared under realistic hardware constraints. Objective: To develop an user-centric framework for optimizing and assessing mTMS focality by introducing a generic optimization algorithm, establishing meaningful focality metrics, and comparing mTMS coil arrays with traditional single-channel TMS across cortical targets. Methods: We developed a fast optimization framework incorporating target E-field constraints via parametrization of degenerated hyperellipsoids, explicitly integrating current-rate limits, for example from stimulator electronics and coil heating. Using high-resolution finite-element models of nine individual brains, we compared two mTMS designs (5-channel planar and 6/12-channel spherical systems) with standard sTMS figure-of-eight coils. Three complementary metrics quantified performance: Focality, Target2Max, and OverstimulatedArea. Results: Despite using a single optimized placement for all region-of-interest targets, mTMS achieved focality comparable to repositioned single-channel TMS. For superficial targets, single-channel TMS showed slightly better focality, but for deeper cortical targets (>25mm skin-cortex distance), mTMS performed similarly. More stimulation channels improved focality but required stronger current-rate constraints. The planar design performed better for deeper targets, while spherical designs improved with additional channels. Conclusion: mTMS systems demonstrate remarkable performance comparable to standard TMS, enabling efficient multi-target stimulation without repositioning. Our open-source framework provides practical tools for designing and evaluating mTMS systems, supporting goal-directed mTMS development and effective application.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Using genetic and idiopathic PD cell models, we map the pathogenic cascade beginning with the seed-driven conversion of endogenous Syn, followed by impaired degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately Lewy body formation. By coupling kinetic modelling of aggregation with functional readouts, we identify secondary nucleation as the predominant mechanism generating toxic Syn aggregation intermediates, identifying the critical process that links seeding to pathology. Extending this framework to PD brain, we quantitatively correlate seeding capacity with the spatiotemporal spread and severity of Lewy pathology, revealing a mechanistic connection between Syn aggregation dynamics and disease progression at molecular, cellular, and anatomical levels.

This study investigated whether rTMS can enhance cognitive resilience in individuals who perform in high-stress environments using cognitive measures and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural mechanisms of rTMS-induced cognitive change. METHODS 40 college-educated adults not reporting cognitive or psychiatric concerns underwent a 5-day accelerated (10 sessions/ day) rTMS treatment and pre-post cognitive assessment. Participants were assigned to 1 of 10 doses defined as number of active vs. sham stimulation sessions/ day (total active pulses = 3,000-30,000). To assess cognitive effects, standard batteries (NIH Toolbox, Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows [WinSCAT]) were administered-and a subset (n=21) also did an N-Back working memory task with EEG measurement-before, immediately after, and 1 month after rTMS. For all indices, linear and quadratic correlations of pre-to-post-rTMS change with dose were examined to test if an optimal dose was achieved. RESULTS From pre- to post-rTMS, participants improved in fluid cognition (working memory, processing speed) as measured by NIH toolbox, t(39)=8.4, p<.001, d=1.3, and WinSCAT, t(39)=4.1, p<.001, d=.65; and, improvement in the latter related linearly to rTMS dose, r(39)=.40, p=.01. Regarding EEG, subjects who received high (6+ active sessions/day) also showed increased amplitudes of an event-related marker of stimulus-directed attention (P300) whether it was elicited by simple task targets, t(10)=3.1, p=.01, d=.95, or task-unrelated noise stimuli played during the task as probes of peripheral attention, t(10)=3.6, p=.005, d=1.1. Additionally, there were linear relationships between change magnitude and rTMS dose for simple task target-related, r(20)=.45, p=.04, and peripheral noise-related, r(20)=.54, p=.009, P300s. CONCLUSIONS rTMS improved fluid reasoning abilities and also changed how dynamic attention is deployed during high-demand challenges as a potential mediator of fluid cognition improvements. While linear dose-response relationships support that changes were rTMS-elicited, absence of a response curve asymptote also suggests that still-higher doses could be warranted to achieve maximal effects in non-clinical samples.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Recently, we developed robotic footwear capable of delivering asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations during walking, offering a portable experimental platform for asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations, allowing it to be executed overground and on conventional treadmills. In this study, we quantified kinetic and spatio-temporal gait adaptation to a foot-ground compliance perturbation delivered by the novel robotic footwear. We found that participants shifted their vertical ground reaction force impulse, vertical pushoff peak, and peak braking force toward the unperturbed limb after the perturbation was removed, indicating a shift in neuromotor control elicited by the perturbation.

Here we directly tested whether the \"mismatch\" neural responses in sensory cortex are due to a spatial or a temporal internal model. We adopted two common paradigms to study predictive coding: one based on virtual-reality and one based on static images. After training mice with repeated visual stimulation for several days, we performed multiple manipulations, including: 1) we introduced a novel stimulus, 2) we replaced a stimulus with a novel gray wall, 3) we duplicated a trained stimulus, or 4) we altered the order of the stimuli. The first two manipulations induced a substantial mismatch response in neural populations of up to 20,000 neurons recorded across primary and higher-order visual cortex, while the third and fourth ones did not.

At the same time neuronal populations undergo coordinated On and Off cortical state activity fluctuations, which are locally modulated by attention. The population coupling of soloists and choristers suggests that soloists should show limited alignment with cortical state fluctuations, while choristers should exhibit profound alignment. To test this, we recorded neurons across cortical layers in macaque areas V1 and V4, while animals performed a feature based spatial attention task. As expected, we found a wide range of population coupling strength of neurons. In line with our prediction, coupling of choristers to cortical state changes (ON-OFF transitions) was generally stronger than that of soloists. The strength of population coupling of neurons was similar during spontaneous and stimulus driven activity. Allocation of attention to the receptive field reduced the population coupling strength. Attentional modulation of neurons was positively correlated with population coupling strength. While neurons on averaged retained their coupling strengths across conditions, some neurons can change coupling strength condition dependent, thereby potentially enhancing the coding abilities of cortical circuits.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Although memory is central to this process, the nature of early verbal memory systems and the factors that determine retention and forgetting remain largely unknown. Behavioural and brain measures have demonstrated memory formation in newborns. However, word traces fade in the face of acoustic overlap, leading to interference and forgetting. Here, we investigate whether speakers' identity changes facilitate the separation into distinct acoustic episodes and the creation of non-overlapping verbal memories. Newborns (0-4 days-old) were tested in a familiarization-interference-test protocol, while neural cortical activity was recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed higher neural activation for novel words compared to familiar ones in the test phase, indicating that the infants recognized the familiar words despite the presence of potentially interfering sounds. The recognition response was measured over the left inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) areas, known to be crucial for encoding auditory information and language processing. The neural response also involved the right IFG and STG, involved in interpreting vocal social cues and speaker recognition.

While naturally occurring consortia or single strains often fall short in efficiency, synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) hold greater promise for enhanced degradation. To address this challenge, we developed GENIA (Genomically and Environmentally Networked Intelligent Assemblies), a genome-informed and machine learning-guided framework for the rational design of SynComs capable of multi-pollutant degradation under simulated environmental conditions. Using a microfluidic high-throughput cultivation platform, 2,155 bacterial strains were isolated from xenobiotic-enriched environments and screened for pollutant-specific growth. Whole-genome sequencing and functional annotation of 45 prioritized strains revealed metabolic traits associated with the potential degradation of challenging persistent environmental pollutants as proof of concept, i.e., lignin oxidation, atrazine dechlorination, and PFAS defluorination. These genomic profiles were encoded into spline-based graph representations and integrated within the GENIA pipeline, which combines graph neural networks, pathway complementarity modeling, and functional redundancy minimization to predict optimal community assemblies.

Like all herpesviruses, HCMV can establish a latent infection that persists throughout the lifetime of the host. The HCMV immediate early (IE) proteins, IE1 and IE2, are viewed as master regulators of HCMV infection and are commonly assumed to play pivotal roles in regulating the balance between latent and lytic infection, as their repression is a hallmark of latency. However, it is still unclear whether their expression can indeed determine the establishment of productive infection and what functions, either related to viral gene expression or to cellular pathways, are involved in this activity. Using THP1 monocytes, ectopically expressing the HCMV receptor, PDGFR to boost viral entry, we show that overexpression of either IE1 or IE2 significantly enhances productive infection, illustrating their critical role in determining infection outcome. Mechanistically, we show IE2 drives expression of the viral early genes at early stages of infection, whereas IE1 acts more broadly to enhance global viral gene expression. We further show that from the many functions of IE1, its ability to promote lytic infection is mainly linked to the disruption of PML nuclear bodies. Importantly, induction of either IE1 or IE2 expression in latently infected cells enhances viral reactivation, with IE1-mediated PML representing a central mechanism. Taken together, our findings elucidate the distinct and complementary roles of IE1 and IE2 in overcoming barriers to productive infection and reactivation.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

While most research has focused on the gut microbiome, limited data address the role of the oral microbiome in T1D. The oral and gut microbiomes overlap substantially, and the oral cavity may influence the gut microbial composition. Saliva and dental plaque represent two distinct oral niches with unique microbial communities, but it remains unclear which better reflects systemic disease states such as T1D. This study compared the performance of salivary and plaque microbiomes in classifying pediatric T1D status. Methods: Paired saliva and plaque samples were collected from 46 children (23 with T1D and 23 healthy controls). Microbial DNA was extracted and sequenced to target the 16S rRNA gene. The data were processed via QIIME 2 for taxonomic classification and centered log-ratio transformation. Alpha diversity, microbial abundance, and clustering analyses were performed to compare the oral microbiome between the T1D and control groups. Random forest classifiers were used to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of saliva- and plaque-based models, both with and without clinical metadata. Results: Saliva samples presented lower alpha diversity than plaque samples did but presented significantly greater bacterial loads and total microbial abundances. Saliva-based models outperformed plaque-based models, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.2% with or without clinical metadata, compared with 73.3% accuracy for plaque-based models. ROC curve analysis further supported this difference, with saliva models reaching an AUC of approximately 0.94 versus 0.75 for plaque, indicating superior discriminative performance. UMAP clustering revealed more distinct separation of the T1D and control groups in terms of the salivary profiles than in the plaque profiles. Feature importance analysis revealed both unique and shared taxa predictive of T1D in each niche. The incorporation of clinical and demographic metadata did not enhance model performance, underscoring the robustness and predictive strength of microbiome data alone. Conclusion: The salivary microbiome is a more effective biospecimen than dental plaque for detecting T1D-associated microbial profiles in children. It offers superior classification accuracy and greater sensitivity in distinguishing T1D status, supporting saliva potential as a noninvasive, scalable medium for future microbiome-based monitoring.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

N.; Potter, R. F.; Gilbert, N. M.", "abstract": "Background: Gardnerella is a genus of gram variable anaerobic bacteria that is commonly present in the female urogenital tract, especially during bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is linked with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI) and Gardnerella has been frequently detected in urine collected directly from the bladder. Understanding the contribution of Gardnerella to urogenital pathogenesis has been complicated by its genetic heterogeneity and a shortage of data from in vivo models. Recently, a clinical isolate of Gardnerella displayed covert pathogenesis, triggering urothelial exfoliation and promoting UTI by uropathogenic E. coli in a mouse model. Data from clinical studies suggests differential association of Gardnerella phylogenetic clades with BV or urogenital infections. In vitro data has demonstrated heterogeneity in the presence and expression of putative virulence determinants between Gardnerella strains. This study was designed to compare diverse Gardnerella strains in vivo to identify genomic variation associated with urinary tract persistence and pathogenesis. Methods: Eighteen Gardnerella clinical isolates from each of the four main phylogenetic clades were individually inoculated transurethrally into female C57BL/6 mice. Bacteriuria was monitored by quantitative culturing of Gardnerella in urine. Pathologic features were assessed by immunofluorescent and histological staining of bladder tissues. Pan-genome phylogenetic analyses were performed on the 18 Gardnerella isolates used for mouse infections to identify accessory genes that were associated with observable in vivo phenotypes, including long and short-term persistence, urothelial exfoliation and bladder edema. Genes that were significantly associated to phenotype were then matched against a pangenome analysis of 291 publicly available Gardnerella genomes in order to determine the conservation of these putative colonization and virulence factors across the genus. Results: Gardnerella strains displayed clear differences in persistence and pathogenesis in the mouse bladder that were congruent with phylogeny. Clades 2 strains were more persistent in urinary tract whereas strains from the other three clades either caused transient bacteriuria or were undetectable. Strains from clade 2 and 4 induced urothelial exfoliation while edema was triggered by strains from clades 2, 3 and 4. Pangenome analyses revealed 45 genes that were associated with in vivo persistence and pathogenicity. Among the wider 291 publicly available genomes, clade 2 strains encoded more of the genes associated with bacteriuria phenotypes compared to strains in the other three clades. Exfoliation-associated genes were present in most clade 4 strains. Clade 3 strains lack most of the in vivo-associated genes, whereas clade 1 strains were more heterogenous. Conclusions: This study provides in vivo evidence for differential urinary tract colonization and pathogenesis by strains from different clades/species within the genus Gardnerella and identifies new putative persistence and virulence factors. Utilizing the in vivo data from tested strains, pangenome analyses predicts that clade 2 Gardnerella are the most likely to persist in the urinary tract, clades 2 and 4 have the highest uropathogenic potential.

We successfully isolated the virus and developed injection- and oral-based infection assays to investigate replication, tissue tropism, transmission and risk of mortality. HiSvV replicated in inoculated adults, induced premature mortality in flies, and was transmitted both horizontally and vertically. Infected flies also mounted a broad antiviral response, supporting active pathogenesis. These findings establish HiSvV as the first confirmed viral pathogen of BSF and underscore the urgent need for viral surveillance and experimental tools to safeguard industrial insect rearing.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

M.; Greenhill, A. R.; Horner, J.; Marsden, S. C.; Carter, B. D.", "abstract": "Current understanding of Martian regolith has advanced due to various rover explorations. Due to this, there are now several variants of Martian regolith that are chemically known and commercially available. These simulants are vital for panspermia models that suggest a transfer of simple life throughout the solar system via ejecta containing life from Mars when its surface was more favourable to host life. Bacteria that produce endospores are suitable candidates for these models as they have adequate protection from the harsh conditions of space, particularly against solar radiation. To assess this, the simple endospore former, Bacillus subtilis, was assessed for growth on several Martian regolith that represented different locations and epochs of Mars. This consisted of a conventional Martian regolith, a sulphur rich regolith, and a simulant of the Jezero crater which was thought to have once been flooded with water. We found that the sulphur rich regolith inhibited endospore formation, while the other two variants favoured endospore production. Interestingly, we also identified that pulsing of UVC in a simulation of endospores on rotational ejecta show that endospores break down faster with lower rotational frequency despite receiving the same UVC dose. Moreover, and most strikingly is that viable endospores after surviving UVC dosage displayed elevated expression of the DNA damage SOS response gene, RecA. Importantly, this study suggests that astrobiological approaches that utilise endospore viability as a benchmark for survival require reassessment as genomic integrity may be compromised.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Contrary to many terrestrial alphaviruses, there are currently no experimentally-determined structures for aquatic alphaviruses, severely limiting their study. In this work, we harness the power of structural bioinformatics and AlphaFold to reconstruct an entire SAV virion, thereby revealing an exposed and distinctive -helical feature in its E2 envelope protein.

The microbial communities of sediments in and around a CAC barrier from 2.7 to 9 m below surface were investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing and strains isolated from the samples. The microbial community consisted of taxa commonly associated with the subsurface environment, including a high proportion of Bathyarchaeota in the deeper samples. The presence of PFAS or the CAC barrier used to treat it affected the microbial community. Bacteria in the order Peptococcales had higher relative abundance in the CAC barrier than upstream or downstream of it. The inverse Simpson index decreased with depth, indicating less variety in the microbes that were present, but was higher in the samples downstream of the CAC barrier, which may indicate an impact of the PFAS on the microbial community. The sorption of PFOS was investigated for six newly isolated strains as well as four other strains, and results indicate that sorption of PFOS by different species or genera of bacteria is more variable than previously thought. These results suggest that the microbial community could play a role in the mobility of PFAS within subsurface waters, and emphasizes the need to understand the subsurface microbial community and its interactions with PFAS.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

We conducted an experiment to understand the legacy effects of repeated drought exposure across plant generations on the root and rhizosphere microbiome of the common bean, hypothesizing that a legacy of exposure improves overall plant microbiome resilience. We profiled the bacterial microbiome using marker gene amplicon sequencing over two plant generations in a complete factorial design for two common bean genotypes, Red Hawk and Flavert. We performed parallel experiments for Red Hawk in two different countries using soils of Pays de la Loire, France, and Michigan, USA. Despite the clear and relatively consistent drought effects on the plant phenotypes, there was neither response of the Red Hawk microbiomes to drought, nor a notable legacy of drought exposure. For Flavert, there was a minor legacy drought effect for the second generation in the rhizosphere microbiome beta diversity. This study demonstrates that rhizosphere microbiomes can be resistant to drought stress and that cross-generational legacy depends on soil origin and host genotype.

Thus, it is important to determine if vaccinated individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection develop immune responses that may protect them against emerging variants of concern (VoCs). We have developed mouse models to understand the protective efficacy of an RBD-based vaccine against challenge and rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. Mice were vaccinated with RBD protein vaccine formulated in 2% Alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant by subcutaneous route. To determine the efficacy of RBD vaccine, mice were challenged approximately 4 weeks post-vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 variants by intranasal route. To determine the efficacy of RBD vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge, mice were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron BA.5 variants at day 14 post SARS-CoV-2 Washington (WA) strain challenge. Our data suggest that single dose alum adjuvanted RBD protein from Wuhan strain provides protection against homologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 WA strain but failed to provide protection against heterologous challenge with Delta and Omicron BA.5 variants. Interestingly, vaccinated mice that survived homologous challenge with the WA strain showed protection against heterologous rechallenge with Delta and omicron BA.5 variants. Furthermore, infectious viral loads of Delta and Omicron BA.5 were not detected in the lung tissues collected from the rechallenged mice at 3 days post-rechallenge. The data suggest that a single dose RBD vaccine from the ancestral Wuhan strain together with survival from WA strain challenge induces protective immune responses against Delta and Omicron BA.5 variants rechallenge.

A total of 1,026 samples were collected from thirteen districts across six provinces in the country. PCR-based diagnosis was performed using the primer set Las606/LSS, which targets the 16S rRNA gene of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed using sanger sequencing for five samples collected from different geographical regions. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on these sequences. Among the 1,026 samples tested, 255 were positive, indicating the widespread distribution of HLB across Nepal. All consensus sequences from Nepal showed strong evolutionary relatedness within the C.

By monitoring leaf inclination angle distributions (LIADs), we can gain insights into plant behaviour that directly influences ecosystem functioning. LIADs affect radiative transfer processes and reflectance signals, which are essential components of satellite-based vegetation monitoring. Despite their importance, scalable methods for continuously observing these dynamics across different plant species throughout day-night cycles are limited. We present AngleCam V2, a deep learning model that estimates LIADs from both RGB and near-infrared (NIR) night-vision imagery. We compiled a dataset of over 4,500 images across 200 globally distributed species to facilitate generalization across taxa. Moreover, we developed a method to simulate pseudo-NIR imagery from RGB imagery to enable an efficient training of a deep learning model for tracking LIADs across day and night. The model is based on a vision transformer architecture with mixed-modality training using the RGB and the synthetic NIR images. AngleCam V2 achieved substantial improvements in generalization compared to AngleCam V1 (R2 = 0.62 vs 0.12 on the same holdout dataset). Phylogenetic analysis across 100 genera revealed no systematic taxonomic bias in prediction errors. Testing against leaf angle dynamics obtained from multitemporal terrestrial laser scanning demonstrated the reliable tracking of diurnal leaf movements (R2 = 0.61-0.75) and the successful detection of water limitation-induced changes over a 14-day monitoring period. This method enables continuous monitoring of leaf angle dynamics using conventional cameras, enabling applications in ecosystem monitoring networks, plant stress detection, interpreting satellite vegetation signals, and citizen science platforms for global-scale understanding of plant structural responses.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

In Ostreococcus mediterraneus resistance to the prasinovirus OmV2 emerged within five days in all virus-exposed populations. Whole-genome sequencing of pairs of resistant and susceptible cell lines revealed extensive structural genomic changes, particularly on the Small Outlier Chromosome (SOC). SOC alterations included large deletions, duplications, rearrangements, and whole chromosome duplication, yet no consistent structural variant or single nucleotide polymorphism could be directly associated with resistance. Hybrid de novo assemblies confirmed the unique SOC assembly of each strain, with a highly polymorphic ~2 kb tandem repeat region exhibiting an \"accordion-like\" pattern of expansion and contraction. No new viral insertions were found, though endogenous viral elements were conserved across lines. Two interchromosomal translocations between the SOC and chromosomes 2 and 17 provide evidence for chromoplexy, thereby offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the distinctive evolutionary path of this chromosome. Together, these findings demonstrate that resistance to OmV2 evolves rapidly and consistently but cannot yet be linked to any specific structural variations; instead, the high rate of localized genomic structural variations points to a distinct mechanism of chromosome evolution.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The structured core element undergoes specific endonucleolytic cleavage, while flanking upstream and downstream stemloop modules, previously implicated in Regnase1 recognition, act cooperatively to enhance cleavage efficiency by ~25-fold. Following cleavage, the upstream fragment is rapidly uridylated, accelerating decay of the NFKBIZ open reading frame. This pathway explains how driver mutations found in this RNA region responsible for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma elevate NFKBIZ expression and how a segment of the SARS CoV 2 genome previously linked to NFKBIZ activation suppresses Regnase-1 cleavage via hybridization to this regulatory RNA segment. Together, these findings define a mechanistic framework for Regnase1 mediated control of NFKBIZ, linking its cleavage activity to both lymphomagenesis and viral pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the histidine-to-phenylalanine substitution triggers reversibility of the SN2 mechanism, but the molecular trick by which it reprograms the catalytic pathway remains unknown.

After measuring the elastic stretch and curvatures from our triangulation, a mechanical model is used to measure the tensions and surface bulk modulus distribution. We simulated moss tip cells from experimental Physcomitrium patens plants to challenge the method with noise estimated from experiments. We discovered that increasing the discretization of the triangulation improved robustness against noise. With multiple cell sampling, we found that around 10 cells were sufficient to recover the elasticity distribution with noise, but only when the elastic stretches were high enough at the tip. With low elastic stretch at the tip, the appearance of non-physical modulus values led to underestimated inference values there, causing false-positive gradient results. This compelled us to study a range of cases, leading us to a dimensionless global phase map showing areas of good inference. This technique will open the field to more comprehensive measurements of tip cell elasticity, providing a key step in understanding tip cell growth and morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Genome-scale metabolic models, when integrated with omics data, provide powerful frameworks for such investigations. Here, we predicted patient-specific metabolite secretion patterns in the form of oversecretion/undersecretion by the TrAnscriptome-based Metabolite Biomarkers by On-Off Reactions (TAMBOOR) algorithm. We first identified biomarkers for the general PD population using a consensus approach that prioritized changes consistent across the patient cohort. Then, we clustered patients based on the predicted metabolite secretion pattern of each patient to assess heterogeneity and identify potential patient subgroups. Three main clusters were detected, and the most discriminative metabolites underlying this grouping were determined. The power of the discriminative metabolites in grouping PD patients were confirmed with independent validation data to show the reliability and robustness of our approach. Predicted biomarkers for the general population of PD included both well-known disease markers, such as dopamine and eumelanin, and additional metabolites, such as salsolinol, leukotriene A4, heme metabolism products, calcitriol, and retinal, with potential roles in PD mechanism and symptoms. A subset of the predictions also indicated that some well-known characteristics may not be consistently exhibited in all patients. Furthermore, certain metabolites such as melatonin, sphingosine, and biliverdin, though not identified by the general approach, showed distinct secretion patterns across patient clusters. For instance, an undersecretion pattern of melatonin, possibly associated with the sleep disturbance symptom of PD, was detected exclusively in one subgroup. Our study emphasizes the importance of individual-level analysis, which has a high potential to investigate heterogeneity in the disease metabolism. Furthermore, it gives insights into the ways of patient classification that can guide more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that protein antibiotics called L-type pyocins kill P. aeruginosa by inhibiting the {beta}-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex at the cell surface, halting outer-membrane protein assembly. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we show that L-type pyocins bind a surface-exposed region of BamA and deploy a C-terminal peptide that competitively inhibits the BAM complex, demonstrating that cell entry is not required for antibiotic activity. We combine genetics, multi-omics and cryo-electron tomography to show that BAM complex inhibition by L-type pyocins or the peptide antibiotic darobactin triggers a multifaceted transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological response. Despite this, BAM inhibition ultimately leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane integrity and cell death. These results validate BAM as a target for antibiotics that do not enter the cell and define an engineerable system for their development.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

R.; Kostylev, M.; Smalley, N. E.; Greenberg, E. P.; Dandekar, A. A.", "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen, uses a cell-cell signaling system called quorum sensing to coordinate group behaviors. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a model to study cooperative behaviors in populations. Several studies of cooperation have been conducted using strain PAO1. Wildtype PAO1 harbors a mutation in mexS, which encodes a negative regulator of the transcription factor MexT, which in turn activates many genes, including the efflux pump MexEF-OprN. We hypothesized that the PAO1 mexS mutation might affect cooperative behaviors. When P. aeruginosa is passaged daily on casein as a sole carbon source, quorum sensing is required to induce synthesis of the extracellular proteases needed to acquire carbon and energy. During growth on casein, individuals with inactivating mutations in the quorum sensing regulator LasR are reproducibly enriched in the population. These LasR mutants are cheaters that benefit from cooperatively-produced proteases and have a fitness advantage over cooperators. We passaged wildtype PAO1, PAO1 with a gene-corrected version of mexS, or PAO1 with a null mutation of mexT on casein as the sole carbon and energy source. We found that correcting the mexS mutation resulted in unstable cooperation: bacterial cultures failed to propagate after about 15 days, whereas the wildtype propagated for the duration of our 30-day experiment. The MexS-corrected and MexT-deficient populations also reproducibly exhibited emergence of a particular quorum sensing variant, LasR-V226I. This variant activated a subset of quorum-sensing regulated genes, suggesting an evolutionary pathway to alter P. aeruginosa quorum sensing regulons.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Research background: Ultraviolet radiation represents a major environmental hazard that damages DNA and promotes oxidative stress in all living organisms. In animals, this stress is counteracted by the Nrf2 signalling pathway, while in yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Yap1 transcription factor coordinates oxidative stress responses. The extent to which these mechanisms are conserved in UV-tolerant yeasts from the Basidiomycota lineage remains poorly understood. Experimental approach: We investigated the stress response of a UV-tolerant Sporobolomyces sp. isolates exposed to long-term ultraviolet-B irradiation. Yeast survival and antioxidant capacity were assessed, followed by proteome-wide quantification of protein expression using tandem mass tag labelling and multidimensional protein identification technology. Proteins were annotated for biological function through gene ontology and pathway analyses to identify stress-related factors and transcriptional regulators. Results and conclusions:The LEV-2 Sporobolomycesyeast isolate displayed remarkable survival under conditions lethal to S. cerevisiae and showed induction of antioxidant activity during prolonged exposure. Proteomic profiling revealed large-scale adjustments in protein expression, including the upregulation of enzymes involved in antioxidant biosynthesis, enzymatic antioxidants, DNA repair proteins, heat shock proteins, and multiple signalling pathways. Importantly, several basic leucine zipper proteins with similarity to animal Nrf2 and yeast Yap1 were detected, with one factor showing a distinct induction in response to ultraviolet stress. These findings suggest that the oxidative stress response of Sporobolomyces is mediated by conserved regulatory modules comparable to those of both yeasts and animals, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of stress adaptation mechanisms. Novelty and scientific contribution: This work provides the first proteome-level description of the ultraviolet stress response in a Basidiomycota yeast. It demonstrates that bZIP transcription factors drive a complex antioxidant and repair programme in Sporobolomyces, functionally reminiscent of the animal Nrf2 pathway. The results support the view that fundamental oxidative stress responses arose early in eukaryotic evolution and have been preserved across distant fungal and animal lineages.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

E.; Dudycha, J.; Lynch, M.; YE, Z.", "abstract": "Spontaneous mutations are the primary source of genetic variation and play a central role in shaping evolutionary processes. To investigate mutational dynamics in Daphnia obtusa, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly spanning 129.4 Mb across 12 chromosomes, encompassing 15,321 predicted protein-coding genes. Leveraging whole-genome sequencing of eight mutation accumulation (MA) lines propagated for an average of 482 generations (spanning over 20 years), we estimated a spontaneous single nucleotide mutation (SNM) rate of 2.23 x 10-9 and an indel mutation rate of 2.75 x 10-10 per site per generation. The SNM spectrum was strongly biased toward C:G > T:A transitions. Comparative analyses with natural population data revealed that exonic mutations observed in the MA lines were significantly less likely to be present in standing variation than intronic or intergenic mutations, suggesting that purifying selection in natural populations acts to remove deleterious alleles. We also identified 48 de novo loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, comprising 8 heterozygous deletions and 40 gene conversion events. The genome-wide gene conversion rate was estimated at 2.62 x 10-5 per heterozygous site per generation.

On SMPs, the majority of FoF1 was identified as dimers bound by the regulatory factor dimeric IF1. In addition, a tetrameric structure formed by association of FoF1 IF1 dimers and with a linear arrangement of the F1 head were also identified. These structures induced a steep membrane curvature, indicating the presence of a structure on SMPs similar to that found on the tips of mitochondrial cristae. High-resolution structures of the respiratory complexes were also determined, and sub-class structures of both CI and CIII2 were resolved. Most SCs were of the CICIII2CIV3 structure, although the presence of the CI2CIII2CIV6 mega complex was also identified.

The present study harnesses combined metagenomic-culturomics research to realise the biotechnological capabilities of mangrove microbiomes, screening bacterial isolates of alive and dead ecosystems for poly-extremophilic lignocellulolytic enzymes to solve the fossil energy crisis. The metagenomic profiling showed that changes in the microbial community composition and predicted functional potential differences were significant between alive and dead mangrove ecosystems. Mangrove metagenomic bacterial communities were more prosperous regarding metabolic diversity and the abundance of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes. Likewise, PICRUSt2 assisted in comprehending that dead mangrove sites were enriched in necrotrophic and stress-related enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. A significant percentage of isolates exhibited acidothermolytic capabilities. Interestingly, the enzyme versatility was more widely observed in Alive mangrove locations, whereas some dead mangrove locations contained poly-extremophilic lignocellulolytic capacity. Notably, Vibrio abundance became a relative measure of ecosystem vitality, directly portraying lignocellulolytic enzyme biotropy.

Here we employ a comparative molecular dynamics (MD) approach comparing motions of wild-type and mutant viral proteins in Rae-Nup98 bound vs. unbound states. Our comparisons of MD simulations are enhanced by kernel-based denoising allowing the isolation of non-random functional dynamics from random thermal noise. We demonstrate that despite large structural differences, three evolutionarily distinct viral systems (i.e. VSV M protein, SARS-CoV2 ORF 6, and KSHV ORF 10) share nearly identical single methionine-dependent functional dynamics related to the host cell inhibition of nuclear transport.

Previously, we identified a Group 3 serotype K96 capsule in a mastitis-associated strain M12 that is critical for its survival in some host tissues. In this study, we show that the K96 capsule of strain M12 confers resistance to human serum complement. We conducted genetic screens to determine how K96 capsule expression is controlled, which led to two principal findings. First, Group 3 capsule synthesis is unstable. Sequencing of spontaneously appearing mutants revealed potential phase-variable control of capsule expression. Some mutants harbored reversible frameshift mutations in a homopolymeric site within kpsC, which were also identified in other K96-encoding ExPEC isolates. Second, a transposon mutagenesis screen revealed that capsule synthesis requires proteins encoded outside of the kps locus, including the RfaH antiterminator and OxyR transcriptional regulator, which control activation of an unusually distant promoter. An {Delta}oxyR mutant of strain M12 failed to produce capsule, was extremely sensitive to complement-mediated killing, and avirulent in Galleria mellonella.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": ""}

The C3HeB/FeJ Kramnik mouse model, frequently used for its capacity to mimic human-like granulomatous lesions, has emerged as a pivotal tool in TB research. However, despite its advantages, the model has limitations, particularly in terms of macrophage pathology and restricted B-cell activity, which pose significant hurdles for translating preclinical findings into human applications. By developing models that better reflect human immune responses, the translation of findings into clinical applications may be improved, ultimately leading to more effective TB treatments and vaccines. This study aims to evaluate the Kramnik model by investigating the efficacy of a novel Pheroid(R) formulation containing traditional TB therapeutics in the C3HeB/FeJ Kramnik mouse model. The potential and limitations inherent to the Kramnik model are explored and the need for complementary genomic analyses, such as sequencing SP110 and SP140, to elucidate the susceptibility linked to the SST1 locus is illustrated.

Moreover, fast-growing bacteria are shown to exhibit stronger nucleotide compositional skew.
