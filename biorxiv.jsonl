However, limitations in current methods for identifying these eQTLs have hindered their comprehensive characterization and downstream interpretation of disease-associated variants. Here, we introduce FastGxC, a method to efficiently and powerfully map context-specific eQTLs by leveraging the correlation structure in genomic studies with repeated sampling, e.g., single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using simulations, we demonstrate that FastGxC is up to nine times more powerful and 106 times faster than existing approaches, reducing computation time from years to minutes. We applied FastGxC to bulk multi-tissue (N=698) and single-cell PBMC (N=1,218) RNA-seq datasets, generating comprehensive tissue- and cell-type-specific eQTL maps. These eQTLs exhibited up to four-fold enrichment in open chromatin regions from matched contexts and were twice as enriched as standard context-specific eQTLs, highlighting their biological relevance. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between context-specific eQTLs and complex human traits and diseases. FastGxC improved precision in identifying relevant contexts for each trait by three-fold and expanded candidate causal genes by 25% in cell types and 6% in tissues compared to standard eQTLs. In summary, FastGxC provides a powerful framework for mapping context-specific eQTLs, advancing our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose a hierarchical model architecture comprising three layers to facilitate modular model construction, closed-loop simulations, and direct comparisons between empirical and simulated data. At the motor layer, the autonomous locomotory model is capable of performing exploration. Based on novel kinematic analyses our model features intermittent forward crawling that is phasically coupled to lateral bending. At the second layer, navigation is achieved via active sensing in a simulated environment and top-down modulation of locomotion. At the top layer, behavioral adaptation entails associative learning. We evaluate virtual larval behavior across agent-based simulations of autonomous free exploration, chemotaxis, and odor preference testing. Our behavioral architecture is ideally suited for the modular combination of neuromechanical, neural or mere statistical model components, facilitating their evaluation, comparison, extension and integration into multifunctional control architectures.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

G.; Saethang, T.", "abstract": "Since its inception over 20 years ago, gene enrichment has been largely associated with curated gene lists (e.g. GO) that are constructed to represent various biological concepts: the cell cycle, cancer drivers, protein-protein interactions, etc. Researchers expect that a comparison of their own lab-generated lists with curated lists should produce insight. Despite the abundance of such curated lists, we here show that they rarely outperform comparisons against existing individual lab-generated datasets when measured using standard statistical tests of study/study overlap. This demonstration is enabled by the WhatIsMyGene database, which we believe to be the single largest compendium of transcriptomic and micro-RNA perturbation data. The database also houses voluminous proteomic, cell type clustering, lncRNA, and epitranscriptomic data. In the case of enrichment tools that do incorporate specific lab studies in underlying databases, WIMG generally outperforms in the simple task of reflecting back to the user known aspects of the input set (cell type, the type of perturbation, species, etc.), enhancing confidence that unknown aspects of the input may also be revealed in the output. To optimize the ranking of gene enrichment results, WIMG imputes backgrounds to curated gene lists, an approach validated by Shannon information analysis. Thus, gene lists that are replete with abundant entities do not inordinately percolate to the highest-ranking positions in output. We delineate a number of other features that should make WIMG indispensable in answering essential questions such as 'What processes are embodied in my gene list?' and 'What does my gene do?'", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Nephron formation rate has a clinically meaningful effect on person-to-person variability in nephron endowment, while exerting in vitro control could enable sustained waves of nephrogenesis in organoid-derived synthetic kidney tissues. However, how the kidney arrives at an appropriate number and ratio of nephrons to collecting ducts is unclear. Here we show that nephron formation is rhythmic and synchronized with branching of the ureteric bud tree (the future urinary collecting ducts). We correlate human and mouse spatial transcriptomics data with the branching 'life-cycle' to uncover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal. The nephron progenitor rhythm parallels rhythmic nuclear elongation and other hallmarks of mechanical tension in surrounding stromal cells that we attribute to branching-induced deformation. Stroma-specific knockdown of actomyosin activity leads to a striking loss of synchronization between nephron formation and ureteric bud branching without blocking either. These results suggest that the stroma acts as a mechanically entrained pacemaker for nephron formation.

Here, we demonstrate the applicability of this constant-pH implementation by simulating the proton-gated ion channel GLIC at resting and activating pH, starting from closed and open structures.

While previous work showed reduced GIT passage times in birds relative to other vertebrates, GIT passage times have never been collectively quantified for bats. We conducted a meta-analysis of published digesta passage times across vertebrates, comparing volant and non-volant vertebrates, while considering the effects of body mass and diet. We hypothesized that, like flying birds, bats have significantly faster digesta passage times relative to nonvolant vertebrates, likely due to their adaptations for flight. Our study supports this, revealing significant differences in passage times among flying and non-flying groups, with bats exhibiting faster transit times compared to non-volant vertebrates. Using a phylogenetic comparative analysis, we show that flight and diet have a strong effect on GIT transit times across diverse taxa, while body mass plays a more limited role. Accelerated transit times in bats likely promote the rapid turnover of gut contents, which may contribute to their distinct GIT microbe compositions. Unique among mammals, bat GIT microbiomes are dominated by Pseudomonadota bacteria, a pattern also observed in flying birds. We hypothesize this convergence may result from rapid GIT transit times quantified here for volant taxa.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

This challenge is now approachable due to the increasing availability of data on community structure across the globe. Ecological communities are often defined with respect to the guilds considered and the interactions they engage in, but it is unclear whether interactions of different types respond similarly to large-scale environmental gradients. Therefore, we lack a deeper understanding of how the emergent structure of interaction networks varies across biogeographical gradients, and how this effect may change depending on their constituent interaction types. Here, using a unique dataset of 952 networks across the globe, we provide a first comparison of network structural metrics and their large-scale variability for five overarching interaction types (feeding, frugivory, herbivory, parasitism and pollination). We show that degree distribution, but not connectance alone, helps us understand the observed network structures, and this pattern is maintained across interaction types (with the partial exception of food webs). Moreover, degree distribution descriptors are generally explained by differences across studies, which represent a proxy for variability in sampling and network construction methods. Environmental factors show weaker but robust effects on network degree distribution, and food webs are generally more sensitive to changes in environmental factors than networks of other interaction types. By analysing common descriptors of the degree distributions of ecological networks, this study underscores for the first time generalities and differences across networks of different interaction types and their response to environmental and anthropogenic factors.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Empirical evidence of division of labor in vertebrates is scarce, largely because we lack a theoretical framework to explore the conditions under which division of labor is likely to evolve in cooperatively breeding systems where helpers remain capable of breeding throughout their lifetime. By explicitly considering alternative helping tasks with varying fitness costs, we model how individual decisions on task specialization may influence the emergence of division of labor under both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Surprisingly, we find that direct survival benefits of living in larger groups are the primary force driving the evolution of cooperation to enhance group productivity, and that indirect fitness benefits derived from related group members are only a non-essential facilitator of more stable forms of division of labor in cooperative breeders. In addition, we find that division of labor in vertebrates is favored by harsh environments. Ultimately, our model not only makes key predictions that are consistent with existing empirical data, but also proposes novel avenues for new empirical work in vertebrate and invertebrate systems alike.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

At later stages, this developmental slowing becomes even more pronounced as human neurons form their elaborate axons, dendrites, and synaptic connections, with axons undergoing an even greater evolutionary expansion than other neuronal domains. However, whether developmental timing is responsible for these differences in magnitude, and how, remains to be determined. Using brain organoids to investigate this, we observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing, and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels with an expression profile aligning with early to late maturation stages of neuron development. Calcium imaging during early neuron development revealed a consistent reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared with mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon outgrowth and longer axons in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the timing of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we first investigated the effect of secreted factors (secretomes) from normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) on human LECs (hLECs) and found enhanced junctional integrity. Co-culture with growth factor-activated, NHDF(G) and -inactivated, NHDF(B) fibroblasts increased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) by 140% and 110%, respectively. Confocal imaging revealed ZO-1 expression increased by 2.1- and 2.0-fold, while VEcadherin rose by 1.6- and 1.3-fold in the NHDF(G) and NHDF(B) groups, compared to controls. Dextran transport dropped by 24% with NHDF(G) and 10% with NHDF(B), confirming reduced permeability. Junction analyzer program (JAnaP) showed more continuous ZO-1 junctions in NHDF co-cultures with a decrease in punctate and perpendicular junctions. Thrombin treatment disrupted hLEC junctions, with stronger effects in the presence of NHDFs. These data suggest that in homeostasis, fibroblasts maintain collecting vessel phenotypes critical for preventing lymphatic leakage in skin. Surprisingly, lung fibroblast's secretomes showed opposite effect in lymphatic junction permeability revealing tissue-specific stromal regulation that may explain differential lymphatic responses in pulmonary versus dermal pathologies.

We ask (i) how shared interactions determine the R gene repertoires and polymorphism in each host and (ii) under which circumstances (trans-specific) polymorphism is maintained. Our results indicate that interactions with a generalist pathogen are more likely to sustain polymorphism at a shared R gene compared to the maintenance of polymorphism at R genes private to each host. The former can translate into trans-specific resistance gene polymorphism. Further, we observe that increasing the relative proportion of a single host species favors fixation of private resistance in the less common host, which stays effective because the pathogen tracks the more common host. Our model thus sheds light on how R gene dynamics are shaped by interactions with a shared generalist pathogen and the pathogen's response to alternative hosts.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

It has been shown to outperform more complex models on key association tasks, such as marker gene identification, and on predictive tasks, such as cell type annotation. Logistic regression has also been used effectively for quantifying spatial proximity between cell types and has demonstrated competitive performance in predicting tissue phenotypes. As increasingly large single-cell atlases become publicly available, training logistic regression models on these datasets offers opportunities for building accurate and robust reference models but also poses major computational challenges. Here, we adapt and extend the theory of coresets for logistic regression. Specifically, we compute a previously introduced classification complexity measure using linear programming to identify omics datasets that admit coresets, i.e. random subsets of cells that preserve logistic loss. Our main theoretical finding is that this complexity measure is close to one for PCA-transformed single-cell datasets. Moreover, we prove that logistic loss is preserved under this linear transformation, suggesting a universal sampling scheme that requires only a constant number of cells per cell type to obtain accurate representations of the data. Experiments across several cell atlases demonstrate that these theoretical guarantees translate to accurate and scalable transfer of cell types and spatial niches, outperforming more complex models, including pre-trained language models and graph isomorphism networks.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate a flexible machine learning framework for HCC detection using methylation profiles from bisulfite sequencing across multiple assay platforms and sample types. The framework supports a split and filter approach that routes each sequenced sample to an assay matched classifier without requiring cross assay feature compatibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed assay specific classifiers using four independent public methylation datasets (~2,500 total samples) representing distinct bisulfite sequencing technologies: GSE93203 (MCB targeted hypermethylation), GSE63775 (MCTA Seq tandem repeat hypermethylation), PRJCA001372 (HBV integration associated hypomethylation), and the HCC subset of GSE149438 (EpiPanGIDX: DMR level hyper and hypomethylation). Separate models were trained using using the biologically relevant features for each dataset and evaluated in two independent blind validation datasets: published tissue WGBS (24 samples: 12 early stage HCC, 12 matched controls; PRJNA984754) and a new preclinical plasma cfDNA WGBS dataset (12 samples) generated at a commercial sequencing laboratory. Limited feature overlap among assays precluded a single unified model. Instead, overlapping features enabled construction of a proof-of-concept meta-classifier for sample routing across assay-specific models. RESULTS: Assay-specific cfDNA models, trained independently on CpG sites from original publications, were evaluated using the biopsy(tissue) dataset and a new plasma dataset as blind validation. All four assay-specific models generalized well to the validation data, with accuracies of 83.5% to 100%. In the validation with the plasma cfDNA samples, the best-performing classifier (among XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) for each public dataset achieved 80 to100% sensitivity and 86 to 100% specificity, with all Stage 2 cases correctly detected across models. The single Stage 1A case showed methylation levels overlapping with cirrhotic controls, consistent with biological expectations. Despite this, a couple of the models predicted this correctly, showing greater sensitivity to Stage 1 cancer. CONCLUSION: A generalizable framework for early detection of HCC composed of assay-specific classifiers and a meta-classifier is described. This architecture readily accommodates addition of new assays via feature-matched models and meta classifications. Larger, prospectively collected studies are necessary to confirm performance and enable clinical translation.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

L.; Meyer, T.; Hay, M.; Rust, N. C.", "abstract": "While humans and other primates are generally good at remembering the images they have seen, they systematically remember some images better than others (\"image memorability\"). Here, we leverage image memorability to resolve a puzzle around how the brain transforms seeing into familiarity. Namely, the neural signal driving familiarity reports is thought to be repetition suppression, an overall reduction in the vigor of the population response in brain regions, including inferotemporal cortex (ITC). However, within ITC, more memorable images evoke higher firing rates than less memorable ones, even when they are repeated. These two observations conflict: if reduced firing leads to stronger memory signaling, then why are the images that induce greater firing more memorable? To investigate this \"familiarity-memorability paradox\", we compared neural activity in ITC and the hippocampus (HC) as two macaque monkeys performed a single-exposure image familiarity task. We found a resolution to the paradox, reflected in two pieces of evidence. First, memory and memorability were not completely overlapping in ITC, suggesting that familiarity signals could be extracted independently of memorability modulation. Second, responses in HC reflected a transformation of ITC responses that extracted memory, leaving behind stimulus-evoked firing modulation. This transformation could be accounted for by a linear decoder that selectively extracts memory and preserves larger ITC memory signals for more memorable images. These results resolve the familiarity-memorability paradox by demonstrating that ITC familiarity signals are a component (but not the entirety) of repetition suppression, and they establish the existence of a previously undescribed medial temporal lobe computation.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Several theories - such as the exploration-exploitation hypothesis - propose that variability plays a key role in motor performance and learning. However, empirical measures of motor and proprioceptive precision are often limited by small sample sizes, and proprioceptive estimates, especially those relying on efferent signals, are difficult to isolate and quantify. In this study, we leveraged a large dataset of 270 participants - including a subsample of older adults (ages 54-84) - to assess the precision of hand movements and proprioceptive estimates, and to examine whether these factors predict individual differences in motor learning and adaptation. We found that baseline reach variance did not predict learning or changes in hand localization. Although active hand localization (which includes efferent contributions) was slightly more precise - showing an 8.6% reduction in variance - this suggests that unseen hand estimates rely primarily on proprioception. Neither motor nor sensory precision varied with age. However, reach aftereffects were modestly associated with proprioceptive precision before training and proprioceptive recalibration after training. No other measure of learning or variance was reliably associated. These findings suggest that reach aftereffects may partly reflect changes in hand proprioception, but overall, we identified no predictors of adaptation to a rotated visual cursor.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Our recent studies revealed soluble Vpu oligomers, prompting further investigation into their interactions with cellular proteins. Notably, Vpu may form a complex with calmodulin (CaM) due to its putative CaM-binding motif; however, experimental proof of this association remained unavailable. Here, we present definitive experimental evidence that the soluble Vpu complex interacts in vitro with calcium-bound CaM (Ca2+-CaM) its active form. Using double electron electron-resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and protein spin labeling, we detected the formation of a soluble Vpu-Ca2+-CaM complex. Both the full-length (FL) and truncated C-terminal regions of Vpu bind Ca2+-CaM. DEER experiments on a spin-labeled CaM cysteine mutant S39C/A103C revealed that, upon association with Vpu, Ca2+-CaM undergoes a transition from an open to a more closed conformation, consistent with previous reports of Ca2+-CaM interactions with other proteins. Furthermore, we observed that the binding of Vpu to Ca2+-CaM leads to dissociation of soluble Vpu oligomers, as evidenced by a reduction in DEER modulation depth for FL Vpu spin-labeled at residue L42C. FRET analysis with a fluorescently labeled C-terminal cysteine mutant of Vpu confirmed this result. Like FL Vpu, the Vpu C-terminal region forms soluble homooligomers that dissociate upon binding to Ca2+-CaM. Collectively, our results suggest that soluble Vpu and Ca2+-CaM form an equimolar complex. DEER analysis of Vpu C-terminal region spin-labeled at residues Q36C/I61C demonstrated that Vpu undergoes significant conformational changes to facilitate Ca2+-CaM binding.

We observed that high BMPR1A expression is correlated with low BRCA1 levels and poor BLBC prognosis in patients. We show that exposure to BMP4 induces BRCA1 transcriptional repression via BMPR1A, promoting a basal differentiation and impairing homologous recombination. This results in increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and accumulation of genetically-unstable, immature cells. In addition, long-term BMP4 stimulation or BMPR1A overexpression induced transformation.

We find that Xi expression levels are a strong linear predictor of female-male expression differences, suggesting that other compensatory or regulatory mechanisms play a more minor role in sex differences in X-linked gene expression. Among females, we identify traits--including BMI, estradiol, and testosterone levels--for which higher Xi expression correlates with the strength of evidence for either additive or dominance effects on the trait. We hypothesize that an underappreciated mechanism could generate dominance effects of X-linked variants on a trait--specifically when the variant influences skew in X inactivation.

We conducted a 30-generation experiment with clonal populations of Daphnia magna maintained either under constant temperature (26 {degrees}C) or gradual warming (+1 {degrees}C every 4-6 generations, up to 32 {degrees}C). We measured fecundity, growth rate, age at maturation, body size, and lifespan across generations, and used a reciprocal transplant assay to disentangle genetic and plastic responses.\n\nWarming populations matured earlier, grew faster, and initially reproduced more than controls, but suffered shorter lifespans and lost their reproductive advantage near 30 {degrees}C, a sub-lethal ceiling that coincided with extinction events. This rate-dependent trajectory contrasts with one-step warming studies that typically report uniformly reduced reproduction. Reciprocal transplants revealed a persistent reduction in adult body size of warming-line offspring, regardless of rearing environment, consistent with heritable or trans-generational change, while growth rate remained largely plastic. Together, these results show that gradual warming can simultaneously elicit plastic and heritable trait shifts, and that reproductive ceilings well below lethal limits act as tipping points for population persistence.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We found that cue-evoked NAc core dopamine is positively shaped by reward prediction and inversely relates to and predicts instrumental reward seeking. Cues that predicted imminent reward with high probability triggered a large NAc dopamine response and this was associated checking for the expected reward in the delivery location, rather than instrumental reward seeking. Cues that predicted reward with low probability elicited less dopamine and this was associated with a bias towards seeking, rather than check for reward.

Both the nature of interactions, spanning antagonistic to cooperative, and the strength of interactions vary between and across microbial species and strains. These local interactions can influence the emergence and maintenance of microbial diversity. However, it remains challenging to link features of local interactions with spatially mediated coexistence dynamics given the significant variation in the microscopic mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell feedback. Here, we explore how microbial interactions over a broad range of ecological contexts spanning antagonism to cooperation can enable coexistence as spatially explicit domains emerge. To do so, we introduce and analyze a family of stochastic coordination games, where individuals do better when playing (i.e., interacting) with individuals of the same type than when playing with individuals of a different type. Using this game-theoretic framework, we show that the population dynamics for coordination games is governed by a double-well shaped interaction potential. We find that in a spatial setting this double-well potential induces phase separation, facilitating coexistence. Moreover, we show that for microbes engaged in symmetric coordination games, phase separation takes on a universal scaling that follows `Model A' coarsening, consistent with prior experimental observations for Vibrio cholerae mutual killers. Finally, we derive a PDE equivalent of the spatial stochastic game, confirming both the double-well nature of spatial coordination games and the universality of phase separation. Altogether, this work extends prior findings on the link between microbial interactions and population structure and suggests generic mechanisms embedded in local interactions that can enable coexistence.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

While a relation between particle exposure and cardiovascular disease has been observed, its role during pregnancy requires further understanding. Herein, we investigated the effect of TiO2 exposure on cardiac tissue in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies using human cardiomyocytes showed TiO2 increased toxicity and necrotic death associated with enhanced oxidative stress. The use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a general antioxidant, rescued the myocytes from TiO2-induced necrotic death. Pregnant (P) or non-pregnant (NP) mice were challenged with TiO2 to assess the effect of pregnancy and exposure in cardiac tissue. Pregnancy alone was shown to alter the cardiac proteome with upregulation of inflammation biomarkers. Upon exposure, both P and NP mice showed notable proteome remodeling with pathways associated with oxidative stress, cardiac function, cell death, and inflammation being altered. Immunoblots confirmed changes in catalase, Complement (C) 5, and glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1).

Normally, induction of autophagy is protective, although in some circumstances, such as conditions of hemodynamic stress, autophagosome accumulation upon autophagy induction can be a maladaptive process. The deficiency of the autophagic protease ATG4D in mice leads to the accumulation of cellular autophagosomes in most tissues, including the heart.

In 2011, Poelwijk et al. formulated a foundational theorem stating that in any multi-peaked fitness landscape, \"at least two mutations exhibit reciprocal sign epistasis\" (Poelwijk et al., J. Theor. Biol., 272:141). The proof relied on the implicit assumption that neutral mutations are absent, commonly accepted in theoretical studies in evolutionary biology. In this study, we extend Poelwijk et al.'s analysis by incorporating genotypes with equal fitness, specifically, accounting for neutral mutations. We demonstrate that when neutral mutations are considered, conventional pairwise reciprocal sign epistasis (RSE) may be entirely absent from a multi-peaked landscape. Instead, RSE is guaranteed only when considering \"distant\" RSE defined through composite mutations, wherein groups of mutations are treated collectively across all their possible combinations. Applying these concepts to empirical fitness landscapes faces a practical limitation: phenotypic measurements contain experimental noise, making mutational effects statistically indistinguishable from zero. Under such conditions, statistically significant detection of RSE in multi-peaked landscapes may be impossible even when composite mutations are considered. Theoretically, our findings imply that in the presence of neutral mutations, compensatory mutations in a multi-peaked fitness landscape need not be adjacent; rather, compensation can occur following one or more neutral steps along an evolutionary path. Practically, in real-world scenarios where fitness measurements contain uncertainty, there may be a fundamental technical limitation to detecting RSE in a statistically significant manner within multi-peaked landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed deep electrospectroscopy, a method to assess nonlinear spectral similarity between the LFP of different areas. A brain-wide application of this technique to the mouse brain revealed an organization composed of groups of spectrally similar areas. Such communities were mostly found in the forebrain and showed an organization that did not strictly follow the cytoarchitecture. For instance, visual parts of the cortex and the visual parts of the colliculus were found in the same community. These electrospectral communities reshaped with context, showing splitting and merging operations, growing in size around brain areas required for a task. In particular, upper and lower limb parts of the somatosensory cortex were primarily in separate communities but merged during a task that required turning a wheel.

A hidden-state inference model best explained these adaptations, outperforming multiple reinforcement-learning variants in predicting both choices and inferred contexts. Oculomotor behaviour corroborated this account where relevant features were selectively attended to, with attentional focus tracking the model's belief updates and decreasing after high prediction errors. Guided by these results, we used magnetoencephalography to examine how cortical population activity is reorganised during inference. Dimensionality and geometry analyses showed that neural state space expanded with the inferred complexity of the task and that 2D contexts were represented as two near-orthogonal axes within a shared planar manifold. Neural activity expanded along relevant as compared to irrelevant dimensions, with these transformations predicting faster reaction times and emerging just before decisions. Finally, these representational changes preceded feedback-evoked frontal theta responses sensitive to prediction error, suggesting that internal models proactively reshape cortical state space to facilitate upcoming learning. Together, our findings reveal how latent-state inference, attention, and dynamic representational geometry interact to support abstraction and adaptive decision-making.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

C.; Maddox, A. S.", "abstract": "Programmed cell death (apoptosis) during oogenesis is conserved across metazoans and linked to regulation of oocyte number and quality. In oogenic germlines, the removal of developing oocytes by apoptosis ensures that oocytes do not contain DNA damage or multiple nuclei. Beyond this chromatin-quality control assurance role, it was unknown how apoptosis contributes to oocyte quality. We used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to study the consequences of loss of apoptosis on oogenesis. Blocking apoptosis reduced fecundity in hermaphrodites at peak fertility and caused germline architectural defects such as abnormal rachis morphology and perturbed the arrangement and distribution of oogenic germline compartments. We posit that the defects associated with the loss of germline apoptosis arise due to lack of sufficient space for normal oogonia growth. In support of this idea, oocytes and embryos are abnormally small and exhibit low viability in animals unable to execute apoptosis. These findings suggest that in addition to preventing ploidy defects during oogenesis, apoptosis contributes to fertility by preserving homeostatic germline structure required for the fidelity of oogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

N.; de Vries, G. J.; Petrulis, A.", "abstract": "The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) regulates sexually-differentiated social behaviors, including sexual behavior, aggression, and social communication. Much of AVP's effect on social behavior is mediated by the most widely-expressed AVP receptor in the central nervous system: the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). Dense expression of V1aR is found in males and females in the lateral septum (LS), which also receives heavy input from sexually-differentiated populations of AVP cells in the extended amygdala. In order to access and interrogate the structure and function of V1aR cells, we developed and validated a V1aR-Cre knockin mouse line (Avpr1a-P2A-iCre). V1aR-Cre mice did not differ from their Cre-negative littermates in their health, sensorimotor function, anxiety/motivational behavioral responses, or in their V1aR binding levels in the LS. The distribution of Cre in the brain, as assessed by crosses with Cre-reporter mouse lines and in situ hybridization (ISH), was highly similar to patterns of V1aR binding and demonstrated strong colocalization between Cre and V1aR expression within LS cells. We used this V1aR-Cre mouse to identify the inputs and outputs of V1aR+ cells in the LS, via a monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus as well as anterograde synaptophysin-mRuby AAV tracing approaches. Monosynaptic inputs to V1aR LS cells were observed from the medial preoptic area (MPA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), hippocampus (mostly ventral), medial septum, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Synaptophysin labeling revealed outputs to some of these same structures (MS, LH, DBB, SuM) as well as parts of the lateral preoptic area (LPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and ventral pallidum. Notably, most structures (except for hippocampus) bidirectionally connected to V1aR LS cells also contain populations of V1aR+ cells and are targets for BNST/MeA AVP cells, suggesting an integrated AVP/V1aR circuit. Finally, using ISH, we measured levels of V1aR mRNA expression in subregions of the LS and colocalization of V1aR with oxytocin receptor (OTR) mRNA, which also has a high affinity for AVP, within the LS. We found similar high percentages of cells containing V1aR+ puncta across dorsal and intermediate LS in both males and females. In contrast, the ventral LS contained fewer V1aR+ cells in both males and females. The highest level of co-expression of V1aR and OTR was found in the intermediate LS in both sexes, suggesting the possible location of functional interactions between AVP and oxytocin within the LS. We also sought to identify other phenotypic aspects of V1aR cells using ISH and confirmed that all LS V1aR cells are GABAergic and that most also express corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, suggesting a substrate by which AVP could interact with stress-related systems in the LS. Our characterized V1aR-Cre mouse will be a valuable resource for understanding the role of AVP/V1aR in behavioral and physiological systems. Using this mouse, we have characterized the connectional architecture of V1aR cells in the LS and revealed an interlocking set of structures that may be the substrate through which AVP regulates social and emotional behavior.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Whether such trade-offs persist in nature--or are eroded as lineages adapt through compensatory changes--remains largely unknown. Here we show that a trade-off between competitive ability and host colonization has been stably maintained in natural Pseudomonas populations for centuries. Wild plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas compete using tailocins--phage-derived molecular weapons that bind to specific cell-surface receptors. Genomic surveys and functional assays reveal that the most broadly lethal tailocins remain rare--while the tailocin's production increases competitive killing, it also compromises plant colonization. We determine that the polymorphisms behind this tradeoff are not transient -- historical genomes spanning two centuries show that the tradeoff has been maintained for at least 105-106 generations. Our results demonstrate that, in natural populations, a tradeoff between competition and pathogenicity is fundamental and not easily overcome.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We used whole-genome resequencing of 123 individuals to compare an adaptive radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes in Laguna Chichancanab, Mexico, to an independent radiation of San Salvador Island (SSI) pupfishes in the Bahamas, and assess the repeatability of adaptive genetic architecture, sources of adaptive variation, and stages of selection. Despite rapid craniofacial divergence of trophic specialists within 8-15 kya, only two candidate genes (3.6%) were shared between Caribbean radiations. Although adaptive introgression played a major role on SSI, we found minimal evidence of adaptive introgression in Chichancanab, likely due to geographic isolation of this inland lake. Instead, de novo mutations provided a substantial source of adaptive variation (30.6%) for the endemic zooplanktivore, 15.3 times higher than the endemic scale-eater on SSI. We found strong evidence that selection occurred in stages, first on regulatory and standing genetic variation, then on de novo and nonsynonymous mutations, parallel to SSI. We then verified that adaptive variants near vision-development and spermatogenesis genes, uniquely within Chichancanab, are consistent with greater visual acuity and divergent sperm morphology in the zoooplanktivore. Consistent with extensive adaptive de novo mutations in WNT10A and rapid diversification of tooth size in the zooplanktivore, we found that experimental inhibition of this pathway in generalists results in narrower teeth. We conclude that de novo mutations, not introgression, can drive rapid adaptive radiations in isolated environments.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

How these rules are mechanistically implemented, however, varies widely across species and remains poorly understood. Here, using quantitative 3D live imaging, mechanical and biochemical manipulations, we dissect the mechanisms governing centrosomal complex (CC) migration and spindle orientation in ascidian 2-cell stage embryos to generate the characteristic planar, square 4-cell stage. We show that following the first mitotic division, CCs in the two blastomeres form at variable orientations relative to the mother spindle and progressively achieve parallel and coplanar alignment during interphase of the 2-cell stage. Final spindle orientation is established prior to nuclear envelope breakdown, contrasting with dynamic spindle reorientation reported in other systems. Our analyses reveal that CC rotation is driven by forces acting on long astral microtubules and guided by an anisotropic, ER-rich cytoplasmic domain that surrounds the CCs. This ER domain correlates with a dense astral microtubule network, enabling length-dependent microtubule pulling that orients the CCs independently of cell shape. In parallel, dynein-mediated cortical pulling refines spindle tilt and maintains coplanarity. Together, these findings uncover a cell-cycle-regulated tug-of-war between ER-mediated cytoplasmic forces and anisotropic cortical forces that ensures robust planar cleavage in ascidian early embryos.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

For biophysical problems, such as protein folding and association, a fundamental question in diffusion-based methods is how their learned functions correspond to thermodynamics. In this paper, we study diffusion models through the lens of theoretical biophysics, analyzing their underlying formulation of potentials and exploring their applications in scoring protein interactions. We develop simple theories rooted in statistical physics that relate thermodynamic potentials to the negative log of the probability of observing a system in a particular state. We include dimensional analysis of diffusion model equations, and a table mapping AI and physics jargon. We then test a diffusion model's ability to capture learned energies as negative log-likelihood values, -log p0(x0), by integrating over the diffusion-generated path or a probability flow ODE path. We test these integrals on a simple 1D Gaussian mixture diffusion model and a protein-docking diffusion model, DFMDock. In the 1D case, we find that integration over both diffusion and flow paths can accurately recover ground truth probabilities. When we extract the learned docking energies for cases where DFMDock succeeds, we observe energy funnels with the minimum energy near the experimental docked structure, like those we observe with Rosetta, an empirically tuned physics-based biomolecular modeling suite. The learned energy performs comparably or outperforms Rosetta interface energy in 6 out of 25 cases at ranking the correctness of docked poses. These data show that we can extract a relevant learned energy function from a diffusion model and compare it to physical energy functions.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The mechanical integrity of epithelial tissues relies on intercellular adhesion proteins which link neighbouring cells and transmit forces across the cellular network. The stability of the intercellular adhesive bonds is critical. Under sustained stress, bond failure leads to cumulative damage that progressively weakens the material and ultimately causes failure at the tissue scale. Although the collective behaviour of adhesion bonds under static loading has been characterised to some extent, their response to dynamic loading remains largely unknown, despite its physiological importance. Here, we combine quantitative experiments and theoretical modelling to elucidate how tissues respond to cyclic mechanical loading. We compare the response of epithelial monolayers to constant tension and cyclic loading regimes. Cyclic loading markedly prolongs tissue lifetime and allows greater total deformation before failure, indicating that intervals of low stress promote bond repair. To interpret these behaviours, we develop an analytical and stochastic framework based on the kinetics of slip-bond intercellular linkers. Our model predicts two intrinsic timescales, rupture and repair, rooted in the molecular dynamics of individual bonds. Under cyclic loading, alternating high- and low-tension phases interact with these timescales to generate three distinct regimes of epithelial behaviour: rupture, slow damage accumulation and stable equilibrium. Normalizing loading parameters by the intrinsic molecular timescales collapses experimental and simulated data into universal stability maps. Our results show that epithelial resilience emerges as an intrinsic property of stochastic bond kinetics. This framework provides a quantitative basis for understanding how the intrinsic dynamic turnover of adhesion bonds enables repair during cyclic loading, allowing tissues to tolerate transient overloads that would cause failure under constant tension. Ultimately, it offers a predictive tool linking molecular adhesion dynamics and macroscopic mechanical behaviour.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a simple classifier that accurately distinguishes PAGs from other gene models based on evolutionary and sequence-derived genomic features, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.87. Remarkably, a model trained solely on maize data gave statistically significant and biologically meaningful results for two evolutionarily distant angiosperms with divergent genome architectures, rice (Oryza sativa) and arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Gene models predicted to have a higher probability of being PAGs displayed patterns consistent with known biological properties of essential genes, and newly identified PAGs received significantly higher prediction scores than non-validated gene models. Notably, the predicted PAGs were not confined to well-characterized gene families or genes with known domain functions. The quantitative scores generated by this model offer a valuable resource for prioritizing and exploring the vast number of uncharacterized gene models in maize and other plants, potentially accelerating gene discovery and functional annotation in crops.\n\nSignificance StatementAnnotation of an organisms genome produces tens of thousands of predicted genes, termed gene models.

L.; Lee, K.-M.; Wong, K.-B.", "abstract": "Maturation of urease, a virulence factor for Helicobacter pylori infection, requires the delivery of nickel ions to the metalloenzyme. To avoid cytotoxicity, nickel ions are transferred within protein complexes of metallochaperones to ensure that the toxic metal do not escape into the cytoplasm. In the urease maturation pathway, metallochaperone UreG receives its nickel ions by forming a 2:2 complex with another metallochaperone UreE. Using C-terminal truncation variants of UreE [UreE(1-158) and UreE(1-148)], we determined the crystal structures of the UreE2G2 complex bound with nickel ions and GMPPNP, a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue. UreE-UreG interactions are asymmetric, where the UreG dimer mainly interact with the proximal UreE. GTP binding induces conformational changes in the G2 and CPH motifs of distal UreG that enable its anchorage to the UreE2G2 complex, justifying why GTP binding promotes the formation of the complex. His68 of the CPH motif of distal UreG moves towards and chelates a nickel ion at the nickel binding site of UreE. Formation of the UreE2G2 complex juxtaposes the nickel binding sites of UreE and UreG. Transfer of nickel from UreE to UreG induce conformational changes that weaken UreE-UreG interactions and promote dissociation of UreG. We further demonstrated that the hydrogenase maturation factor HypA, providing the sole source of nickel ions, could activate urease in vitro by protein-protein interaction with wild-type UreE but not its truncation variants. UreG binding induces conformational changes in the C-terminal tail of UreE and promotes dissociation of HypA-UreE complex and the formation of UreE2G2 complex.\n\nSignificanceOur work provides insights into how cells solve the problem of trafficking a toxic metal, nickel, to the active site of urease. Colonization of Helicobacter pylori in acidic human stomach requires the biosynthesis of active urease, which involves the delivery of the toxic nickel ions to the active site of the metalloenzyme. To avoid cytotoxicity, nickel ions are transported from one metallochaperone to another via the formation of protein complexes so that the toxic metal ions do not escape into the cytoplasm. Supported by structural and biochemical evidence, we present a paradigm on how GTP and nickel binding allosterically promote the formation of a complex between metallochaperones UreE and UreG to facilitate nickel transfer between the two proteins.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Because ecDNA lacks a centromere, it is thought to segregate stochastically and randomly during cell division, thereby generating extensive intratumoral heterogeneity in genomic copy number. Several studies have reported that ecDNA copy numbers can readily change in response to drug treatment, which enables the cells to acquire drug resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying these dynamic changes remain poorly understood --particularly whether such copy-number changes result from static selection of pre-existing clones or from active reconfiguration under drug-induced stress. This key question remains unresolved, mainly due to the absence of technologies capable of tracking ecDNA copy number simultaneously across clones. To overcome this limitation, we developed a high-throughput framework that combines single-cell DNA sequencing with cellular barcoding for clonal tracking of ecDNA copy-number dynamics.\n\nThe results of single-cell cloning experiments revealed that not all clones exhibit identical segregation modes even under drug-free conditions. Clonal tracking under drug treatment showed that resistant populations do not simply emerge from pre-existing clones with favorable ecDNA states; instead, some clones seemed capable of actively reconfiguring their segregation behavior, possibly involving neuron-like alternation in microtubule organization and intracellular transport pathways, to generate drug-resistant cells. These findings suggest that, although ecDNA might segregate stochastically, it may undergo nonrandom, actively regulated segregation under drug stress. This discovery allows the therapeutically targeting of ecDNA segregation mechanisms to counteract adaptive drug resistance.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Orb is one of the key regulators of oocyte specification and polarity. This regulation acts through establishment and maintenance of a 3UTR-dependent positive autoregulatory loop. In 16-cell cysts, positive autoregulation is necessary to accumulate high levels of orb mRNA and protein in one of the two pro-oocytes. A previous study showed that deletion of the orb 3UTR fragment containing CPE sites leads to a failure in proper orb mRNA and protein localization; as a result, oocytes are not specified in 16-cell cysts, and egg chambers contain only nurse cells. In the present study, we found that deletion of CPE and CPE-like motifs disrupts proper Orb protein localization and oocyte specification in germaria. CPE motifs are indispensable for orb mRNA stability: deletion of CPE and CPE-like sequences reduces orb mRNA stability to one third of level in wild type. When the 3UTR is deleted, the remaining 115-nucleotide sequence, which does not include CPE motifs, is sufficient for nurse cell development. Removal of this sequence leads to a further decrease in orb mRNA stability and a drop of Orb protein to undetectable levels. Oogenesis stops in region 2a/2b of the germarium, where the checkpoint is localized, and egg chambers do not form. We propose that CPE motifs are required for orb 3UTR-mediated Orb accumulation which drives oocyte specification, whereas low levels of unlocalized Orb protein expressed in the absence of Orb autoregulation are sufficient for nurse cell specification.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Among these, the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3) and the cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25h) converge on the inhibition of viral entry by altering the behavior of membranes. Here, we dissect the functional and mechanistic relationship between these two membrane-acting effectors using HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as models. We show that IFITM3 and CH25h restrict viral entry with similar efficiency, but act in a largely redundant manner during infection. Their redundancy is consistent across infection systems, cell types, and entry assays, indicating that both factors converge on a shared biophysical block to membrane fusion. Unexpectedly, we uncover a second layer of interplay in which the CH25h-25HC axis remodels IFITM3 trafficking. Exposure to 25-hydroxycholesterol drives IFITM3 from endolysosomal compartments to the plasma membrane, impairs its internalization into early endosomes, and increases its secretion in exosomal vesicles. These effects occur independently of direct antiviral activity and reveal that CH25h regulates IFITM3 cellular dynamics. Together, our study identifies a previously unrecognized cross-regulatory circuit between two IFN-induced antiviral pathways, highlighting how lipid remodeling by CH25h, and potentially by other cellular factors, can contribute to control the behavior of IFITM3.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Senescent cells accumulate in physiological and pathological conditions, including aging. In spite of this, fibroblasts ectopically expressing p16INK4A do not release a SASP nor communicate with the microenvironment. Here, we find that human primary fibroblasts expressing p16INK4A release more small extracellular vesicles (sEV) as part of the SASP than proliferating cells. In addition, we show that sEV isolated from p16INK4A cells are able to mediate paracrine senescence by inducing a growth arrest and DNA damage response in proliferating cells albeit not stimulating the expression of IL-8. Furthermore, we show the transmission of paracrine senescence via sEV is conserved in two cellular models of ageing: expression of progerin, mimicking an accelerated form of ageing, and inducing telomere shortening using a dominant negative mutant. Importantly, sEV isolated from fibroblasts derived from old donors also induce paracrine senescence in fibroblasts derived from young donors. In conclusion, our data indicate that sEV released by senescent and aging cells are an important mechanism of intercellular communication and could potentially explain tissue dysfunction in aging.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

NP cells have adapted to this harsh environment, however, in vitro conditions often fail to recapitulate this environment. Hence, this study aimed to develop media to mimic the conditions of the native NP, with regards to pH, osmolality, glucose, combined with culture in physioxia (5% O2), and determine their effects upon human NP cells and tissue. METHODS: All media utilised low glucose DMEM/serum free conditions with supplements supporting matrix synthesis, based on media recommended for alginate culture (standard media). Healthy media modulated osmolarity (425mOsm/Kg), and pH7.2, degenerate media consisted of 325mOsm/kg and pH6.8. The latter was further supplemented with 100pg/ml IL-1{beta} (degenerate+IL-1{beta} media). NP cells in 3D alginate and NP tissue explants were cultured in these media for up to 2 weeks in physioxia (5% O2) to determine effects on viability, mitochondrial activity, protein expression and secretome. RESULTS: Media osmolarity and pH remained stable and cell viability was not altered by any media composition. Mitochondrial activity was increased during short term cultures, whilst a decrease was seen following 14 days in degenerate media. The secretome of NP cells was differentially affected in healthy or degenerate media, with most increases in catabolic cytokines observed following the addition of IL-1{beta}. Tissue explants showed stability of protein expression of matrix components in both healthy and degenerate+IL-1{beta} media, with limited effects seen on the secretome. DISCUSSION: The media formulations developed here can provide more appropriate environmental conditions in vitro, mimicking more closely the in vivo conditions observed within healthy and degenerate IVDs. The application of which can provide more appropriate culture conditions to test potential therapeutic approaches and understand more fully the pathogenesis of disease using in vitro and ex vivo models.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

However, how the actin network is organized at the cell surface to drive persistent membrane ruffling and macropinocytic cup formation remains unclear. Due to the high curvature of dorsal ruffles, we asked whether membrane curvature-associated proteins, such as those containing F-BAR domains, participate in this process. Here, leveraging public immune transcriptomic profiling and functional assays, we identify Growth Arrest Specific-7 (GAS7) as an F-BAR protein required for membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. GAS7 is enriched at dorsal ruffles and associates with actin regulators, sustaining high levels of active RAC1, to promote ruffle assembly. Moreover, GAS7 restrains the activation of CDC42, a GTPase linked to filopodia formation, cell motility and invasion. As a result, loss of GAS7 reduces ruffling and fluid uptake and instead promotes a phenotype characterized by increased motility, prominent filopodia, altered podosome dynamics, as well as an extracellular matrix-remodelling transcriptional program. Finally, we demonstrate that GAS7 enhances innate surveillance by augmenting the inflammatory response to muramyl dipeptide (NOD2 ligand) and by modulating the kinetics of TLR4 signalling to lipopolysaccharide. Thus, by coordinating RAC1 and CDC42 activities, GAS7 promotes macropinocytic uptake and enhances the macrophage responsiveness to microbial cues, while suppressing a more motile and invasive program.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

ALT is most prominent in osteosarcoma. Although many ALT cells feature loss of the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex, ATRX/DAXX deficiency alone is insufficient to trigger ALT. Here, we provide evidence that Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) acts as a suppressor of the telomeric ALT pathway. TERT-negative osteosarcoma U2-OS (ALT) cells, that normally lack SLFN11 expression, show SLFN11 localization to telomeres upon doxycycline-induced SLFN11 expression. This re-expression markedly suppresses ALT activity, as evidenced by reduced ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and decreased levels of Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). SLFN11 re-expression also attenuates the telomeric DNA damage response (DDR) and induces telomere destabilization in ALT cells. Furthermore, SLFN11 suppresses ALT induction in ATRX-depleted prostate carcinoma DU145 cells. Collectively, our findings identify SLFN11 as a negative telomeric regulator of the ALT pathway, indicating that its loss, together with ATRX/DAXX inactivation, contributes to ALT activation.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Although adipose tissue-secreted factors are implicated in muscle decline, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which carry regulatory cargo such as microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells, may play a key role in this adipose-muscle communication. Methods: EVs were isolated from adipose-conditioned media (ACM) collected from lean and non-lean human donors using ultracentrifugation. Donors were grouped by BMI (lean: 20.7-24.4; non-lean: 25.3-39.3) and age (younger: 31-56 years; older: 60-84 years). EVs were characterised using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), ExoView, nanoscale flow cytometry (CytoFLEX Nano), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Primary human myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes and treated for 24 hours with lean or non-lean EVs (1.3x10^9 particles/ml) or left untreated. Myotube thickness was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy. Transcriptomic changes were assessed by bulk RNA sequencing. EV miRNA cargo was profiled by small RNA-seq and validated by qPCR. The role of miR-150-5p was tested using antagomir inhibition. Results: Non-lean EVs significantly reduced myotube thickness compared to both untreated controls (8.7 +/- 1.66 um vs. 12.4 +/- 1.72 um, p < 0.01) and lean EV-treated myotubes (8.7 +/- 1.66 um vs. 13.2 +/- 3.84 um, p < 0.05), indicating a donor BMI-specific effect. This atrophy was restricted to myotubes derived from older donors. MAFbx expression was significantly increased in response to non-lean EVs (p < 0.05). RNA-seq revealed 471 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EV-treated vs. untreated cells and 293 DEGs between lean and non-lean EV conditions, with enrichment in inflammatory (TNF, IL1B), oxidative stress, mitochondrial, and chromatin pathways. Small RNA-seq identified 7 differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-150-5p and miR-193b-5p, both significantly upregulated in non-lean EVs and validated by qPCR. Inhibiting miR-150-5p partially rescued myotube thickness (10.5 +/- 1.37 um vs. 8.7 +/- 1.66 um, p < 0.05) and reduced MAFbx expression. Conclusions: EVs from non-lean adipose tissue drive muscle atrophy and transcriptional changes in an age-dependent manner. These effects are partially mediated by miR-150-5p, highlighting a mechanistic role for EV cargo in adipose-muscle signalling. Targeting EV-derived miRNAs may offer a novel strategy to combat muscle loss in obesity and ageing.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

In yeast, V-V assembly at the vacuole is mediated by the RAVE complex, but V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells remains less well understood. Here, we systematically define physiological roles of mammalian RAVE. Under basal conditions, mRAVE broadly promotes V-ATPase assembly and organelle acidification. Upon mTORC1 inactivation, mRAVE is recruited to lysosomes and required for the resulting increase in V-ATPase assembly and catabolic activity. Loss of mRAVE disrupts organelle acidification, leading to suppression of lysosomal catabolism, accumulation of dysfunctional lysosomes and compensatory lysosomal exocytosis. Restoring lysosomal pH rescues basal function in mRAVE-deficient cells but not the mTORC1-regulated increase in catabolic activity.

Its best characterized substrates are ubiquitinated proteins that are targeted to the 26S proteasome complex, consisting of a 19S regulatory particle (RP) capping the barrel-shaped 20S core peptidase (CP). The CP can interact with other caps that modulate its function, including Blm10/PA200, a large monomeric protein whose biological function is not well understood. Blm10 is highly upregulated during gametogenesis in budding yeast, suggestive of a natural stage-specific modulation of proteasome composition. Here, we investigate the function Blm10 during yeast gametogenesis, identifying it as a weak activator of the proteasome that can displace the 19S RP from the CP. Due to this competition for the CP, overexpression of Blm10 can lead to attenuation of ubiquitin-dependent degradation and consequent proteostatic defects. Cells lacking Blm10 also display markers of proteostatic stress, including Hsp104 foci and heat sensitivity, suggesting that Blm10 safeguards normal proteostatic balance. We find that Blm10 is important for maintaining gamete fitness and ensuring normal rejuvenation of aged cells following gametogenesis.

To address this, we developed a minimally disruptive workflow to measure the free fraction of hundreds of amines and small peptides at a 7.5-minute cadence for [~]8hrs in freely moving mice using chronic jugular microdialysis implants and chemical isotope labeling Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Single-compound profiles behave according to known physiology, such as purine turnover correlating with movement, delayed histamine/5-HIAA changes, and coordinated amino-acid dynamics. Our multiplexed measures enable high-dimensional analyses that uncover properties of the underlying dynamics. For example, systems-level analyses show that 10 dimensions explain over 70% of the variance in hormone/metabolite covariation, consistent with a low rank description of the physiological state space, with projections aligned to locomotion state transitions. Our work opens avenues for the discovery of hormonal dynamics, compound interactions, and their effects on behavior.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined the pathological specificity of microbleeds by comparing an amyloidosis mouse model (5xFAD) with a small-vessel disease (SVD) model characterized by vascular smooth-muscle cell loss. In vivo multimodal MRI, including gradient-echo, spin-echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging, was complemented by ex vivo high-resolution anatomical scans for validation. Both in vivo and ex vivo gradient-echo MRI consistently revealed hippocampal microbleeds in the 5xFAD model without macroscopic atrophy or ventricular enlargement, whereas no microbleeds or blood-brain barrier disruption were detected in the SVD model. Diffusion-weighted MRI further showed region-specific alterations in apparent diffusion coefficient within the midbrain of 5xFAD mice, but not in other regions or in the SVD cohort. These findings indicate that microbleeds are a pathology-specific marker of amyloid-related vascular injury rather than a general indicator of small-vessel impairment. The combined imaging evidence underscores the potential of microbleeds as a disease-specific biomarker for detecting amyloid-driven vascular fragility and refining diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

To test the role of microglial innate immune signaling in PVI development, we used mice lacking toll-like receptor adaptor MyD88 specifically in microglia. MyD88-deficient microglia showed reduced inflammatory responses but increased early-life phagocytosis of inhibitory synaptic material. In adulthood, males without microglial MyD88 exhibited increased hippocampal PVI density, increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, increased inhibitory signaling, and impaired discrimination behaviors. We determined the cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, which normally drives adult microglial remodeling of the ECM, is developmentally regulated in the hippocampus. MyD88-deficient microglia fail to respond to IL-33, leading to reduced remodeling of the ECM component aggrecan.

Omission testing revealed that prefrontal astrocytes preferentially respond to the cue-reward association, rather than the conditioned stimulus or reward alone.

However, the complex environment of the spinal cord induces unique sources of noise, limiting the quality of spinal fMRI recordings. Various hardware and software solutions have been proposed to address these challenges. Among them, susceptibility-matched padding has gained popularity due its low cost, ease of use, and effectiveness in reducing static B0 field inhomogeneities, which are a major source of artefacts in spinal fMRI. Despite anecdotal evidence, the impact of susceptibility-matched padding on the quality of spinal cord fMRI has not been assessed systematically. We investigated the effects of non-protonated perfluorocarbon liquid-filled padding (SatPad) on B0 field homogeneity and functional echo-planar imaging (EPI) in cervical and lumbar spinal cord in 10 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent two resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, one per cord section. Within each session they were scanned with and without SatPad in a pseudo-randomised order. The use of SatPad increased B0 field homogeneity and improved functional image quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio, timeseries coefficient of variation, DVARS, and ghosting artefacts. While both cervical and lumbar cord data benefited from the use of SatPad, greater effects were observed in the cervical cord. These findings provide a compelling basis for integrating susceptibility-matched padding into routine spinal fMRI protocols.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

This study investigated PLD1 signaling in synaptic integrity and cognition during aging and in a late-onset AD mouse model, hypothesizing differential effects of PLD1 modulation on synaptic vulnerability. AAV2-mediated gene transfer was employed to overexpress (PLD1 OXP) or attenuate (PLD1 ATT) PLD1 in aged wild-type (WT) and 3xTg-AD mice. To validate these constructs, differentiated PC12 cells were utilized. Within these cells, a model of post-mitotic neurons, PLD1 OXP exhibited a notable reduction in both the average neurite length and the percentage of neurite-bearing cells. This suggests that elevated PLD1 activity exerts a significant influence on neurite outgrowth. Conversely, PLD1 ATT did not inhibit neurite formation, indicating it is not detrimental at the cellular level. These cellular findings paralleled in vivo observations - electrophysiological studies revealed PLD1 OXP impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission, particularly in aged WT mice, whereas PLD1 ATT improved synaptic function in 3xTg-AD mice. Behaviorally, PLD1 ATT enhanced spatial working memory and reduced anxiety-like behavior, notably in 3xTg-AD mice. These results highlight that tight PLD1 regulation is vital for maintaining synaptic integrity and cognitive resilience. Thus, PLD1 attenuation may serve as an important complement to immunotherapeutic approaches by strengthening synaptic resilience in neurodysfunctional states, including AD and related dementia (ADRD).", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Via an organoid intermediate stage, the limited healthy donor material was expanded while preserving stemness and subsequently differentiated. Characterisation by spatial and transcriptomic analyses showed that the cellular diversity and architecture of our ALI cultures were comparable to native human lung epithelium. Upon infection with relevant human respiratory pathogens, such as Human Rhinovirus (HRV16) and human Coronaviruses (229E and NL63), only HRV16 induced a strong and early type I and III IFN response, leading to its eventual clearance from the cultures. Depletion of tonic type I/III IFNs using neutralising antibodies or scavengers reduced expression of levels of IFN-stimulated genes and increased infectious HRV production by ~7-10-fold.

Here, we combine yeast complementation assays, in vitro studies, and MD simulations to show that cytoplasmic glutamic acid E136 mediates pH-dependent gating in SsUreI. Mutagenesis in H. pylori/H. hepaticus homologs confirm E136 as a conserved pH sensor across UreI channels.

Several genomic alterations were associated with clinical outcomes, particularly primary refractoriness, including high genomic complexity and mutations in genes regulating plasma cell identity, which predicted resistance to therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed that MM cells from refractory patients exhibited high proliferation signatures and reduced expression of TNFRSF17 (encoding BCMA), while were less enriched for plasma cell-associated transcriptional programs, a phenomenon we term plasma cell identity escape.

A similar expansion of {gamma}{delta} T cells was observed in a longitudinal cohort of infants, from birth to three months of infants followed after intradermal BCG vaccination.

However, the distinct motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations-roles that may inform condition-specific therapeutic strategies-remain unclear. This study aimed to disentangle the respective contributions of motor and cognitive functions, and to assess their modulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twenty-four healthy participants performed a visually cued reaching task in which directional uncertainty was dynamically manipulated by varying the number of targets in real-time. Reaction time was quantified as a behavioural measure. Three stimulation conditions were applied during the preparatory periods between the 'uncertainty' and 'go' cues: no stimulation, regular rTMS at each participant's individual beta frequency, and irregular rTMS. Electroencephalography was used to measure beta-band oscillatory activity. Our results showed that 'uncertainty' cues induced bilateral beta suppression, with greater uncertainty linked to smaller reductions in beta power. Movement-related beta modulation was lateralised to the hemisphere contralateral to the executing hand, where elevated beta power in the pre-'go' cue period predicted longer reaction times. Both regular and irregular rTMS significantly shortened reaction times and attenuated beta event-related desynchronisation. Reductions in beta desynchronisation correlated with improvements in reaction times, suggesting beta desynchronisation reflects a neural threshold for movement initiation. These findings indicate that cortical beta oscillations encode distinct motor and cognitive processes, and that beta frequency rTMS can modulate beta dynamics to facilitate faster movement initiation by lowering this neural threshold.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks.

This snaps the two low-affinity dimers into the very high-affinity circular tetramer, activating the molecules to begin transducing their forward and reverse signals into the cells they are expressed on. Contrary to assumptions that Ephrins do not interact with metals, we show EphrinB2 does indeed bind copper ions at very low micromolar concentrations, a feature consistent with Ephrin ancestry to Cupredoxins. This explains why metal chelators such as EDTA, EGTA, and 8-hydroxyquinoline are potent tetramer inhibitors, as they can bind the EphB arginine-rich copper-like electropositive pocket to compete with EphrinB2 binding.

Phylogenetic placement uses a reference phylogeny and a given evolutionary model to annotate taxonomically environmental DNA. As such, it enables more accurate identification of divergent sequences that may belong to unknown lineages across the Tree of Life. Here we first created the largest dataset of 18S sequences belonging to non-Bilateria metazoans, by curating the sequences found in PR2 database. We then used it as a case study to test the performance of different 18S-based barcodes (V4, V9, and full-length 18S) within a phylogenetic placement framework. Employing a series of sensitivity analyses, we found that the V9 region generally lacks sufficient phylogenetic signal for reliable placements in most of the cases. The V4 region is accurate when the environmental diversity is well represented in the reference tree but struggles with divergent lineages. Full-length 18S overcome short-read limitations and emerges as the most robust option to uncover unknown major clades. Finally, we apply phylogenetic placement to empirical environmental 18S data.

Following exposure, they were tested in the rPVT from 30 - 180 days, and assessed for social recognition memory at 30, 90, and 180 days. At each time point, blood and bone samples were collected for subsequent analysis. We found that acute exposure to 4He ions (25 cGy) significantly impaired sustained attention, resulting in increased lapses in attention, increased reaction time measures, and decreased correct responses. However, exposure to 5 cGy 4He ions only increased some reaction time measures in the rPVT. Both groups displayed impaired social recognition memory. When deficits were found, they persisted for 180 days post-exposure, showing no signs of recovery. Notably, impairments in sustained attention appeared to worsen over time. While these low exposure doses of 4He did not significantly alter overall bone mechanical properties, specific individual parameters of bone strength were affected, and age-related changes likely played a role in observed skeletal integrity changes. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between circulating cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels, and bone biomechanical properties with behavioral performances.

This study aimed to enhance OTCT outcomes by employing microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogels to promote human ovarian graft revascularization. Unlike non-encapsulated tissue grafts, which exhibited early but transient and disorganized host vascular infiltration followed by regression, tissue grafts encapsulated in MAP hydrogels (OvaMAPs) demonstrated delayed yet organized and stable, long-term revascularization. OvaMAPs had significantly greater mouse CD31+ tissue area and vessel length after 3 and 6 weeks post-transplantation in ovariectomized immunodeficient mice compared to non-encapsulated grafts. By 20 weeks, both groups restored physiological estradiol levels (with OvaMAPs reaching 158 pg/mL) and suppressed follicle-stimulating hormone, confirming integration of the grafts with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Notably, OvaMAPs achieved comparable restoration of endocrine function with reduced estradiol variability, indicating more consistent graft function. In conclusion, MAP hydrogel encapsulation promoted long-term graft revascularization and vascular stability after OTCT, ultimately supporting consistent endocrine integration with host physiology.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We investigated bone marrow remodeling in Townes mice by comparing SCD control (SCD-Con) with mice that received total marrow irradiation (TMI) followed by bone marrow transplantation (SCD-TMI-BMT). Multiparametric micro-MRI at 7 T quantified proton density water fraction (PDWF), proton density fat fraction (PDFF), and R2*(1/T2*), and micro-CT assessed trabecular structure in the femur. SCD-Con marrow showed higher water content (elevated PDWF), reduced adiposity (lower PDFF), and imaging features consistent with erythroid hyperplasia and elevated iron burden (shorter T2* with reciprocal increase in R2*). In contrast, SCD-TMI-BMT mice demonstrated smaller R2*, reduced PDWF, and partial restoration of adiposity, accompanied by reciprocal shifts in R2*, consistent with decreased cellular iron and marrow remodeling. Micro-CT revealed an improved trabecular architecture after BMT compared to SCD control. MRI imaging biomarkers aligned with histologic evidence of reduced cellularity and larger adipocyte voids. In conclusion, a TMI-BMT SCD model promotes partial normalization of the marrow microenvironment. Multiparametric MRI with micro-CT provides a practical, non-invasive framework for monitoring marrow remodeling and skeletal health after curative therapy.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

While well-established tools exist for transcriptomics and other omics layers, the development of robust enrichment resources for metabolomics remains comparatively limited. To address this gap, we developed hypeR-GEM, a methodology and associated R package that adapts gene set enrichment analysis to metabolomics. hypeR-GEM leverages genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer reaction-based links between metabolites and enzyme-coding genes, enabling the mapping of metabolite signatures to gene signatures and their subsequent annotation via gene set enrichment analysis. We validated hypeR-GEM using paired metabolomics-proteomics and metabolomics-transcriptomics datasets by assessing whether genes mapped from metabolites significantly overlapped with differentially expressed proteins or transcripts. We further evaluated whether pathways enriched via hypeR-GEM-mapped genes corresponded to those derived from paired proteomic or transcriptomic data. In most datasets analyzed, both the predicted enzyme-coding genes and the associated enriched pathways showed significant concordance with independently derived omics signatures, supporting the utility and robustness of hypeR-GEM. Finally, we applied hypeR-GEM to the analysis of age-associated metabolic signatures from the New England Centenarian Study. The results revealed consistent enrichment of lipid-related pathways, aligning with the well-established role of lipid metabolism in aging, and highlighted additional pathways not captured in the metabolites' annotation, demonstrating hypeR-GEM's practical utility in a real-world use case.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

These sORFs were enriched in pathways related to flagellar assembly, DNA recombination, and transcriptional regulation, which are core processes supporting genome stability and adaptive stress responses. Several previously uncharacterized sORFs occupied hub-like positions within co-expression modules, highlighting their integrative roles in metabolic and regulatory networks.

This study aims to differentiate the influence of gonads versus sex chromosomes on cellular gene expression in the mouse medial septum (MS), a critically understudied brain region. Methods Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing and the Sex Chromosome Trisomy mouse model, we (1) quantified sex differences in cellular gene expression and (2) isolated sex-biasing effects by identifying perturbed cell types, differentially expressed genes, biological pathways, and gene networks, which were integrated with GWAS data to explore links with sex-biased human phenotypes. Results Our analysis revealed that volumetric sex differences in the MS are mirrored by widespread transcriptomic changes across cell types. Critically, genetic effects displayed elevated relevance compared to sex hormones in driving sex-biased gene expression. These effects converge to regulate synaptic/neuronal development, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. Sex chromosome-associated DEGs were enriched for various human disorders, suggesting a cellular and mechanistic basis for their sex-biased patterns. Conclusions Our findings challenge the classical gonad-centric views of sexual differentiation, as the MS displays sex-biased transcriptional regulation driven by sex chromosome-associated effects that are highly relevant for human health.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We combined machine learning with complex-network analysis to quantify how functional connectivity reorganizes across time and hemispheres in resting-state EEG from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including three 5-min sessions: pre-dose (T1), 2 h post-dose (T2), and 4 h post-dose (T3). The cohort consisted of naive ayahuasca users, a population known to exhibit attenuated or more stable acute responses, making the detection of network-level changes particularly challenging. Connectivity was estimated using multiple metrics and sliding windows (10-120 s), and network features were computed and averaged to ensure statistical validity. A representation-selection step identified Spearman correlation and an intermediate temporal scale as optimal, with classification performance peaking at 60-70 s (independent-test AUC and accuracy = 0.93). Linear mixed models revealed a bilateral decrease in eigenvector centrality (weaker hub influence), increased degree heterogeneity in the right hemisphere, and reduced global efficiency in the left. Edge-level analyses localized these effects: Posterior-left connections weakened acutely (lowest at T2), whereas right temporal-central coupling transiently strengthened (highest at T2). Together, these convergent results support a mechanistic summary: as hub-centric shortcuts weaken, communication is increasingly routed through alternative, more distributed and less efficient pathways, with a right-lateralized expression at a later time. Methodologically, the window-optimized, hemisphere-resolved, and edge-validated pipeline extends prior EEG work and highlights temporal scale (approximately 60 s) as a biologically meaningful parameter for detecting psychedelic-induced network reorganization.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Current therapies provide only limited symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for targeted, mechanism-based interventions. Using a C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model (C9-miR) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) motor neurons, we identified significant downregulation of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a calcium-dependent protease family implicated in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that restoring calpastatin function through calpain inhibition with calpeptin or a novel calpastatin-derived peptide ameliorates locomotor deficits and NMJ dysfunction in the C9-miR zebrafish model. These interventions enhance synaptic vesicle turnover and quantal release at the NMJ while improving motor neuron excitability and synaptic integrity in iPSC-derived motor neurons. N-terminomic/TAILS mass spectrometry approaches revealed direct calpain-mediated cleavage of synaptic proteins in motor neurons derived from C9orf72 patients. Proteolysis of key synaptic proteins, such as spectrin, is prevented by calpeptin and calpastatin peptide treatments. Our findings establish the calpastatin/calpain axis as a pivotal regulator of synaptic function in C9orf72-associated ALS and identify it as a promising therapeutic target, offering a novel strategy to restore synaptic transmission and potentially halt disease progression.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

To address this, we performed a systematic review to map the conceptual and methodological diversity of dFC research in PD. Beyond a traditional static synthesis, we developed DynaPD, an open-source interactive application that allows researchers to dynamically explore study designs, analytical pipelines, and reported findings. Our synthesis of 37 eligible studies reveals a landscape defined by methodological contrast. While preprocessing strategies exhibited high variability (divergence), we observed a marked convergence on core analytical choices, specifically the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for parcellation and the sliding-window technique coupled with k-means clustering for state identification. Regarding empirical findings, a consensus emerged on the relevance of specific dynamic features - namely dwell time, fraction time, and number of transitions - yet clinical interpretations varied, particularly concerning the implications of strongly connected versus sparsely connected states. We further identified stated limitations across the studies, including a predominance of cross-sectional designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting standards. These findings highlight the urgent need for longitudinal studies with extended acquisition protocols and standardized reporting frameworks.

M.", "abstract": "Invasive rodents are major contributors to biodiversity loss, particularly on islands where native species have evolved in their absence, rendering them vulnerable to predation. Genetic biocontrol offers a promising suite of species-specific technologies that may contribute to rodent suppression and elimination. Here, we evaluate the potential of Y-linked genome editors (YLEs), which contain a nuclease that disrupts a female-essential fertility or viability gene, to suppress or eliminate a mouse population on a small, isolated island. We benchmark YLEs against other self-limiting genetic biocontrol tools, such as sterile male releases, and self-sustaining tools, such as population suppression gene drives and Y-linked X chromosome-shredders. We use the MouseGD simulation framework to model the inheritance patterns of these systems in the context of rodent life history, calculating elimination probabilities, times to elimination and other outcomes for a range of construct designs, fitness costs and release schemes. We find that YLEs are more efficient than other self-limiting tools, and are capable of achieving rodent elimination within a short timeframe for modest release sizes. For a mouse population size of 10,000, elimination is predicted within five years for releases of 350 males per month, and within ten years for releases of 150 males per month. This scale of production is well within existing capabilities, potentially enabling suppression to encompass a larger spatial scale. We found that elimination could be achieved for YLEs targeting both haploinsufficient and haplosufficient target genes; but for a more restrictive parameter space for the haplosufficient case. Gene drives were predicted to achieve suppression and elimination for smaller release sizes; but also to spread to non-target populations. In contrast, YLEs do not bias inheritance and hence display minimal spillover. Altogether, these characteristics present YLEs as a promising, ecologically-manageable biocontrol tool for elimination of invasive rodents and conservation of native species.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

These GPI-anchored proteins are enriched in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane and serve a variety of functions including acting as receptors and cell adhesion molecules. Human pathogenic variants in GPI biosynthesis pathway enzymes are collectively called inherited GPI deficiencies and lead to several brain anomalies such as global developmental delay, hypomyelination, cerebellar hypoplasia, and premature death. PIGA is the first catalytic enzyme in the GPI anchor biosynthesis cascade, which creates the backbone of all GPI anchors, and PGAP2 is one of the last enzymes in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and modifies the protein-bound anchor for trafficking to the cell membrane. A Nestin-Cre mediated deletion of Piga in the mouse led to early postnatal death and significant structural brain malformations, similar to pathogenic human PIGA variants. While this model provides an opportunity to develop treatments for these neurological phenotypes, we still lack a deep understanding of GPI-anchor functions in brain development. Additionally, there are no studies on Pgap2 in the brain to date. We extended these studies with a series of genetic ablations to precisely determine the role of Piga and Pgap2 in the forebrain, oligodendrocytes, and cerebellum. We find Piga expression in the hindbrain is absolutely required for survival while Pgap2 ablations were much less deleterious.

Participants had to match a target rhythm with either their unseen real hand (RH) grasping movements, or with the movements of a virtual hand (VH) that displayed their actual movements after a constant time delay. Visual movement feedback was, consequently, either task-relevant (VH task) or a distractor (RH task).

However, the high inter-individual variability in gut microbiota complicates the identification of pathogenic mechanisms using traditional methods. In contrast, the smaller variability in gut microbial metabolites offers a more reliable and consistent basis for cross-individual comparisons. Result: Parsimonious Flux Balance Analysis (pFBA), integrated with Double Machine Learning (DoubleML), identified 17 metabolites significantly associated with hypertension (p < 0.05, RobustnessV alue > 0.1). These included meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, cellobiose, dextran 40 (1,6--D-glucan), L-glutamic acid, kestopentaose, among others. Differential microbial correlation network analysis identified a key microbial sub-network, the FERM guild, consisting of 19 species, with prominent genera including Faecalibacterium, Enterobacter, Roseburia, and Methanobrevibacter. Using GSEA, the dysregulation of this guild was found to be strongly associated with a set of 17 hypertension-related metabolites(p = 0.017). Further analysis revealed that the contribution of FERM genus to key metabolites is significantly associated with blood pressure (p < 0.05), even without significant differences in their abundance; additionally, an imbalance exists between FERM genus and other species. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that hypertension is associated with a disruption of gut microbial diversity, structure, and metabolic function. Seventeen key metabolites related to blood pressure regulation were identified, exhibiting pro- or anti-hypertensive potential and linked to functional microbial modules. These results highlight the gut microbiota and its metabolites as promising targets for therapeutic intervention in hypertension.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

This progressive neurodegenerative disorder also poses a severe mental and financial burden to caregivers and society. Despite a major thrust on research for therapy development, no significant progress has been made; only temporary management options are currently available. To this end, we have reported azadiradione (AZD), a triterpenoid that we isolated from neem seed extract using a cell-based assay. AZD showed high efficacy in ameliorating protein aggregation-induced pathology and symptoms in fruit flies and mice. Current evidence suggests that AZD functions through activating the transcriptional function of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a master regulator of protein quality control pathways, without modulating the cellular redox balance. To better understand the pharmacophore of AZD, a triterpenoid in its observed function, we have analysed various structural derivatives, focusing on their HSF1-activating function in vitro and their efficacies in ameliorating protein aggregation-induced toxicities in cell and mouse models. Our analyses, based on real-time PCR, immunoblots, fluorescent anisotropy, and a mouse model of MPTP-induced PD, highlighted Epoxy-azadiradione (Epoxy) as being as efficient as AZD in in vivo functional tests, albeit activating the promoter binding activity of HSF1 with at least two-fold higher efficacy in vitro. Notably, similar to AZD, Epoxy did not induce cellular redox imbalance. We also incorporated molecular docking analyses involving the published crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of HSF1 bound to its DNA recognition element to study molecular dynamics-based energy estimation. The analysis revealed a higher energy stability of the epoxy-bound complexes, as indicated by a significant decrease in binding free energy ({Delta}G) estimated from an ensemble of intermediate docked complex structures.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, we report that KIT-8, a synthetic alkyl ether lipid, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects despite its inability to be converted into plasmalogens within cells unlike its analog KIT-13, which is known to generate plasmalogens. Remarkably, KIT-8 activates key intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf') expression in Neuro2A cells, thereby mimicking the actions of both KIT-13 and natural plasmalogens. Furthermore, KIT-8 significantly improves memory function in mice, underscoring its inherent therapeutic potential. Importantly, the biological activity of KIT-8 suggests that plasmalogen synthesis is not required for its functional effects, introducing a novel concept in ether lipid biology. Supporting this notion, we identified additional alkyl ether lipid analogs, KIT-19 and KIT-20, which also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties despite lacking the ability to generate plasmalogens. These findings indicate that the ether bond structure alone may be sufficient to confer biological activity. To explore this further, we designed and synthesized a series of structurally distinct alkyl ether lipids (KIT compounds) retaining an ether bond at the sn-2 position. In an LPS-induced inflammatory model using mouse-derived microglial MG6 cells, selected compounds KIT-8, KIT-19, and KIT-20 significantly suppressed NF-{kappa}B signaling, reduced p65 nuclear translocation, and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta} and NOS2. Given the cognitive benefits associated with plasmalogens in Alzheimer's disease, our findings position alkyl ether lipids as promising standalone bioactive molecules, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuronal function independently of plasmalogen synthesis.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Precise electrode placement also reduces between-subject variability. Using in-scanner tDCS, accuracy and precision of electrode placement can be determined. Previous studies manually segmented electrode positions from structural MRI, a process that is time-consuming and prone to error. We therefore developed an algorithm that automatedly extracts electrode coordinates from structural MRI. Methods: We applied this algorithm to 49 datasets acquired at different field strengths (3 T and 7 T), with two image resolutions and electrode montages (bifrontal or ring-shaped) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We validated its accuracy by comparing the automatedly extracted coordinates with manual annotations from two independent readers. We then used the actual and intended electrode coordinates to simulate how electrode placement deviations influenced the resulting electric field. Results: For all setups and scanners, the median localization error of the algorithm was 2.3 mm. It was within 1 mm of the variability between human readers (2.7 mm), indicating human-level reliability. Large deviations (> 20 mm) from intended positions led to substantial changes in the electric field - up to 35% for the ring-shaped montage - highlighting the need for placement verification in tDCS studies. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm obviates the need for manual electrode segmentation and allows an objective evaluation of electrode placement accuracy and precision for in-scanner tDCS. It may be used to relate electrode position errors to stimulation effects, thereby supporting reproducible tDCS research.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Rhythmicity in BAM scavenging is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1, mediated by the endocytic receptor CD206, and perturbed with age. In a mouse model of AD, we show that deletion of Bmal1 in BAMs worsens perivascular and leptomeningeal amyloid-beta plaque burden.

K.", "abstract": "Objective: Neuromodulation therapies are becoming increasingly common as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders and deficits. Despite their widespread use, the frameworks used to evaluate device longevity and electrochemical safety are limited, producing variable results for platinum (Pt) electrodes across studies. In addition, next-generation neuromodulation electrodes like thin-film microelectrode arrays (TFMEAs) are more prone to failure by virtue of their smaller size, higher edge to bulk ratios, and greater sensitivity to electrochemical dissolution processes. Two potential contributors to the variability in reported electrochemical safety limits and device performance are particularly sensitive to scaling electrodes to smaller geometries, namely: 1) insufficient measurement device input impedance and 2) unmitigated stimulator leakage currents. Approach: To explore these effects, we first characterize the impact of electrode size (1.27 x 10-4 to 7.85 x 10-3 cm2) on apparent open circuit potential (VaOCP) and interpulse potential (VIPP) measurements at platinum electrodes across measurement instrumentation configurations. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used DC mitigation strategies, including stimulation with capacitive coupling (CC), and with capacitive coupling combined with cathode/anode shorting after each pulse (CC+ES), as a function of electrode size. Main Results: Without proper DC mitigation, insufficient measurement input impedance leads to an underestimation of DC offsets ({Delta}VIPP) and, consequently, overestimation of charge injection limit (Qinj) at Pt electrodes. In contrast, when DC offsets are properly mitigated and the input impedance of the measurement device is sufficient, the experimentally derived charge injection limits for Pt electrodes are larger than what has been reported historically. Significance: By identifying the instrumentation-related confounds biasing measurements of electrochemical safety limits, this work provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of Qinj for safety, as well as a framework for identifying and mitigating DC offset as a potential source of variability in electrophysiological findings across studies using TFMEAs.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Using both one-hot encodings and protein language model (PLM) embeddings, we developed a quantitative framework to map immune receptor organization at global (sequence-set-level) and local (single-sequence-level) scales. Applying the geometry-aware Wasserstein-2 distance, we show that the global structure of the AIRR space can be recovered from as few as ~105 sequence embeddings, at least 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretical immune receptor diversity. We found that immune receptor sequences annotated with different antigen specificities occupy distinct regions of representation space. To resolve local relationships, we introduce a spatial homogeneity metric that quantifies the extent of functional clustering. We found higher spatial homogeneity in embedding spaces than in sequence space for diverse antigen-specific datasets.

Both environments exert selective pressures on rhizobia, influencing the reproductive success of individual strains (e.g., fitness). The soil, a heterogeneous and fluctuating environment, is often overlooked, and little is known about whether selection in the soil influences the outcomes of the rhizobia-legume mutualism. We exposed a mixture of 68 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains to eight soil treatments (temperature, osmotic, and texture perturbations) and selection by two Medicago plant hosts. We found that cold (4{degrees}C) and warm (32{degrees}C) temperatures, as well as salt addition, had the strongest effects on diversity, community composition, or population size. Strain relative fitness was strongly positively correlated among soil treatments, except for cold. Genome-wide association analysis revealed a complex genetic architecture for soil fitness. In contrast, when comparing rhizobial fitness between soil and host environments, we found minimal strain fitness correlations, suggesting independent genetic bases and habitat-specific adaptations. Lastly, by examining the relationship between rhizobial fitness in the soil and their nitrogen-fixing plant benefits, we found that soil selection influenced the relative abundance of high- and low-quality strains; However, whether these effects were positive or negative for the plant was host dependent.

Anthropogenic stressors can transform riverine macroinvertebrate communities, yet the consequences of such transformations to the fishes that feed on them are poorly understood. Changes in any combination of food 'abundance', 'accessibility' or 'quality' may be referred to as changes in the 'foodscape' of fishes. Stressor-driven increases of inaccessible prey that are difficult for fish to detect, capture or ingest, may render foodscapes less profitable to fishes. We examined how nutrient enrichment, fine sediment, acid mine drainage (AMD), flooding and drying reshape fish foodscapes by altering the accessibility of macroinvertebrate prey for two New Zealand river fishes, Galaxias vulgaris and Gobiomorphus breviceps. We determined relative accessibility of macroinvertebrate taxa and traits to these fishes by comparing the abundance of prey taxa and traits in the environment with their corresponding abundances in fish diets. To make these comparisons, invertebrate and fish gut samples were collected from the same river reaches, at the same times, over three years. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of fish gut contents facilitated efficient diet characterisation of over 700 fish guts. Finally, to determine how multiple stressors might affect fish foodscapes, we related invertebrate trait-specific accessibilities to published data defining how the composition of those macroinvertebrate traits varies along stressor gradients. Macroinvertebrate traits that were most accessible to fishes were those promoting detection (e.g., active foraging behaviours exhibited by 'crawlers' and 'scrapers') and ingestion (e.g., moderate size, morphologies lacking defensive structures), typical of mayfly and free-living caddisfly larvae. In contrast, prey with traits inhibiting detection (e.g., small size and burrowing behaviour) and ingestion by gape-limited fishes (e.g., large size), were less accessible to the fishes we studied. Trait abundance-stressor relationships revealed that that increasing fine sediment, nutrients, AMD and drying, and decreased flooding frequency, favoured macroinvertebrates with traits that erode accessibility to fishes. These results show that multiple stressors may decrease the profitability of fish foodscapes by filtering out macroinvertebrate prey with traits promoting accessibility to fishes. Food web approaches to understanding multi-stressor impacts are rare, but are necessary to understand how the effects of multiple stressors on primary consumers then go on to affect predators of higher trophic position. A major barrier to fish foodscape research is the difficulty and cost of estimating trophic networks. We discuss how eDNA metabarcoding, coupled with trait-based approaches may help overcome these barriers, enabling generalisable assessments of foodscape changes caused by multiple stressors.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Because the rewards of public goods are freely available to everyone in a group, they are potentially vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters. Classic kin selection models offer solutions to this public goods dilemma in terms of why public goods investment can be favoured, while game theoretical models offer insights into the conditions where exploitative cheaters can persist. However, existing theory does not provide a unified framework for understanding how much individuals should actually invest in altruism or how this investment strategy relates to why cheaters can coexist with altruists. Here we fill this gap by considering how resource allocation trade-offs shape the generosity of altruists, how this investment decision, in turn, sets the conditions for cheater coexistence, and how local competition impacts these outcomes. We find that, whenever altruists can evolve the optimal level of public goods investment, they exclude cheaters, revealing that stable altruists/cheater coexistence requires overly generous altruists, an outcome frequently driven by mechanistic constraints that limit the range of behaviours in biological systems. Importantly, we show that local competition tends to prevent such coexistence.

Conditional knockout mouse models are indispensable for studying gene function in complex organ systems. The Short Conditional intrON (SCON) system accelerates the generation of such models by inserting the artificial SCON into a coding exon. SCON is designed to splice out after transcription, without affecting gene expression. Upon Cre activity, SCON is converted into the {Delta}SCON allele which cannot be spliced out, introducing premature termination codons (PTCs) to inactivate the gene. Previous validation of the SCON system in mice has focused primarily on phenotypic outcomes. Here, we provide a molecular characterization of the SCON system in Cdh12, a candidate gene implicated in kidney damage in CAKUT. We found that both Cdh12-SCON and Cdh12-{Delta}SCON alleles caused unintended skipping of the exon downstream of the insertion site, culminating in a frameshift and PTC. Consequently, the Cdh12-SCON allele led to a ~25% reduction in mRNA expression, indicating that it was not transcriptionally inert as designed. Despite unintended exon skipping, the Cdh12-{Delta}SCON allele still effectively suppressed mRNA expression.

HPLC analysis of (GlcNAc)n cleavage by MoChia1 revealed that it specifically recognizes the {beta}-anomer of the substrate at the + 1 subsite and cleaves the terminal glycosidic linkage at the reducing end. It also hydrolyzed the partially deacetylated chitotrisaccharide GlcN-(GlcNAc)2 to GlcN-GlcNAc and GlcNAc, but not (GlcN)2-GlcNAc, indicating the requirement of the N-acetyl group at the -1 subsite for the hydrolytic reaction. MoChia1 released p-nitrophenol from pNP-(GlcNAc)2, p-nitrophenyl di-N-acetyl-chitotrioside.

Here we systematically probed the folding of a library of indel variants in the DHFR protein using a sensitive yeast-based protein folding reporter. We show that deletion of Ubr1 or San1 leads to a greater fraction of folded DHFR indel variants, primarily positioned towards the N- and C-terminal regions in DHFR. Intriguingly, most of the DHFR indels that are structurally stabilized in the E3 knockout strains, are also stabilized at lowered temperatures and upon binding the DHFR inhibitor methotrexate.

E.; Natesan, S.", "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are bioactive lipids that regulate numerous physiological functions in humans. Cell signaling by LPAs is mediated mainly via six LPA receptors (LPA1-6), class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among these, LPA1 is recognized to play an essential role in cell proliferation, survival, migration, and tumorigenesis. Despite the structural similarity, 18:0-LPA and 18:1-LPA exhibit distinct functional responses in cell lines overexpressing LPA1. Specifically, our in vitro studies show that 18:1-LPA induces greater Erk activation than 18:0-LPA in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. The structural basis underlying this differential receptor activation has not been previously studied. Using classical molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques, we examined the access and binding mechanisms of the two LPA species to the active state LPA1 receptor. The results show that 18:0-LPA and 18:1-LPA adopt distinct and dynamic poses in the orthosteric pocket despite their similar starting configurations. Mainly, the alkyl tails of the ligands exhibit distinct orientations and residue interactions, leading to differential conformational changes in key activation switches on the conserved CWxP and PIF structural motifs of the receptor. Also, there are significant differences in interhelical interactions at the intracellular end of the transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, and 7. These distinct arrangements lead to striking differences in LPA1 interactions with the G-helix of the heterotrimeric Gi-protein. Notably, 18:0-LPA and 18:1-LPA exhibit similar membrane partitioning characteristics and receptor entry processes through aqueous paths.

By using deuterated fatty acids as Raman probes (Rp), we can determine their local concentrations within cells, taking into account, for example, accumulation in lipid droplets, ER or membranes. Monitoring the incubation time and distribution of Rp allows for the assessment of the rate of lipid uptake and accumulation in the cell. Therefore, RS spectroscopy methods can be used to study the kinetics of lipid transport and metabolism, key in fluxomics. We quantitatively calibrate the C-D band intensities using deuterated lipid standards and compare the RS results with LC-MS and MF data to verify the quantitative accuracy of the Raman method.

As a result, even PSF-limited resolution is often undersampled. Here we demonstrate photon superlocalization as a strategy to mitigate this tradeoff. On intensified detectors, individual photons form multi-pixel detection clouds that can be centroided and reassigned to a finer virtual grid, thereby increasing the effective sampling frequency without optical modifications or FoV penalty. Proof-of-principle epifluorescence and light-sheet experiments show that photon superlocalization restores near-PSF-limited resolution and reveals subcellular structure otherwise obscured by undersampling.

Among the different subtypes of breast cancer, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) has a more favorable prognosis; however, patients can experience cancer recurrence 10 years or more after initial diagnosis. Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) are slowly proliferating cells that drive metastasis and resistance to therapies that target rapidly proliferating tumor cells. BCSC self-renewal and survival pathways make them difficult to eliminate; no selective therapeutics currently exist to target them. Our research aims to use mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) as an oncolytic agent to eliminate BCSCs. Methods: We evaluated the effects of three different MRV strains (T3D, T1L and R2) under both 2D and 3D culture conditions (which enrich for BCSCs) in parental and paclitaxel resistant (TaxR) MCF7 cells using cell viability assays, flow cytometry, western blotting, and tumorsphere assays. We identified differentially expressed genes in response to T1L by RNA sequencing. Novel MRV strains were developed by serial passaging of the parental T1L strain in TaxR BCSCs, leading to the isolation and sequencing of three distinct MRV clones. The novel MRV clones were assessed for their oncolytic effects using the aforementioned techniques alongside inhibitor-based studies targeting cell death pathways. Results: Notably, at least two clones (T1L SP B and T1L SP C) demonstrated enhanced oncolytic potency compared to the parent T1L strain against MCF7 TaxR BCSCs, even though their infectivity and viral protein synthesis was reduced. Whole genome sequencing of the viral clones identified changes in viral protein sequences that correlate with enhanced potency against BCSCs. T1L, T1L SP B and T1L SP C induced apoptosis; however, T1L SP B may induce a more immunogenic form of cell death in the TaxR cells, as indicated by the increased release of extracellular ATP (eATP), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which is associated with immunogenic cell death. Conclusions: In summary, we developed novel oncolytic viruses promote oncolysis in therapy-resistant BCSCs. We found that T1L SP B induces apoptosis in a more immunogenic manner, highlighting the potential of these viruses to eliminate BCSCs and stimulate the immune system.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Six transmembrane epithelial antigen 1 (STEAP1) is a cell surface antigen transcriptionally controlled by EWS::FLI1 that is broadly expressed in EwS, positioning it as a rational immunotherapy target. However, translating CAR T therapy to solid tumors requires overcoming barriers to potency while maintaining safety. Methods: Analyses of transcriptome and proteome data were performed to evaluate the effects of EWS::FLI1 perturbation on STEAP1 expression at the transcript and protein levels in EwS models. STEAP1 expression was validated in EwS patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. Second-generation STEAP1-BB{zeta} CAR T cells were tested in orthotopic and disseminated EwS xenograft models. To enhance antitumor activity, an IL-18-armored STEAP1 CAR was engineered. Dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy and safety were evaluated through measurement of tumor burden, survival, and observation for gross toxicities. Results: STEAP1 was expressed in ~97% of primary EwS tumors and directly associated with EWS::FLI1 fusion protein expression in EwS cell lines. In orthotopic EwS models, STEAP1 CAR T cells induced complete tumor regression at 5 x 10^6 cells. In disseminated disease models, responses were dose-dependent with no evidence of antigen loss. Notably, IL-18 armored STEAP1 CAR T cells achieved complete responses in ~80% of mice at a reduced dose of 10^6 cells without overt toxicity. Conclusions: These data establish STEAP1 as a clinically relevant and highly expressed target in EwS and demonstrate that IL-18 armoring significantly improves CAR T cell efficacy by enhancing potency evident through antitumor activity at reduced cell dose. STEAP1 CAR T cells are currently under evaluation in a first-in-human phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NCT06236139) and these studies support future clinical translation of STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory EwS.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Using Xenium in situ technology in FFPE human breast samples, we address two challenges in the cancer field: 1. achieving reliable normalization of gene expression across heterogeneous sample populations; 2. identifying biomarkers that predict invasion or metastasis. We describe a scalable approach to identify low-variation housekeeping (HK) genes within any given sample set, then use those HK genes for cross- and intra-sample normalization of biomarkers. Analyzing 12 FFPE human breast samples--primarily ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)--with a custom 280-gene panel, we identified four HK genes (EEF1G, EEF2, MALAT1, and RPLP0) that exhibited minimal variability in tumor cells, four tumor cell biomarkers (LDHA, SDC1, PIGR, SFRP1) that increased or decreased with tumor grade, and one tumor-associated myoepithelial biomarker (LAMC2). Normalizing biomarkers to the four HK genes preserved the dynamic range of expression necessary for distinguishing tumor grades, outperforming HKs from legacy RT-PCR diagnostic panels. Lastly, we employed a cell-agnostic approach in the tumor periphery to quantify MMP11, a biomarker correlated with proliferative and potentially pre-invasive ducts.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying single ventricle PAVMs are poorly understood. To comprehensively evaluate molecular changes post-Glenn, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on rat lung samples after Glenn surgery. Methods: Using adult Sprague Dawley rats, we performed scRNAseq on unfiltered lung samples 3 weeks after left-sided Glenn or sham surgery. We compared endothelial cell (EC) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in our model to two mouse models of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a hereditary condition characterized by visceral AVMs. Finally, we modified the vitamin A (Vit A) content of Glenn and sham rat diets and re-assessed PAVM shunting and EC transcriptional differences. Results: Using scRNAseq (n=4 Glenn, n=4 sham), we identified 13 transcriptionally distinct lung cell clusters, including 3 EC clusters (general, capillary, lymphatic), with pronounced differences between Glenn and sham in the general EC cluster (~17% of genes). Comparison to HHT mouse models confirmed overlap of ~18% of DEGs, including identification of significantly downregulated genes involved in and regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) signaling in all 3 models. Dietary deficiency of Vit A intake, a precursor of ATRA, caused increased PAVM shunting (p<0.01) that was mitigated with excess dietary Vit A intake. Lastly, EC-specific RNAseq identified Vit A diet-induced gene expression differences, including regulation of PI3K signaling. Conclusions: In this study, we report the novel application of scRNAseq to study mechanisms underlying single ventricle PAVMs in a surgical rat model. We identified multiple dysregulated biological processes in rat lung ECs post-Glenn, including decreased ATRA signaling and conserved gene expression patterns with HHT.

In this work, the potential of this underground metabolism as a source of novel phenotypes has been assessed in the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. To accomplish this, the high-quality genome-scale metabolic model iJN1462 was updated and expanded by the known set of promiscuous activities in this organism. The new metabolic space was explored to detect latent metabolic traits that could emerge through adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) in order to broaden the range of available nutrients for P. putida. Using ALE, strains capable to degrade N-acetyl-L-alanine, an overproduced metabolite in HIV patients, were obtained. A multidisciplinary characterization of these evolved strains revealed that adaptation arose through synergistic and additive effects involving modifications in enzymes and transcription factors.

Emerging evidence suggests that the soluble epoxide hydrolase may be a promising therapeutic target due to the involvement of sEH-derived diols in inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular destabilization. APPPS1 mice were crossed with an inducible soluble epoxide hydrolase knock-out mouse line. The knock-out was induced before onset of amyloid deposition, and then the mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and RNA sequencing techniques. Here, we identify astrocytic soluble epoxide hydrolase as a key mediator of vascular instability in Alzheimer's disease. Targeted astrocyte-specific deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase in APPPS1 mice dramatically mitigated vascular changes, reducing the vascular amyloid burden by 67.95% and preserving VE-cadherin architecture. Importantly, vasomotion was markedly impaired in the Alzheimer's disease model and was preserved in soluble epoxide hydrolase-deficient animals.

Stable, larger spines are thought to support memory, but the high turnover of dendritic spines and the drifting of neuronal representations following memory formation suggest alternative possibilities. To elucidate a structural trace underlying memory retention, we utilize a mouse model of artificial hibernation. During hibernation, hippocampal neurons exhibited a substantial reduction in their activity and an extensive elimination of dendritic spines and synapses. Despite these changes, their memory and associated hippocampal neuronal representations are intact after arousal. We find that a subset of spines is maintained during hibernation. These spatially clustered engram-engram synapses are exclusively protected from elimination and characterized by synaptic contacts with multi-synaptic boutons. These findings suggest that synaptic engram architecture, rather than larger spines per se, is resilient to network remodeling and underlies long-term memory retention.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The exploration and consolidation of the motor strategy are usually considered to be segregated respectively between task practice and rest periods. Here we show that two types of offline reactivations of neuronal representations of locomotor strategies in a brain-wide motor circuit are associated with exploration and retention. During short rests between trials, replays of these brainwide representations predict subsequent shifts in strategies indicating that distributed offline processes participate in strategy exploration. Shifts in strategy are consolidated, and their retention follows population reactivation in cerebellar sleep spindles and stabilization of cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity patterns, consistent with the role of spindles in brain plasticity. Overall, motor strategy optimization and consolidation are supported by two intertwined but distinct types of offline distributed reactivation events involving interregional interactions.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, disrupts oligodendrocyte homeostasis through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a transcription factor essential for oligodendrocyte maturation, in AD-related glial dysfunction. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we observed aberrantly induced maturation dynamics and reduced oligodendrocyte lineage cell density at 12 months in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by increased MYRF expression. Interestingly, sustained MYRF overexpression was found to be toxic for oligodendrocytes in vitro. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that A{beta} exposure elevates MYRF protein levels and enhances its transcriptional activity, pointing to post-translational regulation. Mechanistically, A{beta} impaired GSK3-dependent phosphorylation and Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination of MYRF, prolonging N-MYRF stability, an effect prevented by PKC inhibition in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of PKC inhibitor Go6983 normalized MYRF levels, restored oligodendrocyte populations and myelin integrity, and improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice, with locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior remaining unaffected. Together, these findings identify MYRF dysregulation as a mechanistic link between A{beta}/PKC signaling and oligodendrocyte pathology, and highlight PKC inhibition as a potential strategy to restore oligodendroglial function and cognition in AD.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Among 123 fine-grained cell states in 27 cell types, we discovered that previously uncharacterized cell states, such as GZMK+GZMH+HLA-DR+ effector memory CD8+ T cells (double-positive [DP] EMCD8), FAM13A+CDK6+ naive CD4+ T cells, and ARHGAP15+FOXO1+ T cells, expanded especially in severe SLE.

However, there are very few therapeutic IgG fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that have shown efficacy thus far. We therefore hypothesized that the memory B cell (Bmem) compartment of individuals who have recovered from infection may be dominated by non-protective IgG molecules but encode some antibodies that are protective. We therefore produced hmAbs from a library of Bmem-encoded IgG1 sequences. Most TcdB-specific hmAbs displayed low affinity binding and poor neutralization of TcdB in vitro while a few hmAbs had high affinity binding and good TcdB neutralization. The results correlated with in vivo studies in which high affinity, TcdB-neutralizing hmAbs provided moderate protection of C57Bl/6 mice against C. difficile disease. Similar protection was observed in Tg32 mice expressing the human FcRn transgene, indicating that gut delivery of hmAb did not account for limited efficacy.

These could be reduced if the toxins were delivered by effector cells that specifically infiltrate cancers, thereby releasing toxins locally into the tumor microenvironment. One of the challenges underlying this strategy is that cells delivering toxins would have to be resistant to them. We address this obstacle by showing that effectors derived from transformed human cell lines genetically engineered for resistance to bacterial adenosine diphosphate ribosylating toxins (ADPRTs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE), can produce targeted immunotoxins that specifically kill cancer cells expressing cognate tumor-associated antigens. Resistance to immunotoxins was achieved by knockout of genes in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway (DPH1-4) required for the posttranslational modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) that is the target of ADPRTs, or by mutation of EEF2 itself. We show that engineering resistance to ADPRTs, one of the most potent toxins acting on human cells, is essential to achieve robust function of armored effectors derived from cell lines. This work establishes a first step on the path to equip effector cells with the ability to deliver powerful toxins to cancer cells and introduces a platform to investigate extension to primary autologous or allogeneic therapeutic cell types.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Although the mechanism of TH synthesis in vertebrates has been well described, it remains elusive in invertebrates due to the lack of identified orthologs of the thyroglobulin (TG), the protein precursor for TH synthesis3,4. Here, we identified a functional TG protein encompassing multiple TG type 1 (Tg1)-domains, encoded by the ScTg-like gene in proto-vertebrate ascidian Styela clava based on the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry combined with phylogenetic and expression pattern analyses. In vitro iodination experiments demonstrated that ScTG-like has the capacity to provide hormonogenic sites for TH synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo gene knockdown of ScTg-like revealed that the larval metamorphosis was significantly inhibited as a consequence of diminished TH levels, indicating that ScTg-like is responsible for the production of endogenous TH. Additionally, an invaginated follicle-like structure was first discovered at the central anterior of the larval trunk where both ScTG-like protein and THs were deposited, suggesting that this structure serves as the location for THs synthesis and storage, functionally similar to vertebrate thyroid follicles. Moreover, we analyzed the structural features of ScTG-like protein and detected the similarly organized Tg1-containing proteins in multiple bilaterian phyla, suggesting that endogenous TH synthesis may be an ancestral, possibly synapomorphic, trait of bilaterians.

Objectives: To characterize how exposure to exogenous opioids during brain development affects learning and memory performance, our lab has developed a rat model of perigestational opioid exposure that closely recapitulates a clinically relevant dosing timeline by beginning morphine exposure before pregnancy and continuing through the first postnatal week. Male and female offspring generated from this model were assessed on several facets of learning and memory during adolescence. Results: Here, we report that morphine exposure selectively impaired spatial learning, as measured by the Barnes Maze, and associative learning, as measured by an Attentional Set Shift Task, without significantly impacting working or short-term memory. Environmental enrichment rescued the spatial learning deficit in males but not females.

Across multiple large-scale datasets using stem cell and organoid models, we establish a robust SNP-IC threshold of approximately 50, above which cells can be reliably assigned to their donor of origin.

Adults and children with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are at risk of experiencing lifelong complications such as hemorrhagic strokes, neurological deficits, and epileptic seizures. These complications can severely reduce quality of life. At present, there is no safe or effective therapeutic option for the long-term treatment of CCMs. Methods. Using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models, powered by the Benevolent Platform, we aimed to identify therapeutic drug targets for CCM pathology (e.g., CCM1, CCM2, CCM3). An AI integrative approach utilized various data types from biomedical entities, including diseases, genes, tissues, and biological mechanisms, together with CCM transcriptomic experimental data. High-throughput drug screening of AI-selected FDA-approved medications, analyses of mitochondrial morphology, and studies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology were conducted in CCM animal models to identify drugs that could potentially be repurposed for the long-term treatment of CCM disease. Results. AI predicted the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways as potential therapeutic targets that contribute to CCM pathology. High-content screening validation revealed that the FDA-approved drug metformin, which acts as an AMPK agonist and mTOR inhibitor, can reverse changes in cell-cell junction organization and increase KLF4 expression, a marker for CCM, in human CCM endothelial cells in cultured assays. In addition, pharmacodynamic markers of metformin were observed in CCM mouse models (Slco1c1-iCreERT2;Krit1fl/fl;Ptenfl/wt and Slco1c1-iCreERT2;Pdcd10fl/fl) including reduced S6 kinase or ribosomal protein phosphorylation, a marker of decrease mTOR signaling, and increased AMPK phosphorylation, a marker of AMPK activation, that corresponded to reduced lesion burden. Pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies in CCM animal models showed that that metformin penetrates the brain and long-term administration has a favorable safety profile. We also demonstrated that brain endothelial cells in chronic CCM mouse models exhibit increased levels of the inflammatory marker VCAM-1, which is associated with altered mitochondrial phenotypes, as observed by immunofluorescence, MITO-tagging, and electron microscopy analysis. Additionally, we discovered that metformin and a potent AMPK activator, PF-06409577, can reverse mitochondrial phenotypic changes in brain endothelial cells and reduce the elevation of VCAM-1 expression associated with chronic CCM disease. Therefore, metformin can provide cytoprotection and may reverse the CCM endothelial phenotype by activating AMPK. Conclusions. Predictions using AI technology and high-throughput drug screening, combined with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological studies in CCM animal models, identified metformin as a promising drug candidate for repurposing for the long-term treatment of CCM disease. We propose that metformin enhances metabolic adaptation to brain vascular malformations by activating AMPK, which helps reverse mitochondrial fragmentation in brain endothelial cells.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Invasive recordings in primary motor cortex (M1) indicate that shared neural populations support both phases by unfolding within orthogonal subspaces or \"manifolds\", yet whether and how these dynamics evolve across the broader set of brain regions involved in memory-guided skilled action remains poorly understood. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) data obtained during a memory-guided delayed finger-sequence task to track fast population dynamics across M1, premotor cortices, and the hippocampus. Linear discriminant analysis decoding of sequence-specific preparatory and execution patterns revealed a transition from preparation to execution patterns across all regions prior to movement onset. Importantly, the onset of execution exhibited region-specific timing, with M1 shifting last, {approx} 100 ms before the first button press, consistent with the established cortical motor hierarchy. Low-dimensional trajectories showed that preparatory and execution states occupied distinct manifolds, yet were not fully orthogonal, suggesting partial overlap in tuning. MEG dynamics were dominated by peri-movement phase activity in primary motor and premotor regions. Nevertheless, above-chance sequence decoding was recoverable from all motor and premotor regions during execution, and in M1 during preparation. The state shift and the decoding accuracy was driven by distributed modulations across multiple frequency bands, indicating that full-band population dynamics carry richer information than band-limited features alone. These results demonstrate that non-invasive MEG can resolve continuous, hierarchical neural state transitions in the human brain in the context of memory-guided movement control. They offer mechanistic insight into distributed motor-related brain dynamics and support developing brain-computer-interfaces that incorporate signals from multiple brain regions beyond the primary motor cortex.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Singh, S.; Collins, H. Y.; Emery, B.; Call, C. L.; Monk, K.", "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a widespread role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Cannabinoid receptors like CB1 and CB2 can be activated with exogenous cannabinoids most popularly known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD). The components of the ECS are expressed early in fetal development, and prenatal exposure to cannabis can lead to structural changes in white matter. White matter is composed of neuronal axons ensheathed in myelin, a lipid-rich insulation that facilitates saltatory conduction and maintains axon integrity. In the CNS, myelin is made by specialized glial cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs), which in addition to neurons also express components of the ECS. However, while several studies have focused on how the ECS regulates neuronal development, there is a limited understanding of its impact on OL development or myelin formation. Therefore, our current study set out to understand how pharmacological activation of the ECS alters OL differentiation and myelin formation in vivo. We administered WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55), a CB1 and CB2 agonist, to larval zebrafish and longitudinally analyzed OL development and myelination in vivo. Interestingly, we observed an increase in non-axonal ensheathments in the spinal cord, which appeared to be surrounding neuronal cell bodies. These non-axonal ensheathments were dependent on CB1, as the addition of WIN 55 in a global CB1 mutant prevented this phenotype. Furthermore, this ectopic cell body ensheathment occurred independently from normal myelination processes, as individual OLs did not exhibit changes in the number of myelin sheaths, sheath length, or total myelin output. This study shows that activation of CB receptors in vivo leads to increased non-axonal ensheathment without significantly changing OL differentiation or normal myelin formation. Future studies can further investigate the pathways that drive this phenotype to better understand how exogenous cannabinoid activation can regulate the precision of oligodendrocyte ensheathment.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

R.; Wang, J.-H.; Meijers, R.; Goodrich, L.", "abstract": "Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCClong isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects.

For example, mutations in the silent modulatory Kv8.2 subunit are known to cause irreversible inherited blindness (KCNV2 retinopathy). This is a currently incurable condition that causes lifelong visual loss, reduced visual acuity, photoaversion, night blindness and abnormal colour vision, alongside a distinctive supernormal electrophysiological (ERG) retinal response to light. In this study, we demonstrate that AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a codon-optimised human KCNV2 gene subretinally into Kv8.2 knock-out mice significantly restores retinal function. Treated mice exhibited improved ERG responses and correct expression of KCNV2 and its encoded Kv8.2 protein in photoreceptors. Recovery of visually guided scotopic and photopic optomotor responses to wildtype levels was achieved at lower vector doses, highlighting dose-dependent efficacy. Furthermore, treatment of human retinal organoids derived from a KCNV2 patient iPSC line resulted in substantial Kv8.2 protein rescue. This work provides the first preclinical proof-of-concept for the safety and therapeutic potential of gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy, laying a strong foundation for future clinical trials.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Patients commonly present with epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TANDs), including intellectual disability and anxiety. Our previous work identified anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants, characterized by enhanced thigmotaxis. We found that anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants was rescued by Rac1 inhibitors. These findings prompted further investigation into Rac1 signaling in the context of TSC pathology. Using G-LISA and FRET live imaging, we confirmed elevated Rac1 activity in the mutant brains. Rac1 activity was reduced following NSC23766 and EHT1864 treatment. Compared to wild-type controls, Rac1 activity in mutants was elevated by 50% in untreated animals, and reduced by ~30-40% after Rac1 inhibitors. Moreover, aberrant connectivity between brain hemispheres that correlated with anxiety before was restored after Rac1 inhibition. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 1,260 DEGs between homozygous and heterozygous tsc2vu242 zebrafish. Rac1 inhibition restored the expression of approximately 1,000 genes toward wild-type levels. KEGG pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in mTOR signaling and focal adhesion, while GO terms highlighted processes including axon guidance, axonogenesis, and neuronal projection. Collectively, our findings support a functional role for Rac1 in TSC pathology, linking cytoskeletal dysregulation with aberrant axon development and anxiety-like behavior. Rac1 inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for modulating both brain structure and function in TSC-associated anxiety.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

This study leverages quasi periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) to characterize spatiotemporal network alterations across longitudinally stable (normal cognitive, mild cognitive impairment, dementia of Alzheimer's type) and transitioning (normal cognitive to mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment to dementia of Alzheimer's type) cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using resting state fMRI. QPPs were used to derive recurrent spatiotemporal templates and network integrity measures at the intrinsic connectivity network level, while cPCA decomposed Hilbert transformed time series into complex valued patterns that capture amplitude and phase relationships. Nonparametric group comparisons revealed a structured trajectory in which limbic, subcortical, and higher cognition networks, including triple network components, are affected early, followed by progressive disruption in visual, cerebellar, sensorimotor, and additional triple network systems. Transitioning cohorts showed many of these alterations before formal diagnostic conversion, indicating that spatiotemporal signatures carry preclinical information. QPP based metrics were particularly sensitive to limbic and subcortical degradation, whereas cPCA emphasized changes in higher order, visual, and cerebellar patterns, revealing complementary aspects of the same underlying pathology. These findings extend prior QPP only work and highlight the utility of combining QPP and cPCA based measures as a dynamic, network-level biomarker framework for AD progression. with potential applications in early detection, characterizing disease trajectories, and treatment monitoring.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop an evolutionary epidemiology model to examine how pathogens adapt to seasonally varying environments, assuming that each strain favours a specific season for transmission. Analytical and numerical results reveal two contrasting regimes: phenological drift, where the preferred season continually advances through priority effects, and stable seasonal adaptation, where evolution converges to a fixed season. Under strong transmissibility, multiple seasonal morphs can coexist, forming polymorphic communities of epidemic timing. These outcomes result from the balance between a seasonal priority effect, rewarding early occupation of the niche, and a seasonal stabilising effect, adjusting traits to the external optimum. Our findings show that epidemic seasonality itself can evolve as a life-history trait, providing a conceptual bridge between pathogen dynamics and the broader evolution of phenology in periodic environments.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

However, the production of monodisperse short fibers with high production rates suitable for screening remains challenging. In this study, short, quasi-monodisperse, magneto-responsive, fluorescent poly({epsilon}-caprolactone) fibers with variable dimensions in the micrometer range are produced in a scalable, semi-continuous two-step fabrication process combining controlled wet-dry spinning with subsequent cryosectioning.

Macrophages, with their natural ability to infiltrate tumors, modulate immunity, and phagocytose cancer cells, offer a promising alternative when engineered with CARs. While studies have demonstrated the feasibility and anti-tumor activity of CAR macrophages (CAR M), enhancing their persistence and phagocytic capacity remains a key challenge. Methods and Results: Building on first-generation CD3z based CAR M, we developed a novel CAR targeting human GPC3, incorporating IFNg; and the extracellular domain of SIRPa; (SIRPaECD) to improve CAR M persistence and block the CD47 SIRPa; immune checkpoint. Following delivery via lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA (LNP mRNA), the self secreted IFNg; sustained M1 polarization through phospho STAT1 activation. Meanwhile, the ectopically expressed SIRPaECD competitively bound to CD47 on tumor cells, thereby blocking the endogenous SIRPa SHP2 interaction in a dominant negative manner. This design enhanced pro-inflammatory activity and anti tumor efficacy compared to CD3z only CAR M. Single cell RNA sequencing and cellular analysis showed that in situ programmed CAR M reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment toward inflammation in a murine HCC model. Moreover, CAR M derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) effectively phagocytosed human HCC organoids while sparing healthy tissues, indicating clinical potential.

RNA viruses infecting these protists have recently gained attention for their role in disease severity. While numerous such viruses have been described in Leishmania and several other trypanosomatid genera, none have previously been documented in the iconic genus Trypanosoma. Results: We report the first discovery and molecular characterization of RNA viruses in trypanosomes, identifying a leishmaniavirus and two narnaviruses in a single strain of Trypanosoma platydactyli, a parasite of the common wall gecko. The leishmaniavirus genome revealed a conserved organization, including a putative ribosomal frameshift site and a hairpin-like secondary structure typical of the genus. Phylogenetic inference indicates that it is closely related to leishmaniaviruses from Old World Leishmania spp., consistent with shared vector ecology. The two narnaviruses have distinct origins, although both cluster with viruses of other trypanosomatids, suggesting historical exchanges among co-infecting parasites. Conclusions: Our study expands both the known diversity of RNA viruses in trypanosomatids and the range of trypanosomatid genera that host these viruses, providing guidance for future screening. We suggest that vector ecology, particularly feeding behavior, may influence viral acquisition by trypanosomes, explaining the previous absence of viral reports from intensively studied trypanosomes of medical relevance vectored by tsetse flies or kissing bugs. Therefore, overlooked species transmitted by Nematocera represent promising candidates for future viral discovery.

NE expression is mediated by an assortment of transcription factors (TF), the most well-characterised of which is PnPf2. Orthologues of PnPf2 regulate virulence in phytopathogenic fungi across the Ascomycete fungal lineage, yet their protein architecture remains functionally uncharacterised. These orthologues are characterised by the archetypal N-terminal Zn2Cys6 zinc-finger DNA-binding domain (DBD), a conserved yet poorly characterised middle-homology region (MHR) and a C-terminal disordered region. We investigated the role of each of the three domains through PnPf2 truncation mutants in situ. This revealed the conserved MHR of PnPf2 is required for the development of disease symptoms on wheat, but also that the C-terminal disordered region in-part modulates NE expression. Domain-interaction analysis through yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screening reveals PnPf2 forms a homodimer mediated by the MHR, indicating its importance mediating protein-protein interactions. Using the MHR as a bait in library-scale protein-protein interaction Y2H assays, we identified the COP9-signalosome protein PnCsn6 as a key interaction partner. PnCsn6 is essential for disease symptoms during P. nodorum infection on wheat, including NE expression. Our study presents the first domain-level functional investigation this virulence-regulating TF orthologue, the results of which underpin the essential role of the MHR in driving protein-protein interactions and effector regulation.

Using clownfish (Amphiprion percula) as a model system, we investigated how individuals strategically modify their phenotype during hierarchy formation. We tested the overarching hypothesis that interactions among size- and age-matched rivals will lead to the emergence of social roles (dominant, subordinate, solitary), accompanied by divergence in four aspects of individual phenotypes: growth, feeding behavior, agonistic behaviors (aggression, submission), and gene expression. To test this, we created 30 replicates of juvenile clownfish, each comprising a size-matched pair housed together, and a solitary size-matched individual housed separately. Our results show that an individuals social context shapes its growth trajectory through coordinated changes in feeding behavior, agonistic behaviors, and gene expression. Individuals emerging as dominant within pairs grew twice as much compared to those emerging as subordinates, while subordinate and solitary individuals showed comparable growth. Initially, paired individuals consumed more food per capita than solitary individuals, but this difference declined as size hierarchies became established. Agonistic behaviors also decreased over time among paired individuals as size differences emerged. Transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of conserved vertebrate growth pathways and ossification related genes, and downregulation of satiety-associated genes, in dominant individuals compared to subordinates and solitaries. Here we link changes in gene expression with growth and feeding behavior regulation that underpin and reinforce social role differentiation during dominance hierarchy formation in clownfish.

With over eighty species, many of which are endemics, and many still being described, this lineage is taxonomically rich, poorly understood, and highly threatened. However, access to these deep habitats remains challenging, making eDNA detection one of the most practical methods for documenting and monitoring them. We developed and validated a qPCR assay targeting a hypervariable region of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, allowing for genus-specific detection and species-level identification. Laboratory and field evaluations involving 47 representative species confirmed high specificity and a detection limit of around 20 DNA copies per reaction. Controlled degradation studies indicated that temperature and pH strongly affect DNA persistence. Field surveys across 47 karst sites (37 caves and 10 surface sites) detected Sinocyclocheilus eDNA in only 33 caves. Dideoxy sequencing of qPCR amplicons provided species-level identification and phylogenetic validation, including detection of a new species. At three cave sites yielding multiple qPCR detections, 16S metabarcoding enabled species discrimination.

Recent findings show that appendicularians have massively lost all ancestral chordate Fgf subfamilies except two, the Fgf9/16/20 and Fgf11/12/13/14 subfamilies, which in contrast have undergone a burst of lineage-specific duplications and diversification into novel paralogs, in an evolutionary scenario that we have named ''Less, but More''. Here, we investigate the downstream effects of the Fgf losses and duplications ion Fgf receptors (FgfRs) and intracellular RTK components in the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica. We show that the single ancestral FgfR gene has expanded into three paralogs (FgfRa-c), which are conserved across cryptic O. dioica species, yet highly divergent from other chordates. Despite strong sequence divergence, structural modeling indicates preservation of canonical FgfR architecture. Expression analyses reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns: FgfRa and FgfRb are maternally supplied and enriched in mesodermal derivatives, whereas FgfRc is restricted to neural and epithelial tissues. Genome surveys of downstream RTK pathways show conservation of core RAS/MAPK, PLC{gamma}/PKC, and PI3K/AKT cascades, but with losses of classical Ras genes and several adaptors, suggesting a lineage-specific simplification of transduction complexes. Transduction gene expression shifts from broad maternal ubiquity to tissue-specific domains, particularly in brain, notochord, muscle, and gonadal primordia throughout embryonic and larval development. Appendicularians appear as the only non-vertebrate chordate lineage that recapitulate the vertebrate-like FgfR expansion following Fgf ligands diversification. Downstream components, however, evolved more conservatively, tending toward simplification, reinforcing the view that appendicularians generate signaling innovation despite extensive gene loss.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

However, the global hadal environments remain the least investigated ecosystem for ARB/ARG compositions and distribution. This study took three-fold approaches to investigate the ARB/ARGs in the global hadal trench sediments, i.e., large-scale cultivation to isolate and verify ARB/ARGs from Challenger Deep sediments, metagenomic analysis of sediment samples from Challenger Deep over a six-year period, and comparative study of resistomes across six hadal trenches through metagenomic analysis. The Challenger Deep sediments had a consistent average ARG abundance of 0.02 copy/cell over a six-year period, whereas some ARG subtypes fluctuated and showed distinct temporal dynamics. Large-scale screening of ARB via microbial cultivation using 13 classes of antibiotics led to enriching distinct ARB, for which eleven genera were identified by metagenomic sequencing as major host for ARGs. The global hadal trench sediments showed a variable ARG abundance, which was significantly lower than those from environments in proximity to human activities, representing a relatively pristine reservoir. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the hadal ARGs underwent niche-specific selections and formed hadal trench-specific clusters that diverged from human-associated lineages, which can be outward transported when disturbed. The study established the hadal trench sediments, as a relatively pristine reservoir of natural ARGs, providing a crucial environmental baseline for assessing their impacts on the ecosystems and public health risks.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

As first found for nodaviruses, the necked cytosolic portals of these organelles bear ringed \"crown\" complexes of viral RNA replication proteins that drive synthesis, capping and release of new RNA genomes. Nodavirus crowns contain two 12-mer rings of viral protein A with C-proximal polymerase domains stacked. In the basal ring, protein As N-proximal RNA capping domains form a central, toroidal floor, while in the apical ring these domains extend radially outward. A third protein A conformation provides a putative central Pol domain interacting with the viral dsRNA replication intermediate in a vesicle beneath the crown. Protein As multiple conformations likely differentially contribute to crown assembly, RNA template recruitment, (-) and (+) strand synthesis, RNA capping, and progeny RNA release. Protein As high copy numbers may provide robustness to these processes. To test such concepts, we combined mutational, complementation and functional analyses. Strong complementation between null mutants in protein As polymerase and RNA capping active sites showed that they operate in independent protein A copies, likely at distinct sites. Thus, neither function is required in all protein A copies, nor are both required in any single copy. Lack of complementation between mutants in distinct RNA capping steps implied that major RNA capping steps must be performed in the same protein. Although RNA polymerase and capping activity were not required in all protein A subunits, none of a series of deletions across these domains were complementable, showing the importance of structural and other requirements for crown assembly, etc. Surprisingly, RNA replication was more sensitive to depleting the fraction of subunits retaining protein As C-terminal intrinsically disordered region than polymerase or capping activity.

S.; Azuama, O. C.; Zafar, K.; Goguen, J. D.; Leong, J. M.; Parveen, N.", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous organism that adapts well in different environments. It is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that produces a wide range of virulence factors, colonizes lungs to cause pneumonia, causes non-healing wounds especially in burn victims, and is a major culprit in destructive keratitis. It can reach the cornea through reusable, extended-use contact lenses and by contaminated eyedrops and artificial tears. Secreted proteases of P. aeruginosa together with pyocyanin metabolite, which inhibits Serine Protease Inhibitors (Serpins) activity contribute to severe tissue damage during infection. Methods: P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different clinical sites were obtained from different researchers and clinicians for this study. We examined P. aeruginosa strains and secretion defective and prpL knockout mutants in PA64481 strain for lysyl endopeptidase (PrpL, a serine protease that cleaves after a lysine residue) activity using serine protease specific D-Val-Leu-Lys -p-nitroanalide substrate. We also determined pyocyanin production in these strains. Results: Examination of secreted milieu from P. aeruginosa showed that 41 corneal isolates had detectable lysyl endopeptidase activity associated with PrpL at levels significantly higher than by 27 non-corneal isolates. We found that PrpL is secreted by the xcp-based type II secretion system. Bacterial culture supernatants displaying higher PrpL activity and not low secreted PrpL levels disrupted corneal epithelial cell monolayers in vitro, which is consistent with a role of this protease in destructive keratitis. Many examined strains also produced high levels of pyocyanin. Conclusions: This retrospective examination of clinical P. aeruginosa suggests that high levels of PrpL and pyocyanin-producing isolates are more prevalent among corneal isolates and could enhance tissue damage during infection. Supporting this premise, corneal epithelial cell monolayers disrupted by high PrpL-producing strains but remained intact after treatment with P. aeruginosa mutants culture supernatants that lack or have reduced secreted PrpL.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The virus is comprised of two clades, Central African clade I and West African clade II with case fatality rates of ~11 and ~4%, respectively. Since the discovery of mpox disease in 1970, the virus has been restricted to Africa. However, in 2022, a previously unrecognized subclade IIb caused the largest global outbreak of mpox disease with a case fatality rate of ~0.2%. The difference in virulence of MPXV subclades in human infection warrants further investigation, however, one critical limitation is the lack of susceptible small animal models. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of four murine models, including CAST-EiJ and three immunocompromised models (C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-, C57BL/6 Ifngr-/-, and C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-/Ifngr-/-) to MPXV clade IIa (WR 7-61 and US-2003) and IIb (MA-2022) isolates. All four mouse models were susceptible to clade IIa infection, leading to severe disease marked by decreased body temperature, weight loss, and lethality. In contrast, clade IIb infection produced minimal to mild disease at similar doses in all four murine models. The clade IIb isolate produced severe disease (40% lethality) at only the highest dose (8.0 log10 PFU) in the most susceptible immunocompromised mouse model, C57BL/6 Ifnar-/-/Ifngr-/-. This is the first demonstration of lethal disease with clade IIb in a murine model. In addition, these data demonstrate that clade IIa is ~100- to 100,000-fold more virulent than clade IIb and provide three additional murine models for investigating MPXV infection and pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The current study integrates bioarchaeological, historical, and genomic data to investigate the ancestry and putative disease-related mortality of nine individuals whose remains were recovered and subsequently sequenced. Population-genetic analyses revealed strong affinities with Northern European populations, particularly from Norway, Iceland, Estonia, and Czechoslovia, consistent with their likely roles as soldiers or laborers employed by the Dutch West India Company. To explore potential causes of death, we conducted a metagenomic screening with a novel pipeline optimized for degraded DNA, which revealed widespread presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens across all samples. Authenticity was confirmed through post-mortem damage patterns characteristic of historical samples. These findings, together with the absence of combat trauma and the collective burial context at the site, support the hypothesis of an epidemic-related mortality event.

Using high-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, fine-scale chemical profiling, and behavioral assays on hybrid populations, we identify three methyl-branched alkanes as key pheromonal compounds that strongly predict male mating preferences. QTL explaining their species-specific variation partially co-localize with genomic regions enriched for candidate genes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis, including cytochrome P450 enzymes and fatty acid synthases. These findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between the variation in these gene clusters and species-specific chemical signaling. Further comparative analyses reveal hitherto unrecognized sex-specific regulatory effects, cytoplasmic influences, and complex genomic interactions shaping the variation in these pheromonal profiles.

Despite being a well-known mechanism overall, examples of rapid evolution from invasive species and on broad geographic ranges are poorly documented. The box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) is a polymorphic invasive species that recently colonized Europe, but the ecological factors driving the morph frequencies in natural populations are still largely unknown. Here we took advantage of citizen science, that allows for an unprecedented amount of observations across a large spatial scale, and pheromone trapping, for a more targeted sampling, to detect differences in morph ratios for our model species across Europe and Asia. We then fitted linear regressions and generalized mixed models to detect what variables in the invasive environment drive their frequencies. We found that the melanic form of this moth is maintained at intermediate frequencies in the entire range, but that both at the continental scale and at the local scale, its frequency is higher in warmer and drier conditions. This finding supports the hypothesis of a rapid evolution of colour polymorphism in this invasive species, that established the observed cline in roughly 27 generations. Finally, we provide a physiological rationale of the observed cline, using an experimental approach, showing that melanic individuals have a better resistance to desiccation, compatible with their higher frequency in warmer and drier climates.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

First, reconstructed sequences were substantially more divergent than database references, underscoring the limited coverage of existing viral sequence collections. Second, polar viromes exhibited significantly higher within-region divergence, with south polar assemblages consistently the most distinct and north polar divergence varying by biome. Third, these patterns were found to be robust to potential reconstruction artifacts; all datasets underwent identical processing, and divergence inflation was observed exclusively in polar samples.

In brown lemurs (genus Eulemur), a hybrid species formed by E. rufifrons x E. cinereiceps has been proposed, but never tested with genome-wide data. To test this hybrid speciation hypothesis, we combined low-coverage host genomes derived from fecal DNA with gut microbiome profiling across a 180-kilometer transect spanning the hybrid zone. Population genomic, phylogenetic, and demographic analyses reveal that a distinct hybrid lineage originated ~44,000 years ago, followed by extensive backcrossing with E. rufifrons beginning ~22,000 years ago. This process has led to genomic swamping and the apparent loss of genetically pure E. rufifrons in southeastern Madagascar, while E. cinereiceps has remained largely distinct. Gut microbiome divergence mirrored these patterns, with hybrids more closely resembling E. rufifrons than E. cinereiceps, although predicted microbial functions were largely conserved across all three lineages. Overall, we interpret our results as a hologenomic signal of nascent speciation followed by collapse. Our findings suggest that hybridization in Eulemur is both more widespread and evolutionarily complex than previously recognized, with major implications for conservation: interspecific gene flow may serve as a key mechanism promoting primate adaptation during periods of rapid environmental change.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Centromeres are essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division, yet their highly repetitive sequence has historically hindered their complete assembly and characterization. Consequently, the full spectrum of centromere diversity across individuals, populations, and evolutionary contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by assembling and characterizing 2,110 complete human centromeres from a diverse cohort of individuals representing 5 continental and 28 population groups. By developing a novel suite of bioinformatic tools tailored for centromeric regions, we uncover previously unknown variation within centromeres, including 226 novel centromere haplotypes and 1,870 new -satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) variants. We find that mobile element insertions are present in 30% of centromeres, with chromosome 16 harboring Alu elements within the kinetochore site at an 11-fold higher frequency than expected. While most centromeres have a single kinetochore site, 6% of them have di-kinetochores, and <<1% have tri-kinetochores, which we confirm with long-read CENP-A CUT&RUN, DiMeLo-seq, and multi-generational inheritance. We further show that the position of the kinetochore is not random and is, instead, closely associated with the underlying sequence and structure of the centromere. To understand the nature of evolutionary change, we compared 2,110 complete human centromeres to 5,747 complete centromeres recently assembled from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. We show that centromeres have a >50-fold variation in mutation rate, with the most rapidly mutating centromeres on chromosome 1 and the slowest mutating centromeres on chromosome Y. Additionally, a subset of centromeres show evidence of introgression from archaic hominins, shaping their sequence, structure, and evolutionary history. We validate these centromere mutation rates in a four-generation family, spanning 28 family members and 483 accurately assembled centromeres, and show that the kinetochore site is the most rapidly mutating region in the centromere, with twofold more single-nucleotide variants than the rest of the centromeric -satellite HOR array on average. We propose a model that reveals an 'arms race' between centromeric sequence and proteins, with frequent mutations within the site of the kinetochore that lead to changes in genetic and epigenetic landscapes and, ultimately, rapid evolution of these critically important regions.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We engineered biomimetic protein coronas to control nanoparticle-protein interactions and enhance tumor targeting. Competitive binding studies using NMR spectroscopy revealed that transferrin (Tf) and fibronectin (Fn) outcompete albumin (BSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 15 nm gold nanoparticle surfaces, establishing a binding hierarchy that enables predictable corona composition. Pre-coating nanoparticles with a four-protein combination (BSA+Tf+Fn+IgG) created coronas that selectively enhanced cancer cell uptake while reducing macrophage recognition in vitro. When administered to tumor-bearing mice, these engineered coronas achieved 13 ppm/g tumor accumulation (equivalent to 4% ID/g) representing 6.5-fold improvement over bare nanoparticles and 2.6-fold improvement over PEGylated formulations. Proteomics analysis of secondary coronas formed in human serum revealed that engineered nanoparticles selectively recruit transport and adhesion proteins while limiting immune recognition signatures. The pre-formed coronas maintained targeting protein retention and reduced complement binding compared to controls. Circular dichroism confirmed minimal protein structural perturbation, preserving receptor-binding functionality for active targeting. The strategy harnesses natural protein adsorption processes to create \"smart\" biological interfaces that simultaneously evade immune clearance and promote tumor cell recognition through multiple receptor pathways. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of treating the coron as a programmable interface, addressing delivery limitations that have hindered clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the first crystal structure of HtpGMtb, in complex with the non-hydrolysable form of ATP, AMPPNP. The crystal structure reveals that the HtpGMtb dimer adopts a conformationally silent structure, that precludes the dimerisation of the chaperone catalytic domains needed for ATP hydrolysis. Also, binding studies show that HtpGMtb directly interacts with TLR4 with a nanomolar affinity, and that this interaction allows HtpGMtb dimer to engage two TLR4 molecules.

MD simulations also correctly predicted bilayer dimensions for single component flat bilayers observed in cryoEM images. However, Martini3 CG-MD simulations failed to predict changes in membrane thickness induced by high curvature and with heterogeneous lipid compositions. We pinpointed the misbehavior of polyunsaturated lipid tails and cholesterol in Martini3 simulations as the main sources of error contributing to inaccurate bilayer thicknesses.

Using 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing, we assessed changes in diversity, taxonomic composition, enriched microbial taxa, and co-occurrence network structure to distinguish between plant-mediated recruitment (cry-for-help) and pathogen-induced dysbiosis. TuMV infection caused a pronounced reduction in bacterial diversity and a restructuring of bacterial community composition, whereas fungal communities remained largely stable. Viral infection also led to genotype-specific shifts in enriched bacterial genera, with opportunistic and stress-tolerant taxa proliferating differently in each genotype. Despite the initial perturbation, bacterial networks recovered connectivity and, in some cases, reached higher complexity than those of healthy plants, indicating strong microbial resilience. Together, these results reveal that TuMV infection acts as a selective filter on bacterial, but not fungal, root communities and that the surviving taxa can reorganize into functional networks.

In this study, we expand and modify the image-based profiling pipeline to observe autophagy and virus infection side-by-side using ZIKV encoding a fluorescent reporter. We observe cell and autophagy morphology changes after ZIKV infection and found distinct feature profiles in both infected and uninfected cells treated with ZIKV. We compare ZIKV-infected morphologies to those of cells treated with autophagy-regulating drugs and find ZIKV-induced changes similar to treatment with a combination of autophagy inducer and inhibitor. Using the pipeline, we also train and build a deep learning classifier to identify infected cells using a cellular autophagy reporter without the help of a fluorescent reporter virus. This shows the versatility of image-based profiling in infection-based systems.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Despite their fundamental relevance, the underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In plants, floral transition is a key developmental process whereby the shoot apical meristem changes from producing leaves to flowers. Using quantitative imaging, developmental genetics and dynamical systems theory, we show that a time-dependent bistable switch between APETALA2, a key floral inhibitor, and the floral activators SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 and FRUITFULL, can explain the dynamics of floral transition in Arabidopsis. Notably, we detect a slowing down of the inhibitor dynamics, consistent with having a system crossing a critical point of a bistable switch and transiently experiencing a ghost attractor. We demonstrate that only this time-dependent bistability can generate the range of dynamical behaviours measured across genotypes, including oscillations in the inhibitor. We propose that time-dependent bistability is a robust dynamical mechanism for regulating developmental transitions.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

N.; Niu, P.; Aho, V. T. E.; Pope, P. B.; Schwarm, A.", "abstract": "Methane emissions from ruminants can be expressed through several metrics as total production, yield, or intensity, each reflecting distinct aspects of energy utilization. Among these, methane intensity defined as grams of methane emitted per kilograms of energy-corrected milk, directly links emissions to productive efficiency; however, the microbial mechanisms underlying variation in this trait remain unclear. Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to characterize rumen microbial identity, functional potential, and transcriptional activity in lactating cows differing in methane intensity while sharing breed and diet. Microbial community composition and diversity were comparable across phenotypes. However, rumen microbial gene expression revealed marked functional divergence. The rumen content of low-methane intensity cows showed enriched transcription of fructan-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes and butyrate-forming pathways, primarily encoded by RUG440 (Atopobiaceae) and Sodaliphilus-affiliated metagenome-assembled genomes. These functions suggest a fructan-butyrate metabolic axis supported by potential cross-feeding between primary degraders and butyrate producers. Conversely, the high-methane intensity rumen exhibited greater transcription of pectin-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes, mainly carried by Prevotella metagenome-assembled genomes, suggesting methyl-ester hydrolysis and methanol release. Despite higher methanogenesis transcript levels in high-methane intensity cows, total methane production did not differ between groups. Together, these findings reveal two contrasting functional configurations of the rumen microbiome in Norwegian Red dairy cattle: a fructan-butyrate-oriented metabolism in low-methane intensity cows and a pectin-methanol-oriented metabolism in high-methane intensity counterparts. This study provides genome-resolved, multi-omic evidence that microbial carbohydrate specialization and fermentation routing contribute to methane intensity phenotypes in dairy cows, offering mechanistic insights for improving ruminant climate efficiency.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated how vaccine-induced immunity shapes the evolution of a human-origin H3N2 virus in pigs using an in vivo sustained transmission model. Pigs (seeders) were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated swine vaccine and then infected with an antigenically distinct FLUAV containing human-origin HA/NA. Contact pigs were introduced two days later. After 3 days, seeder pigs were removed, and new contacts introduced. This was repeated for a total of 4 contacts. Sequencing of nasal swab samples showed the emergence of mutations clustered near the HA receptor binding site, enabling immune escape and abolishing binding to N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Mutant viruses recognized 2,6-sialosides with 3 N-acetyllactosamine repeats, which are rare in swine lungs, while the parental virus bound structures with a minimum of 2 repeats. Adaptative HA mutations enhanced avidity for 2,6-linked sialic acid, likely compensating for the low abundance of extended glycans. Notably, residues outside the canonical HA binding pocket contribute to glycan binding, suggesting a trade-off between receptor breadth and avidity. These findings show that non-neutralizing immunity promotes viral adaptation by fine-tuning receptor engagement and immune evasion.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Surveillance of infectious and vector-borne diseases is vital for predicting and mitigating detrimental effects of zoonotic spillover events. Beyond assessing what microorganisms are circulating in specific environments, it is important to understand how potential reservoir hosts, especially animals such as bats, participate in pathogen transmission. Bats can host and potentially spread infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. However, bats can also act as bioindicators that test positive for pathogenic microorganisms without necessarily contributing to the pathogen replication cycle. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) provides an efficient means to broadly screen for pathogens, although microorganism selectivity can sometimes be lower than targeted approaches. Pairing mNGS results with higher-sensitivity tests such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) can validate results and together these tools provide a relatively fast and reliable method for conducting surveillance. To test this approach, we surveyed the types of microorganisms circulating in Belize by collecting 263 blood samples from 20 different bat species captured in the Orange Walk District in 2019, 2022, and 2023. We used mNGS to initially characterize the microbial communities and qPCR to confirm presence and intensity of human pathogens of interest. We detected 1,430 different microorganisms with some relevance to human or animal health, including the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi which was detected in the phyllostomid bats Desmodus rotundus and Artibeus jamaicensis. qPCR confirmed the presence and intensity of Trypanosoma cruzi in mNGS-positive bat samples.

Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota dysbiosis in both conditions, yet microbial associations with their co-occurrence remain unexplored. Methods: A total of 68 girls (18 normal, 25 PP-only, 18 obesity-only, and 7 obesity-PP comorbidity) were enrolled. 16S rRNA sequencing was applied to determine gut microbiota of girls. Microbial diversity, composition, and differential abundant taxa were analyzed. Results: While overall microbial diversity and community structure were similar across groups, obesity-only subjects exhibited significantly increased microbial richness (Chao1 index, P<0.01 vs. all groups), characterized by a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio (P<0.001 vs. normal/PP), increased Proteobacteria (P<0.001 vs. normal), and enrichment of genera including Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Anaerostipes, Haemophilus, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (P<0.05 vs. other groups). PP-only subjects showed reduced Verrucomicrobiota (P<0.001 vs. normal/obesity) and elevated Escherichia_Shigella (P<0.05 vs. normal). Most strikingly, the obesity-PP comorbid group exhibited a unique gut microbiota profile characterized by a dramatic depletion of Firmicutes compared to the obesity-only group (P<0.001) and a remarkable nearly 100-fold increase in Verrucomicrobiota abundance (P<0.001 vs. other groups), suggesting a distinct microbial ecotype potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of this comorbidity. Conclusion: This study delineated unique gut microbiota alterations associated with isolated obesity, isolated PP, and their comorbidity in girls. The distinct dysbiotic pattern in comorbid obesity-PP suggested complex microbiota-host interactions, providing a new microbiological perspective for understanding the mechanism of comorbidity between obesity and precocious puberty.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Models trained exclusively on industrialized infants perform poorly when applied to non-industrialized datasets. In contrast, more diverse models including individuals from both lifestyles achieve increased correlation between microbial and chronological age. We identified differences in relevant taxa associated with the maturation in the different lifestyles.

The proteolytic processing of the Gag structural polyprotein into its individual components triggers a dramatic structural reorganisation that produces fully mature and infectious virions. HIV-1 maturation remodels the Gag lattice to enable membrane fusion, but how early proteolytic steps regulate the envelope glycoprotein (Env) organisation is unknown. Although cryo-electron tomography has defined structural intermediates of global maturation, it has not resolved how Env conformers relate to specific early maturation states. Here, we show that partial Gag cleavage, prior to capsid formation, allosterically reorganises the membrane-proximal lattice, promoting Env clustering and fusion-competent conformations. Using native virus preparations combined with novel cryogenic fluorescence-lifetime imaging correlated to cryo-electron tomography, we map Env conformational signatures onto defined Gag-processing intermediates. This reveals an unrecognised early maturation stage in which incomplete Gag processing primes Env for entry, shifting current models by positioning functional Env activation upstream of core maturation. These results establish that early lattice remodelling is a key determinant of HIV-1 fusion competence and expose a previously inaccessible, intervention-sensitive step with implications for therapeutic and vaccine strategies targeting maturation-entry coupling.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

These factors are enriched in pathways essential for RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and nuclear condensate organization, revealing that the vRNA engages a far broader host network than previously appreciated. Functional interrogation of top candidates demonstrates that GMPS, TOP2A, SRRM2, and SPEN serve as critical proviral factors operating at distinct stages of the IAV synthesis program: GMPS and SPEN are required for efficient production of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA; TOP2A promotes mRNA capping and early transcript accumulation; and SRRM2, together with SR-proteins, coordinates splicing of viral M and NS transcripts. These findings support a model in which the incoming vRNA acts not merely as a transcriptional template but as a scaffold that initiates assembly of nuclear machinery required for productive viral replication.

The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is an obligate blood-feeding species that frequently interacts with livestock and humans, yet their role in parasite maintenance in Central America remains poorly characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed 205 blood samples from vampire bats collected at two sites in northern Belize over three years (2019, 2021, 2022). PCR screening revealed an overall T. cruzi prevalence of 41.5% and increasing infection risks over time. The amplicon-based next-generation sequencing of the parasite mini-exon locus identified 36 unique haplotypes belonging to five DTUs: TcI, TcIV, TcV, TcVI, and TcBat. TcBat was present in half of the samples sequenced. TcBat and TcVI, were detected in Belize for the first time. Belizean TcBat haplotypes clustered closely with Colombian reference sequences, and a subset formed a Belize-specific clade, indicating previously unrecognized TcBat diversity in the region; in contrast, Brazilian TcBat sequences were more distantly related. Conclusions/Significance Vampire bats in Belize harbor diverse T. cruzi genotypes, including DTUs with established roles in human disease. Given their obligate blood diet, frequent feeding on livestock, and occasional biting of humans, vampire bats may serve as bridge hosts linking sylvatic, domestic, and human transmission cycles. Together with a recent report of an acute human Chagas disease case in northern Belize, these results underscore the need for integrated One Health surveillance of bats, vectors, livestock, and humans to better evaluate and mitigate the risk of Chagas disease in Central America.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Self-supervised generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) offer great potential for learning compact yet expressive representations of data, which can be used for subsequent discriminative tasks and are intrinsically interpretable. However, the default learning algorithm results in weakly discriminative data representations due to under-specification of the generative task. We propose and evaluate a novel modification to the VAE learning algorithm that models intra-frame shift-invariance. We demonstrate that this modification provides representations that are more interpretable, consistent and improve classification performance. Performance accuracy is evaluated on species detection tasks on two weakly annotated data sets across temperate and tropical terrestrial habitats and compared to leading discriminative models BirdNet and Perch, as well as the classic VAE. Whilst demonstrated in terrestrial recordings, the approach is transferable to marine, freshwater, and soil habitats.

I.; Canestro, C.", "abstract": "Tunicates offer a suitable system to study the evolutionary mechanisms underlying lifestyle transitions, ranging from the biphasic lifestyle of ascidians alternating swimming larva with sessile adults, to the fully free-living appendicularians. The appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, despite having only ten pairs of tail muscle cells, roughly half than in ascidian larvae, exhibits a remarkably rich repertoire of behaviours required for house inflation, swimming, nodding, and the rhythmic water pumping through the house. This apparent paradox suggests that functional diversification might have arose not from increased cell number, but from molecular specialization within a minimal musculature. To address this question, here, we reconstruct the evolution of the Myosin class II heavy-chain (Myh) gene family across tunicates and generated a developmental expression atlas of all O. dioica Myh genes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the cardio-paraxial Myh subfamily duplicated into two tunicate-specific subfamilies, followed by independent bursts of paralogue duplications in ascidians and appendicularians. In O. dioica, two distinct Myh-Scp-Tb paralogs show cardiac expression, and surprisingly, combinations of different Myh-Scp-Tb paralogues define multiple muscle cell identities along the tail. The innovation of this anteroposterior muscle regionalization associated to the Myh-Scp-Tb expansion provides a plausible mechanism for fine-scale modulation of contractile properties within a minimal musculature, helping to resolve the paradox of ''fewer cells, but more contractile properties'' in appendicularian tail movements. Conversely, the loss of the Myh-Sj/bw gene, which in ascidians is expressed with post-metamorphic body-wall and siphon muscles, is consistent with a pattern of regressive evolution associated to the absence of trunk muscles in O. dioica. This finding supports the view that the appendicularian lifestyle is a secondary derived condition, and that the last common ancestor of tunicates likely possessed an ascidian-like biphasic lifestyle. Together, our findings indicate that both gene-family duplication and gene loss have shaped the evolution of appendicularian tail muscle, enabling the emergence of complex tail-driven behaviours, and offering new insights into the ancestral lifestyle of tunicates.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

We discovered a negative correlation between cancer and trauma mortalities (P-value [&le;] 0.0006), even when we accounted for the fact that different causes of death must sum to 100%. Platelet size and trophic level negatively correlated with trauma mortality, but not when controlling for cancer mortality (P-value = 0.06).

For these reasons, and because many cortical neurons project axons to the affected striatal neurons, striatal and cortical atrophy have long been proposed to have distinct mechanisms, with one potentially a secondary consequence of the other. In the striatum, we recently found that neurons degenerate asynchronously as their own huntingtin (HTT) gene CAG-repeat tracts, typically inherited at 40-50 CAGs, expand somatically beyond 150 CAGs. To ask whether a similar or different dynamic affects the cerebral cortex, we analyzed HTT CAG repeats and genome-wide RNA expression together in more than 130,000 nuclei from 12 cortical areas of brain donors with HD. The resulting data revealed that cortical and striatal neurodegeneration in fact result from analogous sequences of cell-autonomous events, each instructed by somatic expansion of a neuron's own HTT CAG repeat. Analyses revealed that somatic expansion beyond a high toxicity threshold (of about 150 CAGs) is necessary and sufficient to initiate pathological changes; that this pathogenicity length threshold is shared by striatal and cortical projection neurons of all types; and that cortical area, cortical layer, and axonal projections play only incidental roles, as proxies for the true driver: profound (up to 50-fold) variation among types and subtypes of pyramidal neurons in the likelihood of reaching the 150-CAG toxicity threshold in a human lifetime.

Our comparative analyses reveal a striking loss of conserved synteny with ancestral metazoan linkage groups, as well as between Dugesia and Schmidtea genera, suggesting that pervasive structural instability is a defining hallmark of flatworm genome evolution. However, in contrast to what has been reported in Schmidtea, synteny is broadly retained among Dugesia species. We also found a widespread expansion of transposable elements, most notably DNA transposons, in Dugesia, and reject a whole-genome duplication hypothesis as the underlying cause for its larger genome size and haploid chromosomal set.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Across four phytoplankton species diverged ~333-639 million years ago, genes within U (female) and V (male) \"UV\" mating-type regions- non-recombining chromosomal regions that determine mating compatibility show strikingly elevated intron retention relative to genes in other genomic regions. Long-read data reveal abundant truncated, likely non-functional mRNA isoforms despite preserved coding potential. This suggests that splicing defects arose early in UV evolution and have persisted over deep time. We propose that these defects arise from evolutionary changes in sequence composition and chromatin organization that accompany recombination suppression, such as reduced GC content, altered nucleosome occupancy, and disrupted methylation, that collectively compromise splicing fidelity. Unlike sex chromosomes, which often degenerate through gene loss, splicing-deficient UV regions in green algae retain hundreds of genes, indicating that transcript-level dysfunction provides an alternative route to functional decay. Our results identify chromatin-mediated splicing deficiency as a novel axis of genomic erosion and position algal UV systems as models for studying how recombination suppression reshapes RNA processing fidelity in essential, non-recombining genomes.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Computational free-energy methods aim to predict these interactions accurately, yet membrane proteins remain particularly difficult due to the added thermodynamic effects of the lipid bilayer. Alchemical free-energy calculations provide state-of-the-art accuracy by transforming one ligand into another, and recent non-equilibrium approaches (NEQ-FEP) offer improved efficiency and parallelization. However, no existing workflow automates NEQ-FEP for membrane proteins and enables decomposition of the observed binding free energy into membrane-partitioning and protein-specific components. NEMAT is an open-source pipeline that performs automated non-equilibrium alchemical transformations in water, membranes, and membrane-embedded protein environments. Here we show that NEMAT reproduces experimental binding-energy trends for P2Y1 ligands with accuracy comparable to established equilibrium methods. These findings demonstrate that NEQ-FEP can be applied reliably to membrane systems when supported by a consistent workflow. In contrast to previous approaches, NEMAT provides systematic control over transition length, sampling, and replica averaging, enabling stable work-distribution overlap and reproducible free-energy estimates. In a broader context, NEMAT offers a practical route to mechanistically interpretable affinity predictions for membrane-embedded targets.

Results indicated high diversity, with 46 variations in chromosome number (2n), ranging from 8 to 140, and 30% of species exhibiting polyploidy. This suggests multiple chromosomal alteration events occurred during the tribe's evolution. The chromosome number 2n = 20 was identified as the ancestral state for most internal nodes of the tree and confirmed as predominant in the Andropogoninae subtribe. However, more recently divergent taxa displayed higher chromosome numbers. The research concludes that chromosomal variation is dynamic and complex.

We assessed relationships between internal wood degradation and esca foliar symptoms in 23 Vitis vinifera L. cultivars grown in a common garden, to determine how healthy wood biochemical traits, endophytic microbial communities, and fungal pathogen traits contribute to susceptibility. Unlike other types of necrosis, white-rot necrosis was significantly more abundant in previously symptomatic plants, especially in the most susceptible cultivars. These cultivars had slightly higher hemicellulose levels and significantly fewer extractives in healthy wood. Glycosylated phenylpropanoids accumulated in the wood of esca-symptomatic plants, especially for susceptible cultivars. By contrast, neither esca expression nor cultivar susceptibility affected the diversity, composition or function of microbial communities in healthy wood. Esca susceptibility appears primarily linked to wood degradability and metabolic responses rather than microbial communities, suggesting that the use of weakly susceptible varieties together with white-rot removal might attenuate grapevine decline.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

However, due to the spread of electric and magnetic fields, M/EEG recordings capture activity from all sources within the brain. Commonly used approaches for the extraction of ROI activity only partially alleviate this problem, and field spread remains a challenge even at the level of ROI time series. Because of the remaining field spread (RFS), the extracted time series captures activity not only from the considered ROI but also from other regions (not necessarily neighboring ones). The amount of RFS can strongly affect the validity of interpretations: with more RFS, the extracted time series becomes less representative of the ROI. However, neither the amount nor the pattern of RFS is usually known. In this study, we apply the cross-talk function (CTF) to analyze contributions of all sources across the brain to the extracted ROI time series, thereby quantifying the degree of RFS. With CTF, we show that the effect of RFS on the extraction of ROI activity and on the estimation of inter-regional connectivity is highly non-uniform across the cortex. In particular, ROIs farther away from the recording sensors are more likely to capture activity and connectivity from other areas. Finally, we validate this observation in simulations and complement it by investigating spurious and ghost interactions in real data. Overall, our results illustrate how CTF can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantify the effects of RFS and to evaluate pipelines for the extraction of ROI activity.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic, immunological, and histological analyses showed that pneumococcal colonisation prior to PVM infection enhanced and prolonged interferon signalling, increased anti-viral cytokine and chemokine protein levels and CD8+ cell responses.

In this study, we analysed natural populations of small-spored Alternaria from Germany, Poland, and Serbia using molecular phylogenetics, morphological characterisation, and controlled infection assays to clarify species identity, host associations, and pathogenic potential. Both A. alternata and A. arborescens were detected across all regions and hosts, indicating broad distribution and ecological overlap. The two species were consistently isolated from foliar lesions and were each capable of causing characteristic Alternaria Brown-Spot (ABS) symptoms, thereby fulfilling Kochs postulates. Phylogenetic analyses based on Alt A1 and RPB2 loci resolved two well-supported species clades and revealed extensive haplotype sharing across more than 1300 km, multiple hosts, and diverse climates, suggesting high gene flow and limited population structure. The consistent co-occurrence and comparable pathogenicity of A. alternata and A. arborescens underscore their equal ecological relevance and redefine their roles in ABS epidemiology.

Genome-wide association mapping identified 77 unique Yr loci. Of these, 33 overlapped with the previously reported ~1,100 loci, while 44 were likely novel. Nine mapped Yr loci were effective at the adult plant stage and showed no overlap with the known APR genes. Two wheat lines, though lacked the widely effective Yr5 and Yr15 genes, exhibited resistance to all 20 Pst races at the seedling stage and natural field races at the adult stage, suggesting that they may carry novel, broad-spectrum resistance alleles. APR genes Yr18, Yr29, and Yr36 were detected at low frequencies, indicating that much of the observed resistance may arise from less characterized or novel sources. Wheat improvement had no effect on the frequency of ASR alleles but resulted in a three-fold increase in the frequency of APR alleles, suggesting that the latter were subjected to more consistent breeding selection over time.

Analysis of this differential expression (DE) typically identifies many genes of interest. However, it is not clear which genes differ between extremes because they alter phenotypic liability and which show differences as a result of the extreme phenotype itself. We propose a formal model to distinguish between genes that are upstream and \"cause\" differential expression versus those for which differential expression is a result of the initial manifestation of phenotype. Relying on two sets of p-values, one from differential expression analysis and one from gene-specific association with phenotype (AP), and a gene coexpression or other gene-based network that serves as a bridge, our method identifies communities of genes more likely upstream or downstream of the phenotype.

We apply our method to data that were generated to assess the biological basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

However, despite the essential roles of CTCF and cohesin in establishing TADs, a long-standing paradox persists: CTCF and cohesin binding sites dramatically outnumber observed TAD boundaries, suggesting the existence of undiscovered architectural factors. To identify such missing factors, we conducted high-resolution in silico screens using C.Origami, a multi-modal AI model for predicting chromatin interactions. Remarkably, we identified ZNF654 and JMJD6 as novel factors uniquely defining TAD boundaries. Experimental validation confirmed that ZNF654, an uncharacterized vertebrate-specific zinc-finger protein, interacts with CTCF to form an architectural protein complex that demarcates chromatin domains. Genetic knockout of ZNF654 weakens TAD boundary strength without influencing other CTCF or cohesin binding sites. JMJD6, a deeply conserved jmjC-family dioxygenase, marks the anchors of the strongest chromatin stripes at both TAD boundaries and enhancer-promoter sites, while deleting JMJD6 weakens or diminishes such interaction signature.

Yet important gaps in our understanding remain: (1) What type of dynamics are observed during brain states? (2) What type of dynamics are observed between brain states? We address these questions by developing a multi-level Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) model, which jointly estimates state-specific equations of motion and probabilistic state transitions. Within states, the inferred dynamics were stable attractors: model estimated fixed points closely matched observed fMRI activity. A central finding was that dynamic states did not map one-to-one onto canonical static large-scale networks; instead, the relationship was many-to-many, with each state engaging multiple networks and each network participating in several states. For example, a default-mode related state also engaged attention/control net-works. Between states, transitions were structured (i.e., non-random) and heterogeneous. While some state transitions were relatively abrupt in terms of fMRI activity change (e.g., between a default-related network and an attention/control-related network), others were much smoother. Indeed, vector-field analyses in latent space quantified both toggle-like (abrupt) switches and smoother changes, revealing distinct transition pathways. To link systems-level organization to brain regions, we introduced region-level dynamics importance and state transition importance measures. Subcortical regions, particularly basal ganglia structures, dominated the dynamics of the highest-occupancy state, suggesting corticostriatal loops may scaffold a baseline regime from which excursions into other states arise. Importantly, regions most influential for within-state dynamics sometimes differed from those driving state transitions, demonstrating that fMRI signal magnitude alone does not uniquely uncover how regions contribute to system-level properties. Our SLDS framework provides a principled bridge between discrete-state and continuous-trajectory perspectives of resting state dynamics, clarifying what the brain does while in a state and how it moves between states during rest.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The mechanistic basis of meiotic heat sensitivity has remained unclear. Here, we show that in budding yeast, even moderate heat stress impairs the processing of programmed double-strand breaks into crossovers, resulting in permanent meiotic division arrest. This arrest depends on methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79) by Dot1, and a subset of other components of the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Thus, in contrast to the canonical heat shock response that adapts mitotically dividing cells to elevated temperatures, meiotic arrest is triggered by stalled recombination intermediates in the context of the H3K79 chromatin modification. These findings suggest a conserved epigenetic pathway responsible for heat-induced meiotic failure across eukaryotes. Genetically enhancing the heat tolerance of meiotic chromosome metabolism may increase reproductive resilience of organisms facing rising global temperatures, bridging the gap until mitigation strategies are in place.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biophysical assays, we demonstrate that access to this cryptic site is dynamically controlled by a single \"gatekeeper\" residue, Gln52. The rotameric state of Gln52 dictates a conformational equilibrium between a \"closed,\" state and a ligand-accessible \"open\" state. We validated this mechanism by engineering SIRP mutants to bias this equilibrium. A Q52F mutation locked the pocket in a closed state, abolishing both CD47 and fragment binding, while Q52A and Q52R mutations biased the protein toward an open state. These \"open-biased\" mutants not only exhibited decreased affinity for CD47 but also significantly improved binding to small-molecule fragments that inhibit the SIRP-CD47 interaction. This work reveals the intrinsic conformational plasticity of SIRP and establishes a validated structure-based roadmap for a new class of allosteric inhibitors. This 'flexibility-for-inhibition' strategy functions by trapping a non-binding conformation and represents a broadly applicable framework for targeting this and other challenging immune checkpoints.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Recent spatial technologies measure the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome and other modalities from thousands of cells across a tissue. Most assays typically profile only one modality from a tissue slice, raising the question of how to align spatial data from heterogeneous feature spaces. While multiple approaches have been developed for multi-modal integration of single-cell datasets, few existing techniques perform spatial alignment across arbitrary modalities incorporating both spatial and feature information. We introduce Manifold Gromov-Wasserstein (MGW), a metric-learning framework that exploits the product structure of spatial multiomics to infer modality-specific Riemannian pull-back metrics with neural fields. MGW aligns Riemannian distances induced by these metrics via Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport, yielding a hyperparameter-free cost across arbitrary modalities sharing a spatial base. The formulation enjoys theoretical invariances - including orthogonal transformations of the spatial and feature domains as well as global feature scalings. We demonstrate the advantages of MGW on multiple alignment tasks, including Stereo-Seq spatiotemporal transcriptomics of mouse embryo, Xenium and Visium spatial transcriptomics of colorectal cancer, and spatial metabolomics-transcriptomics from human striatum and kidney cancer. MGW recovers biologically meaningful correspondences and spatially coherent tissue structures, outperforming existing OT- and non-OT-based multi-modal baselines.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "With the emergence of powerful deep learning-based tools, computational protein design has become a widely accessible technique. Nowadays, it is possible to perform both sequence and structure design in a matter of minutes, making the technology attractive to the broader scientific community. In protein design campaigns, one of the most common in silico strategies to evaluate how well a sequence encodes a target structure is the so-called self-consistency or refolding pipeline. In this approach, a structure prediction model is used to refold the designed sequence to probe whether it is compatible with the intended structure, and is evaluated via two metrics linked to experimental success: the confidence score of the predicted structure (pLDDT) and the self-consistency root-mean-square deviation (scRMSD), which measures how closely the refolded structure matches the target. In this work, we systematically evaluate how different models and structure prediction settings impact these metrics, and to what extent they can be used to reliably filter sequence design candidates. We show that evolutionary information can obscure folding models' abilities to assess sequence-structure compatibility, reducing the predictive performance of refolding metrics for experimental success, particularly for designs that share homology with natural sequences. We further highlight limitations of refolding metrics, including their sensitivity to structural features, such as flexibility. Our findings raise awareness of potential pitfalls in refolding-based evaluation and support more informed use of these metrics in protein design campaigns.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Its permeability barrier is formed by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) known as FG-nucleoporins (FG-NUPs), whose physical state has long been debated. Deciphering how FG-NUPs behave inside living cells is crucial for understanding how the NPC achieves selective and rapid transport. Here, by combining site-specific labelling with picosecond time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, we reveal that FG domains exhibit nanosecond-scale, liquid-like mobility in live cells, yet undergo a liquid-to-solid transition in vitro. Experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations further show that importin-{beta}, a major nuclear transport receptor, and O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a key post-translational modification of FG-NUPs together stabilise the dynamic FG network. Finely balanced FG-FG interactions modulated by O-GlcNAcylation, along with FG-importin-{beta} interactions, maintain liquidity and enrich importin-{beta} near the NPC periphery, while extended FG domains remain in the central channel to form the transport barrier. These findings reconcile conflicting models of FG-NUP organisation and explain the recent observations in high-resolution MINFLUX studies of importin-{beta} depletion from the pore centre in mammalian cells. Beyond resolving debates over FG-NUP behaviour, our study underscores the importance of studying IDPs in their cellular context, with broader implications for understanding IDP-related diseases, including viral infections, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

They are considered promising biochemical targets for developing repellents of arthropod disease vectors and drugs to treat a variety of medical conditions including pain, inflammation, and itch. Recently, we discovered that cinnamodial (CDIAL), a natural drimane sesquiterpene produced by the medicinal plant Cinnamosma fragrans, agonizes mosquito TRPA1 channels and is antifeedant and repellent to Aedes aegypti. However, the selectivity of CDIAL for mosquito vs. human TRPA1 and how CDIAL binds to TRPA1 channels are unknown. Here we characterize the agonism by CDIAL of Aedes aegypti (Aa) and Homo sapiens (Hs) TRPA1 channels and compare it to that induced by two other known TRPA1 agonists, nepetalactone and JT010. Heterologous expression of AaTRPA1 and HsTRPA1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that CDIAL agonized both channels with similar potency. Nepetalactone was less potent of an agonist than CDIAL for both AaTRPA1 and HsTRPA1, but was a more specific agonist for AaTRPA1 over HsTRPA1 compared to CDIAL. JT010 did not detectably activate AaTRPA1, but was a more potent agonist of HsTRPA1 than CDIAL. To generate insights into a putative binding site of CDIAL on AaTRPA1 we mutated six Lys residues (656, 678, 681, 728, 738, 744) and/or a Cys residue (684) in the coupling domain previously hypothesized to be involved. Simultaneous mutation of the six Lys residues to Ala dampened agonistic responses of AaTRPA1 to CDIAL, whereas changing Cys684 to Ser had no detectable impact. Protein modeling and molecular docking simulations for both AaTRPA1 and HsTRPA1 suggest species-specific CDIAL-binding mechanisms to the coupling domain, which involve Lys681 in AaTRPA1 and Cys621 in HsTRPA1.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Baker, K. C.", "abstract": "Joint injuries, such as rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), is associated with the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). It is known that ACL rupture can lead to disruption of metabolic pathways, including the conversion of the essential amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine, which is associated with a sustained inflammatory response. An in vivo study was undertaken to determine the acute effects of intra-articular administration of liposomes loaded with the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) following ACL rupture. Using an established rat model of non-surgical ACL injury, male and female Lewis rats underwent a single intra-articular injection of empty liposomes, or liposomes loaded with IDO-1 and were subsequently randomized to 1- or 2-week endpoints. IDO-1 treatment after ACL injury was associated with a significant reduction in synovial fluid concentration of tryptophan at both 1- and 2-week endpoints. In addition to a reduction in tryptophan, IDO-1 treatment led to significantly lower synovial fluid concentrations of IL-1b and TNF-a. Intra-articular administration of IDO-1-loaded liposomes also increased the ratio of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) to IL-17-secreting helper T lymphocytes (Th17 cells). Similarly, IDO-1 treatment increased the number of CTLA4+ cells relative to IL-17A+ cells that infiltrated joint tissues at a 2-week endpoint. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (CE-uCT) was used to quantify treatment-based effects on articular cartilage thickness and surface roughness at at 2-week endpoint. In addition to sex-based differences, IDO-1-loaded liposome treatment was associated with increased cartilage thickness, with no significant effects on surface roughness. Histologic characterization is needed to determine whether this increased cartilage thickness represents a chondroprotective effect, or a degenerative effect of IDO-1-treatment.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

P.; Hildebrandt, T.; Sysko, R.; Berner, L.

Preliminary evidence suggests a role of the corticostriatal system; the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the inhibitory control brain network for risk of BE in children. Methods: Data from 65 children with BE (57% girls) and 84 matched controls (52% girls) from the 4.0 baseline release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were included. Stop Signal Task-based fMRI data were analyzed using graph theoretic techniques. Global and nodal network properties (e.g. efficiency, betweenness-centrality) were compared for between-group differences and sex-by-group interactions. Results: Despite comparable behavioral performance, children with BE showed significantly increased nodal efficiency of the right postcentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and increased connectedness of the right postcentral gyrus compared to control children. Children with BE showed distinct network hubs including the right MFG and left insula, while controls had distinct hubs in the right orbitofrontal and left fusiform gyri. Group-specific sex differences were found in the functioning of insular and frontal cortices. Conclusion: Increased efficiency and connectedness in frontal and parietal nodes of the inhibitory control network functioning in children with BE may represent a vulnerability for overeating. Distinct sex differences in functioning in children with BE compared to control children may reflect specific vulnerabilities to BE in the inhibitory control system in boys and girls that may contribute to sex differences in prevalence.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

Yet there is little direct experimental evidence causally linking interoceptive predictions to regulation of bodily physiology. Here we address this by focusing on insular cortex and glucose homeostasis. We find that just before the onset of a meal, insular cortex exhibits a transient burst of activity, reflecting a prediction of the future metabolic state. This transient predictive burst of activity is essential for anticipatory insulin release, subsequent post-meal insulin release, post-meal glucose and lipid homeostasis, and post-meal metabolism signaling in the liver. Our results highlight that insular cortex predictive computations are essential for anticipatory physiological control and for subsequently maintaining metabolic homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

The loss of pial collaterals abolished inter-territorial coupling without affecting local neurovascular responses.

We hypothesized that the diversity and community structure of AAP bacteria would vary across the vertical gradient, in relation to changes in environmental variables and following the DCM profile. To test this hypothesis, we studied the composition of AAP communities at different depths along the DCM structure in the South and Central Atlantic Ocean, by means of amplicon sequencing of the pufM gene. The results show significant differences in richness, community structure and taxonomic composition of samples from different layers of the DCM, highlighting the dependance of AAP bacteria on its structure. Remarkably, the use of primers with broad phylogenetic coverage enabled the recovery of several phylogroups previously detected only through metagenomics.

Nevertheless, a persistent empirical observation is that ordinary electric fans drastically reduce mosquito bites, even in the absence of chemical repellents. Here, we introduce a physics-guided, agent-based simulation demonstrating that mosquito host-seeking is not chemically inevitable but physically fragile. The model integrates directional airflow, vortex-induced chaotic mixing, and thermal decoy fields, and tracks 250 autonomous mosquito agents over 600 time-steps under Monte-Carlo sampling without fixed random seeds. Three aerodynamic mechanisms were quantified. Mild upward airflow already reduces successful host localization by more than 80 percent, despite not mechanically preventing flight. Increasing vortex circulation produces a continuous phase transition, collapsing localization probability below 1 percent at moderate strength. Thermal decoys cause only a linear dilution of success, indicating that misinformation alone cannot trigger collapse. A two-dimensional phase map reveals a robust \"invisibility region\" where airflow and vortex perturbations interact multiplicatively, eliminating host detection even when neither factor individually reaches threshold. These results show that mosquito host-seeking operates as a gradient-dependent failure system: once scalar fields lose spatial coherence, navigation collapses independent of sensory capability. This provides a quantitative theoretical basis for fan-mediated mosquito protection and suggests that non-chemical, low-energy airflow strategies can induce physical invisibility to hematophagous insects.", "date": "2025-12-11", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the immune genes involved in self-recognition and inhibition of immune responses against self-cells (missing-self immunity) are expected to be evolutionarily constrained. However, many pathogens, such as the Lyme disease agent Borrelia, hijack these genes to evade the immune system and may therefore select for their diversification. How these contrasting but concurrent selective forces shape the evolution of missing-self regulators is not clearly understood. To fill this gap, we investigated polymorphism and molecular signatures of selection acting on a missing-self regulator, the Complement Factor H (CFH), in bank vole populations, which are an important wild reservoir for Borrelia. We then compared the geographic structuring in the CFH domain interacting with Borrelia (CCP 20) against a genomic background represented by RAD-seq markers. We found signals of positive and diversifying selection at CCP 20, suggesting that CFH evolved in response to pressures from pathogens. Additionally, we found other innate immunity genes within the alternative complement pathway, which is regulated by CFH, under diversifying selection, highlighting its involvement in host-parasite coevolution.

It operates entirely on structural information, using molecular structures to infer equivalence and define relationships. StereoMapper was implemented using RDKit (2025.3.3) and Open Babel-wheel (3.1.1.22) which provides the core functionality of the Open Babel software, and benchmarked across four curated control datasets to evaluate performance in relationship classification (enantiomer, diastereomer, stereo-resolution pairs, and protomer).

On curated positive control sets containing only positive examples across multiple relationship classes, StereoMapper achieved mean precision, recall, and F1-scores of 92.6, 98.0, and 95.3, respectively; following optimisation, these improved to 98.9, 98.2, and 98.5.
