T.; Santos, J. A.; Alkema, M. J.; Shlizerman, E.", "abstract": "The ability to fully discern how the brain orchestrates behavior requires the development of successful computational approaches to integrate and inform in-vivo investigations of the nervous system. To effectively assist with such investigations, computational approaches must be generic, scalable and unbiased. We propose such a comprehensive framework to investigate the interaction between the nervous system and the body for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Specifically, we introduce a model that computationally emulates the activity of the complete somatic nervous system and its response to stimuli. The model builds upon the full anatomical wiring diagram, the connectome, and integrates it with additional layers including intra-cellular and extra-cellular bio-physically relevant neural dynamics, layers translating neural activity to muscle forces and muscle impulses to body postures. In addition, it implements inverse integration which modulates neural dynamics according to external forces on the body. We validate the model by in-silico injection of currents into sensory- and inter-neurons known to play a role in locomotion behaviors (e.g. posterior/anterior touch) and by applying external forces on the body. We are able to generate characteristic baseline locomotion behaviors (forward and backward movements). Inclusion of proprioceptive feedback, implemented through inverse integration, shows that feedback can entrain and sustain movements initiated by neural or mechanical triggers. We further apply neural stimuli, experimentally known to modulate locomotion, and show that our model supports natural behavioral responses such as turns, reversals and avoidance. The proposed model can be utilized to infer neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behavior. For this purpose, we develop large-scale computational ablation approaches such as (i) ablation survey and (ii) conditional ablation. Our results show how an ablation survey can identify neurons required for a ventral turning behavior. We also show how conditional ablation can identify alternative novel neural pathways, e.g. propose neurons which facilitate steering behavior towards olfactory attractants. The outcomes of our study show that the framework can be utilized to identify neural circuits, which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Disruptions in this interaction are linked to various human diseases, yet the mechanisms enabling robust body-axis formation through {beta}-Catenin/Wnt-Dkk interactions remain unclear. A key model system for Wnt-driven pattern formation is the pre-bilaterian organism Hydra, where two ancestral Dkks interact with Wnt signalling to self-organise the body axis. While Hydra patterning has been extensively studied using the activator-inhibitor framework, a model integrating experimentally identified molecules has been lacking. Here, we introduce a mathematical model incorporating both Dkks and their experimentally observed interactions with Wnt signalling. Numerical and analytical studies show that this network alone is sufficient to drive de novo body-axis formation across a broad parameter range. Our mutual inhibition model offers an alternative to the classical activation/long-range inhibition paradigm, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed Dkk and Wnt patterns under various conditions. Unlike previous models, it is directly grounded in experimental data, links injury response to pattern formation, and remains robust against perturbations.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

In those who do not, it is unclear at what point, or by what mechanism, a trajectory of stable resiliency emerges. Methods: Utilizing a 10-day repeated social defeat stress model (RSDS) for MDD, we observed that a critical period between 7 and 10 daily defeats marks the phenotypical divergence of resilient from susceptible mice. Using cell-type selective electrophysiology, chemogenetics, optogenetics, fiber photometry and RNA quantification was employed to investigate the nature of stress effects on neuroadaptation in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) required to determine resilience. Results: In response to ongoing stress, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF+, but not CRF-) neurons of the (BNSTov) displayed a sustained increased firing rate in resilient, but not susceptible mice. This neurophysiological adaptation was self-sustaining, but only after 7 critical stress exposures, indicating that the process of developing resilience is dependent on stress history. Conclusion: Our study reveals a novel process by which individuals might persist in the face of adversity by way of stress-provoked activation, not inhibition of a key CRF limbic region that establishes a pathway to resilience.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch task are unknown. Here we trained head fixed mice in a simple go-cue task to move a whisker on one side of the face to touch a sensor and tracked facial movements. Our analysis shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head-post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e. whether go cue triggered movement had begun, or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task -- to touch the sensor within 2 seconds -- how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Our study reveals that CHK2 binds to the MUS81-EME2 complex and positively regulates the formation of DSBs in response to replication stress or BRCA2 deficiency. This association occurs through the FHA domain of CHK2 and is disrupted by the I157T mutation, but not by the R117A mutation. The CHK2-MUS81 complex assembles downstream of fork reversal and degradation, and CHK2-mediated phosphorylation of MUS81 is essential for introducing DSBs at deprotected replication forks, thereby promoting replication fork recovery in BRCA2-deficient cells. Together, our findings elucidate a regulatory mechanism of the MUS81 complex and uncover a novel role of the ATM-CHK2 axis in the response to deprotected replication forks in the absence of BRCA2.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

This process is regulated by specific expression of multiple genes, which guide the cell through differentiation but also ensure proper function of terminal cell types. Over the last decade, the role of cellular metabolism in maintaining stem cells pluripotency and differentiation has been getting more attention due to a direct link between metabolic state and differentiation potential of cells. Since Nuclear Myosin 1 (NM1) deletion leads to a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis in mice, here we asked if NM1 also contributes to cell differentiation. Indeed, analysis of metabolomic profiles and cytokine and chemokine levels upon NM1 depletion support a role in hematopoiesis. In an NM1 KO mouse model results from total blood cell count and bleeding assay show decreased erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis as well as failure in hemostasis. Next, we explored the role of NM1 during the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells to terminal blood cells by transcriptionally profiling bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood from NM1 KO mice. We found that in bone marrow, NM1 deletion leads to overexpression of genes associated with glycolysis-dependent platelet activation and suppression of the innate immune system. These expression patterns are preserved and become more complex in spleen and peripheral blood. The study, therefore, provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of hematopoietic differentiation and activation of specific blood cell types and suggests NM1 as a potential therapeutic target for blood-related disorders.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs and learning ''composition-to-function'' mappings that reveal genetic part composability rules and enable rapid identification of behavior-optimized variants. Here, we introduce CLASSIC, a genetic screening platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pools of constructs of arbitrary length containing diverse part compositions. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of >105 gene circuit designs (from 5-20 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. The resulting datasets can be used to train ML models that accurately predict circuit behavior across expansive circuit design landscapes, revealing part composability rules that govern circuit performance.

The {beta}-cell microtubule network has a complex architecture and is non-directional, which provides insulin granules at the cell periphery for rapid secretion response, yet to avoid over-secretion and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have previously characterized a peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array, which is critical for the withdrawal of excessive insulin granules from the secretion sites. Microtubules in {beta} cells originate at the Golgi in the cell interior, and how the peripheral array is formed is unknown. Using real-time imaging and photo-kinetics approaches in clonal mouse pancreatic {beta} cells MIN6, we now demonstrate that kinesin KIF5B, a motor protein with a capacity to transport microtubules as cargos, slides existing microtubules to the cell periphery and aligns them to each other along the plasma membrane. Moreover, like many physiological {beta}-cell features, microtubule sliding is facilitated by a high glucose stimulus. These new data, together with our previous report that in high glucose sub-membrane MT array is destabilized to allow for robust secretion, indicate that MT sliding is another integral part of glucose-triggered microtubule remodeling, likely replacing destabilized peripheral microtubules to prevent their loss over time and {beta}-cell malfunction.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

N.; Fronhofer, E. A.", "abstract": "Dispersal is key to understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Dispersal may itself evolve and exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, organisms may modulate their dispersal rates in response to the density of their conspecifics (density-dependent dispersal) and their own sex (sex-biased dispersal). While optimal dispersal plastic responses have been derived from first principles, the genetic and molecular basis of dispersal plasticity has not been modelled. An understanding of the genetic architecture of dispersal plasticity is especially relevant for understanding dispersal evolution during rapidly changing spatial ecological conditions such as range expansions. In this context, we develop an individual-based metapopulation model of the evolution of density-dependent and sex-biased dispersal during range expansions. We represent the dispersal trait as a gene-regulatory network (GRN), which can take population density and an individual's sex as an input and analyse emergent context- and condition-dependent dispersal responses. We compare dispersal evolution and ecological dynamics in this GRN model to a standard reaction norm (RN) approach under equilibrium metapopulation conditions and during range expansions. We find that under equilibrium metapopulation conditions, the GRN model produces emergent density-dependent and sex-biased dispersal plastic response shapes that match the theoretical expectation of the RN model. However, during range expansion, when mutation effects are large enough, the GRN model leads to faster range expansion because GRNs can maintain higher adaptive potential. Our results imply that, in order to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics in contemporary time, the genetic architecture of traits must be taken into account.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

To this end, we present two tools for simulating and analyzing behavioral trait dynamics: The Nash Score, a novel metric for evaluating evolutionary stability, and uumarrty, a Python-based framework for simulating predator-prey interactions using game theory. These tools provide a new approach for assessing the temporal co-evolution of behavioral traits within agent-based models, with a particular focus on predator-prey dynamics, though the framework is generalizable to other ecological interactions. The Nash Score functions as an analog to the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) from classical game theory, offering a quantitative index to assess the relative stability and resilience of behavioral traits under selection. By integrating evolutionary game theory into agent-based modeling, our framework addresses longstanding critiques about the oversimplification of ecological dynamics in traditional game-theoretic models and improves the interpretability of post-hoc analyses in simulation-based studies. We demonstrate the utility of these tools through a case study on the microhabitat preferences of kangaroo rats and rattlesnakes. Specifically, we explore the emergence and stability of optimal strategies across scenarios with: (1) heterogeneous energy yields among microhabitats, (2) differential strike success rates by microhabitat, and (3) the presence of a specialist predator. Our results highlight key drivers of behavioral adaptation in predator-prey systems and offer insight into how eco evolutionary feedbacks shape the emergence of stability in complex environments.

Here, we investigate whether the binding of CTCF/cohesin on DNA imposes constraints on DNA replication, leading to replication stress and genomic instability. Our results reveal that CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to DNA during replication (S phase) in cancer cells (HeLa). Further, examination of replication stress through ChIP-seq of the DNA damage response/repair proteins (MRE11, STN1, {gamma}H2AX, and RAD51) showed high enrichment of these proteins at CBSs (as compared to their immediate flanking regions and control sites) and positively correlated with the binding strength of CTCF/cohesin at CBSs in the S phase. Moreover, analysis of somatic mutations from cancer genomes supports that the enrichment of mutations at CBSs is significantly higher in samples harbouring somatic copy number deletion in MRE11 and STN1 compared to wild-type samples. Together, these results demonstrate that the co-binding of CTCF/cohesin on the DNA during the S phase causes replication stress and DNA strand breaks, and this could lead to genome instability at CBSs observed in cancer.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

In awake macaques receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS, we found that cathodal stimulation robustly disrupted the repertoire of functional connectivity patterns, increased structure-function correlation, decreased Shannon entropy, and favored transitions towards anatomically-based patterns. Under deep sedation, anodal tDCS significantly altered brain pattern distribution and reduced structure-function correlation. The prefrontal stimulation also modified dynamic connectivity arrangements typically associated with consciousness and unconsciousness.

We advocate the use of minimally informative priors, as they increase the accuracy and decrease the uncertainty of the inference. For complex HMMs, stronger prior assumptions are needed to render the posterior sufficiently proper. This can be achieved by confining the parameter space to physically motivated limits. Another beneficial assumption is finite cooperativity of ligand-binding and unbinding events, which introduces a bias towards non-cooperativity but still allows for a non-vanishing degree of cooperativity that is inferred from the data. Despite its vagueness, our prior renders the posterior sufficiently proper for all datasets that we considered without imposing the assumption of non-cooperativity.

We found that temperature alone does not drive prey evolution unless predators are present, and food-web context determines ensuing evolutionary dynamics.

Inter-individual correlations are also employed on data from fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Many past studies have not specified tasks for participants, keeping them in an implicit \"resting\" condition. This lack of task specificity raises questions about how different tasks impact inter-individual correlation estimates. In our analysis of fMRI data from 100 unrelated participants, scanned during seven task conditions and in a resting state, we calculated Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) for each task as a regional measure of brain functions. We found that changes in ReHo due to different tasks were relatively small compared with the variations across brain regions. Cross-region variations of ReHo were highly correlated between different tasks. Similarly, whole-brain inter-individual correlation patterns were remarkably consistent across the tasks, showing correlations greater than 0.78. Changes in inter-individual correlations between tasks were primarily driven by connectivity in the visual, somatomotor, default mode network, and the interactions between them. The subtle yet statistically significant differences in functional connectivity may be linked to specific brain regions associated with the studied tasks.

Indeed, differentially expressed mRNAs across cell types dis-played colocalization patterns that scaled by abundance, as did simulations that reproduce cell-specific differ-ences in abundance.

Increasing evidence supports the contributing role of satellite cells in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal degenerative muscle disease caused by loss of dystrophin.

Here, we used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to determine how dystrophin deficiency impacts the satellite cell transcriptome and cellular composition by comparing satellite cells from mdx and the more severe D2-mdx DMD mouse models. DMD satellite cells were disproportionally found within myogenic progenitor clusters and a previously uncharacterized DMD enriched cluster. Despite exposure to different dystrophic environments, mdx and D2-mdx satellite cells exhibited overlapping dysregulation in gene expression and associated biological pathways. When comparing satellite stem cell versus myogenic progenitor populations, we identified unique dysfunctions between DMD and healthy satellite cells including apoptotic cell death and senescence, respectively. Pseudotime analyses revealed differences in cell fate trajectories indicating that DMD satellite cells are stalled in their differentiation capacity. In vivo regeneration assays confirmed that DMD satellite cells exhibit impaired myogenic gene expression and cell fate dynamics during regenerative myogenesis. These defects in differentiation capacity are accompanied by impaired senescence and autophagy dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that inducing autophagy can rescue differentiation of DMD progenitors.

Methods: We used multiplex fluorescent in situ-hybridization to characterize the distribution of GalR1 mRNA in the vPFC and vHC. We assessed behavior in rats using the 5-Choice task. We developed a novel viral approach to gain genetic access to GalR1-expressing neurons in the vPFC and vHC, and used optogenetic stimulation and fiber photometric analysis to gauge the contribution of GalR1 on different phases of the 5-choice task. Results: We found that GalR1 is expressed in glutamatergic neurons in both the vPFC and vHC, and that optogenetic excitation of GalR1 expressing neurons in the vPFC, but not vHC, selectively disrupts attention. The calcium dynamics in GalR1-expressing neurons revealed opposing activity in the vPFC and vHC which was consistent with our previous work demonstrating differential behavioral effects induced by GalR1 activating in these regions. Conclusions: We discovered that GalR1-expressing neurons in the vPFC and vHC have distinct activity profiles linked to unique cognitive signals and behavioral outcomes. This region- and response-specific intrinsic activity shapes the expression of executive-control behaviors.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

To assess how culture pH impacts Jen1 endocytosis, S. cerevisiae was grown in carbon-limited continuous cultures with a mixed ethanol-lactate feed. When applying a linearly increasing pH (6.75 to 7.25), extracellular lactate and pyruvate concentrations increased progressively. Up to pH 7.0, these concentrations aligned with the thermodynamic equilibrium of Jen1-mediated electroneutral carboxylate-proton symport, while Jen1 internalization became more pronounced above pH 7.0. Transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, together with higher residual lactate levels, indicated increased energy demands at supra-optimal pH values. By analyzing transport, endocytosis, and transcriptional responses in actively growing continuous cultures, this study uncovers pH-dependent physiological challenges associated with electroneutral carboxylate/proton symport. The data support the hypothesis that Jen1 internalization evolved to prevent intracellular metabolite loss under unfavorable pH conditions. These findings provide novel insights into the physiological consequences of transporter energy coupling and the ecophysiological relevance of anion transporters when extracellular pH approaches or exceeds cytosolic pH.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

N.; Pureswaran, D. S.; Marshall, K. E.", "abstract": "Aim: While many studies on ectotherm thermal tolerance consider temperature exposure, the frequency of temperature exposures is emerging as an important and generally overlooked driver of survival and fitness which may influence species ranges. We use a physiologically-informed species distribution model to evaluate the influence of temperature fluctuations on the historical distribution and intensity of defoliation of a Lepidopteran forest pest, and on predicted future defoliation. Location: Eastern Canada. Time period: 2006-2016, projections to 2041-2070. Major taxa studied: Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae, spruce budworm). Methods: We combined publicly-available maps of spruce budworm-induced defoliation between 2006-2016 in the Canadian province of Quebec with climate, forest composition, and de novo temperature fluctuation predictors to train a species distribution model. Our model evaluated how predictor categories influence spruce budworm defoliation and compared these results to a model trained without temperature fluctuations. Additionally, we predicted future spruce budworm defoliation under 2041-2070 climate change conditions using the models trained with and without temperature fluctuation predictors to determine the impact of temperature fluctuations on future defoliation predictions. Results: We found that the inclusion of temperature fluctuation predictors improved model performance, and these predictors ranked highly in importance relative to predictors in other categories. The model trained with temperature fluctuation predictors also predicted vastly different defoliation distribution and severity across Quebec, Ontario, and Labrador than the model trained without them under future climate. Main conclusions: Our study reveals the previously overlooked importance of temperature fluctuations on landscape-scale spruce budworm defoliation and demonstrates the importance of including physiologically-informed predictors in species distribution models. It also provides a novel framework for including thermal variation in correlative species distribution models of ectotherms.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Both these phenomena subject populations to novel conditions, either in space (species introductions) or in time (climate change), yet the role of adaptation in how populations respond to these rapid environmental shifts is poorly understood. We conducted a large-scale trans-continental common garden experiment using white clover (Trifolium repens, Fabaceae) to test whether adaptive evolution to spatiotemporal variation in climate could contribute to the ecological success of one of the most widespread plant species in the world. Individuals from 96 populations of Trifolium repens (white clover) from both its native (Europe) and introduced (North America) ranges were planted into four experimental common gardens located in northern (Uppsala, Sweden) and southern (Montpellier, France) Europe, and northern (Mississauga, Canada) and southern (Lafayette, USA) North America. We recorded plant sexual and clonal fitness in each common garden and assessed whether the strength of local adaptation differed between the native and introduced ranges and whether populations are rapidly adapting to climate change. Results show that local adaptation was only evident when populations were transplanted into common gardens located in the same range (native or introduced) from which they originated and was driven by stronger selection (due to climatic factors rather than herbivory) at lower latitudes in both ranges. Our results indicate rapid local adaptation across a large latitudinal gradient in introduced T. repens populations, along with an associated adaptation cost when transplanted back into the native range. We also find evidence of an adaptation lag in the northern common garden in the introduced range, with plants from historically warmer climates exhibiting the greatest fitness. These findings support two major conclusions: 1) white clover can rapidly adapt to spatial variation in climate in its introduced range as well as the native range, and 2) despite rapid adaptation to novel environments, introduced white clover populations are not keeping pace with rapid climate change. Overall, our results provide insight into the role of adaptation in facilitating the ecological success of non-native species in a rapidly changing world.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

This involves the production and deployment of antibacterial toxins that disrupt essential cellular processes in target cells. The continuous arms race in which bacteria acquire new toxin and immunity proteins to promote increased adaptation to their environment is responsible for the diversification of this toxin repertoire. Here, we deployed in-silico strategies to analyze 10,000 genomes and identify effectors secreted via the type VI secretion system of Salmonella. We identified 128 candidates, which are widespread in a vast array of Salmonella serovars and other bacterial species. Tox-Act1 is among the most frequent candidates and was selected for in-depth characterization. Tox-Act1 contains a permuted NlpC/P60 papain-like catalytic core characteristic of lipid-targeting members rather than the typical peptidases or amidases. Evolutionary analysis revealed the relationship of Tox-Act1 with acyltransferases. Biochemical assays with purified toxin and lipidomics of intoxicated cells showed that Tox-Act1 exhibits phospholipase activity, cleaving off acyl groups from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. In addition, we demonstrate that Tox-Act1 is secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner and provide a competitive advantage during colonization of the gut of infected mice. This work broadens our understanding of toxin domains and provides the first direct characterization of a lipid-targeting NlpC/P60 domain in biological conflicts.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

G.; Garrido, M. I.", "abstract": "The role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in consciousness is hotly debated. Frontal theories argue that the PFC is necessary for consciousness, while sensory theories propose that consciousness arises from recurrent activity in the posterior cortex alone, with activity in the PFC resulting from the mere act of reporting. To resolve this dispute, we re-analysed an EEG dataset of 30 participants from a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm where faces are (un)consciously perceived. Dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate the effective connectivity between the key contended brain regions, the prefrontal and the posterior cortices. Then, a second-level parametric empirical Bayesian model was conducted to determine how connectivity was modulated by awareness and task-relevance. While an initial data-driven search could not corroborate neither sensory nor frontal theories of consciousness, a more directed hypothesis-driven analysis revealed strong evidence that both theories could explain the data, with a very slight preference for frontal theories. Specifically, a model with backward connections switched off within the posterior cortex explained awareness better (53%) than a model without backward connections from the PFC to sensory regions. Our findings provide some support for a subtle, yet crucial, contribution of the frontal cortex in consciousness, and highlight the need to revise current theories of consciousness.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Roiuk, M.; Neff, M.", "abstract": "Initiation of translation on eukaryotic mRNAs requires a 40S ribosome loaded with an initiator tRNA in order to scan for, and to identify, an initiation codon. Under most conditions, the initiator tRNA is recruited to the ribosome as part of a ternary complex composed of initiator tRNA, eIF2 and GTP. Although this function of recruiting the initiator tRNA was originally ascribed to another factor, eIF2A, it was later disproven and shown to belong to eIF2. Nonetheless, eIF2A is still considered a translation initiation factor because it binds the ribosome and shows genetic interactions with other initiation factors such as eIF4E. The exact function of eIF2A during translation initiation, however, remains unclear. Here we systematically test in HeLa cells, using ribosome profiling and luciferase reporter assays, the role of eIF2A in translation initiation, including translation of upstream ORFs that are either initiated with a AUG or near-cognate codons. Since eIF2A is thought to take over the function of eIF2 when eIF2 is inhibited, we also test conditions where the integrated stress response is activated, thereby leading to eIF2 inactivation. In none of our assays, however, could we detect a role of eIF2A in translation initiation. It is possible that eIF2A plays a role in translation regulation in specific conditions that we have not tested here, or that it plays a role in a different aspect of RNA biology.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Deconvolution of sample identity using inherent features would enable the incorporation of pooled barcoding and sequencing protocols, thereby increasing data throughput and analytical sample size without requiring increases in experimental sample size and sequencing costs. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept that sex-dependent gene expression patterns can be leveraged for the deconvolution of pooled snRNA-seq data. Using previously published snRNA-seq data from the rat ventral tegmental area, we trained a range of machine learning models to classify cell sex using genes differentially expressed in cells from male and female rats. Models that used sex-dependent gene expression predicted cell sex with high accuracy (93-95%) and outperformed simple classification models using only sex chromosome gene expression (88-90%). The generalizability of these models to other brain regions was assessed using an additional published data set from the rat nucleus accumbens. Within this data set, model performance remained highly accurate in cell sex classification (90-92% accuracy) with no additional training. This work provides a model for future snRNA-seq studies to perform sample deconvolution using a two-sex pooled sample sequencing design and benchmarks the performance of various machine learning approaches to deconvolve sample identification from inherent sample features.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Despite its pivotal role, RuBisCO has a slow carboxylation rate and is competitively inhibited by oxygen (O2). These traits impose limitations on photosynthetic efficiency, making RuBisCO a compelling target for improvement. Interest in Form II RuBisCO from Gallionellaceae bacteria, which comprise a dimer or hexamer of large subunits, arises from their nearly 5-fold higher carboxylation rate than the average RuBisCO enzyme. As well as having a fast carboxylation rate (25.8 s-1 at 25C), we show that Gallionellaceae RuBisCO (GWS1B) is extremely sensitive to O2 inhibition, consistent with its evolution under semi-anaerobic environments. We therefore used a novel in vivo mutagenesis-mediated screening pipeline to evolve GWS1B over six rounds under oxygenic selection, identifying three catalytic point mutants with improved ambient carboxylation efficiency; Thr-29-Ala (T29A), Glu-40-Lys (E40K) and Arg-337-Cys (R337C). Full kinetic characterization showed that each substitution enhanced the CO2 affinity of GWS1B under oxygenic conditions by subduing oxygen affinity, leading to 25% (E40K), 11% (T29A) and 8% (R337C) enhancements in carboxylation efficiency under ambient O2 at 25C. By contrast, under the near anaerobic natural environment of Gallionellaceae, the carboxylation efficiency of each mutant was impaired ~16%.

We developed a LA mouse model and validated key findings through histopathological examination and RT-qPCR analysis. Results: We identified nine distinct cell types in the joint microenvironment with significant compositional shifts during disease progression.

In C. elegans, we found that proper expression of PAL-1, the C. elegans Caudal orthologue, is required for correct positioning of motor neuron cell bodies in the first larval stage ventral nerve cord (VNC). We identified an upstream regulatory region within the pal-1 promoter that drives pal-1 expression in a subset of DD and DA neuronal progenitors. We also show that SEX-1, a nuclear hormone receptor, is required for motor neuron positioning in the VNC. Loss of sex-1 results in neuronal positioning defects similar to those observed in pal-1 mutants. This is due to a requirement for SEX-1 in promoting pal-1 expression in DD and DA neuronal progenitors during VNC assembly. Double mutant analysis further suggests that SEX-1 also has pal-1-independent functions.

While systems for continuous directed evolution have successfully compressed gene evolution onto laboratory timeframes at scale, past work largely focused on the evolution of single genes towards single functions. In contrast, when nature searches for new gene functions, it does so by exposing a vast repertoire of genes to a multitude of complex selective pressures in vivo, multiplying the possibilities for innovation. To mimic natural gene evolution in laboratory time, we introduce OrthoRep Assisted Continuous Library Evolution (ORACLE). In ORACLE, high-diversity function-agnostic gene libraries (e.g., open reading frames from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana and human cells) are encoded onto OrthoRep's p1 plasmid in yeast where library members durably mutate up to one-million times faster than the host genome. As a result, ORACLE provides an opportunity to quickly observe the evolutionary emergence and optimization of new gene functions that satisfy complex in vivo selection pressures from an abundance of sources. Using ORACLE, we discovered a wealth of novel gene variants conferring new cellular functions, each experimentally evolved in fewer than ~100 generations corresponding to less than one month of serial passaging. In several cases, genes that initially exhibited little to no observable phenotype rapidly evolved to confer transcription factor activity, chaperone activity, inhibition of specific targets, etc. These findings demonstrate the relative ease with which existing genetic material can enter the view of selection and evolve new function in vivo. Moreover, our work establishes ORACLE as an effective system for exploring the fundamental mechanisms of gene innovation and discovering bespoke biomolecules for diverse applications.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

In turn, the cytoskeleton influences the signaling machinery via several feedback loops, but the nature and function of this feedback remain poorly understood. In this study, we use computational models to discern the essential role of complementary positive and negative feedback loops in polarizing cells. We contrast two potential mechanisms for the negative feedback: local inhibition and global inhibition. Our results indicate that both mechanisms can stabilize the leading edge and inhibit actin polymerization in other sites, preventing multipolarity. While some experimental perturbations align more closely with the local inhibition model, statistical analyses reveal its limited polarization potential within a wide excitability range. Conversely, global inhibition more effectively suppresses secondary and tertiary leading-edge formation, making it a more robust polarization mechanism. This raises an intriguing question: if local inhibition better replicates experimental observations but is less effective for polarization than local excitation and global inhibition, could there be a supplementary mechanism enhancing its polarization potential? To address this, we propose a novel mechanism involving the dynamic partitioning of back molecules which enhances communication between the front and back of the cell and can be leveraged by local feedback interactions between the cytoskeleton and signal transduction to improve polarization efficiency.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

We introduce a previously undescribed communication display in two cuttlefish species: Sepia officinalis and Sepia bandensis. The four \"arm wave signs\" are stereotyped arm movements consisting of long-lasting, expressive, and repeated sequences of undulations of the arms, which can be combined and expressed following specific patterns. Using non-invasive behavioral experiments, we tested the hypothesis that they represent multimodal communication displays. To assess the role of visual cues, we recorded videos of animals signing and played them back to individual cuttlefish participants. When seeing the movies, cuttlefish waved back at the display. Most importantly, they were more likely to wave back when the movie was in upright (original) configuration as opposed to flipped upside-down, similar to the manner in which humans perceive faces and other socially relevant displays. In addition to their visually striking display, arm wave signs produce mechanical waves in the water, prompting us to explore the possibility that they may also be perceived via mechanoreception. Using playback experiments similar to those adopted in vision, we obtained preliminary evidence to support this hypothesis, indicating that arm wave signs may represent multimodal signals involving vision and mechanoreception. Our new result on communication with arm wave signs opens up novel possibilities for understanding vibration-mediated communication through the lateral line and/or the statocysts in a cephalopod species as an example of convergent evolution with vertebrates.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

While existing methods rely on statistical models, motif enrichment, or prior-based inference, they often depend on deterministic assumptions about regulatory relationships and rely on static regulatory databases. Moreover, few approaches can effectively integrate prior biological knowledge with data-driven inference to capture novel, dynamic, and context-specific regulatory interactions. Results: To address these limitations, we develop scRegulate, a generative deep learning framework that leverages variational inference to infer TF activities while incorporating gene regulatory network (GRN) priors. By integrating structured biological constraints with a probabilistic latent space model, scRegulate offers a scalable and biologically interpretable solution for prediction of regulatory interactions from scRNA-seq data. We comprehensively benchmark scRegulate using multiple public experimental and synthetic datasets generated from GRouNdGAN to demonstrate its ability to infer TF activities and GRNs that are consistent with the underlying ground-truth regulatory interactions. scRegulate outperforms existing TF inference methods, achieving AUROC values of 0.71-0.86 and AUPRC values of 0.80-0.95 on three synthetic datasets. Additionally, scRegulate accurately recapitulates experimentally validated TF knockdown effects on a Perturb-seq dataset, achieving a mean log2 fold change of -0.61 to -18.92 (p [&le;] 8.0610x10-13) for key TFs such as ELK1, EGR1, and CREB1. Applied to the PBMC scRNA-seq data, scRegulate reconstructs cell-type-specific GRNs and identifies differentially active TFs that align with known immune regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we show that scRegulate's TF embeddings capture meaningful transcriptional heterogeneity, enabling accurate clustering of cell types. Collectively, our results establish scRegulate as a powerful, interpretable, and scalable framework for inferring TF activities and regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic.

Here, we show that TDP-43 pathology in AD is broadly associated with splicing abnormalities, including aberrant splicing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). TDP-43 drives the formation of elongated APP isoforms, disrupting alternative splicing across ALS, FTLD-TDP and AD, providing a compelling mechanism for a long-standing observation of APP isoform dysregulation. We further establish a mechanistic link between TDP-43, APP splicing, and A-beta pathology. Surprisingly, the disruption to alternative APP splicing is mediated by a toxic gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function, rather than loss of its nuclear role. Using proximity proteomics and base editing in human iPSC-derived neurons, we show that TDP-43 pathology causes cytoplasmic co-sequestration of splicing regulators SCAF11, SRSF5, and TIAL1. Knockdown of these regulators also results in APP mis-splicing and increased A-beta burden, without affecting other TDP-43 targets such as STMN2 or UNC13A. Together, our findings suggest that TDP-43-mediated splicing dysfunction upstream of APP contributes to the pathogenesis of seemingly disparate neurodegenerative diseases, uniting AD and ALS/FTLD-TDP through a shared molecular mechanism.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

The MGD-induced ternary complex interface does not resemble known protein-protein interactions (PPI) with CRBN. Instead, CRBN mimics an endogenous binding partner of G3BP2 and repurposes a preexisting PPI hotspot on the target protein. Our findings provide a novel generalizable concept for the rationalization of unconventional neosubstrate binding modes on CRBN, demonstrate unprecedented potential for the reprogrammability of this substrate receptor by MGDs, and offer opportunities for rational expansion of the target repertoire accessible to this modality.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Additionally, CB predicted activity-increasing and -decreasing mutations for the conformationally-gated enzymes Src, B-Raf, MurA, and FabZ. We then used CB to design novel variants of E. coli lipoic acid ligase (LplA) biased toward 'open' or 'closed' adenylate ester-bound conformations, which were characterized through tryptophan fluorescence and small angle X-ray scattering measurements. Closed-biased LplA variants exhibited greater sequence-specificity than wild-type, enabling targeted fluorophore labeling of proteins in living cells, while open-based LplA variants were far more promiscuous, enabling proximity-dependent proteome tagging in cells.

We compiled demographic time series from 87 populations for 66 animal species spanning 12 taxonomic classes to test whether sociality promotes demographic buffering and whether this relationship depends on environmental context. Using stochastic elasticities and phylogenetically comparative analyses, we find broad support for the social buffering hypothesis: more social species exhibit lower sensitivity of population growth to vital rate variance (lower stochastic elasticity to vital rate variances, Tsigma), particularly in juvenile survival and reproduction. Contrary to expectations, juvenile vital rates, but not adult survival, showed the strongest buffering patterns in social taxa, suggesting life-stage-specific social mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that social species invest more in maximising the average performance of adult survival and reproduction (higher stochastic elasticity to vital rate means, Tmu), consistent with adaptive strategies favouring canalisation of fitness-related traits. This buffering benefit is especially relevant in highly unpredictable environments: in climates with erratic precipitation, social species have greater demographic advantages, exhibiting even lower Tsigma values. Together, these findings provide support for the social buffering hypothesis, especially in highly stochastic environments. Social traits confer some demographic stability under moderate climatic conditions, but may become more relevant under extreme stochasticity, an insight particularly important for understanding population resilience in a rapidly changing world.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Proteins are treated as smooth Riemannian manifolds; each residue is equipped with a localized fiber, whose environment vector encodes geometric and physico-chemical features. Motivated by Density Functional Theory - which links global electron density to reactivity - we hypothesize that a sufficiently rich local density stencil captures the same information at the residue scale. On this foundation we build a single-file Python toolkit, reactive site predictor.py, which ranks candidate reactive residues in both metallo- and apo-proteins. The score combines (i) a geometry-based environment term, (ii) relativistic ZORA distance factors for metal centers, (iii) coordination-number and angle-deviation corrections, and (iv) an optional pocket-proximity flag. A fixed global random seed removes all stochastic elements, guaranteeing reproducibility. Benchmarks on three representative assemblies - Rubisco, GroEL, and SecA - achieve top-10 recall between 90 and 50 percent for documented functional residues. While promising, the current validation is limited to three static PDB structures; extension to dynamic ensembles and explicit quantum layers is left to future work. The framework thus offers an interpretable, physics-grounded, and deterministic paradigm for protein-function prediction. Beyond residue-level reactivity, the same manifold-fiber formalism is ultimately intended for purely geometric analysis of protein-protein interfaces: instead of assigning scalar scores, we construct an explicit contact submanifold and study its curvature, topology, and fibre-overlap signatures to deduce interaction logic without additional learning.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

This enhanced velocity, driven by three unique amino acid substitutions (R114Q, S155A and Y309F), facilitates long-distance transport in these species and represents a case of convergent evolution. Our structural analysis reveals that accelerated ADP release underlies the increased speed of GcKIF5A. Despite exhibiting a reduced force generation, GcKIF5A maintains efficient cargo transport under load. Furthermore, GcKIF5A exerts less drag in mixed-motor environments, an adaptation particularly beneficial for multiple motor-driven long-distance axonal transport.

Using an ex-vivo optogenetic approach, we mapped the connectivity of COM and MDN afferents in intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) layer 5 projection neurons and tested for afferent-selective neuromodulation of synaptic transmission. Dual whole-cell recordings in pairs of IT and ET neurons found that COM afferents monosynaptically target both IT and ET neurons, but that MDN afferents selectively target IT neurons. Both afferents exhibited similar, and target-independent, short-term synaptic plasticity (facilitation), but were differentially modulated by ACh and 5-HT. COM transmission was suppressed strongly by ACh and moderately by 5-HT, while MDN inputs to IT neurons were largely unaffected by either neuromodulator. Cholinergic suppression of COM transmission was blocked by atropine or the M4-preferring antagonist VU602841, but enhanced by the M4 positive allosteric modulator VU0467154. Serotonergic suppression of COM transmission was mildly reduced in the presence of SB216691, a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Chemogenetic inhibition of hM4Di-expressing COM terminals mimicked the suppressive effects of ACh and 5-HT on synaptic transmission.

The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6-8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence with the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed in the IL. These results reveal that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Because gyral crowns are consistently thicker than sulcal fundi and cortical folds vary widely across individuals, these fluctuations introduce unmodeled nuisance variance that can obscure meaningful biological effects of interest. Previous global methods of folding compensation incompletely compensate for folding effects on cortical thickness and the spatial smoothing that is typically used to reduce these effects in the literature also markedly degrades spatial localization precision. To address these limitations, we developed a novel method for folding-compensated cortical thickness estimation that uses nonlinear local multiple regression with five folding measures to model and more completely remove folding-related variance from cortical thickness. This approach estimates what cortical thickness would have been in the absence of folding, yielding a more biologically interpretable measure of cortical architecture. We applied this new approach to data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA) and Aging Human Connectome Project (HCA), demonstrating substantial reductions in intra-areal and inter-individual variability, substantially increasing standardized effect sizes of age on cortical thickness while preserving the neurobiologically expected patterns, and avoiding the loss of spatial precision that occurs with the spatial smoothing that has traditionally been used in the literature. The method has been integrated into the HCP pipelines, facilitating its widespread use.

These factors have impacted the molecular evolution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To account for the role of genetic background and variable sites in shaping the migratory and evolutionary paths, we analyzed the ancient mtDNA as spatiotemporal co-mutation networks. Haplogroup-based analysis of the variable sites suggests a transition from hunter-gatherer to agrarian lifestyle during the Copper-Bronze transition period. Furthermore, the genetic interaction networks showed that COX and CYB genes behaved diversely with time and that there is an interplay of the genetic interactions with NADH Dehydrogenase genes specific to each age. We performed a phylogeny (tree) based gene network analysis and examined polymorphism to divergence ratios to complement the co-mutation networks. The tree-based gene networks exhibit similar topology with reduced co-mutation among the genes. The more traditional polymorphism/divergence analysis indicated that the CYB gene has been under long-term purifying selection.

Here, we integrated multi-omics datasets using the machine learning-based MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) pipeline to uncover novel GRNs and pathways involved in glioblastoma (GB) pathogenesis, one of the most aggressive brain cancers. GABA-signalling emerged as a previously unrecognized potential driver of GB tumour pathogenesis, with the discovery of GABA-related networks and relevant transcription factors (TFs) such as ARX, GSX2 and members of the DLX family, which play key roles in GABAergic interneuron development. Furthermore, in vitro co-culture assays showed that GABAergic input promotes GB cell proliferation, potentially through non-synaptic pathways such as metabolic or paracrine mechanisms. Our study provides insights into novel GRNs in GB pathogenesis, positioning GABA signalling as a potential therapeutic vulnerability in GB, and offering new promising therapeutic targets aimed at blocking neuron-glioma interactions.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Gamete release is often synchronised with respect to the daily light changes at sunrise and sunset. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, morning spawning occurs when oocyte maturation and gamete release are induced by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) neuropeptides released from opsin-expressing cells in the gonad directly upon light stimulus. Here, we characterise the distinct spawning cycle of a previously undescribed species Clytia sp. IZ-D identified on the Pacific coast of Japan, which releases gametes in the evening. Clytia sp. IZ-D jellyfish spawn 14 hours after light stimuli under a 24-hour light-dark cycle and exhibit autonomous and synchronised spawning cycles with a 20-hour interval under constant light. We found that the female spawning cycle reflects the growth and acquisition of maturation competence by oocytes, such that each day a new batch of growing oocytes becomes responsive to MIH at a time that correlates with the timing of actual spawning. We propose that the synchronised evening spawning in this species is controlled by an unusual circadian timing mechanism based on the progressive development of gamete competence to MIH and modulation of the opsin-controlled MIH signalling pathway. This mechanism may provide resilience to light cycle instability due to local climate variation and ensure reproductive isolation from other Clytia species by alternating the gamete release timing.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

We find that progenitors are characterised by broadly open chromatin, reflecting their broad potential to generate any ectodermal derivative. As development proceeds, cell-type-specific chromatin signatures are established. Inferring an enhancer-centric gene regulatory network, we predict Foxk2 as new regulator for placode specification and verify this prediction experimentally. Foxk2 target enhancers are open in placodal, but not any other ectodermal cells.

However, progress in predicting the structure of RNA, either alone or in complex with other macromolecules, has been less prominent, although some recent developments have been reported. It remains unclear whether the improved prediction accuracy is sustained for novel RNA structures. Results: Here, we use an independent benchmark to evaluate the performance of the latest methods. First, we show that state-of-the-art methods can sometimes predict the structure of single-chain RNA strands, with accurate models observed for RNAs with well-defined or regular secondary structures. Next, our evaluation was extended to RNA complexes, where prediction accuracy was notably higher for those involving extensive canonical base pairing. Additionally, a structural similarity analysis revealed that prediction success strongly correlates with resemblance to known structures, indicating that current methods recognise recurring motifs rather than generalising to novel folds. Finally, we also noted that the estimation of accuracies for RNA models is far from accurate. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably identify the correctly predicted models with today's methods.

Here, we have developed a new platform to combine the advantages of these two approaches. PyCycleBio utilises bounded-multi-component models and modulus operators alongside the harmonic oscillator equation, to model a diverse and interpretable array of rhythmic behaviours, including the regulation of temporal dynamics via amplitude coefficients.

This extraordinary size makes vWF a unique shear stress sensing molecule. Below a critical shear stress, vWF is in a globular conformation that prevents platelet binding. Above the critical shear stress, vWF is stretched into platelet accessible fibers. Although previous studies have suggested that leukocytes or cancer cells can bind to vWF fibers, acting forces and the likelihood of cell adhesion has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report that vWF is a size-selective protein that prefers to interact with objects smaller than 4 m in diameter. Consistently, tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) were able to interact with vWF in parallel to platelets. Although whole tumor cells under flow were unable to bind to vWF per se, binding of EVs and platelets along the vWF fiber promoted platelet aggregation, which in turn entrapped circulating tumor cells. In conclusion, our study highlights the shear-sensitive nature of vWF and its ability to bring EVs and platelets together to enhance coagulation. While EVs-vWF-platelet aggregates may serve as novel biomarkers, their therapeutic disruption may prevent hypercoagulation in disease.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Nephrotoxicity was assessed in KS cell-derived organoids treated with known nephrotoxic agents, including cisplatin and gentamicin. Additionally, we investigated the nephrotoxicity of puberulic acid, a compound associated with acute kidney injury linked to the Beni-koji CholesteHelp supplement recently reported in Japan, using both kidney organoids and wild-type mice. The organoid model successfully recapitulated morphological injury induced by known nephrotoxins and enabled quantitative assessment via Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1) mRNA expression. In organoids, puberulic acid induced apoptosis, demonstrated by increased cleaved caspase-3-positive cells, similar to cisplatin-treated samples. Transmission electron microscopy revealed structural alterations such as loss of intercellular tight junctions and vacuolization, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed significant Kim-1 upregulation following nephrotoxic exposure. In vivo, puberulic acid-treated mice exhibited impaired renal function and histological findings of ATN, closely resembling the organoid results.

Here, we functionally examine how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We find that HVC can generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC is permissive for song initiation but it is not required for transitions between syllables or completing song. We show that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably causes vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of song, reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences can be induced at any moment in song and depends on local circuits within HVC. We identify and computationally model a synaptic network including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal-motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behavior.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Typically, these temporally extended mental events unfold within coherent spatial contexts, rich in naturalistic scenes and objects. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding how these events are represented in the brain. This study aimed to investigate the neural patterns involved in the construction of temporally extended mental events. Using ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined brain regions previously implicated in this cognitive process, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and posterior neocortex. We employed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants engaged in three forms of mental imagery: single objects (e.g., \"a black espresso\"), single scenes (e.g., \"a busy cafe\"), and extended scenarios (e.g., \"meeting a friend for coffee\"). We identified a shared neural network - comprising the vmPFC, hippocampus, and posterior neocortex - engaged across all forms of mental imagery. However, we observed a hierarchical organization in their contributions: the posterior neocortex supported the construction of objects, scenes, and scenarios, while the hippocampus primarily contributed to scenes and scenarios. The vmPFC exhibited a stepwise increase in activation, peaking during scenario construction. These findings suggest that the construction of mental events emerges from the close interaction of perceptual details provided by the posterior neocortex, spatial coherence from the hippocampus, and the integration of those elements into a coherent, temporally extended mental event by the vmPFC - the \"movies\" of the mind.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

The coactivation patterns shared similarities between resting-state and auditory-task data, as indicated by the group-level similarity of 0.84 and individual-level similarity of 0.71 in the spatial topographies. Furthermore, the occurrence rates of AC patterns identified in the task data, using pattern templates derived from resting-state data, correlated with specific task contrast regressors. Our results indicate that the AC function can be characterized by a set of dynamically varying coactivation patterns that are consistently observed during resting state and auditory stimulation, and that get synchronized with auditory input. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity in the AC and support the development of more time-efficient paradigms for studying its functional organization.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

As such studies have generally been performed on adults, it is unclear if the results are applicable during brain development. Here we applied Bayesian reduced-rank regression (BRRR), to extract low-dimensional representations of electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra measured from normally developing children at different ages. The clinical EEG recordings represented different sleep stages in a pediatric population (N=782) of ages varying from 6 weeks to 19 years. The representations learned within specific sleep stages successfully separated between the subjects. Furthermore, a model trained with data across sleep stages generalized to unseen data, suggesting that informative neural fingerprints could be extracted. Fingerprint stability increased with the age of the subjects. In comparison to correlation-based measures in differentiating individuals from each other, the BRRR model performed better, highlighting the usefulness of the dimensionality reduction for data obtained in demanding clinical settings. While further studies are needed to address the possible non-linear maturation effects over developmental periods, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of stable within-session neurofunctional fingerprints in pediatric populations.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Abundant studies have identified a core network of brain regions including amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and, more recently, the cerebellum, as key players in learning and extinction. Yet, the precise interactions within this network and their relationship to individual learning abilities and extinction have remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how functional (FC), effective (EC), and structural (SC) connectivity patterns in the core learning network allow predicting individual differences in the efficacy of learning, extinction, and renewal. Analysing a large dataset of over 500 participants across a multitude of paradigms, our results revealed that FC predicted better acquisition, with a central role of ACC and hippocampus, whereas SC, involving ACC and amygdala, predicted higher levels of extinction learning. EC results suggested a predominantly inhibitory coupling among core learning network nodes, with paradigm-specific EC connectivity patterns predicting learning. Our predictions not only generalised between fear and cognitive predictive learning paradigms but were also successful in predicting learning from task-related FC and simulated data. Together, these results describe the multimodal neural determinants of learning, extinction, and renewal, and may inform individualised interventions for affective disorders based on neural connectivity patterns.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

We asked whether these discrepancies arise from how stimuli are presented. Thirty adults memorized seven digits presented in four modes: Simultaneous (all digits for 2800 ms) or sequential presentations at Fast (400 ms per digit), Slow (1000 ms per digit), and Fast+delay (400 ms per digit plus a 600 ms free time in between). We analyzed EEG during encoding and a 6 s retention period in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (18-24 Hz) frequency bands. Recall accuracy was highest in the Simultaneous mode and lowest in the Fast mode, yet these two conditions did not differ in any frequency band during encoding or retention. Encoding produced parametric load-related theta increase and beta decrease, possibly reflecting growing executive control demands and motor program formation, respectively. Alpha power did not scale with load during encoding. During retention, theta and beta during retention were unaffected by presentation mode. Alpha power did not differ significantly when all sequential modes were grouped together compared to the simultaneous mode. However, the Fast+delay mode uniquely showed below-baseline alpha in the first half of the retention. Our findings suggest that alpha dynamics are sensitive to the temporal structure of encoding and retention periods, particularly the presence or absence of free intervals between stimulus presentations. We propose that alpha modulation during WM retention may reflect processes beyond the simple gating of irrelevant sensory information.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

They first watched movies featuring two characters (AB), followed by scenes where one original character interacted with a new one (BC). Memory was assessed for direct (AB and BC), indirect (AC) associations, and source memory about whether two characters had appeared together. Source memory was more accurate when participants correctly inferred indirect associations. Time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) of EEG data revealed both neural pattern similarities and dissimilarities during AB and BC encoding. Pattern similarities, indicating memory integration across episodes, predicted successful indirect associations. Conversely, dissimilarities predicted accurate source memory, indicating the preservation of distinct memory traces.

We developed new FP immunogens using three alphavirus-like particles (VLPs) and introduced additional glycans to mask shared carrier-specific epitopes. In two independent guinea pig studies, sequential immunization with heterologous carriers enhanced FP-directed antibody titers, which were further improved with glycan engineering. Separately, using diverse FP variants sharing the same N-terminal six amino acids increased neutralizing antibody titers. When combined, these two strategies led to higher FP-directed titers and, after Env trimer boosting, induced FP-directed neutralizing antibodies against multi-clade wild-type HIV-1 in nearly all animals.

Extensive efforts have been made to recapitulate TRM development from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro to study molecular and cellular mechanisms of TRM development and to create cellular models of disease. However, available PSC models of mouse TRM development exhibit low overall efficiencies of TRM generation, generate heterogeneous off-target populations, and rely upon undefined media components, thus limiting their reproducibility, scalability, and widespread application as an experimental platform for TRM biology. To address these important limitations, we developed an efficient and reproducible protocol to faithfully recapitulate the stepwise differentiation of mouse PSCs (epiblast stem cells) into unspecialized, proliferative TRMs through the pro-definitive hematopoietic program under defined conditions. These immature TRMs can stably integrate into developing mouse neural organoids in vitro and acquire features of microglia. In addition, immature TRMs can stably engraft into the lung niche in vivo and adopt alveolar macrophage characteristics.

Using PerturbFate, we profiled over 300,000 cultured melanoma cells to characterize multi-modal phenotypic and gene regulatory responses to perturbations in more than 140 Vemurafenib resistance-associated genes. We uncovered a shared dedifferentiated cell state marked by convergent transcription factor (TF) activity signatures across diverse genetic perturbations. Combined inhibition of cooperative TF hubs effectively reversed cellular adaptation to Vemurafenib treatment. We further dissected phenotypic responses to perturbations in Mediator Complex components, linking module-specific biochemical properties to convergent gene activations.

The pathology of both barriers coincided with astrocyte activation localized to affected vessels in R6/2 mice, as well as post-mortem HD human brains.

Results: We present mimicDetector, an optimized bioinformatic pipeline for systematically identifying protein-level molecular mimicry between pathogens and their hosts. mimicDetector builds on existing k-mer-based approaches with three key improvements: (i) improved sensitivity for short-sequence alignments using the PAM30 substitution matrix and tuned BLASTP parameters; (ii) a revised k-mer filtering strategy based on bitscore differences rather than percent identity; (iii) the removal of overly conservative homologue exclusion steps.

Behavioral trait measures of inattention, hyperactivity, and working memory capacity were also obtained. Acute attention, measured by EEG during video viewing, was a strong predictor of test scores. In contrast, self-reported trait measures of attention were not significant predictors. Working memory capacity and GPA positively predicted test scores. Inattention traits predicted GPA, suggesting a negative effect on overall academic performance. These results suggest that attentional traits only weakly and indirectly affect student performance.

A total of 53 \"white fish\" sushi samples were collected from 50 restaurants. Molecular identification successfully assigned 41 samples to nine distinct fish species, while seven samples were identified at the genus level. In eight cases (20.5%), the species name provided by restaurant staff did not match the molecular identification, meaning that one in five restaurants supplied incorrect information. We found that lower sushi prices were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of misidentification (P=0.035, OR = 0.53, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.03]).

However, studies evaluating the efficacy of T cell immunotherapy in aged mice are limited and yield inconsistent results, while clinical data are largely retrospective. Methods: Here, we used a murine model of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to investigate how aging influences efficacy, from CAR T cell production to in vivo anti-tumor activity. Results: We found that aging reduced CAR T cell production yields and altered their phenotype and function. Aged CAR T cells were predominantly effector memory CD4 T cells, whereas young CAR T cells were primarily central memory CD8 T cells. Functionally, aged CAR T cells exhibited non-specific cytotoxicity, driven by constitutive degranulation and elevated granzyme B secretion independent of CAR expression. This phenotype was induced by the aged microenvironment, as young T cells transferred into aged hosts adopted similar behavior. In vivo, young CAR T cells efficiently reduced tumor burden in young leukemia-bearing hosts, but were not effective in aged hosts, where the aged microenvironment impaired CAR T cell persistence.

This divergence is linked to differential BCR isotype usage across barrier tissues rather than to affinity. In the gut, the commensal-induced TGF-{beta}-rich milieu promotes B cell class-switching to IgA. Consequently, the IgA BCR bias selection towards LLPCs, a process that is counteracted by its cytosolic tail domain.

Here we examine how temporal variability in glucodynamics, or time-varying glucose use, is related to cognition in 35 younger and 43 older adults. Stationary metabolic rates of glucose were not directly associated with cognition. Rather, higher glucodynamic variability, and its coherence into metabolic networks, was associated with better cognitive performance. Lower glucodynamic variability in ageing was associated with altered metabolic network efficiency and reduced cognitive performance. Our results demonstrate for the first time that variability in cerebral glucose metabolism is biologically and functionally relevant to cognition and the network architecture of the brain. Cognition is influenced by time-varying glucose metabolism and its coherent fluctuations in metabolic networks.

Here, we measured VOC emissions at both community and species levels (Plantago lanceolata) in experimental plant communities of varying diversity (The Jena Experiment) to understand the role of VOCs in driving biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. We show that plant diversity determines the release of plant VOCs at both levels. At the community level, plant species richness directly enhanced VOC emission and increased VOC richness both directly and indirectly by altering herbivore damage and LAI. At the species level, plant diversity did not directly affect the VOC emissions of P. lanceolata but indirectly affected it by influencing the VOC emissions from the surrounding community. Plantago lanceolata individuals in communities with high concentrations of green leaf volatiles decreased their VOC emission, while those in communities with high concentrations of terpenoids increased their VOC diversity. Our results provide first evidence that plant diversity shapes community-level plant VOC emission and thus influences focal plant VOC emission inside the community.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

One way that microbial invaders may facilitate this is to use cooperative public goods, such as metal-binding siderophores. However, siderophore production can be exploited by non-producing cheats who benefit from production without paying any associated costs. Here, we test the importance of cooperation for the success of Pseudomonas aeruginosa invading a 5-species microbial community. We do this by comparing the success of a siderophore-producing strain, a siderophore-deficient mutant strain and a 50:50 mixed population, both in environments with weak (copper absent) and strong (copper present) siderophore requirement. We found no effect of invader type on success when siderophores were less essential for growth, but large differences when they were selectively favoured. Here the producer-cheat mix had the greatest success, with both strains having near equal fitness and reaching high densities, whilst in isolation producers had intermediate success and cheats the lowest. Similarly, resident diversity only differed across invader treatments when copper was present. In conclusion, we show that the presence of cheats can provide a larger benefit for invasion success than pure cooperator populations, but only when public goods are particularly beneficial.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

However, the core mechanism of viral entry, CD4 binding and co-receptor engagement remains conserved. While therapies such as Lenacapavir represent important advances, the continued emergence of resistant strains will demand new and more adaptable treatment strategies. This challenge is not unique to HIV; future pandemics will likely present similar pressures, highlighting the need for drug design methods that are not only effective but also fast and scalable. Recent advances in protein structure prediction have transformed the landscape of therapeutic design, enabling the accurate modelling of target structures from sequence alone and now facilitating the development of novel therapeutics without prior structural data. EvoBind leverages these advances to rapidly generate cyclic peptide binders in a single design round, using only the amino acid sequence of a target protein. Cyclic peptides offer several advantages over traditional linear protein molecules, including increased stability, while their small size improves oral bioavailability and enables access to challenging binding sites. Here, we demonstrate the use of EvoBind to generate cyclic peptide binders against the HIV envelope protein gp41, which is essential for viral-host membrane fusion. Cell-based assays confirm potent inhibition of two different HIV-1 strains with no detectable toxicity. The combination of artificial intelligence-guided design and streamlined experimental validation can significantly accelerate therapeutic development, reduce costs, and provide timely solutions to the challenges posed by viral evolution and emerging global health threats.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Whilst these exhaled volatiles could well serve as biomarkers for human metabolic processes, thereby providing insights into the clinical and nutritional status of individuals, there exist various confounding factors that limit their easy application. A major confounding factor is the introduction of microbially produced oral volatiles into the exhaled breath, yet these volatiles are often ignored in discovery volatile research studies. Here, we provide a comparative cross-sectional study of selected volatiles commonly found in exhaled breath, namely 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethanol, acetoin, acetone, isoprene, methanol and 2-pentanone, measured in nasal and oral end-tidal exhaled breath samples for twenty-one volunteers, using the analytical technique of gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry. Significant differences in 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethanol and acetoin concentrations are found between breath samples exhaled via the mouth and those exhaled via the nose, serving to illustrate the extent to which the oral microbiome can influence volatile concentrations in breath. A central finding is that the nasally sampled volatiles are little influenced by the inhalation route (oral or nasal). The evidence is clear that in order to reduce the influence of the oral microbiome on untargeted discovery breath research studies, end-tidal exhaled nasal breath samples should be taken for endogenous volatile analysis, otherwise oral microbial volatiles could be falsely identified as biomarkers. This is particularly important given the rise in the use of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to identify variations in volatilomes. The development and commercialisation of simple, user-friendly and comfortable end-tidal exhaled nasal sample collection devices are required for nasal sampling to become widely adopted.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

The information rate through the RTK/ERK pathway in STE-1 cells was below 0.5 bit/hour but increased to 3 bit/hour after oncogene inhibition.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms and whether the observed effect was a driver of the observed decline, we developed an advanced spatial isotopic tracing pulse-chase method to study the dynamics of N-linked glycans. Our analysis revealed enhanced glycan biosynthesis in AD mouse models. Based on these findings, we performed genetic and dietary interventions to modulate glycan biosynthesis. Genetic knockdown of glycan biosynthetic enzymes ameliorated the hyper-glycosylation and improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes in AD mice. In contrast, oral glucosamine supplementation drove hyper-glycosylation and exacerbated cognitive and behavioral deficits. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a large population of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) stratified by glucosamine use, leveraging electronic health records. Consistently, glucosamine supplementation was associated with increased mortality in AD and ADRD patient cohorts, and significantly elevated progression from MCI to AD compared to age-matched controls.

On these active structures, nonreciprocally coupled extension and retraction activities of bacterial pili drives the collective oscillations. Surprisingly, this collective behavior exhibits broken left-right symmetry. We discover that this symmetry-breaking process is primarily driven by an aging-related frequency gradient across the biofilm.

The canonical EB model (CEB), grounded in equilibrium redox potentials, dictates the order of initial EB steps with initial reduction of high-potential iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe2S) by quinol followed by reduction of low-potential heme bL (bL) by semiquinone. However, this concept falls short in explaining several experimental observations, including intermediate semiquinone spin-coupled to 2Fe2S and the absence of short-circuiting. We applied quantum mechanical calculations on large cluster models of cytbc, encompassing both 2Fe2S and bL, to investigate the early stages of EB. Our results reveal that EB is an emergent property of an integrated system of redox cofactors, where transient charge separations dynamically modulate electron affinities. In this system, electron transfer initiates preferentially toward bL, indicating a departure from the conventional sequence proposed by CEB. Based on this finding we introduce an EMBER (EMergent BL-first Electron Routing) mechanism of EB and show by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy that predictions derived from this mechanism receive strong experimental validation. We argue that EMBER explains the observed stability of semiquinone coupled to 2Fe2S and suppression of energy wasting short-circuits without additional assumptions. It highlights the importance of dynamic electrostatic interactions in shaping electron transfer pathways in biological systems.

Although both G-quadruplexes and i-motifs have been implicated in transcriptional control, their relative contributions, particularly when formed on complementary strands of the same locus, are unclear. Here, we characterised the structure and stability of nine ILPR-based sequences using biophysical techniques and luciferase reporter assays. We demonstrate that transcriptional activation in response to high glucose occurs only when both G-quadruplex and i-motif structures can form. Other combinations of structures do not induce transcription. Moreover, promoter activity correlated positively with i-motif stability, but not with G-quadruplex stability.

Neural data revealed that, across all ages, infants exhibit enhanced auditory responses to music compared to shuffled music, indicating that auditory encoding of music emerges early in development. Movement data revealed a different outcome. While coarse auditory-motor coupling is present at all ages, more complex structured movement patterns emerge in response to music only by 12 months. Notably, no age group demonstrated evidence of coordinated movements to music. Additionally, enhanced auditory responses to high vs low pitch were only evident at 6 months, while infants movements were better predicted by high-pitched compared to low-pitched music at all ages.

The Omicron variant that emerged in late 2021 showed a major antigenic shift and rapidly spread worldwide. Since then, Omicron-derived variants have maintained their global dominance, for reasons that remain incompletely understood. We report that the original Omicron variant BA.1 evolved several traits that converged in facilitating viral spread. First, Omicron displayed an early replicative advantage over previous variants when grown in a reconstructed nasal epithelium model based on primary human cells. The increase in Omicron replication was more marked at the 33{degrees}C temperature characteristic of human nasal passages, resulting in a physiologically relevant advantage. Omicron also caused a decrease in epithelial integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, Omicron caused a more marked loss of motile cilia at 33{degrees}C than other variants, suggesting a capacity to impair mucociliary clearance. RNAseq analysis showed that Omicron induced a broad transcriptional downregulation of ciliary genes but only a limited upregulation of host innate defense genes at 33{degrees}C. The lower production of type I and type III interferons in epithelia infected by Omicron compared to those infected by the Delta variant, at 33{degrees}C as well as 37{degrees}C, confirmed the increased capacity of Omicron to evade the innate antiviral response. Thus, Omicron combined replication speed, motile cilia impairment, and limited induction of innate antiviral responses when propagated in reconstructed nasal epithelia at physiological temperature. Omicron has the capacity to propagate efficiently but stealthily in the upper respiratory tract, which likely contributed to the evolutionary success of this SARS-CoV-2 variant.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the role of NOPR in depressive phenotypes alongside potentially prohedonic effects of NOPR antagonism across species. In Study 1, we evaluated whether exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) upregulated ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatal prepronociceptin (Pnoc) gene expression in adult mice. In Study 2, we tested whether chronic social defeat altered Pnoc gene expression in reward-related regions. To establish whether direct NOPR modulation is implicated in reward-related behaviors, in Study 3, we assessed whether NOPR antagonism alters reward learning in rats. Finally, in Study 4, we tested whether NOPR antagonism boosts motivation among depressed humans. ELA induced anhedonic behavior and increased Pnoc expression in the VTA; in females (but not males), ELA increased Pnoc expression in the dorsal striatum (Study 1). Furthermore, chronic stress reduced Pnoc-expressing cells in the VTA, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex and susceptible rats showed reduced VTA NOPR gene (Oprl1)-expressing cells (Study 2). In a behavioral assay, a single 30-mg dose of a NOPR antagonist (BTRX-246040) boosted reward learning in rats (Study 3). Finally, in depressed humans, relative to placebo, 8-week treatment with BTRX-246040 increased incentive motivation (Study 4). Collectively, our findings indicate that chronic stressors alter Pnoc and mRNA levels of Pnoc-expressing cells in a sex-selective and region-specific manner impacting reward structures, and that NOPR antagonism shows anti-anhedonic properties.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

R.; Bober, J.; Li, Y.; Pelts, M.; Santana, G. M.; Dietrich, M. O.", "abstract": "Social isolation enhances sociability, suggesting that social behavior is maintained through a homeostatic mechanism. Further, mammalian social needs shift dramatically from infancy through adolescence into adulthood, raising the question of whether the neural mechanisms governing this homeostatic regulation evolve across developmental stages. Here, we show that agouti-related peptide (Agrp) neurons, which regulate hunger in adults, are activated by social isolation from weaning through adolescence but not in adulthood. Importantly, the activity of these neurons is critical for social behavior during adolescence: inhibiting Agrp neurons reduced isolation-induced sociability in juveniles but not in adults, and Agrp neuron activation promoted sociability only in young mice. After isolation, reunion with siblings or other conspecifics, but not unfamiliar adult males, rapidly decreased neuronal activity in juveniles, an effect requiring intact olfaction. These findings identify Agrp neurons as a key component of the circuitry governing age-specific social homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "When we hear continuous speech, we perceive it as a series of discrete words, despite the lack of clear boundaries in the acoustic signal. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) encodes phonetic elements like consonants and vowels, but how it extracts whole words as perceptual units remains unclear. Using high-density cortical recordings, we investigated how the brain represents auditory word forms - integrating acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical features - while participants listened to spoken narratives. Our results show that STG neural populations exhibit a distinctive reset in activity at word boundaries, marked by a brief, sharp drop in cortical activity. Between these resets, the STG consistently encodes distinct acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical information, supporting the integration of phonological features into coherent word forms. Notably, this process tracks the relative elapsed time within each word, independent of its absolute duration, providing a flexible temporal scaffolding for encoding variable word lengths. We observed similar word form dynamics in the deeper layers of a self-supervised artificial speech network, suggesting a potential convergence with computational models. Additionally, in a bistable word perception task, STG responses were aligned with participants' perceived word boundaries on a trial-by-trial basis, further emphasizing the role of dynamic encoding in word recognition. Together, these findings support a new dynamical model of auditory word forms, highlighting their importance as perceptual units for accessing linguistic meaning.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

While population-level neural dynamics and single-neuron activity in motor learning have been widely studied, the contributions of individual neuron types remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a brain-machine interface (BMI) task with perturbations of varying difficulty to investigate single-neuron dynamics underlying neurofeedback adaptation in two rhesus macaques. Cortical neurons were classified based on waveform shape into narrow waveform (NW) and broad waveform (BW) categories, representing putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively. Compared to BW neurons, NW neurons were more active and more strongly involved in the learning process. Moreover, task difficulty modulated neural responsiveness and coordination within both neuron groups, highlighting differential neuron engagement during motor learning. Our findings provide novel insights into single-neuron mechanisms underlying neurofeedback adaptation and emphasize the distinct functional roles of neuronal phenotypes in rapid learning processes.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

M.; Shultz, S.", "abstract": "It has previously been thought that the social brain hypothesis applies in its full quantitative form only to primates. Using more appropriate brain indices and less error-prone statistical methods, we here show that it does in fact apply to both Insectivorans and Carnivorans, as well as to elephants and orcas. While Insectivorans form a grade on their own, reflecting a simple transition from small-brained solitary social systems to slightly larger-brained pairbonded monogamy, the Carnivorans map directly onto the primate socio-cognitive grades, dividing between loose sociality and more bonded sociality paralleling the pattern observed in monkeys. In addition, the subgroupings of species with multilevel social systems (including hyaenids elephants and orcas) map across the grades in the same way as do primates with similar societies. This suggests that common principles and trajectories underlie social evolution in mammals.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "In the hippocampus, there is a region and synapse-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist preference for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses, enriched in GluN2A-containing NMDARs, favor D-serine, while medial perforant path (MPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses that are rich in GluN2B-containing NMDARs prefer glycine for LTP induction. This study investigated the role of astrocytes in providing these co-agonists. We confirmed in rat hippocampal slices that exogenous D-serine (10 M) is sufficient to restore LTP at SC-CA1 synapses blocked under astrocyte calcium (Ca2+) -clamp conditions, consistent with previous findings. However, exogenous glycine (10 M) also rescued the LTP. In contrast, at MPP-DG synapses, 100 M exogenous glycine, but not 10 M nor 100 M D-serine, restored the LTP blocked by astrocyte Ca2+-clamping. Our findings support the view that, as for serine in CA1, astrocytes are the cellular source of the glycine required for LTP induction at MPP-DG synapses.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Parthasarathy, A.; Hancock, K. E.; Polley, D. B.", "abstract": "Among all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences that vary across three orders of magnitude, from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. Here, we developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds. Target sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25-80 Hz), envelope changes (~5 Hz), and slower changes in embedded context reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable levels of distraction: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously and independently measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task. Sustained shifts from random to regular arrangements of temporal sequences were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions (<10Hz) of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of a more distracting sound while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope modulation rate were unaffected by varying levels of distraction. Categorizing trials according to task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials. By designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the remarkable temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes in the 7-10 Hz alpha range that has been linked to distractor suppression, which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

These regions or patches, which are classically found in the occipito-temporal cortex, encode visual properties of faces. Using naturalistic movie-watching fMRI data from 176 human subjects and multivariate functional connectivity analysis, here we comprehensively characterize a novel network of four frontal face patches (FFPs) arranged dorsoventrally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. FFPs are strongly coupled with a face-selective region in the middle superior temporal sulcus, appear to be primarily involved in processing high-level social aspects of faces during movie-watching, and show partial correlations of activity with distinct cognitive networks. Activations in FFPs are correlated with the performance of subjects in a social cognition task. We further identify two groups of subjects who showed a remarkable difference in the topographical organization of FFPs. The discovery of FFPs provides new insights into the understanding of social processing in the brain.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Herman, P. A.", "abstract": "Task-switching paradigms, often used to study cognitive flexibility, frequently employ incongruent bivalent stimuli, triggering two tasks and potentially conflating cognitive flexibility with interference control. This study assesses cognitive flexibility using univalent stimuli (triggering one task) and congruent bivalent stimuli (same response across tasks) in a modified Stroop task to investigate well-established neural activity correlates of cognitive flexibility, manifested in human (females and males) electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, while isolating switch process from the influence of interference control at the response level. In particular, we analyzed EEG theta-band activity and event-related potential (ERP) components in switch (N2, P3a, P3b, late sustained potential (LSP)) and interference (N400, LSP and mid-frontal theta activity) conditions. We compared each of the switch and the interference condition to the control condition using cluster-based permutation test. In the switch condition, we observed fronto-central N2, reduced frontal P3a, and a positive occipital LSP. The interference condition showed increased frontal theta, parietal N400, and a positive occipital LSP. We also compared switch and interference conditions using cluster-based permutation test. We observed a larger N2 in the frontocentral regions during the switch condition and higher frontal theta activity during the interference condition, which aligns with their comparisons to the control condition. This result suggests that distinct neural mechanisms are used for each of the processes involved in conflict monitoring. Specifically, the theta activity may reflect sustained monitoring and conflict resolution during interference, while the N2 may reflect more transient conflict detection and the need to switch task sets.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": ""}
