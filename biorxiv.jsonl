S.; Lundblad, V.", "abstract": "In most eukaryotes, the enzyme telomerase maintains the termini of linear chromosomes through the addition of repetitive telomeric sequences. It is widely assumed that the primary site of action for telomerase is the single-stranded G-rich overhang at the ends of linear chromosomes. We show here that a second substrate, created by spontaneous replication fork collapse during duplex telomeric DNA replication in wild type budding yeast, is elongated by telomerase at a much higher frequency (~50%) than fully replicated chromosome termini. Furthermore, as much as ~200 nucleotides can be added in a single cell division to these newly collapsed forks, indicating that spontaneous replication fork collapse and the subsequent response by telomerase is a major determinant of telomere length homeostasis. This challenges a long-standing model for telomere length regulation which posits a length-sensing mechanism that assesses individual telomeres to determine whether chromosome ends are in telomerase-extendible or telomerase-non-extendible states. We propose that these two states are instead structurally and temporally distinct substrates for telomerase, generated by two different processes (fork collapse vs. completion of DNA replication). We also show that replication fork collapse at telomeres is kept in check by a telomere-dedicated Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1 complex in collaboration with the canonical RPA complex, indicating that these two complexes bind single-stranded DNA exposed at the replication fork to facilitate replisome progression through duplex telomeric DNA. Although failures during DNA replication are often genotoxic events, this represents an opposing example in which fork collapse has been co-opted to promote genome stability.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Here we found that lack of the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (cry) leads to increased sleep under short winter-like days in fruit flies, reminiscent of the hypersomnolence in SAD. CRY functions in neurons that synthesize the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, including the small ventral lateral neurons which are known to be circadian pacemakers, and down-regulates the GABAergic tone. This in turn leads to increased neural activity of the wake-promoting large ventral lateral neurons, a subset of circadian neurons that are inhibited by GABA-A receptor. CRY protein is known to be degraded by light, thus rendering CRY to be functional within this GABAergic circuitry to enhance wakefulness only under short day length. Taken together, we demonstrate a mechanism that specifically regulates wakefulness under short winter-like days, which may provide insights regarding the winter sleepiness in SAD.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Our approach involved designing, building, and testing 96 metagenomically diverse consortia, learning a generative model using community strain presence/absence as input, and distilling model constraints through statistical inference. SynCom15 cleared Kp-MH258 across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo environments, matching the efficacy of a fecal microbiome transplant in a clinically relevant murine model of infection.

Using the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model, we demonstrate that daily oral NaB supplementation significantly protects against pathological angiogenesis, impacting not only vascular but also neuronal and microglial pathologies in the inner retina.

Site-specific recombinases provide a route to genetic memory via targeted DNA modifications, but their high specificity and efficiency are offset by leaky expression and limited tunability in prokaryotes. We developed a tightly regulated, titratable Cre recombinase system for Escherichia coli that achieves low recombination rates and minimal basal activity. Implemented on both plasmids and the chromosome, the latter showed superior retention of genetic memory across generations. These features make the system broadly useful for environmental biosensing and other applications. To demonstrate applicability to environmental biosensing, we developed a whole-cell recombination-based biosensor for arsenite, a toxic and ubiquitous pollutant that is primarily mobilized in anoxic environments such as flooded soils, sediments, and aquifers. However, existing arsenite whole-cell biosensors face limitations in sensitivity and workflow in anaerobic settings. Our biosensor reliably recorded anoxic arsenite exposure as a stable genetic memory for delayed fluorescence readout in aerobic conditions, with detection sensitivity comparable to conventional wet chemical methods. By decoupling exposure from measurement, this approach offers a foundation for arsenite biosensing under field-relevant conditions, including redox variability and other physicochemical gradients, without the constraints of anoxic measurement. More broadly, the ability to induce low-rate, heritable genetic changes expands the genetic toolkit for environmentally responsive systems, with applications in environmental monitoring, bioproduction, bioengineering, as well as experimental studies of microbial ecology, evolution, and host-microbe interactions.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Glucose transporter (GLUT) transcripts as well as proteins are upregulated in human lungs and other cancers and are negatively correlated with patient survival, particularly GLUT1 and GLUT3. Thus, inhibiting GLUT function has been an attractive anticancer strategy. We previously characterized WZB117 and DRB18, first- and second-generation pan-class I GLUT inhibitors, respectively. DRB18 strongly inhibits glucose transport mediated by GLUT1-4 in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report DRB18 as a more stable and potent anticancer compound, compared to WZB117. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissue array to investigate GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein expression between normal, lower and higher stage LUAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to examine additive effect of GLUT3 to GLUT1 mediated prognosis in LUAD. Glucose uptake and resazurin dye-based proliferation assays were used to determine glucose uptake inhibitory and cell proliferation inhibitory against panel of human cancer cell lines A549, Panc1 and Hela. DRB18 potency was tested against the presence of extracellular nutrients glucose, glutamine and ATP. Synergism between DRB18 and clinically approved anticancer drugs was tested against cancer cells. DRB18 and advanced NSCLC drug Paclitaxel were tested for synergy in vitro and in vivo. GLUT1/3 combination exhibited higher hazard ratio than either GLUT1 and GLUT3 alone in many cancer types including LUAD. DRB18 reduced glucose uptake in NSCLC A549, pancreatic Panc1, and cervical Hela cancer cells with varied but strong anticancer potencies in the presence or absence of extracellular nutrients such as ATP and glucose. Combined with different clinical and pre-clinical anticancer compounds such as V9302, CB839, Sutent, Brigatinib, DRB18 significantly increased death of A549 and Panc1 cells. Noteworthy, DRB18 exhibited strong anticancer synergy with paclitaxel, an approved chemo drug for NSCLC, drastically reducing cancer cell proliferation in vitro and growth of A549 tumors grafted on the flank of nude mice without significant side effects, compared to single drug treatments. Mechanistically, DRB18 treatment with paclitaxel elevated the expression of Caspases 3 and 9, suggesting GLUT-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing anticancer mechanisms of DRB18 with paclitaxel.

Despite the importance of these transitions, existing analytical frameworks struggle to reconcile the high-dimensional nature of these reconfigurations with the need for structured trajectories and mechanistic interpretability. Specifically, identifying the precise network components responsible for driving these dynamics remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce RONI (Riemannian filtering Of Network Interactions), a geometry-aware, unsupervised framework that treats time-varying FC as a signal evolving on the manifold of symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrices. By defining intrinsic filtering operators along the SPSD geodesics, RONI enables a principled multiresolution decomposition of FC dynamics directly on the manifold. This representation allows for the isolation of \"dynamic drivers\" - specific network elements that dominate coherent connectivity modes across distinct temporal scales. We demonstrate the versatility of RONI by applying it to a diverse array of large-scale neural recordings, including hippocampal electrophysiology data, cortex-wide and dendritic calcium imaging, and human EEG. Across these varied modalities and spatio-temporal scales, RONI identifies biologically meaningful sub-networks that shape the geometry of the connectivity trajectory, providing a unified, interpretable, and quantitative framework for studying the evolution of distributed neural interactions.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We use genetic code expansion to incorporate photo-caged amino acids into FLP, replacing critical residues in the active site with their photocaged counterparts. Photocaged FLP displays no detectable background activity, and brief illumination, can be used to activate FLP with near 100% efficiency.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that photocaged FLP can be used to switch on expression of target genes in individual cells within the animal using a standard 405 nm microscope mounted laser to deliver the activating light.

In actively sensing species such as echolocating bats, these constraints raise a fundamental ecological question: what limits the stability and density of cohesive groups under increasing interaction load? 2 I develop a constraint-based framework in which neighbour-based interaction is treated as a closed-loop process that is only feasible when sensory updates can be acquired, processed, and acted upon within a finite temporal budget. Building on an asynchronous swarm simulation grounded in echo-timed biosonar control, I formalise two receiver-side feasibility constraints that become critical in dense groups: (i) temporal overlap between conspecific calls and the echo-processing window, and (ii) level dominance of the tracked neighbour's echo over competing conspecific signals. 3 Both constraints emerge as probabilistic feasibility boundaries rather than binary conditions for perceptual success or failure. Across a broad parameter space of responsivity, group density, and flight speed, the fraction of call events supporting reliable neighbour-based updates declines smoothly with compounded interaction load. Temporal overlap is organised by a single compound term integrating local density, neighbourhood call rate, call duration, and echo delay, while level dominance operates in a marginal regime where masking is frequent but intermittent. 4 Simulation results show that stable, collision-averse swarm cohesion can persist across wide ranges of density and motion without explicit coordination or interference avoidance, provided that sufficiently frequent informative updates remain available. Breakdown occurs not because echoes become undetectable, but because the probability of obtaining timely, behaviourally relevant updates falls below what is required to sustain closed-loop control. 5 Together, these findings identify temporal feasibility and interaction dominance as general constraints shaping cohesion, spacing, and fragmentation in actively sensing animal groups. Rather than invoking acoustic jamming as a failure mode, the framework reframes interference as a background condition that regulates the statistics of actionable information. This closed-loop perspective provides a unifying ecological principle for collective behaviour in active sensing systems and generates testable predictions for when cohesion should persist or fail under increasing sensory and interactional demand.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

However, currently available molecular clock methods, which often rely on simple homogeneous substitution models, can produce inaccurate time estimates, particularly for deep-time or rapidly evolving lineages where substitution heterogeneity and saturation are common. Hereby, we introduce phyloHessian (https://github.com/evolbeginner/phyloHessianWrapper), a Julia-based software to enable the use of complex mixture substitution models in molecular dating. phyloHessian employs different algorithms to improve the numerical accuracy in calculating the phylogenetic Hessian matrix, which is further integrated into PAML-MCMCtree's approximate likelihood framework to conduct dating analyses. Simulations mimicking phylogenies at different timescales demonstrate that complex mixture substitution models significantly enhance the accuracy of divergence time and substitution rate estimates in deep-time phylogenies. This pattern remains consistent across a wide range of uncertainties associated with molecular clock analysis. Additionally, mixture models display greater robustness to model and calibration specifications compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Empirical analysis of Microsporidia and Rickettsiales with different substitution models shows that mixture models, compared to homogeneous models, yield accelerated substitution rates and in some cases significantly different divergence times, leading to a revised understanding of their host association origins. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating complex mixture substitution models for constructing reliable evolutionary timelines and elucidating the evolutionary history of deep-time or fast-evolving lineages.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

This study investigated pretreatment, pertraction, and chain elongation strategies to convert bakery waste into n-caproate and n-caprylate. Bakery waste was mechanically and enzymatically processed, and different inocula were tested to optimize the conversion of the resulting glucose-rich solution into lactate and ethanol (intermediates). These intermediates were fed into continuous chain elongation systems, which operated for over 386 days at 37{degrees}C and pH 5.5. Results showed that 30-35% of bakery waste carbon was converted into n-caproate and 10-15% into n-caprylate. Enzymatic starch hydrolysis proved essential, and lactate was a superior intermediate for chain elongation compared to ethanol. A maximum volumetric MCC production rate of 131{square}mM{square}C{square}L-1{square}d-1 (0.1 g L-1 h-1) was achieved.

B.; Sun, M.; Wu, X.; Wang, J.; Wan, S.", "abstract": "As the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, pancreatic cancer (PaC) is a highly heterogenous malignancy that can be divided into a multitude of potential subtypes, with the main 4 consisting of aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX), immunogenic, progenitor, and squamous. Each PaC subtype is characterized by their unique molecular pathways and therapeutic characteristics. Identifying PaC molecular subtypes is essential for downstream patient risk stratification and tailored treatment design. Conventional wet-lab approaches for PaC subtyping like microdissection, histopathological studies or molecular profiling are often laborious, costly and time-consuming. To address these concerns, we present MetaPaCS, a novel meta-learning framework to accurately identify PaC subtypes based on transcriptomics data only. Specifically, after preprocessing, the transcriptome-based feature vectors were classified by 10 base machine learning (ML) classifiers, whose prediction outputs were then combined with the initial preprocessed feature vectors to constitute a new set of ensemble feature vectors for a meta-learning model. Our meta-learning model could learn and leverage the diversity of different base classifiers to boost the prediction performance beyond any single ML model. Results based on 100 times ten-fold cross validation tests on benchmarking datasets demonstrated that MetaPaCS performed significantly better than existing state-of-the-art methods for PaC subtyping. In addition, our meta-learning model remarkably outperformed each individual base classifier, demonstrating that MetaPaCS could combine diverse results from multiple base classifiers to boost the ensemble performance. We believe that MetaPaCS is a promising tool for characterizing PaC subtypes and will have positive impacts on downstream risk stratification and personalized treatment design for PaC patients.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the capillary regression that occurs along with inflammation in murine kidneys following irreversible unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgical challenge. Mice lacking genes encoding global TNF, the endothelial IL-1 receptor IL-1R1, or both (double knockout, DKO) were examined at 10 days after UUO surgery. While loss of the individual genes did not affect peritubular capillary (PTC) regression, PTC regression was significantly reduced in DKO mice.

DKO kidneys also displayed less fibrosis by Picrosirius Red and Masson trichrome staining.

Plastid Movement Impaired 1 (PMI1) is one of the proteins involved in this process that undergoes rapid, blue light-dependent relocalization within the plasma membrane.

We identify the NT-C2 domain as the principal membrane-binding module and show that it extends beyond the boundaries previously assigned to the C2 domain. Plasma membrane localization is mediated by interactions between the extended NT-C2 domain and the phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], with basic residues within this region being essential for PMI1 membrane binding. We further demonstrate that the NT-C2 domain binds Ca2+ in vitro and that calcium availability modulates its phosphoinositide-binding preference. Consistently, depletion of cytosolic Ca2+ or inhibition of Ca2+ fluxes abolished the blue light-induced redistribution of PMI1 within the plasma membrane. Finally, we show that the extended NT-C2 domain, together with its flanking intrinsically disordered regions, is indispensable for PMI1 function in chloroplast movement regulation.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

The COPII complex is responsible for delivering cargo proteins from the ER to the Golgi, which is facilitated by the complex's member proteins Sec24 and Sar1. Additionally, the N-termini of glycosyltransferases (GTs) play a crucial role in their transportation and localization. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that XXTs interact with Sar1 protein in the COPII complex but not with Sec24, which was previously reported to be the main recruiter of cargo proteins into COPII-coated vesicles. The mutation of the arginine to glutamine residues of di-arginine motifs in the N-termini of XXT2 and XXT5 caused protein mislocalization and significantly reduced the strength of the interaction with Sar1. These mutations caused 90% of XXTs to either remain in the ER or localize to non-Golgi small compartments. In turn, such mislocalization significantly suppressed the recovery of xyloglucan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) mutant plants (xxt1xxt2 and xxt3xxt4xxt5), failing to restore their root phenotypes to normal. Our results demonstrate the interaction between cargo proteins and Sar1 proteins, highlighting the critical role of di-arginine motifs in this interaction.

Here, we established the first human iPSC-derived neuronal model of MTRFR loss and identified mechanisms driving differential vulnerability between cortical and motor neurons. Although knockdown led to comparable deficits in mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS across both subtypes, cortical neurons engaged adaptive programs, including dendritic mitochondrial remodeling and heat-shock response activation, that preserved survival. Motor neurons failed to mount these responses and instead displayed apoptotic and inflammatory priming. Pharmacological enhancement of stress adaptation rescued motor neuron survival, indicating that resilience is programmable.

We study this issue at the first synapses in the central auditory pathway formed by auditory nerve afferents onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus, called endbulbs of Held. Non-traumatic noise exposure alters endbulb properties, decreasing the probability of vesicle release and enlarging the pool of releasable vesicles as assessed using electrophysiological methods and immunolabelling. These changes appear homeostatic, to maintain synaptic efficacy during periods of high activity. To identify structural changes underlying the larger vesicle pool, we used serial blockface electron microscopy of endbulbs from control and noise-exposed mice to quantitatively assess synaptic morphology. We observed no differences in the juxtapositional area between endbulbs and bushy cells, nor in the number or density of active zones and postsynaptic densities. Images of endbulb terminals were significantly darker after noise exposure, indicating an increase in the density of synaptic vesicles.

Here we tested a method of hIL-6 delivery based on injection of retrograde AAV to the cervical spinal cord of adult mice. This was envisioned as a first step toward a regenerative treatment after spinal cord injury based on widespread stimulation of descending projection neurons. We found, however, that animals treated with AAV2-retro-hIL-6 developed severe tremors and weight loss within days of injection and reached criteria for humane euthanasia within five to eleven days, depending on viral dose. Examination of the cortex showed a pronounced increase in Stat3 phosphorylation in corticospinal tract (CST) neurons in hIL-6 animals versus control, confirming effective retrograde signaling.

C.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can fragment or fuse to support different bioenergetic demands (e.g., glycolysis vs. oxidative phosphorylation) and distinct cell behaviors (e.g., mitosis or migration). While the role of mitochondrial dynamics in wound healing and metabolic disorders has received significant attention, the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion during normal embryonic development is less well understood -- in part due to the difficulty of studying such processes in vivo. Combined with the depth-resolved imaging capabilities of multiphoton microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of the mitochondrial cofactor NADH can be used to simultaneously visualize mitochondrial network morphology and infer certain aspects of cellular bioenergetics (e.g., glycolysis vs. oxidative phosphorylation) in a label-free, non-invasive manner. Here we demonstrate that NADH FLIM can be used to accurately track the subcellular localization and topology of mitochondrial networks in live Drosophila embryos. We used this technique to assess whether cells show changes in NADH lifetime during convergent extension (CE) -- a conserved process of tissue remodeling in which thousands of germband cells undergo coordinated intercalation to drive elongation of the head-to-tail axis. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe significant changes in NADH lifetime or network appearance during CE in wild-type embryos, suggesting that germband cells do not need to alter their baseline metabolism to fuel cell intercalation during normal development. To directly assess the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion during CE, we used RNA interference to disrupt the fission mediator Drp1 and the fusion mediator Opa1. Consistent with expectations, inhibiting mitochondrial fission in Drp1-knockdown embryos led to hyper-fused networks and significantly longer NADH lifetimes, indicating a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation. Conversely, inhibiting mitochondrial fusion in Opa1-knockdown embryos led to more hyper-fragmented networks and significantly shorter NADH lifetimes, indicating a shift towards glycolysis. Interestingly, inhibiting either fission or fusion altered tissue elongation and greatly increased the rate of cell intercalation errors, suggesting that a precise network topology is required for proper CE. We hypothesize that the CE defects in Drp1-knockdown embryos are primarily due to incorrect basal subcellular localization of mitochondria, whereas the CE defects in Opa1-knockdown embryos are due to deficient ATP and/or ROS production. These experiments demonstrate the utility of FLIM-based applications for characterizing the role of mitochondria during normal embryonic development, which could yield a better understanding of the metabolic underpinnings of various pathologies that involve epithelial remodeling, including spina bifida, defective wound healing, and cancer metastasis.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

While acute cohesin depletion completely disrupts genome folding, it yields modest transcriptional impacts, but these findings are often confounded by cohesin's essential roles in cell division and proliferation. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by decoupling architectural functions from cell-cycle roles using an acute NIPBL degron system. By integrating single-gene imaging with single-cell and bulk multi-omics during mouse pluripotency transitions and germ-layer specification, we show that NIPBL-mediated cohesin function is required for proper de novo activation of lineage-specifying genes. Mechanistically, NIPBL translates epigenetic priming into transcriptional outputs by physically bringing distal enhancers and target promoters into proximity. We further uncover a dual regulatory role: an acute requirement for establishing new enhancer-promoter interactions during cell state transitions and a long-term role in safeguarding transcriptional fidelity by preventing ectopic gene de-repression.

In addition to pesticides, using spent mushroom substrate (SMS) has a protective effect against Fusarium infection in cucumber, partly through effects on the microbiome. Fusaric acid (FA), a phytotoxic virulence factor secreted by Fusarium, disrupts both plant physiology and the rhizosphere microbial community. Herein, we investigated the relationship between SMS and this virulence factor. Bioassays demonstrated that SMS adsorbed FA both in culture supernatants and in soil. Adsorption behaviour conformed to the Langmuir Freundlich isotherm model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 52.72 g/g. Kinetics followed a pseudo second order model, indicating physical and chemical adsorption. Scanning electron microscopy showed that SMS had a porous surface, facilitating FA capture. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and chemical blocking assays were used to identify secondary amide groups as the key binding sites. In a dual-compartment pot system designed to isolate adsorption from other direct effects, SMS treatment significantly reduced the FA concentration in the cucumber rhizosphere and mitigated FA-induced disease aggravation. This lowered the disease index by up to 25%. Bacterial 16S metabarcoding showed that FA disrupted the rhizosphere bacterial diversity and community structure. However, when FA was adsorbed by SMS, the microbial diversity and community stability were restored. FA reduced the abundance of sensitive taxa such as Bacillus. Meanwhile, SMS-adsorbed FA preserved its relative abundance, suggesting a selective protective effect for FA sensitive rhizobacteria. These findings indicate that SMS protects cucumber against Fusarium by alleviating FA toxicity toward beneficial microbes.

J.; Siddiqui, K. S.", "abstract": "A key step in the evolution of lignin-degrading enzymes is revealed by the observation that, unlike other heme-proteins studied to date, Class II peroxidases exhibit minimal energy transfer from tryptophan (Trp) to heme residues. Bioinformatics analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Class II (MnP and VP) and Class III (horseradish peroxidase, HrP) structures indicate that the Trp residue in HrP has the highest orientational factor and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. By contrast, Trp residues in MnP and VP display low FRET efficiency due to unfavorable orientation factors despite their proximity to the heme. Steady-state fluorescence experiments confirmed this low FRET efficiency, showing strong emission in MnP and VP but weak emission in HrP. This decreased Trp-to-heme energy transfer appears to minimize competition between direct FRET and long-range electron transfer (LRET), allowing electrons to flow from bulky lignin substrates to the heme center. Such a mechanism likely provided a selective advantage during the evolution of Class II peroxidases, facilitating efficient lignin degradation at the enzyme surface.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

This study examined how long-term expansion of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a hollow fiber bioreactor (HFB) influences cellular senescence and the molecular composition of secreted small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). During extended HFB culture, BMSCs exhibited progressive morphological flattening and cytoskeletal disorganization, accompanied by increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and immunophenotypic remodeling characterized by reduced fluorescence intensity and spatial redistribution of canonical MSC markers, consistent with a stress-adapted, early senescence-associated cellular state. In parallel, sEVs were collected longitudinally over 40 days and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting, and quantitative proteomics. While vesicle size, marker expression, and yield remained stable throughout culture, proteomic profiling revealed pronounced, phase-dependent remodeling of sEV cargo, including coordinated alterations in oxidative stress-related processes, lysosomal and extracellular matrix-associated pathways, and relative depletion of cytoskeletal and translational components. Notably, these vesicular signatures closely mirrored senescence-associated changes observed at the cellular level. The strong correspondence between cellular phenotypes and sEV proteomic profiles establishes vesicle analysis as a convergent and noninvasive readout of BMSC aging, enabling sensitive monitoring of senescence progression while reducing reliance on parallel, labor-intensive cellular assays. Collectively, these findings indicate that prolonged HFB culture promotes a controlled, stress-associated senescence program in BMSCs and position sEV proteomic profiling as a robust approach for assessing stem cell aging dynamics during long-term three-dimensional bioreactor culture", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We introduce Alvessa, an evidence-grounded agentic research assistant designed around verifiability.

Alvessa substantially improves accuracy relative to general-purpose language models and performs comparably to coding-centric agents while producing fully traceable outputs. Using adversarial perturbations, we show that detection of fabricated statements depends critically on access to retrieved evidence.

They exhibit three cellular states resembling astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neural progenitor (NPC) cells. Understanding their biology has been challenging due to the lack of relevant in vitro models. Here we established and extensively characterized four astrocytoma cell lines (LGG275, LGG336, LGG85, LGG349) derived from IDH-mutant astrocytoma at different grades, cultured in defined media and analyzed by multi-omics. These lines display growth rates in vitro and in vivo consistent with tumor grade and recapitulate key molecular alterations observed in patient tumors, including IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 mutations, activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway and, in the most aggressive line, amplification of MET and PDGFRA. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the 4 astrocytoma lines maintain the three major cellular states observed in patient tumors. A hallmark of higher-grade-derived lines (LGG85, LGG349) is the persistence of NPC-like populations without growth factors, reflecting tumor progression. The LGG275 line most accurately mirrors slow-growing astrocytomas. Using CD44 and GLAST, we isolated astrocyte-like cells (CD44/GLAST) from LGG275 that preferentially adopt a quiescent state yet retain remarkable plasticity, generating oligodendrocyte-like cells (CD44-/GLAST-). Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that astrocyte-like and oligodendrocyte-like cells populations resemble quiescent and activated neural stem (NSC) cells from the adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Finally, we found that NOTCH signaling regulates the balance between astrocytic and oligodendrocytic states, while DLL3, expressed by oligodendrocyte-like cells, modulates both proliferation and phenotype.

J.; Vanguri, R.; Yamashiro, D.; Connolly, E.", "abstract": "Background: High dose radiotherapy (HDRT) is highly immunogenic, promoting tumor antigen release and enhancing responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). However, HDRT also induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits therapeutic benefit. The Notch signaling pathway is a key regulator of immune and stromal cell function. We hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of Notch signaling with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), AL101, would overcome radiation-induced immunosuppression and synergistically enhance antitumor efficacy when combined with HDRT and anti PD-1(aPD-1) therapy. Methods: Syngeneic neuroblastoma (9464D) and triple-negative breast cancer (EO771) tumors were established in C57BL/6 mice and athymic nude mice. Mice received GSI AL101 (6.5 mg/kg daily x10), a single 12Gy dose of RT (Day 3), and aPD1 antibody (200ug, Days 0, 3, and 6) for triple combination therapy. A subset of mice were sacrificed on Day 10 for mechanistic studies; the remainder were followed for survival and were euthanized when tumors reached 1.5cm3. Tumors were analyzed by spectral flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). Histological image analysis of lung metastases was performed to quantify metastasis area relative to total lung area. Results: The triple combination of RT + GSI+ aPD-1 resulted in synergistic and durable tumor growth inhibition and significantly prolonged survival in both 9464D and EO771 models. In contrast, neither GSI nor aPD-1 treatment alone significantly impacted tumor growth. Dual therapy with RT + GSI modestly improved survival compared with RT alone. The triple combination regimen also markedly reduced lung metastases at the survival endpoint in EO771 bearing mice. These effects were abrogated in athymic nude mice, confirming an immune-dependent mechanism. ScRNA-seq revealed that RT alone increased exhausted T cells and immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages, whereas triple therapy reversed these effects, significantly reducing exhausted T cells while increasing activated CD8+ T cells, M1-like macrophages, and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC). Moreover, triple therapy also restored CD103+ dendritic cells-specialized for antigen cross-presentation-within the TME. Spectral flow cytometry corroborated these findings, demonstrating that GSI combined with RT + aPD-1 reprograms the TME toward an immunostimulatory state. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the novel repurposing of GSI therapy to remodel the immunosuppressive TME induced by radiation and enhance the efficacy of HDRT combined with ICI. Triple therapy activates CD8+ T cells, reduces Tregs and exhausted T cells, restores cross-presenting dendritic cells, and reverses myeloid-driven suppression, supporting Notch blockade as a promising immuno-radiotherapeutic strategy with strong translational potential.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

This lineage transition is dependent on upregulation of the NE-specifying transcription factor ASCL1, typically in a genetic background of RB1 and TP53 loss. Here we identify extracellular matrix-integrin-YAP1/TEAD signaling as a critical brake on NEPC lineage transition. Deletion of Itgb1, the shared B1 subunit required for collagen and laminin-mediated integrin activation, is sufficient to induce ASCL1 and NE lineage gene expression, by activating LATS1/2 kinases with subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TEAD signaling. Conversely, restoration of YAP1/TEAD signaling by pharmacological LATS1/2 inhibition, or by expression of constitutively active YAP1/TAZ mutants, prevents or reverts NEPC lineage transition. NOTCH and AR cooperate with YAP/TEAD to repress ASCL1, such that combined inhibition leads to complete reprograming of PRAD into NEPC in vitro, providing a dynamic platform to dissect the molecular events responsible for lineage transition over time. We find that lineage transition is accompanied by a redistribution of FOXA1 and TEAD cistromes from PRAD to NEPC-specific enhancers and requires the pioneering activity of FOXA1. Thus, extracellular matrix/integrin signaling in the PRAD tumor microenvironment restrains NE lineage plasticity, highlighting a potential path for pharmacological inhibitors in modulating treatment-induced lineage change.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a key gene regulatory process that diversifies the proteome and controls gene dosage. Previous studies have detected aging-associated splicing changes across various tissues. However, their use of bulk RNA-seq obfuscates the impacted cell-types and may confound cell-type proportion changes with cell-intrinsic ones. We present a framework that first assembles and maps alternative splicing events in appropriate single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), then applies LeafletFA, a probabilistic model that discovers coordinated splicing programs (SPs) without requiring prior knowledge of cell types or clinical information, such as age. Applying this framework to over 200,000 cells from mouse and human Smart-seq2 multi-tissue atlases, we discovered global and cell type specific aging-associated SPs. In mice, integrating SPs with gene expression significantly improved age prediction in 46 of 76 tissue-cell types tested. We identified the RNA-binding protein \\textit{Snrnp70} as a key upstream mediator driving the shift from youthful to aged SPs. To test evolutionary conservation of these patterns, we employed transfer learning to map the murine splicing dictionary onto human transcriptomes. This revealed a conserved \"youth\" program (SP4) that is maintained in quiescent endothelial tissues but lost in high-turnover organs. We identified a conserved, age-dependent alternative 5' splice site usage in the splicing factor \\textit{SRSF5} as a molecular marker of this program in both species. Our work establishes alternative splicing as a coordinated, evolutionarily conserved dimension of cellular aging and provides LeafletFA as an open-source tool for single-cell splicing analysis.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

These functions require accurate tracking of running speed and acceleration. While speed dependence in these areas is well-studied, acceleration-dependence has received little attention, and the joint effect of speed-acceleration is unknown. Hence, we assessed the joint influence of these kinematic variables by computing receptive fields in a novel, 2D, phase space of speed-acceleration using the Allen Brain Visual Observatory data. Head-fixed mice ran spontaneously on a running wheel next to a monocular gray screen ensuring virtually no changes in the retinotopic or allocentric space. Remarkably, about half (44.3%, 6590/14862) of neurons in the visuo-hippocampal circuit (from LGN to subiculum) were significantly modulated by a specific combination of speed and acceleration to form receptive fields in the speed-acceleration phase space (called kinematic space). The prevalence of kinematic tuning is comparable to the fraction of place cells in the mouse hippocampus, and the fraction of visually tuned neurons in higher visual areas. The kinematic field size (~30% of the sampled space) was also comparable to the place field size. Kinematic fields spanned the entire space but preferred either low-speed, high-acceleration or the high-speed, low-acceleration segments. Although pupil size too varied spontaneously, the kinematic tuning exceeded pupil size tuning in all brain areas. Surprisingly, pupil size modulated the activity of ~20% of hippocampal neurons, which was comparable to that in LGN and visual cortical areas. Thus, all visuo-hippocampal areas have focused kinematic fields that are three times more prevalent than the pupil size fields in the absence of any vestibular, visual or spatial stimuli.

Here, we combined social network mapping with three-person EEG hyperscanning to investigate how friendships in shared networks modulate interpersonal coordination. We mapped social networks across seven undergraduate cohorts (N = 378) and recruited a subset of participants (N = 93) that consisted of triads of two mutually close friends and one non-friend from the same network. Triads performed a novel joint motor task in which participants produced forces towards a collective target. Non-friends consistently produced greater and more vigorous force than friends during joint action. This effect was strongest for non-friends embedded in smaller social networks. At the neural level, non-friends exhibited stronger alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization, higher inter-subject correlation, and increased inter-brain group phase synchrony. These neural signatures are consistent with increased action preparation, prediction, and attentional engagement during coordination. Taken together, these findings indicate that friendship and social network context are reflected in how individuals allocate physical effort and engage during collective action, and suggest that non-friends work harder and allocate more attention during joint tasks to compensate for the disparity in social standing. By linking real-world social relationships to behavioural and multi-brain neural dynamics, this work demonstrates that relational context is embodied in the mechanisms supporting human group coordination.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

In 6 awake nonhuman primates, we recorded cortical vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs) from subdural electrodes placed in prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas, in response to cVNS or taNS. Across 478 different taNS and cVNS protocols, we varied stimulation side, intensity, frequency, pulse count, and pulse width (PW) and assessed independent effects on amplitude and latency of early (EC; 30-100 ms), intermediate (IC; 101-200 ms) and late components (LC; 201-500 ms) of VEPs. Fixed and random effects of stimulation parameters and subjects, respectively, on VEP measurements, were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Overall, cVNS elicits more robust VEPs than taNS, with larger EC, IC and LC amplitudes in both hemispheres. cVNS-elicited ECs and LCs are largest in PFC and PC areas, whereas ICs are largest in SM areas. On the other hand, taNS generally does not elicit area-specific responses. cVNS-elicited ECs have slower latency than ta-NS elicited ECs. Higher stimulation frequencies and intensities and a longer pulse width elicit larger ECs and ICs for cVNS, and to some extent for taNS. Both short and long cVNS trains elicit stronger ECs, and long trains elicit slower ICs. Earlobe stimulation elicits VEPs that partially overlap with those from taNS. In conclusion, cVNS and taNS elicit cortical VEPs in a manner consistent with distinct engagement of ascending vagal pathways, and with similarities and differences in the effects of stimulation parameters on evoked responses.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

To address this significant gap in knowledge, we used two infection models to investigate innate immune regulation by the sEVs released from cells infected with either Yersinia pestis (Yp) or Burkholderia thailandensis (Bt), designated as EXi-Yp and EXi-Bt respectively. The EXi induced differentiation of naive human monocytes to macrophages and triggered robust pro-inflammatory cytokine release, including release of IL-6, mirroring direct bacterial infection effects. Comprehensive cell signaling analyses revealed that the EXi modulate a small set of host signaling proteins, with p38 activation being primarily responsible for the observed protective effects. EXi-induced p38 activation leads to increased IL-6 release, which in turn is responsible for decreased bacterial survival within recipient immune cells that are subsequently infected. Consistent with the in vitro results, mice administered with EXi-Yp exhibited elevated serum IL-6 levels and were protected from Yp infection. Furthermore, using our microfluidic chip platform that allows functional interrogation of EV effects under physiologically relevant conditions, we have demonstrated that EXi exchange between Yp-infected cells and naive recipient monocytes leads to differentiation of the recipient cells to macrophages. Together, our findings reveal a largely unexplored aspect of innate immunity and provide a mechanistic model in which EXi prime local and distant naive monocytes via p38-induced differentiation and IL-6 production to protect against infection with Gram-negative bacteria.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

If left untreated, SjD can also cause inflammation and damage to other parts of the body, including the skin, lungs, kidneys, and nervous system, and increase the risk of developing lymphoma. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule HLA-DR3 is strongly associated with SjD. To investigate how post-translational modifications (PTMs) influence the presentation of SjD-associated autoantigens by HLA-DR3, we employed a computational framework to analyze the binding of PTM-mimic peptides to HLA-DR3. Our analysis revealed that PTM-mimic substitutions at canonical anchor positions rarely improved predicted binding affinity using the Stabilized Matrix Method, with most modifications resulting in reduced affinity. However, a comprehensive analysis of full-length SjD-associated autoantigen sequences (Ro60, Ro52, La) identified discrete regions with high densities of PTM-eligible anchor sites, specifically, the Ro60 HEAT solenoid, Ro52 RING/B-box/PRY-SPRY modules, and the La motif-RRM1 region, suggesting that PTMs may alter epitope presentation in a sequence-dependent manner. Experimental validation of selected PTM-mimic peptides demonstrated enhanced T cell responses, which were associated with increased binding affinity to HLA-DR3. Structural modeling of a representative complex revealed that PTM-mimic peptides adopt a slightly shifted backbone orientation and altered side-chain positioning, leading to a larger peptide-DR3 interaction interface.

However, nanobody discovery has been limited by technologies that rely on laborious library generation, panning, and clone screening techniques. Here, we demonstrate the successful adaptation of Linking B-Cell Receptor to Antigen Specificity through Sequencing (LIBRA-seq) to immunized alpacas for the rapid identification of antigen-specific nanobodies, derived from heavy-chain antibodies. We validated for nanobody discovery (nbLIBRA-seq) in two different disease settings. First, we identified over 300 antigen-specific heavy chain antibodies against human Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), also known as CD71, from a single alpaca blood sample. Experimental validation showed nbLIBRA-seq was able to identify nanobodies that exhibit specific binding to CD71, with two nanobodies also showing receptor internalization on human T cells. In a separate experiment, we tested the ability of nbLIBRA-seq to perform nanobody discovery with multiple antigens in the antigen screening library. Using fusion glycoproteins from the related respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 1,125 antigen-specific heavy-chain expressing B cells were recovered via nbLIBRA-seq. A subset of these nanobodies was validated experimentally to possess the target antigen specificity. Together, our results illustrate the potential of nbLIBRA-seq to rapidly identify antigen-specific heavy chain antibodies for a range of diverse targets, a capability that will be of critical significance for the effective and efficient development of novel nanobody-based therapeutics against targets of biomedical significance.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Also, recent data suggest that ANO1 is a specific marker for interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The aim of the paper was to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of ANO1 in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine during embryofetal development as a potential marker for the differentiation of ICC and smooth muscle cells. As a material, we used 2 human embryos and samples from 21 human fetuses. The tissue samples were routinely processed into paraffin blocks, and 5 micrometre-thick sections were immunostained for ANO1. Our results show that ANO1 appears during embryonic development (8th week), and its expression continues through the fetal stages. Epithelial, endothelial and ICC cells consistently expressed ANO1 in all examined samples. Smooth muscle cells showed strong expression in muscularis propria, however by the 25th week this immunopositivity was absent from outer muscle layers in stomach and large intestine.

V.; Kapur, A.; Gadhiya, P.; Arora, R.", "abstract": "During pregnancy uterine stromal cells undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial cell transition termed decidualization. In humans initiation of decidualization occurs in the absence of an embryo resulting in a need to identify embryo-independent molecular cues that can initiate decidualization. Although, similar to humans, decidualization in the mouse can be induced in the absence of an embryo, whether an implantation event is prerequisite for such decidualization is not known. In this study using different models of estrogen-dependent implantation, including natural (embryo) and artificial (sesame oil, agarose only beads, and Concanavalin A coated agarose beads) we determined that implantation chamber formation precedes decidualization. We show that focal stimuli, including the embryo, Concanavalin A coated bead, and oil droplets, induce V-shaped implantation chambers that lead to sub-epithelial PTGS2 expression and decidualization. Unfertilized eggs and uncoated agarose blue beads fail to form an implantation chamber and do not initiate decidualization. Further, we show that lectins that share sugar binding properties with Concanavalin A can also induce a V-shaped implantation chamber. Finally, using second harmonic generation we show that during decidualization collagen fibers spread radially away from the implantation chamber irrespective of the focal signal used for inducing the chamber. Thus, in the mouse artificial decidualization also initiates at the site of implantation chamber formation. These findings are critical when separating physical stimulus-dependent, embryo-dependent and embryo-independent mechanisms of decidualization that underlie a successful pregnancy.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We utilized a non-bulked segregant analysis using whole genome sequencing (WGS), mapping the trait to a roughly 3.5 mega-base (Mb) region of the X-chromosome. However, this mapping yielded ~5-fold lower resolution than anticipated, due to an uneven distribution of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between the X-chromosomes of the two recombining lines. This uneven SNP distribution was associated with recombination events biased towards regions of low SNP density, and away from the more SNP dense regions associating with the activity phenotype. We find that nearly perfect mapping of X-chromosome visible markers occurs only in historical data from a time before the establishment of discrete genetic background strains. This suggests that genetic uniformity in early Drosophila studies may have contributed to more consistent recombination frequencies, whereas modern mapping efforts are complicated by variability in SNP distribution across recombining strains. These findings highlight challenges in Drosophila genetic mapping in situations where altered SNP density can skew recombination, complicating trait localization.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

The tubulin cofactors, TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and the Arl2 GTPase, form TBC-DEG assemblies that regulate {beta}-tubulin assembly and disassembly from  and {beta}-tubulins, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we reconstitute the human TBC-DE and TBC-DEG assemblies from eukaryotic cells co-purified with monomeric {beta}-tubulin intermediates and determine their cryo-EM structures. The structures reveal that TBC-DEG disassembles {beta}-tubulin by releasing -tubulin through a lever-arm-like rotation in TBCE coupled to major conformational change in Arl2 upon its nucleotide release, while TBCD tightly holds {beta}-tubulin. TBCD dissociates -tubulin by refolding the {beta}-tubulin H10-S8 loop at its intradimer interface. The TBC-DEG-{beta}-tubulin or TBC-DE-{beta}-tubulin assemblies undergo extensive back-to-back dimerization mediated by {beta}{beta}-tubulin homodimers, formed through their dissociated H8 helices at unoccupied intradimer interfaces. Structural comparisons demonstrate that the TBCE mechanical rotation, driven by the Arl2 GTPase cycle, either delivers -tubulin or removes it from beneath the TBCD-bound {beta}-tubulin and is directionally regulated by TBCC stabilizing {beta}-tubulin interfaces. Our findings suggest that TBC-DEG/TBCC catalyzing heterodimerization of -tubulin with {beta}-tubulin may have evolved to counteract the {beta}-tubulin intrinsic tendency to form off-pathway toxic homodimers through its exposed -tubulin-binding intradimer interface.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

While most research has centered on immune signaling and hormone dynamics, plant-pathogen interactions also dramatically reshape primary metabolism, often modifying source activity and converting infecting tissues into strong metabolic sinks. The SnRK1 (SNF1-related kinase 1) protein kinase acts as a cellular fuel gauge in plants, integrating metabolic status and environmental and developmental cues to maintain carbon and energy homeostasis. Here, we explored SnRK1-mediated quantitative resistance against clubroot disease in the related crucifer model Arabidopsis thaliana. Both soil and hydroponic-based disease bioassays revealed how especially increased nuclear SnRK11 activity antagonizes clubroot development, suggesting a pivotal role for transcriptional regulation. qRT-PCR analysis and quantification of soluble sugar contents and invertase activity in roots indicate that SnRK1 represses sucrose transporter expression as well as cell wall invertase (CWINV) expression and activity, likely limiting clubroot development by reducing sink strength. Consistently, cellular assays indicate that the recently identified SnRK11-targeting P. brassicae effector PBZF1 interferes with SnRK11 nuclear translocation. Our study thus corroborates that SnRK1 is a primary effector target and shows that SnRK1-mediated reprogramming of gene expression and sink activity is an effective mechanism against clubroot disease development.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We recently identified that the human, but not murine, immunomodulatory protein B71 (CD80) activates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), a function arising from evolutionary divergence in human B71. This discovery provides an opportunity to directly interrogate the role of this interaction in disease progression using a well-characterized murine model of mutant A{beta} overexpression (CRND8). We generated a mouse line in which murine B71 was replaced with a chimeric human:murine B71 that retains normal interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28, while gaining the ability to bind p75, and evaluated its effects in CRND8 mice. Expression of human:murine B71 in vivo resulted in increased lethality, accelerated neuroinflammation of resident glia, more rapid synaptic and dendritic loss, and enhanced microvascular compromise in the subiculum compared to CRND8 mice expressing murine B71.

However, it remains unclear whether the brain possesses such an efficient system, and if so, what are the features of the system. Over a decade ago, a glymphatic system was proposed to describe neurofluid transport through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perivascular spaces (PVS), complemented by dural and meningeal lymphatic pathways. Nonetheless, it is still elusive whether transport within the CSF and PVS occurs as a structured form of flow. Moreover, unlike the abundance of blood capillaries in the brain, only a low density of lymphatic vessels has been observed. Such a low density of lymphatic vessels is unlikely to support the level of efficiency required for effective metabolic waste clearance in the brain. By combining expansion microscopic imaging with CRANAD-3, a pan-beta-amyloid fluorescence probe, we discovered abundant nano-scale lymphatic-like vessels (NLVs) in the brain parenchyma of both mouse and human. The majority of these vessels have diameters less than 1000 nanometers and show moderate positivity for several lymphatic biomarkers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, PDPN, and VEGFR3. The NLVs coil around blood vessels and possible connections between blood vessels were observed. Notably, we also found that some NLVs travel through several layers in the cortex and display distinct orientation patterns in different cortical layers.

Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice.

However, whether cortical dynamics are governed by such a singular hierarchy, or instead by multiple concurrent timescales, has remained unclear due to this fundamental methodological constraint. Here, developing an assumption-free spectral analysis of human intracranial recordings, we discover a fundamental dissociation: cortical dynamics are organized into a fast spectral component (~10-100 Hz) and a slow component (<~1-10 Hz). Crucially, only the fast component spatially recapitulates the classic sensory-to-transmodal functional gradient, whereas the slow component lacks gradient and is coupled to cardiac-related neural activity.

While the E627* variant has been shown to result in a truncated protein and dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling, its specific role in human pancreatic islet health and function remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDA5627* would protect islet cells from stress-induced dysfunction, identity loss, and cell death. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we introduced the E627* and A946T variants into human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a T1D patient. We differentiated these hPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and treated them with IFN, poly(I:C), and coxsackievirus B3, an enterovirus implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and an array of functional assays, we investigated the variant impact on both whole SC-islets and their individual cell populations. Our analysis revealed that SC-islets, and their {beta}, , and {delta} cell subpopulations, harboring the MDA5627* variant exhibit an attenuated immune response to the various stressors compared to MDA5946T cells.

We identify an unexpected early role for Torso in activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), generating posterior membrane domains enriched in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Elevated PI3K activity disrupts PGC formation, while reduced PI3K activity leads to ectopic PGCs. We further demonstrate that GCL remodels the posterior pole membrane by suppressing Torso-dependent PI3K activation.

Cell-cycle analysis using the FUCCI system revealed altered neuroblast cell-cycle dynamics, characterized by depletion of proliferative populations and enrichment of G1-phase cells, indicative of stem cell exhaustion. In addition, increased apoptotic signaling was detected in larval neural tissues expressing amyloid {beta} and Tau. Together, our findings demonstrate that amyloid {beta} and Tau disrupt asymmetric division, differentiation, and self-renewal of neural stem cells during development, resulting in reduced neuronal output and defective brain organization. This study highlights that amyloid {beta} and Tau exert neurotoxic effects early in development, providing mechanistic insight into how neurodevelopmental perturbations may contribute to later neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We asked whether, and along which axis, marine species obey Rapoport s rule when ranges are quantified in three dimensions. Location: Global ocean. Taxon: > 20,000 marine species spanning pelagic and benthic habitats across major animal phyla and fishes. Methods: We combined AquaMaps 2.0 modelled distributions with independently curated depth limits from FishBase and SeaLifeBase to estimate latitudinal and vertical (bathymetric) ranges for each species. We quantified latitudinal range versus absolute mid latitude and depth range versus mid depth, and repeated analyses by habitat and taxonomic group. We used linear and polynomial regressions and Gaussian mixture models in range gradient space to identify and compare alternative Rapoport regimes. Results: Marine biodiversity exhibits a classic latitudinal diversity gradient and strong concentration of richness in the upper ocean, with broader ranges at higher latitudes and greater depths. Support for Rapoport s rule is weak and inconsistent for latitudinal ranges, but strong and pervasive with depth, with correlations between vertical range and mid depth frequently exceeding 0.8 across habitats and taxa. Latitudinal and vertical ranges are positively, but only moderately, coupled, with a small subset of 3D generalists spanning both large latitudinal and depth extents. Main conclusions: The marine realm appears to obey Rapoport s rule primarily along the vertical, rather than latitudinal, axis. Depth-structured environmental tolerance thus emerges as a dominant constraint on marine range limits and three-dimensional biodiversity gradients.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

We find significant differences in evolutionary conservation of multiple genes and GO categories between vertivores and invertivores. Conservation relative to herbivores differs among vertivores, invertivores, and the combination of all carnivores. Lineages with predatory diets have increased conservation in lipid and amino acid metabolism relative to herbivores. Notably, we find that results in the combined carnivore-herbivore comparison are much more similar to those of the invertivore-herbivore comparison than the vertivore-herbivore comparison, which suggests that prior studies on carnivory may have been detecting signatures of selection related to invertivory.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

The screen revealed 10 candidates (six mitochondrial), including the vitamin B12 chaperone MMADHC and cytosolic B12-dependent methionine synthase (MTR). MMADHC is short-lived across cell types and we show that its levels increase with PMF collapse. MMADHC stabilization precedes PINK1 activation in a time course of increasing mtDNA depletion, suggesting greater sensitivity to PMF collapse. MMADHC accumulates in mitochondria with LONP1 inhibition but in the cytosol upon PMF collapse, likely due to mitochondrial import failure. Cytosol-stabilized MMADHC increases MTR levels and activity.

Identifying phage-host interactions (PHIs) is crucial for understanding infection dynamics and developing phage-based therapeutic strategies. Recent deep learning approaches have shown great promise for PHI prediction; however, their performance remains constrained by the limited number of experimentally validated positive pairs and the overwhelming abundance of unlabeled or non-validated samples. Moreover, most existing models overlook higher-level phylogenetic relationships among hosts, which could provide valuable structural priors for guiding representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a phylogenetic tree-aware positive-unlabeled deep metric learning framework for phage-host interaction (PHI) identification. Unlike traditional approaches that train classification models to strictly separate positive and negative phage-host pairs, the proposed method learns representations under supervision from both confirmed positive PHIs and host phylogenetic tree constraints on non-positive samples. The proposed method can seamlessly formalize contrastive learning and deep metric learning within the same framework that explicitly optimizes PHI encoders with biological constraints in the learning functions. We show that this metric learning formulation outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that enforce separation between positive and negative samples without consistently aligning the learned representations with evolutionary distances. Experiments on the Cherry benchmark dataset and metagenome Hi-C multi-host dataset demonstrate that our approach enhances species-level prediction accuracy, improves cross-host generalization, and yields more interpretable representations of phage-host relationships.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

This confinement can be described using low-dimensional manifolds. Leveraging information geometry, we developed a method to quantify cell state transition manifolds using single-cell RNA sequencing data. With this approach, each single cell is represented as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and is associated with a Fisher information matrix. We analyzed variations in the Fisher information matrix and its eigenvalue spectrum during cell state transitions. Our results reveal pronounced sloppiness in single cells, where cell state is sensitive to only a few specific combinations of parameters. Importantly, the degree of sloppiness fluctuates during cell state transitions. We found that critical transitions are associated with changes in the so-called stiff parameters. Notably, parameters identified as stiff exhibit low velocities and minimal fluctuations, whereas sloppy parameters display higher velocities and larger fluctuations. These findings indicate that cells fine-tune sensitive directions with caution while permitting greater flexibility along sloppy directions, revealing a principle of least action confining the paths taken during state transitions. During transitional stages, fluctuations and velocities increase were observed on stiff parameters, reflecting enhanced dynamical activity as cells navigate through critical regions of the manifold.

While many types of fluorescent linear force sensors inserted in cellular fibrillar elements have been developed, few tools are available to track two-dimensional tension in cell membranes. Here, we present a novel principle for tension detection using a fluorescent probe based on the scaffold of the GsMTx4 peptide from Grammostola venom. Previously, we have shown that amphipathic GsMTx4 binds to lipids and inhibits mechanosensitive channels by inserting more deeply into the membrane at tensions near activation thresholds, thereby acting as a buffer clamping lateral pressure in the bilayer. We leverage this property of GsMTx4 to redistribute between the 'shallow' and 'deep' immersion states, thereby designing probes with a fluorescent moiety that increases quantum yield in nonpolar environments. GsMTx4 analogs carrying fluorescent groups at the two positions increase fluorescence intensity in osmotically shocked liposomes and aspirated giant vesicles in a near-linear fashion in response to physiological bilayer tensions. The responses show dependence on membrane composition, particularly lipid charge and the presence of lipid-ordering components, such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Langmuir compression isotherms recorded in the presence of NBD analogs indicated initial incorporation into the monolayer, followed by sharp expulsion at the monolayer-bilayer equivalence pressure, with correlated changes in monolayer compressibility and fluorescence, illustrating the basic principle of probe action. The probes show promise for monitoring tension in biological membranes at low, non-inhibitory concentrations. Experiments with native cell-derived membrane vesicles reveal heterogeneous baseline staining and tension responses, underscoring the probes' selectivity for distinct membrane domains.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Adaptive therapy (AT), a resistance management strategy, aims to address this issue by selectively applying therapeutic pressure to promote competition between therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant clones, allowing for long-term control of tumor burden. AT relies upon the assumption that resistance comes at some fitness cost in the absence of therapy. Is that assumption justified? We conducted a systematic review of the literature on experimental tests of the fitness cost of therapeutic resistance. We conducted a search for peer-reviewed papers that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) experiments of direct competition, (ii) between therapy-resistant and therapy-sensitive clones, (iii) in a therapy-free environment. We found 47 experiments that matched those criteria. Of those experiments, approximately two-thirds (68%) found a fitness cost to resistance in a competitive environment. Of all pooled features from the studies reviewed, we found that the resistance characteristic was most significantly associated with whether resistant clones exhibited a fitness advantage in competition (p=0.0147). Further, we identify complex ecological interactions that may influence the behavior of the cancer cell population without selection by therapeutic pressure. Predicting which resistance characteristics can be exploited therapeutically with AT and identifying potential methods of modulating the costliness of the resistant phenotype may be critical to future improvements in cancer therapy.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Using an inducible, liver-specific DHHC7 knockout (D7LKO) mouse, we report that loss of DHHC7 in hepatocytes potentiates adenylyl cyclase-PKA-CREB signaling through reducing palmitoylation of inhibitory G protein  subunit (Gi), leading to transcriptional elevation and secretion of proteoglycan 4 (Prg4). Elevated circulating Prg4 acts on adipocytes by binding GPR146 via Prg4s N-terminal SMB domain, suppressing adipocyte PKA substrate phosphorylation and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) Ser563 phosphorylation, thereby impairing lipolysis. Under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, D7LKO mice and mice with adenoviral hepatic Prg4 overexpression develop pronounced obesity characterized by increasing brown, subcutaneous, and visceral fat mass and adipocyte hypertrophy; strikingly, these animals show little impairment in glucose tolerance or circulating triglycerides but display elevated plasma cholesterol. Conditioned medium containing Prg4 recapitulates suppression of adipocyte HSL phosphorylation in vitro, and SMB-deleted Prg4 fails to bind GPR146 or inhibit HSL phosphorylation.

This reliance minimizes crosstalk but constrains circuit complexity and information integration. Creating hybrid TFs that combine or interpolate promoter specificities could therefore expand the design space of synthetic regulatory systems. However, it remains unclear whether hybrid functions can be created by mixing amino acid sequences, and how such functional integration could be achieved in a principled manner.

We model log-responses as (multi)variate Gaussian and compute optimal thresholds, PD-PFA trade-offs, and ROC curves at 30 minutes and 4 hours. The NP framework captures expected biology: PD increases with TNF dose; wild-type cells outperform A20-/- at matched conditions; and combining two time points (bivariate analysis) improves detection (e.g., for 0.0052 vs. 0.2 ng/mL, PD rises from 0.71 (30 minutes) and 0.42 (4 hours) to 0.80 at PFA = 0.1). The analysis recovers expected biology (higher TNF causes higher detectability; negative feedback lowers late responses) and flags cases where decision quality degrades (e.g., perturbations that blunt separation between conditions). The same recipe extends to multivariate readouts without changing the logic. Overall, the NP detection framework provides a compact, quantitative score of pathway performance and failure.

Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as \"real\" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such \"unreal\" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery to cerebrospinal [fl]uid (CSF) mediates transfection of target cells to enable sustained delivery of secretory proteins into the CSF, o[ff]ering promising avenues for both CNS therapy and mechanistic studies. However, despite the advantages afforded by AAV tropism-based cellular selectivity and transgene delivery, both preclinical studies and clinical trials report short- and long-term adverse e[ff]ects, particularly immune activation. Especially relevant for CSF biology, CNS immune insults raise the risk of CSF dysregulation, including hydrocephalus. These risks may be exacerbated in pediatric populations, where ongoing CNS development, including immature meninges, choroid plexus (ChP), and skull structures, may further impair any ability to compensate for CSF dysregulation. To systematically address these risks and provide guidelines for minimizing CNS immune insults by AAVs, we test the dose-dependent e[ff]ects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 3 AAV serotypes (AAV2/5, AAV2/4, and AAV.PHP.eB) to neonatal (P0.5) CD1 mouse pups. Histological analysis veri[fi]ed AAV2/5 tropism limited to ChP epithelial cells (CPECs), whereas AAV.PHP.eB transfected both CPECs and ependymal regions. By contrast, AAV2/4 shows limited transfection in the brain. Further, we [fi]nd that ICV injections of all 3 AAV serotypes at the high dose (4x109 genome copy GC/pup) induced ventriculomegaly by P7.5, while the low dose (1x109 GC/pup) was well tolerated. Additionally, high-dose AAV2/5 tropism became more permissive, transfecting the ChP and also ependymal cells and some neurons. Longitudinal MRI of P0.5 pups with high-dose AAV2/5 ICV injections highlighted quick progression of ventriculomegaly. CSF ELISA analysis detected elevated proin[fl]ammatory cytokine CCL2 in AAV2/5 and AAV2/4 high-dose groups, indicating CNS inflammation. Moreover, decreased CSF TTR concentrations in high-dose groups suggest ChP dysfunction. We further revealed that earlier in utero high-dose ICV AAV2/5 injections at E13.5 induced even more severe ventriculomegaly and that adult animals were also susceptible to ventriculomegaly after high-dose AAV ICV delivery. Taken together, our data emphasize critical safety considerations of CSF-based AAV delivery, particularly during brain development. Further, these results call for an optimized dosage for perinatal ICV AAV applications.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Evolution relieved conformational bottlenecks by promoting alternate functional sub-states, gradually shifting the rate-limiting step from substrate binding to sub-state interconversion, and finally to the chemical step. Reorganization of the conformational landscape enhanced OXA-48's ability to hydrolyze ceftazidime and introduced a trade-off in its native activity against meropenem. This trade-off stemmed from catalytic incompatibility between the native and the evolved sub-state populations.

Cranial globularization and chin emergence are well-documented morphological transformations whose genetic basis remains poorly understood, whereas Neandertal introgression is primarily documented through genomic evidence. How these evolutionary phenomena relate to craniofacial variation in present-day humans remains largely unresolved. Here, we leverage 3D craniofacial data from over 50,000 UK Biobank participants and employ a multivariate, multiscale genome-wide association approach to define axes of variation aligned with inter-population allele frequency shifts, evolutionary processes, and clinical conditions. We identify continuous craniofacial trends within our cohort that mirror global patterns of genetic diversity, indicating that facial differences between human populations arise at the phenotypic axes already present within a single population. We further demonstrate that modern human-derived alleles underlie the origins of the human chin by reducing midfacial projection relative to other hominins and reveal the persistent effects of Neandertal introgression on craniofacial diversity today. We also model genetically informed endophenotypes for orofacial clefts, obstructive sleep apnoea, and myopia.

(4) What is the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (mtCOI) diversity of A. biguttula? (5) Which regions constitute its native versus invaded range? Adults were collected from Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Species identity was confirmed morphologically and by sequencing mtCOI, where possible, from five individuals per site, yielding consensus haplotypes. We analyzed 11 US, 20 Puerto Rican, and 342 sequences originating from publicly available databases (n = 373). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed monophyly of this species. A haplotype network recovered 70 unique haplotypes, including a star-like core of 68 radiating from Hap01 and two divergent singletons. The mainland US and Chinese populations were fixed for Hap01, indicating recent introductions. Puerto Rico exhibited Hap01, Hap52, and Hap70, reflecting multiple introductions, but could also result from haplotype diversity carried within a single introduction involving many individuals. Furthermore, southeastern US sites were fixed for Hap01, indicating extension from Puerto Rico and Florida. No haplotype was host-specific, confirming a lineage across crops. Diversity metrics indicate recent expansion in Iraq, Hong Kong, and Puerto Rico. South Asia, particularly Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, showed the highest haplotype diversity, supporting its role as the putative native range. In contrast, low diversity in China and the US is consistent with recent invasion.

L.", "abstract": "Expressed genes potentially fall into two distinct categories: 'tissue-specific' genes expressed in a subset of cell types that carry out the distinctive functions of those cells; and 'housekeeping' genes that are broadly expressed across all cell types and carry out the basic functions of life. It is unclear, however, whether these are actually two distinct classes or whether they represent an intuitive but false dichotomy imposed upon gene expression patterns that vary widely and continuously in how specific they are to particular tissues. We address this question using a high-coverage, whole-embryo single cell RNAseq atlas of the model invertebrate chordate Ciona robusta. There is a major complication in that quantitative measures of tissue-specificity such as the Tau and Gini metrics show a strong negative correlation with expression level. We show here that this correlation is the result of sampling error and not a fundamental biological relationship. Raw Tau scores are bimodal, but this is largely an artifact of Tau's sigmoidal relationship with expression level for uniformly expressed genes. Simulations and statistical analyses indicate that the Tau metric is badly confounded by expression level for ubiquitously and/or weakly expressed genes but is relatively accurate for genes that have statistical evidence of differential expression. The distribution of tissue-specificity scores for these differentially expressed genes is broad and flat, spanning from near-binary to near-uniform. While only subtly bimodal, ubiquitously expressed and tissue-specific genes are clearly distinguishable, especially at higher expression levels. We explore the use of pseudocounts to shrink the high tissue-specificity scores of weakly expressed genes and find that they are effective at separating tissue-specific from ubiquitously expressed genes but distort rankings of tissue-specificity. Gene ontology code analysis indicates that the most tissue-specific genes are strongly enriched for predicted roles as transcriptional regulators and tissue-specific effector molecules, whereas the most ubiquitously expressed genes are enriched for predicted housekeeping functions. We conclude that the 'tissue-specific' vs 'housekeeping' dichotomy is meaningful in the Ciona embryo despite the broad range of Tau scores for tissue-specific genes. These findings provide a framework for formally assessing the tissue-specificity of gene expression across a broad range of taxa and developmental stages.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we assembled draft genomes for 499 angiosperm species from a lowland rainforest in Singapore, representing 67% of its flora, and integrated these with plant traits and comprehensive forest census data. Across the community, most gene families evolve under stabilising selection, with copy numbers maintained near long-term optima that differ among ecological strategies. These niche-associated genomic attractor states provide a mechanism for convergent adaptation and species coexistence. Modelling stabilising selection also identified a strong trade-off between defence and growth, indicating that pathogen pressure constrains developmental diversification. Consistent with this, species-specific genome space was enriched for resistance genes and transposable elements. In contrast, genomic processes structuring present-day plant community composition differ from those driving deep-time convergence. Genomic comparisons across forest types revealed stronger selection on defence-related pathways in old-growth primary forests and on growth-related processes in regenerating secondary forests, while community-level genomic profiles showed expansions in gene families associated with rapid responses to environmental fluctuations. Stabilising selection therefore links population-level adaptation with long-term species diversification in the tropics. Niche similarity promotes long-term coexistence, whereas local community structure is shaped by more rapid ecological filtering driven by environmental change.

In this study, we aimed to leverage on the innately rewarding and salient nature of play behaviour, to investigate the potential contagiousness of positive affective states in juvenile rats. Observers that had been moderately socially deprived for varying durations first witnessed highly-playful (Play) or non-playful (Control) demonstrator rats prior to being reunited and given the opportunity to freely interact. Surprisingly, we observed the emission of negatively-valenced 22 kHz calls in a subset of sessions which was also associated with heightened play behavior of the demonstrators. We found that the reunited observers showed an increase in play behavior following observation in the Play condition compared to the Control condition, but only after short social isolation and in sessions without 22 kHz calls. In addition, an overall higher number of positively-valenced 50 kHz calls were emitted in the Play condition, again in sessions without 22 kHz emissions. Despite the limitations of the experimental procedure, our results highlight the complex nature of positive emotional sharing and provide encouraging first indications of using social play observation to study positive emotional contagion.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

Kinetic data show clear curvature in rate-temperature plots, particularly for the cold-adapted enzyme, independent of unfolding. This non-Arrhenius behaviour is accounted for by Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT), implying an activation heat capacity, largest for the psychrophile. Simulations reveal the molecular origins of these differences, showing significant conformational and dynamical changes between reactant and transition states in the cold-adapted enzyme, with a smaller activation heat capacity in the mesophilic enzyme, and near-zero for the thermophile. Transition-state-like conformations and reorganized correlated dynamics underlie these adaptations.

Urine, not strictly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, accumulates extensive variable information and reflects changes in the body earlier and more sensitively, making it an excellent source for biomarker discovery. However, long-distance transport of urine samples usually requires a strictly maintained cold chain throughout the process, resulting in high costs and operational challenges. Here, we propose a urine sample processing method that uses brief heating to inhibit bacterial proliferation and protein degradation. A single urine sample was equally divided into three groups: a pre-heated transport group, a non-heated transport group, and a -80 frozen storage control group, with five replicates in each group. Both the pre-heated and non-heated transport groups were transported simultaneously across northern and southern China for five days under ambient temperature conditions. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the intra-group overlap rates of identified proteins within the groups treated with 65 water bath heating for 15 minutes and -80 frozen storage were 97.1% and 97.5%, respectively, demonstrating high reproducibility. There were no significant differences in the number or types of urinary proteins identified between these two groups, with an inter-group overlap rate of 99.9%. Additionally, the pre-heated transport group and frozen storage control group showed no significant difference in the number of bacterial-derived peptides and proteins identified. In contrast, significantly more bacterial-derived peptides and proteins were identified in the non-heated transport group than in both the pre-heated transport and frozen storage control groups. This indicates that heating effectively suppresses bacterial counts in urine samples during five days of transport at ambient temperatures. This approach provides a more economical and convenient solution for long-distance transport of urine samples, eliminating the need for cold chain transportation or preservatives. We also recommend using consistent urine processing methods within the same study to minimize technical variability.", "date": "2025-12-31", "journal": ""}

FUS stimulation elicits ML without the need for optical excitation, thereby enabling deep-tissue imaging devoid of background interference from excitation light. By modulating the excitation frequency of FUS, ML can be programmed as a characteristic signal. Integrated with a Fourier frequency-transform identification reconstruction (FFIR) algorithm, the specific ML signals can be detected with high sensitivity, reaching sub-millimeter spatial resolution and markedly enhanced signal-to-background ratios compared to conventional photoluminescence-based approaches. By macrophage internalization of the ML nanoparticles to yield functional macrophage-nanoparticle (FMNs), a ultralow detection limit of 10 cells can be achieved.

The CRISPR-Cas13b system, specifically the PspCas13b subtype, has emerged as a promising programmable antiviral tool capable of targeting viral RNA with high specificity. However, the efficacy of Cas13b-based interventions relies heavily on the design of potent and conserved CRISPR RNA (crRNA) spacer sequences, a task complicated by high viral genetic diversity. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, which targets double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic genomes, Cas13b directly targets single-stranded RNA, making it ideally suited for RNA virus therapeutics; however, existing computational tools predominantly focus on Cas9 DNA targeting or Cas13d for mammalian transcript knockdown, leaving a significant gap for Cas13b-specific viral antiviral design. In this paper, we propose a computational pipeline and machine learning framework for the rational design of high-efficacy Cas13b guide RNAs targeting all four Dengue serotypes. Our approach integrates large-scale genomic data extraction, conservation analysis, and a novel in silico optimization module for guide RNA (gRNA) sequences, based on recently reported Cas13b design rules (e.g., 5' GG motif preference, Cytosine penalties). To predict targeting efficiency, we benchmark classical machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) against foundation model-based predictors (Nucleotide Transformer, RNA-FM) using a dataset of experimentally validated spacers. Our results demonstrate that classical feature-engineered models significantly outperform deep learning approaches when trained on experimentally validated gRNA datasets in low-data regimes. We identify highly conserved, optimized crRNA candidates, including several pan-serotype guides with predicted high potency.

Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus.
