Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioural, and reproductive differences. Here we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Masel, J.", "abstract": "Nearly neutral theory predicts that species with higher effective population size (Ne) are better at purging slightly deleterious mutations. We compare evolution in high-Ne vs. low-Ne vertebrates to reveal subtle selective preferences among amino acids. We take three complementary approaches. First, we fit non-stationary substitution models using maximum likelihood, comparing the high-Ne clade of rodents and lagomorphs to its low-Ne sister clade of primates and colugos. Second, we compared evolutionary outcomes across a wider range of vertebrates, via correlations between amino acid frequencies and Ne. Third, we dissected which amino acids substitutions occurred in human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat, as scored by parsimony -- this also enabled comparison to a historical paper. All methods agree on amino acid preference under more effective selection. Preferred amino acids are less costly to synthesize and use GC-rich codons, which are hard to maintain under AT-biased mutation. These factors explain 85% of the variance in amino acid preferences. Parsimony-induced bias in the historical study produces an apparent reduction in structural disorder, perhaps driven by slightly deleterious substitutions in rapidly evolving regions. Within highly exchangeable pairs of amino acids, arginine is strongly preferred over lysine, aspartate over glutamate, and valine over isoleucine, consistent with more effective selection preferring a marginally larger free energy of folding. Two of these preferences (K[-&gt;]R and I[-&gt;]V), but not a third (E[-&gt;]D) match differences between thermophiles and mesophilic relatives. These results reveal the biophysical consequences of mutation-selection-drift balance, and demonstrate the utility of nearly neutral theory for understanding protein evolution.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Codanin1 regulates histone shuttling via the chaperone ASF1, yet the role of CDIN1 in CDA-I pathology remains unclear. Notably, CDIN1 is known to interact directly with the C-terminus of Codanin1.

Ingesting antidepressants such as paroxetine in early pregnancy increases the risk of ASD in offspring. However, a comprehensive picture of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to paroxetine retards neurogenesis in the optic tectum and the dorsal telencephalon, which corresponds to the human amygdala. Paroxetine-treated embryos exhibit impaired growth, with small heads and short body lengths resulting from transient apoptosis. This is reminiscent of the early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with ASD. Interestingly, the delayed neurogenesis in the small heads was found to be restored after the cessation of paroxetine. This restoration was accompanied by extended retinotectal projections, suggesting brain-preferential remodeling. Finally, the paroxetine-treated fish exhibited impaired social behavior, further supporting the correspondence with ASD.

Here we directly addressed this question by exposing serially cultured human primary fibroblasts to multiple, low doses of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and analyzing somatic mutation burden using single-cell whole genome sequencing. The results indicate that mitotically active cells can sustain at least ~56,000 single-nucleotide variants with only a slight adverse effect on growth rate. We provide evidence that such high levels of mutations are tolerated through negative selection against variants in gene coding and non-coding regions, and in sequences associated with genetic pathways for maintaining relevant cellular functions such as growth and cell identity.

It enables breeders to quantify their breeding objectives in terms of desired genetic gains (i.e., desired response to selection) and facilitates the efficient simultaneous improvement of multiple quantitative traits in a breeding population without the need for economic weights. We deliberately chose the term ''optimal'' here, which is typically associated with the profit-oriented selection indices commonly used in animal breeding, such as the Smith-Hazel Index. Our intention is to refute the perception that the Desired Gains Index is less efficient than the Smith-Hazel Index since both approaches maximise expected genetic gains in proportion to the breeding objective. To achieve this, we first review the relationship between the Desired Gains Index and the Smith-Hazel Index to show that desired gains are actually a form of economic weighting expressed as an improvement ratio for the traits under selection. We then present a general form of the Desired Gains Index to leverage best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), which enables seamless integration of pedigree or genomic relationship information (e.g., genomic estimated breeding values) between the selection candidates and other related individuals. Finally, using stochastic simulation, we compare the performance of different parent selection strategies, including index selection for population improvement, independent culling, and selection of extreme genotypes. The objective of these demonstrations is to convey the potential impact and benefits of the Desired Gains Index to a broader audience without the need for a deep understanding of selection theory and the equations presented here.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Wright, K. W.; Lichtenberg, E. M.", "abstract": "Understanding how the availability of both trophic and non-trophic resources impacts key ecosystem service providers is crucial for informing conservation efforts. Non-trophic resources such as shelter can play critical roles in ecosystem function and resilience by affecting predation and pathogen rates, reproductive success, and interspecific interactions. However, non-trophic resources are often overlooked. This holds true for insect pollinators; impacts of shelter on community dynamics and pollination remain poorly understood. Because the majority of bee species spend most of their lives underground, we explored whether nesting habitat characteristics are key drivers of ground-nesting bee abundance, diversity, and community composition. We additionally compared impacts of aboveground versus belowground nesting habitat characteristics, as the latter have received significantly less attention. Nesting habitat characteristics we considered included bare ground cover; and soil texture, compaction, and depth. We also included floral abundance and richness. We focused on rangelands, natural or semi-natural grasslands that are managed for livestock grazing, where management can dramatically alter trophic and non-trophic resources. Thus, we also investigated impacts of grazing management on bee habitat. We found that belowground, but not aboveground, nesting habitat characteristics were important for ground-nesting bee assemblages. Ground-nesting bee abundance and richness were highest at sites with sandier and less compacted soils. Our results suggest that livestock grazing management may indirectly impact ground-nesting bee abundance through impacts on floral abundance. Sites with longer grazing rest periods had higher floral abundance, and sites with higher floral abundance supported more ground-nesting bees (but not more bee species). Policy implications: Our study highlights the importance of considering non-trophic resources in conservation and restoration management. Managers should be cautious in using an aboveground measure such as bare ground as an indicator of bee habitat quality. Rather, we recommend that belowground habitat characteristics such as soil texture and compaction be included in habitat quality assessments. Evidence-based rangeland conservation and restoration planning may need to manage for ground-nesting bees' preferred levels of soil compaction. Additionally, management-insensitive habitat characteristics such as soil texture may be important considerations for site prioritization in pollinator habitat conservation and restoration efforts.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

In electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography functional connectivity analyses, artefactual connectivity can also occur with zero-phase-delay. To minimise artefact, contemporary analyses typically exclude all zero-phase-delay interactions. However, the extent to which 'true' interactions are resultingly lost - and the impact this has on the performance of functional connectivity metrics as biomarkers - remains unknown. Here, we show that most cortico-cortical functional connectivity occurs with zero- or near-zero phase-delay, even where such connectivity is unlikely to be artefactual. Including, rather than excluding, zero-phase-delay connectivity increases the reliability, convergence with neurobiology (structure-function concordance, homotopic interhemispheric connectivity, and age-related connectivity changes), and prognostic ability of functional connectivity metrics. We find that excluding zero-phase-delay connections penalises functional connectivity strength between the strongest structurally connected regions: stronger structural connections lead to functional connections with phase-delays closer to zero, mediated by a shorter signal propagation time.

Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers.

Do these limited father-offspring relationships also affect later-life outcomes for offspring? Working in a well-studied baboon population where males contribute little direct offspring care, we found that juvenile female baboons who had stronger paternal relationships, or who resided longer with their fathers, led adult lives that were 2-4 years longer than females with weak or short paternal relationships. This pattern did not differ between females who experienced high versus low levels of early-life adversity; hence, paternal relationships were equally protective in both harsh and benign early environments. Males' relationships were strongest with juvenile females they were most likely to have sired and when males had few mating opportunities. Hence, father-daughter relationships may be constrained by male mating effort.

Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for accurately reconstructing evolutionary histories, as failing to account for discordance can lead to misinterpretations of species boundaries, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeographic patterns. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary drivers of mitonuclear discordance in the Tropidurus spinulosus species group, which contains nine species of lizards inhabiting open tropical and subtropical environments in South America. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenomic approaches, applied to mitochondrial and nuclear data, we identified different instances of gene flow that occurred in ancestral lineages of extant species. Our results point to a complex evolutionary history marked by prolonged isolation between species, demographic fluctuations, and potential episodes of secondary contact with genetic admixture. These conditions likely facilitated mitochondrial genome capture while diluting signals of nuclear introgression. Furthermore, we found no strong evidence supporting incomplete lineage sorting or natural selection as primary drivers of the observed mitonuclear discordance. Therefore, the unveiled patterns are most consistent with neutral demographic processes, coupled with ancient mitochondrial introgression, as the main factors underlying the mismatch between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies in this system. Future research could further explore the role of other demographic processes, such as asymmetric sex-biased dispersal, in shaping these complex evolutionary patterns.\n\nSignificanceMitochondrial and nuclear genomes evolve independently, through distinct processes, often leading to conflicting genetic patterns--a phenomenon known as mitonuclear discordance. While widely documented, the underlying causes of such discordant patterns are not always clear. In this study, we investigated the drivers of mitonuclear discordance using a lizard group (the Tropidurus spinulosus species group) as a model system. Our findings suggest that changes in population size and historical isolation, possibly followed by secondary contact, were key drivers of ancient introgression among species, especially affecting the mitochondrial genome. These results provide valuable insights into how natural population dynamics shape the evolutionary processes behind mitonuclear discordance.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The vertebrate Cu-ATPase homologs ATP7A and ATP7B facilitate excess copper efflux, in addition to metalating cuproproteins. ATP7A and ATP7B exhibit copper-responsive basolateral and apical trafficking polarity respectively, in polarized epithelia. To elucidate the role of conserved functional domains in copper-responsive trafficking and copper transport, we substituted the copper-binding amino-terminal, Nucleotide-Binding (NBD) and C-terminal domain of ATP7B with that of ATP7A either singly or in combinations. The six chimeric Cu-ATPases generated, although functionally active, exhibited altered trafficking phenotypes. Notably, the N-terminal-substituted ATP7B exhibited constitutive trafficking to the basolateral membrane; however, the N-terminal and NBD double-substituted chimera gained steady-state TGN localization, indicating a putative interaction between the two domains critical for its TGN-localization. We analyzed orthologous Cu-ATPase domain sequences from diverse organisms and found that the N-terminal domain and NBD showed similar evolutionary relationships, unlike that of C-terminal domain, suggesting their co-evolution. This study for the first time correlates evolutionary stringency imparted onto Cu-ATPase domains with their significance in proper trafficking regulation.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Proteins are treated as smooth Riemannian manifolds; each residue is equipped with a localized fiber, whose environment vector encodes geometric and physico-chemical features. Motivated by Density Functional Theory--which links global electron density to reactivity--we hypothesize that a sufficiently rich local density stencil captures the same information at the residue scale. On this foundation we build a single-file Python toolkit, reactive_site_predictor.py, which ranks candidate reactive residues in both metallo- and apo-proteins. The score combines (i) a geometry-based environment term, (ii) relativistic ZORA distance factors for metal centers, (iii) coordination-number and angle-deviation corrections, and (iv) an optional pocket-proximity flag. A fixed global random seed removes all stochastic elements, guaranteeing reproducibility. Benchmarks on three representative assemblies--Rubisco, GroEL, and SecA--achieve top-10 recall between 90 and 50 percent for documented functional residues. While promising, the current validation is limited to three static PDB structures; extension to dynamic ensembles and explicit quantum layers is left to future work. The framework thus offers an interpretable, physics-grounded, and deterministic paradigm for protein-function prediction. Beyond residue-level reactivity, the same manifold-fiber formalism is ultimately intended for purely geometric analysis of protein-protein interfaces: instead of assigning scalar scores, we construct an explicit contact sub-manifold and study its curvature, topology, and fibre-overlap signatures to deduce interaction logic without additional learning.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Here we employed OTTR-seq to comprehensively profile tRNA modifications across nine archaeal species spanning diverse ecological niches, including thermophiles, methanogens, acidophiles, and halophiles.

Comparative genomic analyses revealed clear associations between modifications and evolutionary changes in enzyme domain architectures, including divergence in homologs of Trm14, Trm10, Trm11, and Trm1. We also expanded upon previously characterized identity elements in the D-stem, such as the conserved G10oU25 pair critical for Trm11 specificity, providing additional insight into determinants that likely govern enzyme-substrate interactions.

However, this system is transcriptionally silent, which has fueled questions about its true biological function. To clarify the role of this system in defense, we carried out a census of Acr proteins found in Enterobacterales and identified AcrIE9 as a potent inhibitor of the E. coli K12 Type IE CRISPR-Cas system. While sharing little sequence identity, AcrIE9 proteins from Pseudomonas and Escherichia both interact with the Cas7 subunit of the Cascade complex, thus preventing its binding to DNA.

Its creation and appreciation recruit the brain's limbic and reward systems, leading to the evocation of emotions ranging from happiness and sadness to tenderness and grief. Here, we explore the potential of music as an interventional tool in a novel neurofeedback experiment. This study introduces and validates a musical interface for real-time fMRI neurofeedback that is adaptable to various experimental paradigms. Using a previously developed motor imagery connectivity-based framework, we evaluate its feasibility and efficacy by comparing the modulation of bilateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during functional runs with real versus sham (random) feedback in 22 healthy adults. We also assess its performance against a visual feedback interface. The experiment involves a 50-minute MRI session, including anatomical scans, a PMC functional localizer run, and four neurofeedback runs (two with active feedback and two with sham feedback). Pre- and post-session questionnaires assess mood (looking at the behavioral impact of the NF session), musical background (in search of predictors of NF success), and subjective feedback experiences. During neurofeedback, participants perform motor imagery of finger-tapping, with feedback delivered as a dynamic, pre-validated chord progression that evolves or regresses based on the correlation between left and right PMC activity. We found that our implementation of music-based feedback was successful, with participants managing to modulate their own connectivity using the proposed interface. The modulation performance was similar for active and sham NF runs, possible due to the power of music to boost neuromodulation, but the network recruitment was stronger for active NF, including in the insula, putamen, and target ROIs. Behaviorally, we found a decrease in tension and an improvement in the overall mood of the participants after the session. When comparing our results to previous NF data with a visual interface, we found stronger brain activations, in particular in NF-relevant regions such as the insula and the putamen.

However, its relationship with neurochemical and cellular architecture in the brain remains poorly understood. By integrating molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we provide converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes is systematically associated with brain entropy. We found significant differences in entropy correlations between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia for the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine receptor (D1), and between normal controls and bipolar disorder for the norepinephrine transporter (NAT) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA). No significant differences were observed between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the neurotransmitter domain. In terms of cellular and metabolic features, both the normal controls vs. schizophrenia and normal controls vs. bipolar disorder comparisons revealed widespread differences associated with most mitochondrial markers, as well as glial cells and inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest disruptions in energy metabolism, neuroinflammatory activity, and inhibitory neuronal regulation in the clinical groups. Furthermore, these results indicate that brain entropy is not randomly distributed but is systematically linked to specific neurochemical systems and cellular characteristics. This systems-level perspective offers valuable insights into how the complexity of brain activity emerges from the underlying molecular architecture and how it is altered in psychiatric disorders.

West syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder marked by infantile spasms, an early symptom that typically subsides with age. However, many patients progress to other seizure forms, known as seizure evolution, which is closely linked to poor long-term outcomes. Despite its clinical significance, the neurobiological mechanisms behind seizure evolution in West syndrome remain poorly understood. Recent genetic studies have consistently identified the CYFIP2 p.Arg87Cys variant in West syndrome patients, and the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model carrying this mutation has been shown to recapitulate key symptoms of the disorder, including infantile spasms. In this study, we aimed to gain deeper insight into seizure evolution by conducting longitudinal deep phenotyping of the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model from the neonatal stage to seven months of age. We tracked seizure activity through behavioral and EEG recordings and employed multi-omic analyses, including tissue and single-cell level transcriptomics, ultrastructural analysis, proteomics, and lipidomics, to capture a comprehensive view of molecular and cellular changes. Our results showed that after an initial period of neonatal spasms, Cyfip2+/R87C mice entered a seizure-free phase, followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures in adulthood, ultimately leading to premature death. This progression was associated with synaptic remodeling, sequential activation of different glial cell types, lipid droplet accumulation in astrocytes, and significant proteomic and lipidomic changes in the brain. These findings suggest that seizure evolution in West syndrome involves complex, time-dependent interactions between neurons and glial cells, along with alterations in lipid metabolism. Our study highlights the potential of longitudinal multi-omic approaches to uncover underlying mechanisms of seizure evolution and suggests that targeting these changes could offer novel therapeutic strategies.

R.; Mastromonaco, G.; Vander Wal, E.", "abstract": "Prey must balance the energetic benefits of foraging with avoiding predation risk. This risk-reward trade-off, a cornerstone of behavioural ecology, hinges not only on realized predation risk but also on how prey perceive that risk. We often assume energetically rewarding habitats must be inherently risky because prey often increase their vigilance in these habitats or avoid them altogether. However, our assumption that these antipredator behaviours reflect perceived risk frequently goes untested. We used non-behavioural data to test our assumptions about which habitats prey perceive as risky by pairing observations of habitat use of elk (Cervus canadensis) with their physiological responses measured from faecal hormones: glucocorticoids (GC), which reflect stress from perceived risk and hunger, and triiodothyronine (T3), which increases with energy intake. Elk had lower GC and T3 in the forest, a putatively safer and poorer foraging habitat than cropland, where they produced more T3, indicating foraging. Surprisingly, GC levels were consistent in cropland, even during the daytime when human activity-and putative risk-peaked. This lack of risk responsiveness highlights that physiological responses are a nuanced integration of perceived risk and reward rather than a guaranteed outcome of habitat use. Our study challenges the assumption that high-reward habitats are inherently risky, and that safer habitats limit energy intake, revealing that the assumptions we make about habitats from a behavioural lens may not always be the reality for prey.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

We re-create two donors in vitro by integrating primary epithelium, hepatocytes and their autologous CD45+ TRI populations into a low-shear, 3D-printed MOTIVE-2 vessel that fluidically couples gut and liver compartments. Local co-culture establishes parenchyma-specific immune programs: colonic epithelia drive Th1/Th17 skewing in Donor 1 but B-cell differentiation in Donor 2.

This study investigates the impact of S4 on BC cell viability, proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Specifically, we administered a synthetic peptide inhibitor of cofilin 1 activity in vivo (PCOF). Following monocular deprivation, adult mice received either the PCOF peptide or a control peptide. Structural plasticity was assessed by quantifying dendritic spine density using Golgi-like staining, while visual plasticity was evaluated by measuring visual acuity through the optomotor response test. Our results show that, in adult mice treated with the PCOF peptide - but not in controls - monocular deprivation led to a significant reduction in dendritic spine density in the contralateral visual cortex, as well as a decrease in visual acuity of the previously deprived eye. These findings indicate that cofilin 1 activity is crucial for the regulation of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult mouse visual cortex.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Deep-projecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) serve as the first synaptic relay to the brain requiring Lrrn2 and Lrrn3a for precise axonal targeting and connectivity within the optic tectum. Genetic targeting of these CAMs leads to circuit disorganization and impairments in contrast sensitivity, leading to deficits in visually guided behaviors.

N.; Gregg, N. M.; Valencia, G. O.; In, M.-H.; Kapeller, C.; Shu, Y.; Worrell, G. A.; Miller, K. J.; Hermes, D.", "abstract": "Electrical stimulation is increasingly used to modulate brain networks for clinical purposes. The basic unit of neurostimulation, a single electrical pulse, can travel through white matter to influence connected neuronal populations. However, the mechanisms by which it influences connected populations is not well understood: stimulation may excite, inhibit, or add noise to neuronal population activity. In this study, we investigated how single pulses modulate the neuronal processing of images in a well-controlled visual paradigm. In two human subjects implanted with iEEG electrodes for clinical purposes, single pulses were delivered to electrodes in white matter tracts connected to measurement electrodes in visual cortex. Images appeared on-screen at 0, 100, or 200 ms after each pulse. Using finite impulse response modeling, we decomposed the broadband and evoked potential responses into separate components induced by electrical stimulation and by visual processing. Single pulses induced transient broadband increases followed by suppression, but they did not modulate the visual broadband responses (i.e., stimulation response was additive to visual response). In contrast, single pulses elicited prominent brain stimulation evoked potentials and they modulated the visual evoked potentials. Specifically, visual evoked potentials were larger when stimulation occurred closer to visual onset. This indicates that a single electrical pulse can increase the strength or synchrony of visual inputs. Overall, these findings suggest that the effects of electrical stimulation in the visual system are two-fold: stimulation induces additive effects on broadband power, possibly by adding noise, and it interacts with synchronous visual inputs to amplify them.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Participants judge which of two tactile stimuli, one on each hand, came first. A key finding is that TOJ performance declines when the arms are crossed, likely due to interactions between tactile, proprioceptive, and visual information. The TOJ crossing effect has been widely reported, but studies have employed various analysis methods, leaving open whether the choice of method influences the effect's magnitude. Moreover, some studies have reported modulations by the availability of visual information, response modality, or speeded response requirements. Through an exhaustive, systematic literature search, we identified 37 experiments that investigated the TOJ crossing effect. Meta-analysis estimated the effect size at approximately 1.4. The moderators did not significantly affect this estimate, though this is likely due to too few studies being available to obtain sufficient statistical power. The large effect size supports the TOJ task's use in other, e.g. developmental and clinical, research. However, the lack of statistically significant effect modulation by the moderators calls for caution when applying it for research questions beyond the crossing effect itself.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

However, the functional differences between beta localized to one brain area versus beta synchronized across brain areas remains unclear. We monitored beta bursts in non-human primates, both neurotypical and stroke-impaired, during the performance of complex motor tasks. Across both groups of animals, we identified two distinct beta burst types: global bursts that tend to be synchronized across cortical and subcortical areas, and local bursts that tend to be confined to cortex. These two types exhibited distinct neural dynamics, with global bursts linked to reduced firing variability and overall slowed movements. In contrast, local bursts often occurred during the execution of complex behaviors, particularly during prehension. We found evidence for changes in the distribution of global and local bursts during recovery after stroke. In impaired animals early after stroke, global bursts predominated and were associated with reduced speed and impaired grasping. Notably, recovery of grasping was associated with a reduction in global bursts and an increase in local bursts, suggesting that local bursts may play an important role during prehension. Our findings reveal distinct roles of global and local beta bursts and indicate that the normalization of global and local burst timing tracks recovery of dexterity.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Therefore, there is a need to identify traits that can predict seed persistence, but studies about the effects of seed size and shape on persistence yielded results varying across regions. We studied 392 species of the Pannonian flora (Central Europe) to asses (i) how seed mass and shape affect seed persistence, (ii) whether this effect is consistent across plant functional groups, and (iii) whether seed mass and shape are correlated in different functional groups? Methods We collected data on the seed mass and persistence of species and we performed measurements to calculate their Seed Shape Index, which quantifies deviation from sphericity. We analysed how seed mass and Seed Shape Index affect persistence in all herbaceous species and separately in four plant functional groups. We also tested whether and how seed mass and shape are related to each other in these groups. Key Results Across all species, both seed mass and Seed Shape Index negatively affected seed persistence. The same relationship was observed separately for perennials, short-lived species, and forbs, but only seed shape affected persistence in the graminoid group. Larger seeds also tended to be less spherical in graminoid species, in contrast to all studied species and to other functional groups, where we observed inverse or no relationship between seed mass and shape. Conclusions Consistent with many studies in other floras, both seed mass and shape negatively affected seed persistence in the Pannonian flora. However, only seed shape influenced persistence in graminoid species, suggesting that different factors may be at play in forbs and graminoids. Therefore, future studies of this relationship may need to treat and analyse graminoids separately.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

In this work, we define the distance between single-cell clusters by proposing the use of the average overlap metric to compare ranked lists of differentially expressed genes in a top-weighted manner. We first benchmark our approach in a truth-known dataset comprised of highly similar yet distinct T-cell populations and show that evaluating clusters with average overlap results in a consistent, precise, and biologically meaningful recapitulation of true cell identities. We then apply our approach to data of unsorted mouse thymocytes and characterize stages of T-cell development in the thymus, including minor populations of double-negative (CD4-CD8-) T-cells that are notoriously difficult to confidently detect in unsorted single-cell data. We demonstrate that measuring cluster similarity with average overlap of marker gene rankings enables robust, reproducible characterization of single cells and clarifies biological interpretation of their underlying identities in highly homogeneous populations.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

By tightly binding to its ectodomains, these affimers derailed binding of Fc{gamma}RIIIa to Fc portion of IgG leading to latter's degradation. This ability to decrease antibody titer suggests use of these affimers as therapeutic interventions in autoimmune conditions like immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) which is caused by autoantibodies against platelets.

Their complexes were subsequently analyzed by MD simulations at theoretical pH 7.4 (and 5.7) at 310 K. For all trajectories, we tracked two characteristic molecular descriptors of Fc{gamma}RIIIa: {theta} and {delta}, the angle and distance between the center masses of the two ectodomains, respectively.

Methods: We analyzed publicly available 3T and 7T DTI datasets (b-values = 1000 and 2000 s/mm2) from 25 young adults participating in the Human Connectome Project. Orientation-dependent transverse relaxation R2 profiles from whole brain WM were generated from T2-weighted images (b-value = 0) and characterized using a previously developed cone model based on the generalized magic angle effect (MAE). Derived anisotropic R2 or R2a values were compared between different magnetic fields. Similar comparisons were also conducted for the derived R2a values from whole brain WM and two fiber tracts, based on gradient-echo signals reported in the literature. Classical relaxation theories predict that the ratio of (R2a (7T))/R2a (3T)) will be unity or (7/3)^2 (i.e., approximately 5.4) if the measured orientation-dependent R2 arises exclusively from MAE or from the previously proposed susceptibility effect, respectively. Results: Fitted model parameters were comparable for DTI datasets with b-values of 1000 and 2000 (s/mm2). The fitted R2a increased, on average, from 3.6{+/-}1.1 (1/s) at 3T to 5.4{+/-}1.5 (1/s) at 7T for DTI datasets with a b-value=1000 s/mm2. The measured ratio of (R2a (7T))/(R2a (3T)) was thus approximately 1.5. However, based on gradient-echo signals, this ratio essentially became unity within the measurement precision. Conclusion: This study suggests that MAE is the primary mechanism for the observed orientation-dependent transverse relaxation at 3T in human brain WM, offering a different perspective from previous literature.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

However, the clinical relevance of these models has been questioned due to a mutational landscape void of driver mutations typically seen in human melanomas and a tendency to form necrotic cores at high tumor volumes. Creating the YUMM1.7 line addressed these limitations by providing an additional contextually consistent model with a more clinically relevant genetic background. The combined use of both models can generate stronger studies in melanoma immunology and immunotherapy. However, to date, there have been no direct functional comparisons of the characteristics of these two models to inform the design of such studies. To address this, we conducted a series of functional experiments to characterize the kinetics of tumor growth, chemotherapeutic sensitivity, and immunogenicity of these models. We found that the B16F0 model had faster intrinsic tumor growth rates, was more susceptible to lysis by tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, and secreted higher levels of the angiogenic factors VEGF and Ang2. Meanwhile, the YUMM1.7 model was more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment, secreted higher levels of chemokines CCL2, CXCL1, and CX3CL1, and showed higher infiltration of lymphocyte and myeloid subsets relative to tumor size. Overall, these results suggest that the YUMM1.7 model may be better suited for in vivo studies of mechanisms that require a wide window of opportunity for observation and intervention, such as immune response. However, angiogenesis and immunotherapy studies may benefit from a more in-depth comparative analyses of both models.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

To better understand the underlying resistance mechanisms to BTK inhibitors, we established an ibrutinib-resistant model from a patient-derived splenic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cell line (VL51) through prolonged drug exposure. Resistant cells exhibited a 15-fold increase in ibrutinib's IC50, along with distinct morphological changes, mitochondrial activation, and cross-resistance to covalent, non-covalent BTK inhibitors and BTK degraders. Integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses identified overexpression and secretion of IL-16 as a key feature of resistance, driven by chromatin remodeling and activation of the FLI1 transcription factor. IL-16 conferred ibrutinib resistance via CD9-mediated activation of the NF-kB and AKT signaling pathways and was found to be elevated in the serum of ibrutinib-refractory CLL patients. Functional studies showed that targeting the IL-16/CD9 axis using neutralizing antibodies or CD9-binding peptides restored sensitivity to BTK inhibitors and R-CHOP chemotherapy in MZL, mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma models.

Through screening a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library we identified MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a suppressor of CD8+ T cell mediated killing. We demonstrate that TAK1 acts as a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint by integrating signals from T cell-secreted TNF and IFNy effector cytokines to elicit a cytoprotective response. This cytoprotective response profoundly limits the anti-cancer activity these key effector molecules and completely abrogates bystander killing by perforin deficient T cells. Inhibition of the TAK1 checkpoint effectively redirects the combined TNF/IFNy pathway activation to promote inflammatory cell death via RIPK1 and Caspase-8 and simultaneously amplifies the output of the IFNy pathway, thereby priming cells for cytokine-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TAK1 deficiency led to proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, enhancing the formation of Complex II and subversion of other cytoprotective responses. Targeting the TAK1 checkpoint led to profound attenuation of tumour growth in immune competent mice, with minimal impact in immune deficient counterparts. Adoptive cell therapy led to preferential elimination of TAK1 deficient clones. Collectively, our study uncovers a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint controlled by TAK1 activity that switches TNF and IFNy responses from cytoprotective to apoptosis. Cancer cells exploit this to limit cell death in the presence of the cytotoxic lymphoctye cytokines TNF and IFN{gamma} and therapeutic intervention can fully unleash the impact of these effector molecules both on the direct target and bystander cells.

The EWS-FLI1 protein, the oncogenic driver in EwS, is a fusion of the FET protein, EWSR1, at its amino terminus, with the carboxy terminus of the transcription factor, FLI1. Since EwS cells have pronounced sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, the role of EWS-FLI1 in DNA repair is likely. Here, we demonstrate that EWS-FLI1 causes a defect in microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) repair. EWSR1 is a splicing factor that promotes the faithful splicing of the POLQ pre-mRNA, required for the expression of POL{Theta}, a critical protein in the MMEJ pathway. Expression of EWS-FLI1, or loss of EWSR1, causes exon 25 skipping of the POLQ transcript, decreased POL{Theta} protein expression, impaired MMEJ, and cellular sensitivity to inhibitors of NHEJ repair and HR repair, through the mechanism of synthetic lethality. Knockdown of EWS-FLI1 expression restores POL{Theta} mitotic foci and increases MMEJ activity.

First, we used data from a synthetic lethal screen performed in Drosophila cells to identify novel drug targets of NF1. Then, we performed statistical enrichment analysis of the screen results to identify further candidate targets that were not conserved between Drosophila and humans and could not have been found in the screen. We identified and validated hTERT as a synthetic lethal partner gene to NF1 with high potential as a therapeutic drug target, using the FDA-approved inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT). The lethal effect of AZT was validated in peripheral neurofibroma NF1-deficient human cell lines and NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells. The effect of AZT was also conserved in vivo, highlighting the translational potential; treatment of mice with AZT inhibited NF1 mutant xenograft growth to the same extent as the current clinically approved MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. Finally, we show that combined treatment with AZT and selumetinib resulted in a further synergistic reduction in NF1-deficient human cell viability. In conclusion, AZT represents a promising novel therapeutic for the treatment of NF1 tumours, either alone or in combination with selumetinib.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

To support the complementarity of these mechanisms, rare H3K27M-negative DMGs express EZHIP. Interestingly, EZHIP is one of the few genes recurrently mutated in PFA. The significance of EZHIP mutations in PFA, and whether EZHIP has wider functions in addition to repression of H3K27me3 deposition, are not known. Here, we investigated the mutational landscape of EZHIP in pediatric brain tumors. We found that EZHIP mutations occur not only in PFA, but also in rare medulloblastoma and pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG), including in H3K27-positive DMG. Contrary to current expectations, we show that mutant EZHIP is expressed in H3K27M-positive DMG. All the EZHIP-mutated HGG cases also have EGFR mutations. Further, we pursued better understanding of the function of EZHIP by expressing it in human-derived neural models. Our transcriptomic analyses indicate that EZHIP expression potentiates neuronal-like gene programs associated with synaptic function. Metabolomics data indicate that EZHIP leads to repression of methionine and polyamine metabolism, suggesting links between metabolic and epigenetic changes that are observed in PFA. Collectively, our results expand the repertoire of tumor types known to harbor EZHIP mutations and shed light on EZHIP-dependent metabolic and transcriptional programs in relevant neural models.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Despite a strong epidemiological association with age, conventional PDAC preclinical models fail to capture the histopathological and stromal complexities that emerge in older organisms. Using an age-relevant syngeneic orthotopic model, we demonstrate that organismal aging accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis. Through transcriptomic profiling, we identify a conserved extracellular matrix gene signature enriched in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from aged tumors, consistent with an augmented fibrotic landscape that supports immunosuppression, metastatic tropism, and poor prognosis. To directly test the functional impact of stromal aging, we employed heterochronic co-implantation models, revealing that revitalizing the aged tumor stroma with young CAFs restores immune infiltration and attenuates metastasis in older hosts. Conversely, aged CAFs, while immunosuppressive, fail to enhance metastasis in young hosts, suggesting that a youthful microenvironment exerts dominant regulatory control over disease progression. These findings demonstrate that stromal age is a critical modulator of both immune exclusion and metastatic behavior in PDAC. Importantly, our work establishes a new conceptual framework for understanding how aging shapes the tumor microenvironment in PDAC and opens a fertile avenue of investigation into age-specific stromal regulation. Moreover, this work raises compelling questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms, questions now accessible through our models, and lays the foundation for future efforts to therapeutically target stromal aging in PDAC.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

While MGMT promoter hypermethylation is associated with enhanced responsiveness to TMZ, additional epigenetic determinants of TMZ resistance remain largely undefined. In this study, we established TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cell lines that consistently maintained their resistant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a marked upregulation of MGMT expression in these models. To systematically investigate the epigenetic regulators governing TMZ resistance and cell survival, we conducted CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomic screens using our focused Epigenetic Knock-Out Library (EPIKOL), which targets 800 chromatin regulators alongside selected positive and negative controls. These unbiased screens validated MGMT as a primary mediator of TMZ resistance, confirming the robustness of our approach. Moreover, dropout screens across multiple resistant cell line models identified Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 4 (RBBP4) as a critical vulnerability. Notably, RBBP4 knockout significantly impaired cell proliferation without affecting MGMT expression, suggesting a distinct mechanism supporting the survival of TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells. Subsequent transcriptomic profiling following RBBP4 loss demonstrated significant downregulation of cell cycle pathways, particularly the G2/M checkpoint. Live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence analyses further revealed increased cell size and multinucleation in RBBP4-deficient cells, indicative of disrupted mitotic progression. Collectively, our results identify RBBP4 as a key regulator of cell cycle progression and survival in TMZ-resistant glioblastoma and highlight its potential as a novel epigenetic target for therapeutic intervention in recurrent disease.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Mammalian extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous in nature based on their protein content, RNA content, density, size, and functions. In contrast, our understanding of plant EV diversity is quite limited. Multiple plant EV protein markers have been identified. Two of these, TETRASPANIN 8 (TET8) and PENETRATION 1 (PEN1), appear to mark distinct subpopulations of plant EVs. To further assess the diversity of plant EV subpopulations, we purified EVs from N. benthamiana transiently expressing multiple EV marker proteins and then assessed colocalization of these markers using high resolution Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF-M). We confirmed that TET8 and PEN1 indeed mark distinct EV populations, as they colocalized only 4.7% of the time. This value was nearly identical to that found for EVs purified from transgenic Arabidopsis co-expressing these two markers, demonstrating that transient expression of Arabidopsis EV proteins in N. benthamiana can be used to assess EV subpopulations, bypassing the requirement of generating transgenic plants for every marker combination of interest. We then used the N. benthamiana system to assess colocalization of PEN1 and TET8 with the EV markers PATELLIN1 (PATL1), ANNEXIN2 (ANN2), and RPM1-INTERACTING PROTEIN4 (RIN4). PATL1 and ANN2 colocalized with PEN1 56.6% and 46.6% of the time, respectively, whereas they colocalized with TET8 only 28.4% and 30.8% of the time, respectively. In contrast to PATL1 and ANN2, the RIN4 protein colocalized with TET8 more frequently than with PEN1 (30% versus 13%). Together, these results indicate that plant EVs are heterogeneous in their protein cargos and that TET8 marks a distinct subpopulation of EVs. PEN1, PATL1, and ANN2 commonly mark the same EV population that is distinct from TET8-labeled EVs, while RIN4 more often associates with TET8-labeled EVs.

Auditors, tasked with processing extensive information under time constraints, may experience difficulties in maintaining professional scepticism, a fundamental mechanism that supports these core evaluative functions. Default nudges or pre-selected options, subtly shape choices with the premise of easing cognitive load and ultimately enhancing audit performance. This study examined how cognitive load and default nudges shape decision-making-based professional scepticism. In three online experiments, we investigated how default nudges influence professional scepticism under varying cognitive loads among auditors. Experiment 1 validated a cognitive load manipulation (minimal, low, medium, high) using reaction time and accuracy, selecting low and high load conditions for further study. Experiment 2 confirmed load-dependent reaction time increases, with audit task accuracy remaining stable. Experiment 3a tested the effect of default nudge on professional scepticism under varying levels of cognitive load, revealing that nudging accelerated responses and improved audit accuracy, but only under cognitive load. Experiment 3b explored default-setting-response alignment, showing that nudging toward considering an accounting item as \"non-aggressive\" (e.g., not indicative of fraud), the less sceptical and most common case, enhanced accuracy, whereas nudging toward considering the item \"aggressive\", reduced it. These findings highlight how cognitive load disrupts scepticism and suggest that strategically placed nudges can enhance audit decision-making based professional scepticism under pressure. Insights from this study have direct implications for high-stakes professions, where optimized decision environments could support critical judgment under cognitive strain.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we used single cell (sc)-RNA-Seq analysis of UM-hepatic stellate cell (HSC) co-cultures to demonstrate that HSCs enriched for UM cell states that expressed genes implicated in cell survival, metabolic reprogramming and angiogenesis. A lead candidate driver of HSC reprogramming was the TGF-B family member GDF15, which was associated with a metastatic UM phenotype. Silencing of BAP1 in UM cells led to increased GDF15 expression and accumulation of H3K27ac marks at the GDF15 promoter. Treatment of HSCs with GDF15 led to increased expression extracellular matrix proteins, inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, including IL-8. Both exogenous GDF15, IL-8 and conditioned media from UM-HSC co-cultures increased endothelial cell network formation in vitro, an effect that was blocked by anti-GDF15 antibodies. In multiple models of metastatic UM, silencing of GDF15 inhibited the outgrowth of metastatic lesions, associated with reduced deposition of extracellular matrix and recruitment of endothelial cells.

C.", "abstract": "Somatic mutations of Ras, encoding a small GTPase, are detected in a wide range of human cancers. Tumor genome sequencing further reveals a cancer type-dependent mutational spectrum for the Ras gene, suggesting that tissue- and allele-specific effects underlie tumorigenic activity. Although biochemical studies have characterized the GTPase activity of several Ras variants in vitro, precisely how somatic mutations of the endogenous Ras locus differentially affect tissue growth and homeostasis remain elusive. Here we engineered the endogenous Drosophila Ras locus to create a spectrum of inducible oncogenic alleles and then compared their activities in vivo. In the developing wing primordium, somatic clones carrying the oncogenic mutation Ras G12V exhibited a weak activation of downstream MAPK signaling but did not disrupt tissue architecture. However, cell clones carrying the same Ras G12V allele in the adult midgut exhibited a growth advantage and progressively took over the tissue, resulting in intestinal barrier dysfunction. In contrast, cell clones expressing a distinct allele, Ras Q61H, formed aberrant cysts that disrupted epithelial architecture and triggered local cell death. Conversely, when we induced cell clones carrying Ras Q61H in the midgut, hyper-proliferating mutant cells rapidly expanded to occupy the entire tissue. Surprisingly, this population of rapidly expanding mutant cells was eventually eliminated from the midgut, restoring wild-type cells and normal barrier function. Thus, in the midgut, Ras G12V was ultimately more deleterious than Ras Q61H due to the regression of Ras Q61H mutant cells. These results establish a new model for somatic mutagenesis at the Ras locus and illuminate a mechanistic basis for the tissue-specific effects of oncogenic Ras variants. Further, this study provides direct evidence that allele-dependent clonal dynamics may play a critical role in the tissue-selectivity of Ras oncogenic mutations.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

However, direct in vivo evidence for human SKP2 on cancer initiation and prostatic microenvironment is still lacking and a prostate-specific SKP2 humanized mouse model is critical for developing prostate cancer immunoprevention approaches through targeting human SKP2. We therefore have established a prostate-specific human SKP2 (hSKP2) knock-in mouse model by a CRISPR knock-in approach. Overexpression of hSKP2, which is driven by an endogenous mouse probasin promoter, induces prostatic lesions including hyperplasia, mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN), and low-grade carcinoma and increases prostate weights. Transcriptional profiling by RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant gene expression alterations in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix, and interferon signaling in the prostate of hSKP2 knock-in mice compared to wild-type mice. Single cell deconvolution showed an increase of fibroblasts population and a decrease of CD8+ T cell and B cell populations in the prostate of hSKP2-knock-in mice. Consistently with these results from the SKP2 humanized mouse, overexpression of hSKP2 in human prostate cancer PC3 cells markedly increased cell migration and invasion and induced the gene expression of EMT and interferon pathways, including FMOD, THY1, PFKP, USP18, IL15, etc. In addition, paired prostate organoids were derived from SKP2 humanized and wild-type mice for drug screening and validated by known SKP2 inhibitors, Flavokawain A and C1. Both of which selectively decrease the viability and alter the morphologies of organoids of hSKP2 knock-in rather than wild-type mice.

We observed strikingly divergent effects: ARA significantly promoted tumor growth, resulting in 100% tumor survival and 4-fold larger tumors compared to controls, with enhanced vascularization and invasive morphology. In contrast, DHA administration reduced tumor survival (40% versus 92% in controls) and significantly suppressed the progression of remaining tumors, with remaining DHA-treated tumors approximately 4.5-fold smaller than controls and 18-fold smaller than ARA-treated tumors. DHA-treated tumors appeared well-circumscribed with standard surrounding tissue architecture. No significant differences in body weight were observed among treatment groups, indicating the treatments were well-tolerated. These findings build upon our previous research demonstrating that ultra-high dose {omega}3 supplementation can completely block tumor formation in MYCN-driven NB. The profound tumor-suppressive effects of DHA suggest that dietary modulation of {omega}3 and {omega}6 HUFA intake may offer a complementary, low-toxicity approach to high-risk NB standard of care (SoC).

The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells.

To address this paradox, we developed novel esophageal cancer models, including a CIN-isogenic model, discovering myeloid-attracting chemokines - with the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) as a prominent hit - as conserved CIN-driven targets in EAC. Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, we quantified the extent of ongoing cGAS-activating CIN in human EAC tumors by measuring cGAS-positive micronuclei in tumor cells, validated by orthogonal whole-genome sequencing-based CIN metrics.

Ablation of FASN impeded leukemic cell growth, survival, clonogenicity in vitro, and the leukemic burden in vivo. Conditional knockout of FASN barely affected hematopoiesis but significantly attenuated the leukemic progression of MLL-AF9 transplants. By screening a library of platensimycin derivatives, we identified compound MS-C19 as a potent FASN inhibitor. Pharmacological targeting of FASN by MS-C19 suppressed leukemic cell growth and clonogenicity in clinical AML blasts. Mechanistically, both MS-C19 treatment and FASN deficiency triggered the activation of lysosomal and inflammatory gene expression. Loss of FASN led to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and subsequent lysosome-associated cell death, but not lysosome biogenesis.

Depletion of GRN significantly reversed the inhibitory effects caused by FASN knockdown.

While tumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated, its interplay with immune evasion remains poorly defined. In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq data from the GSE168204 dataset (n = 25 pre/on-treatment biopsies) comparing responders (n = 9) and non-responders (n = 16) to anti-PD-1 therapy. Using DESeq2 (|log2FC| > 1.5, padj < 0.05), we identified key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in non-responders, including chromatin remodelers SMARCA2 (log2FC = 1.63, padj = 0.005) and KAT6B (log2FC = 2.8, padj = 1.2e-08), and the inhibitory receptor FCGR2B (log2FC = 2.196, padj = 0.001). Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis highlighted EP300 and KMT2A as hub genes linking histone acetylation (GO:0000123) to extracellular matrix remodeling (KEGG:04512). Transcription factor analysis identified STAT3 and RELA as central regulators of this resistance signature. These findings suggest that non-responder melanomas coordinately upregulate chromatin modifiers and immune checkpoints, promoting immune evasion. Our results nominate EP300 and FCGR2B as potential therapeutic targets to overcome resistance, warranting preclinical validation.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Treatment with mutant-selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) results in initial tumor reduction, yet nearly all patients eventually relapse. The mechanisms driving drug resistance are incompletely understood, creating significant barriers to curing metastatic disease. We integrated clinical genomic and single-nuclei RNA (snRNA) sequencing from a cohort of 62 EGFR-mutant LUAD patients treated with the third generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib, and compared treatment-naive (TN), minimal residual disease (MRD), and progressive disease (PD) tumors. We found that disease progression is associated with a marked decrease in alveolar lineage fidelity, coincident with reduced MAPK signaling and adenocarcinoma identity. PD tumors with sustained MAPK pathway activity, such as those with EGFR or MET amplifications, tended to retain adenocarcinoma identity. In contrast, MAPK-low tumors were more likely to undergo histological transformation to squamous or neuroendocrine lineages. Remarkably, we observed rare tumor cell populations prior to treatment that were poorly differentiated, in some cases with neuroendocrine or squamous features. At progression, these histologically divergent tumor cells increased in prevalence, both in cases with overt histological transformation, and in others with sub-clinical histological plasticity. These findings suggest that pre-existing capacity for histologic plasticity may be a substrate for therapy induced selection. Taken together, our results illuminate genomically encoded MAPK signaling and lineage plasticity as complementary mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI in lung adenocarcinoma.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) limits the potency of the antitumor immune response and facilitates disease progression and metastasis. Our current study demonstrates that p38 is a druggable target in the TME that regulates the outcome of the immune-tumor interaction. The study revealed that systemic blockade of p38 reduces metastasis, and this anti-metastatic response is negated by depletion of CD8+ T cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the immune-TME showed that pharmacological p38 inhibition (p38i) or tumor-specific inactivation of p38 by CRISPR/Cas9 (p38KO) resulted in a less exhausted and more activated CD8+ T cell phenotype. Immunophenotyping analyses demonstrated that p38 blockade reduced the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors on CD8+ T cells (i.e., PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4), indicating a reversal of immune exhaustion and enhanced immune activation systemically and in the TME. In contrast, p38 blockade did not exhibit inhibitory effects on T cells in proliferation assays in vitro and did not affect the proportion of regulatory T cells in vivo. The major negative impact of p38 blockade in vivo was on the myeloid populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Further, tumor p38 activity was required for the expression of cytokines/chemokines and tumor-derived exosomes with high chemotactic capacity for myeloid cells. Altogether, this study highlights a previously unrecognized p38-driven pathway that promotes an immune suppressive TME and metastasis, and that therapeutic blockade of p38 has important implications for improving antitumor immunity and patient outcomes.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

However, which cell processes regulate the NAD+/NADH ratio is not known. Here, we find that some cancer cells elevate the NAD+/NADH ratio in response to serine deprivation by increasing mitochondrial respiration. Cancer cells that elevate mitochondrial respiration have higher serine production and proliferation in serine limiting conditions than cells with no mitochondrial respiration response, independent of serine synthesis enzyme expression. Increases in mitochondrial respiration and the NAD+/NADH ratio promote serine synthesis regardless of whether serine is environmentally limiting. Lipid deprivation can also increase the NAD+/NADH ratio via mitochondrial respiration in some cells, including cells that do not increase respiration following serine deprivation. Thus, in cancer cells where lipid depletion raises the NAD+/NADH ratio, proliferation in serine depleted environments improves when lipids are also depleted. Taken together, these data suggest that changes in mitochondrial respiration in response to nutrient deprivation can influence the NAD+/NADH ratio in a cell-specific manner to impact oxidative biomass synthesis and proliferation.

In vivo, the HSC niche is significant and might be harnessed in regenerative medicine. HSCs in various niches have exhibited their respective tropism and proliferations based on the growth factors secreted by the niche. Accordingly, in this work, we hypothesized HSCs tropism towards cancer and stem cell niche of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+, having a high relapse rate for possible cell therapy development. Our results indicate that HSC exclusive tropism towards breast cancer stem cells (CSC) and interaction with the cancer milieu lead to HSC differentiation into T-lymphocyte cells (CD4 & CD8). Moreover, the single-cell type proteomics of the migrated HSCs towards TNBC-CSCs and HER2+ cells indicated upregulation of IL-7 and Notch protein and several other upregulated proteins primarily involved in T cell activation and migration-related pathways. Likewise, the metabolomics from HSCs-derived conditioned media-treated CSCs, and HER2+ cells showed the capability of HSC-CM in arresting the growth and cell cycle of TNBC-CSC via altered mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Using linear regression, we identified genomic regions where AR occupancy is associated with the expression level of ARA-elncRNA1. We further demonstrated that this eRNA recruits AR to YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, stabilizing these interactions. A series of experiments, including RIP-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR, and EMSA, were conducted to validate the proposed model. Finally, we investigated the role of ARA-elncRNA1 in prostate cancer cells survival. Results We confirmed the sequence-specific interaction between AR and ARA-elncRNA1. This eRNA not only regulates AR occupancy at the promoters of several AR-dependent genes but also protects AR from proteasomal degradation. The AR:ARA-elncRNA1 complex interacts with YY1 and influences enhancer-promoter looping. Additionally, ARA-elncRNA1 was found to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and expression level of lncRNA was associated with a lower Gleason score.

In this study, a systems biology approach was employed to investigate how the interplay between passive, myogenic, neurogenic, and astrocytic responses shapes arteriolar vasodynamics in small rodents. A model of neurovascular coupling is proposed in which neurons inhibit and dampen the myogenic response to promote vasodilation during activation, and facilitate the myogenic response to promote rapid vasoconstriction immediately post-activation. In this model, inhibition of the myogenic response is mediated by the hyperpolarization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Dampening and facilitation of the response are mediated by neuronal production of nitric oxide and release of neuropeptide Y, respectively. We also introduce a model for gliovascular coupling, in which astrocytes periodically inhibit the myogenic response upon detecting an increase in myogenic activity through interactions between their endfeet and arterioles. Our study revealed that in the resting state, the interplay between the delayed myogenic response and passive distension, acting as negative and positive feedbacks respectively, generates undamped oscillations in vessel diameter, known as vasomotion. In the active state, these oscillations are disrupted by the neurogenic and astrocytic responses.

Their strict vertical transmission greatly reduces their effective population size, making selection less efficient and driving a pattern of molecular evolution where genome size reduces. Contrastingly, there are sporadic observations of genome expansion in symbionts from clades where the genome has previously reduced in size. It is currently unclear whether these events are an idiosyncratic consequence of exposure to novel active mobile elements, or are driven by the host context. In this paper, we report the concerted genome expansion of two co-infecting heritable symbionts that supports a host-related driver of expansion. We assembled the genomes of Spiroplasma and Rickettsia bacteria that co-infect the lacewing Mallada desjardinsi. Both symbionts had the largest genome reported to date in their clade, approximately twice the median size for their respective genus. Genome expansion was driven by proliferation of mobile elements in both cases, but the underpinning elements were distinct. The observation that the proximate causes of expansion differed between symbionts led us to reject the hypothesis that concerted expansion was driven by a common mobile element invasion. We hypothesize these processes are driven either by bottleneck events impacting host population size, by the host environment causing stress-induced activation of mobile genetic elements, or by both symbionts having undergone a recent and coincident transition to vertical transmission.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Rather than simply reduce firing rate, adaptation may help neurons form better (i.e. more discriminable) representations of sensory input. To study effects of adaptation in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), we recorded single unit LTMR responses to 30-second-long vibrotactile stimuli with different intensities and frequencies applied to the hind paw of rats. To assess the impact of adaptation on somatosensory encoding, decoders were applied to the initial and late (adapted) phases of population-level responses to assess the decodability (discrimination) of stimulus intensity and frequency. Adaptation-mediated changes in the rate and timing (phase-locking) of spikes were quantified. Rate coding of stimulus intensity was improved by the nonuniform reduction in firing rate across responses to different stimuli, and across neurons. This improvement was absent in simulations with uniform reductions in firing rate, thus revealing the necessity of stimulus-dependent variability in adaptation effects. Spike timing (quantified as interspike intervals) remained highly informative about stimulus frequency throughout stimulation despite the progressive reduction in spike count over time. When the drop in spike count was accounted for, adaptation was found to improve temporal coding of stimulus frequency by increasing the precision of phase-locking. In other words, adaptation improved the precision of spike timing, and this increased the information about stimulus frequency conveyed by each spike. These results show that adaptation, by modulating spiking in different ways, can improve encoding of different stimulus features using different coding schemes.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

More than a million species of nematodes are expected to occur on Earth. However, only around 28,000 have been described to date. Nematode phylogenetics remains challenging due to their small size, morphological simplicity, and cryptic diversity. Traditional morphological and molecular approaches, such as single-locus markers (e.g., 18S rRNA, COI), often lack resolution, particularly at shallow evolutionary scales. Moreover, morphology-based classifications are flawed, and phylogenies inferred from single-locus data often fail to resolve deep branching relationships within the nematode phylogenetic tree. These limitations highlight the need for more comprehensive genomic approaches to achieve higher-resolution evolutionary inferences. Here, we design and test the first ultraconserved elements (UCEs) probe set for two nematode families: Panagrolaimidae and Rhabditidae. This approach captures thousands of loci without requiring whole-genome or transcriptome sequencing. Our probe sets targeted 1612 and 100397 UCE loci for Panagrolaimidae and Rhabditidae, respectively. In vivo testing for Panagrolaimidae captured up to 1457 loci, enabling a robust phylogenetic reconstruction. Genera classifications within Panagrolaimidae were congruent with prior phylogenies, except for one strain, which we here redescribe as Neocephalobus halophilus BSS8, based on morphological and molecular evidence. We applied machine learning classifiers to determine the minimum loci required for genus-level classification. For the Rhabditidae family, benchmarking of machine learning models revealed that XGBoost provided the highest accuracy for genus-level classification, with 46 loci as the most informative. For Panagrolaimidae, despite the availability of extensive laboratory isolates, genomic resources are limited. We identified 63 loci as the most informative for the classification of this family.

Here, we address why, to function optimally, Osh6 must bind to Ist2, an ER-resident lipid scramblase able to connect the ER to the PM via an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We determined in vitro that Osh6 binds to the Ist2 IDR with micromolar affinity, whether empty or bound to its lipid ligands. Moreover, we found that Osh6 efficiently transfers PS at ER-PM contact sites if the Ist2 IDR has a minimal length and its binding site in the IDR is sufficiently removed from the ER surface. Next, we reconstituted the Osh6:Ist2 complex within artificial ER-PM contact sites and demonstrated that the association of Osh6 with Ist2 allows for a fast and directed PS flux between the connected membranes. We identified the Ist2 binding site on the Osh6 surface by validating structural models using our functional assays. Finally, we found that the Osh6-mediated PS transfer can be coupled to the PS scramblase activity of Ist2. These data unveil new functional partnerships between an LTP and a membrane tethering/scramblase protein and point to the general advantage of localizing these processes to membrane contact sites to ensure their efficiency.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Consequently, extensive research has focused on identifying inhibitors, particularly short peptides, capable of targeting hIAPP and disrupting its amyloidogenic process, offering potential therapeutic strategies to prevent or slow T2D progression. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the anti-amyloidogenic peptide QBP1 in blocking the critical conformational transition to {beta}-structure experienced by the hIAPP monomer, thereby in preventing amyloidogenesis and in reducing the cytotoxicity associated with its amyloid forms. First, we evaluated the anti-amyloidogenic effects of QBP1 through an in vitro aggregation methods, including a Thioflavin-T binding assay, dot blotting using the oligomer-specific A11 and fibril-specific OC antibodies, and negative staining electron microscopy. To assess its cytoprotective potential of QBP1 on hIAPP-induced toxicity, we examined its effects when fused to a protein transduction domain (penetratin) in INS-1E pancreatic {beta}-cells, using viability assays and transcriptome analysis. Our results demonstrate that QBP1 effectively halts the formation of early toxic hIAPP intermediates, preventing amyloid progression and preserving {beta}-cell viability and function. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that QBP1 stabilizes amylin through strong van der Waals interactions and {pi}-H bonds at hydrophobic and aromatic residues (i.e., W, F), forming a stable binding network that prevents aggregation. Binding free energy analysis confirmed its high affinity, driven by favourable non-polar solvation energy and optimized structural complementarity.

In this study, we focused on a new culture system incorporating a three-dimensional (3D) culture method using a liquid medium containing the low-molecular-weight agar polymer LA717 in low-adhesion culture vessels. We initially confirmed conditions for the efficient high-density 3D culture of normal cells using LA717-supplemented medium in low-adhesion 96-well plates. Using human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) as a normal cell model and HeLa cells as a transformed cell model, we demonstrated that the new 3D culture system effectively maintained the dispersion of MSCs and prevented their aggregation, while transformed HeLa cells exhibited robust anchorage independence, thereby establishing the new liquid/low-molecular-weight agar colony formation (LACF) method as an alternative to SACF. Finally, by systematizing the digital analysis system for the LACF assay (D-LACF assay), which streamlines the overall workflow from the performance evaluation of the test method to product testing and result interpretation, the limitations of the conventional soft agar-based D-SACF assay were addressed and its practicality and utility were enhanced. This in vitro evaluation system is expected to provide a promising approach for improving the quality and safety of hCTPs.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we use lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems based on clinically approved formulations for the efficient intracellular delivery of mRNAs encoding for intrabodies targeting mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), key mediators of the necrotic cell death modalities, necroptosis and pyroptosis, respectively. LNP delivery of intrabody mRNA resulted in robust protein expression, with a MLKL binding intrabody preventing MLKL membrane translocation and protecting against necroptotic cell death. Similarly, LNP delivery of a bivalent intrabody targeting the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC protected against NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome-driven responses, including caspase-1 and IL-1beta activation and gasdermin D-driven pyroptotic killing. These findings establish that LNPs harbouring anti-necrotic intrabody mRNAs allow for sufficient intracellular expression to neutralize necrotic cell death signalling and provide a general, clinically relevant, strategy for delivering therapeutic intrabodies into cells.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

This discrepancy leads to substantial technical and biological differences between GEX and scRNA-Seq datasets, making it difficult to integrate data and perform downstream tasks like cell-type classification. To address this challenge, we introduce GENESIS (Gene Expression Normalisation and Enhancement for Single-cell Integrated Sequencing), a novel computational framework designed to transform GEX data from Multiome experiments into enhanced, scRNA-Seq like profiles. Utilising advanced generative models--including Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and a tailored VAE UNet architecture--GENESIS can generate high-quality data by modelling and compensating for the inherent differences between nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA.

In mosquitoes and other insects, the olfactory system detects environmental odors primarily through a diverse repertoire of tuning odorant receptors (ORs), which require the highly conserved odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) to function. While Orco's role in enabling tuning receptor function is well established, its cellular localization patterns, developmental expression dynamics, and system-wide impact on olfactory physiology and behavior remain understudied in Ae. albopictus. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged the Q-system to systematically characterize Orco-expressing neurons (ORNs) across embryonic, larval, pupal and adult stages of Ae. albopictus. We uncovered a dramatic reorganization of the olfactory system during metamorphosis: ORNs were observed as early as the embryonic stage and expanded during larval development before rapid degeneration and re-generation in the pupal stage resulting in the final population of adult ORNs. Orco expression in adults spanned the olfactory neurons of the antennae, labella, and maxillary palps in both male and female mosquitoes, consistent with its conserved peripheral distribution. To further investigate the functional implications of Orco, we generate Orco knockout mutants and strikingly discovered that Orco knockout mutants displayed significant widespread downregulation of tuning Ors, suggesting that Orco may influence OR expression or stability. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed significantly attenuated responses to human volatiles in Orco mutants, and behavioral assays demonstrated a marked decline in blood-feeding efficiency and elimination of host preference in females. Together, these findings reveal dynamic reorganization of ORNs during mosquito development and uncover the critical role of Orco in maintaining the integrity and function of the olfactory system, providing insights which may inform novel, next-generation vector control strategies.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Methods and Results We investigated the role of NT5DC2 for MAO A activity in PC12D cells. Western blot analysis revealed that NT5DC2 primarily binds to the non-phosphorylated form of MAO A. siRNA-mediated NT5DC2 downregulation reduced MAO A activity, leading to decreased dopamine metabolism and increased noradrenaline synthesis.

RGCs vary considerably between species, and small model organisms display distinct RGC innervation patterns from that in humans. There is thus a need for robust models of human RGC circuit formation that preserves innervation specificity. Here, we developed an in vitro microfluidics eye-to-brain connectivity model using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs to assess brain region-specific connectivity features. We find that cultured human RGCs segregate their dendrites and axons and display axonal features that align with that of their in vivo human RGC counterparts. The addition of region-specific brain targets to human RGC axons terminals resulted in differential RGC connectivity with distinct retinorecipient brain regions. Increased synapse formation occurred between RGCs and lateral geniculate neurons relative to that with superchiasmatic nucleus neurons, mirroring in vivo innervation differences. Both retinorecipient partners induced the formation of more synapses relative to non-retinorecipient brain target controls. These results suggest that human RGC innervation properties are preserved in culture systems and that human RGCs can differentially sense and respond to retinorecipient targets to control wiring outcomes. These systems may aid in the discovery of human-specific wiring factors for potential therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Addressing these questions has direct relevance to our understanding of food choice behaviour and how it may be modified in dietary interventions. We screened N=99 healthy adults to select a sample (N=27, M[SD]age = 24.25[2.94] years) who reported similar perceptual experiences of sugar and sweetener, thus removing a potential confound of sensory differences, for fMRI scanning. While scanning, they received sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages in two conditioning paradigms, which both manipulated participants expectation of flavour delivery: first in a probabilistic and second in a deterministic way. Participants ability to accurately distinguish sugar from non-nutritive sweetener depended largely on their expectations, which also significantly affected the perceived pleasantness of each flavour. Expectation altered brain responses to flavour delivery during the deterministic task only, where the (mistaken) expectation of sugar significantly increased midbrain responses to sweetener compared to when sweetener was expected. Trial-wise confidence and pleasantness ratings differentially augmented brain responses to sugar and sweetener delivery. These results highlight the importance of expectancy in both the behavioural and neural encoding of sweet flavour, particularly in the context of unreliable sensory information.

Preclinical proof-of-concept studies and clinical case reports in salvage therapy settings suggested a benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in IPM management.

Here, we performed sequential nCounter-based transcriptomics on lung tissue of cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice with IPM (Rhizopus arrhizus infection) to dynamically study the pulmonary immune environment. Within 7 days after infection, lungs of mice with IPM showed reversal of early proinflammatory signaling, impaired T-cell signaling, and upregulation of exhaustion markers. Similar immune paralysis signatures were seen in mice with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and fusariosis. For therapeutic studies, Mucorales-active antifungal therapy with isavuconazonium sulfate (ISAV) was initiated on day 3 after IPM infection, along with anti-PD-L1 or a non-targeting isotype antibody (control) given either on days 3+5 (early) or days 6+8 (late). Both early and late adjunct anti-PD-L1 therapy were well-tolerated and significantly improved morbidity/mortality outcomes compared to ISAV + isotype. Notably, early adjunct anti-PD-L1 therapy promoted significantly stronger innate immune cell activation, upregulation of key cytokine pathways, reinvigoration of T-helper-cell signaling, and reversal of IPM-induced exhaustion signals than both late adjunct anti-PD-L1 and isotype control. These findings indicate that combined antifungal and early immunomodulatory therapy may be an important strategy to intercept immune paralysis and improve outcomes in immunocompromised hosts with IPM, inviting further preclinical and clinical exploration of early host-directed interventions to treat deadly mold pneumonias.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Our analyses revealed the conserved, cell type-specific sequestration of untranslated RNAs encoding key cell fate regulators. Notably, P-body contents did not directly reflect active gene expression profiles for a given cell type, but rather were enriched for translationally repressed transcripts characteristic of the preceding developmental stage. Mechanistically, microRNAs (miRNAs) direct the selective sequestration of RNAs into P-bodies in a context-dependent manner, and perturbing AGO2 or alternative polyadenylation profoundly reshapes P-body RNA content. Building on these mechanistic insights, we demonstrate that modulating P-body assembly or miRNA activity dramatically enhances both activation of a totipotency transcriptional program in naive pluripotent stem cells as well as the programming of primed human embryonic cells towards the germ cell lineage.

In this study, we investigated the evolutionary responses of Escherichia coli when exposed to the flagellotropic phage {chi}. Using an experimental evolution approach, E. coli cells were repeatedly subjected to environments rich in phage {chi} but selective for motility. Unlike traditional well-mixed cultures, we employed swim-plate assays to simulate spatial confinement and promote motility. Whole genome sequencing of evolved populations revealed early emergence of non-motile, {chi}-resistant mutants with mutations disrupting motility-related genes. Motile mutants emerged in later passages, possessing mutations in the flagellin gene fliC. Swim-plate assays showed a diverse range of motility among these mutants, with some displaying slower, and others faster, expansion speeds compared to the ancestral strain. Single-cell tracking experiments indicated an increased tumble bias in {chi}-resistant mutants, suggesting an adaptive response involving altered flagellar rotation.

In such settings, evolutionary processes can result in the loss of biosynthetic pathways, leading to dependencies among strains. The Black Queen Hypothesis suggests that these gene losses reduce metabolic burden, potentially conferring a fitness advantage. However, how these dependencies evolve at the level of individual cells remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an experimental system that enables direct observation of the first steps in the evolution of metabolic dependencies at single-cell resolution. Using a microfluidic setup combined with live-cell microscopy, we tracked the fate of individual amino acid auxotrophic mutant cells - deficient in methionine, tryptophan, or proline biosynthesis - within spatially structured Escherichia coli wildtype populations. When amino acids were externally supplied, auxotrophs grew faster than wildtype cells, Without external supply of amino acids, they grew significantly slower. When auxotrophs formed cell clusters, local depletion of amino acids further diminished their growth rates as well as the growth of neighbouring wildtype cells. Our mathematical model indicates that auxotroph growth is strongly constrained by the low rate of amino acid leakage from wildtype neighbors, conferring an advantage only once leakage surpasses a critical threshold. Overall, our findings show that the benefits of gene loss are highly context-dependent. Through single-cell experiments and modeling, we shed light on the early evolution of metabolic dependency and the trade-offs between reducing metabolic costs and maintaining metabolic autonomy in microbial communities.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Our analyses identified a robust bias for terminal deletions of the right arm of Chr7 (Chr7R) associated with unbalanced translocations. This bias was observed at approximately constant strength across all three sites where the amplification reporter cassette was inserted, in CNV-carrying yeast clones derived both spontaneously and from mutagen-induced recombinogenic conditions. We conducted allelic mitotic recombination experiments to investigate the possibility of the presence of a fragile site on Chr7R, but the results disfavored this model, and instead indicated that the Chr7R bias applies only to non-allelic rearrangements. We validated the existence of a CNV formation bias at Chr7R through an orthologous NAHR competition approach that was independent of selection for FA+Cu resistance. Finally, we showed the in contrast to its high participation in NAHR as a recipient sequence, Chr7R becomes amplified as a translocation donor less frequently than other comparable regions of the genome. To begin unraveling the cause of this unusual behavior, we evaluated the effect of a set of candidate genes involved in chromatin mobility and sister chromatid cohesion on the rearrangement spectra involving Chr7R. We found that deletion mutations in some of these genes, particularly SAP30, attenuated the biased NAHR behavior. Taken together, our results suggested that although Chr7R is not inherently more prone to DNA breakage than other regions, once a DNA lesion is formed there, it has a higher propensity to undergo inappropriate repair leading to a chromosomal rearrangement.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The families Podosporaceae and Sordariaceae contain relatively low genome-wide levels of CUB, while the highest levels of CUB are found in Chaetomiaceae and the \"BLLNS\"-group, a monophyletic group of five other Sordariales families. Based on genomic clustering, and ancestral state reconstruction of GC nucleotides at the third codon position, we hypothesize that Podosporaceae and Sordariaceae represent the ancestral state of amino acid composition and CUB. The Chaetomiaceae and BLLNS have most likely diverged from this state, with increased natural selection driving use of specific codons, resulting in higher genome-wide CUB. We expect that the higher levels of CUB in Chaetomiaceae genomes might have been caused by ecological niche specialization, including high optimal growth temperature of some Chaetomiaceae species.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Interestingly, the crucial amino acid residues (tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan) responsible for BLUF photocycle and photodynamics are evolutionarily replaced by phenylalanine (Y5F), asparagine (H27N) and alanine (W87A) residues, respectively. In present communication, we have studied the impact of this evolutionary plasticity on the BLUF photodynamics and associated endonuclease activity. The results obtained showed that the evolutionary plasticity in the BLUF domain influenced various functional aspects of BLUF domain including FAD binding, domain stability, recovery kinetics, and spectral characteristics. The impact of amino acid plasticity on the C-terminal endonuclease (EndoIII) domain was also studied. The evolutionary plasticity induced changes in the flavin binding pocket of the BLUF domain elevated the light-gated endonuclease activity associated with EndoIII domain. The molecular docking analysis and spectroscopic studies also confirmed the substrate-binding ability of the BLUF-EndoIII. The elevated endonuclease activity suggested that the amino acid residues, which are crucial for BLUF photocycle are indeed dispensable and there might exists another electron transfer pathway for BLUF domain activation and regulation of associated endonuclease domain. Considering the role of endonucleases in bacterial defense, the understanding of the BLUF photodynamics, mechanism of signal transfer to the downstream endonuclease domain and associated endonuclease activity might elucidate the first naturally occurring light-gated endonuclease in bacterial system.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

However, its robustness against pre-analytical variation has not been sufficiently characterized. Here, we systematically evaluate five plasma proteomics workflows, including three bead-based methods and two conventional protocols, using controlled spike-ins of low-abundance proteins and defined cellular contaminants. We find that bead-based approaches enhance detection of low-abundance proteins but can be highly susceptible to systematic bias from platelet and PBMC contamination, even at low levels. This can easily inflate results by thousands of proteins, likely accounting for some of the very high literature-reported numbers. In contrast, a perchloric acid-based workflow shows notable resistance to erythrocyte and platelet-derived interference. We further investigate how centrifugation conditions, anticoagulant choice, and buffer-bead combinations modulate contamination profiles and demonstrate that bias can be partially mitigated by optimized sample handling. In total, we identify more than 13,000 protein groups from various conditions, including cellular components from the circulating proteome. Our results provide a quantitative framework for assessing workflow performance under variable sample quality and offer guidance for both biomarker discovery and quality control in clinical proteomics studies.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

To minimize unwanted responses from the host immune system, several decellularization treatments have been proposed. Effective treatments should aim at avoiding the deterioration of the physical and mechanical properties of the implanted tissue. In this work, we carried out a mechanical characterization of FL specimens from human dead donors, both in their native-physiological condition and upon decellularization with three commonly used detergents, t-octyl-phenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP). Uniaxial tensile tests were used to characterize the elastic stiffness and ultimate stresses of the tissue, and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was applied to monitor the strain evolutions and meso-mechanical deformation responses. None of the investigated decellularization protocols was found to lead to a significant deterioration of the FL mechanical properties, suggesting the applicability of these chemical treatments for graft preparation and usage in the clinical practice. The application of DIC also allowed us to get a first estimate of the FL Poisson ratio as well as to draw the attention on the inhomogeneity of strain distributions, suggesting that the use of average engineering strains can lead to an oversimplification of the actual deformation field.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Existing models often fail to leverage such feature dependencies during inference, limiting their ability to model complex biological systems. We present a Bayesian group factor analysis transfer learning framework that supports multitask, multi-modal learning. Our approach learns a shared latent space within each domain, simultaneously across multiple domains, and uses a feature-wise prior to model complex relationships. We evaluate our framework using controlled synthetic data experiments and four disjoint patient cancer datasets from acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. We show that our method improves drug response prediction and more readily recapitulates consensus biomarkers of drug response.

Although some methods developed in previous studies are available for large-scale data, they do not consider evolutionary times or gene gain/loss are not counted properly. Moreover, the results can be altered just by rotating the phylogenetic tree. Results: We proposed two new phylogenetic methods, Ancestral State Adjustment (ASA) and Simultaneous EVolution test (SEV), which consider the ancestral state of gene presence/absence to evaluate the evolution of ortholog groups (OGs) more properly and guarantee the robustness of the results. In evaluations using three distinct prokaryotic datasets, ASA and SEV showed better performance than methods previously proposed for large-scale data. We compared the functionally related genes detected by each method and found that SEV and its predecessor can identify slowly evolving genes, such as housekeeping genes. In contrast, ASA and its predecessors can detect functionally related genes that tend to be gained or lost in a fixed-order, indicating a strong evolutionary constraint that provides clues for functional prediction. Using matrix multiplication, we showed that SEV is scalable in the latest genome databases.

Here, we evaluated the acute synaptic effects of three structurally distinct OGAi (ceperognastat, ASN90, and MK8719) in mouse hippocampal slices. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that all three compounds impaired both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by reduced paired-pulse facilitation/depression and suppressed long-term potentiation. Immunohistochemistry showed altered synaptic protein levels, with increased PSD-95 and reduced Synaptophysin 1 in neurons, alongside a biphasic shift in Tau phosphorylation.

Polymyxin B (PMB) based combination therapy is considered as a best alternative treatment for those middle and low-income countries that cannot access to the latest medicines. Its crucial to know both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of a pathogen to understand the killing effect of each drug and its combinations. Hence, our objective of this study was to incorporate mechanistic insights gained from resistance mechanisms to develop a mechanism based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model (MBM). Six clinical CRKP isolates were used for static concentration time kill (SCTK) assays to evaluate the rate and extent of killing by monotherapy, double and triple combinations using PMB, meropenem and fosfomycin. A MBM was developed using the SCTK data in S-ADAPT. The MBM estimated lower maximum killing rate constant of PMB (3.61 h-1) in an isolate with non-functional MgrB and high-level phenotypic resistance. Based upon model discrimination and PMBs outer membrane disruption, mechanistic synergy was included in 3 isolates which has porin mutations. Mechanistic synergy of PMB was 83-88% with meropenem and 81-98% with fosfomycin. The PMB concentration required to achieve 50% of synergy was 0.48-0.64 mg/L. Simulations with a lower PMB regimen (1mg/kg q12h) and fosfomycin (8g q8h) showed >73% reduction in area under the bacterial load-versus-time curve for four isolates. The triple combination showed 67.7% reduction in non-carbapenamase producing isolate.

Here, we provide experimental evidence for stochastic tuning in human cells adapting to the lethal chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. As in yeast, the tuning process is not driven by mutations and is reversible upon removal of methotrexate challenge.

Here, we evaluate the scanning DIA approach combined with ion trapping via the Zeno trap in a method termed ZT Scan DIA, using a prototype Zeno trap Q-TOF instrument (SCIEX). Applying this method to established proteome standards across various analytical setups, enabling intermediate to high sample throughput, we observed a 30 to 40% increase in identified precursors. This enhancement extended to overall protein identification and precise quantification. Furthermore, ZT Scan DIA effectively eliminated quantitative bias, as demonstrated by its ability to deconvolute proteomes in multi-species mixtures.

Sensing of CVB3 RNA by melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA5) induces a Type 1 Interferon (T1IFN) response that is critical for reducing viral replication and dissemination within cells and the host. The cytosolic nucleotide oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), however, has been implicated in a proviral role in CVB3-induced myocarditis, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Because NOD2 is especially important in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and CVB3 is an enteric virus that initially infects the intestinal tract leading to virus dissemination to other tissues, we sought to determine whether NOD2 expressed in IECs would impact CVB3 infection. Here, we demonstrate that IEC NOD2 promotes CVB3 replication. Replication of a related Enterovirus, poliovirus, was also enhanced by NOD2. We discovered that NOD2-/- IECs have increased T1IFNs and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression, including IFIH1, the gene encoding for MDA5. Replication of CVB3 was rescued when MDA5 expression was reduced in NOD2-/- IECs. CVB3 replication was further increased, and the T1IFN response reduced, in NOD2+/+ IECs treated with the mitophagy inducer carbonyl cyanide m-chlorphenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Mitophagy induction in NOD2-/- IECs, however, had no effect on CVB3 replication, or the T1IFN response, suggesting a role for NOD2 in mitophagy. Overall, our data demonstrate that NOD2 promotes CVB3 replication in IECs by suppressing T1IFN expression and MDA5 activation via NOD2-mediated mitophagy. Since T1IFN restricts enteroviruses in vivo, CVB3 and other enteroviruses might exploit NOD2 activation in the intestinal tract to evade antiviral T1IFN responses. This evasion could enhance their replication in the intestine and promote their spread to other organs, potentially leading to diseases in the pancreas, heart, and central nervous system.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

As these isolates were genetically distinct beyond capsule-encoding genes, the exact relationship between transformation and capsule remains unclear. Herein, we compared the transformability of a collection of isogenic capsule-switch strains. Strains with different capsule types and amounts significantly differed in their transformation frequency, with the unencapsulated strain having a higher frequency compared to encapsulated strains. A GFP-reporter of each strain monitoring the expression of a Com regulon-controlled gene showed similar kinetics, indicating differences in transformability were due to processes downstream of competence activation. The Com pilus, induced by competence, binds and takes in the donor DNA, and is the central component of the transformation apparatus. The surface exposure of Com pilus significantly differed among serotypes with highly transformable strains having more cells binding ComGC antibody. Further, electron microscopy demonstrated that transformability correlated with the proportion of cells bearing a Com pilus, which was affected by both the presence of capsule and serotype. Additionally, the unencapsulated strain displayed longer pili than encapsulated strains. Examination of capsule porosity revealed that serotypes with higher transformation frequencies had more porous capsules. Together, these results indicate that the capsule interferes with the assembly of Com pilus, thereby inhibiting the natural transformation of Spn.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Lower production means that millions of people are losing out on potential food, income and livelihoods. Rebuilding these stocks to maximize sustainable production can contribute towards ending hunger and malnutrition but requires active and effective fisheries management. Yet, for fish stock recovery plans to be implemented, recovery benefits, targets and timeframes need to be quantified. Here, using 1211 individual reef sites and 23 jurisdictions identified globally as being below maximum sustainable production levels, we show that reefs have the potential to increase sustainable yields by nearly 50% if allowed to recover towards their maximum production levels. For individual jurisdictions this recovery represents from 20,000 up to 162 million additional sustainable servings of reef fish per year in comparison to current sustainable production, meeting recommended seafood intake for up to 1. 4 million additional people a year. However, such growth and food provisioning will require fish stocks to double their standing biomass (increase by a median of 32 t/km2). Recovery timeframes range from 6.4 years under the most stringent scenario (a seascape moratorium) to 49.7 years under the maximum harvest scenario that results in recovery. We find that locations with the greatest potential for sustainable gains in yield are among those with the greatest food and micronutrient deficiencies, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in recovering fish assemblages to achieve their maximum sustainable potential.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

High-resolution profiling to delineate cellular diversity revealed a largely conserved set of cell types across four species, with minimal evolutionary gain or loss and potentially more prevalent changes in cell type abundance. In-depth comparisons between D. melanogaster and D. yakuba showed that transcriptomic conservation and differentially expressed genes between species are highly cell-type-specific, suggesting that cell types evolve as highly independent units. We identified widespread species differences in gene expression, particularly in the neuromodulatory signaling pathway, while preserving a conserved circuit layout in sexual identity and neurotransmitter properties. We further generated a female dataset in D. melanogaster to define sex differences in cell types and examine species divergence in relation to sex differences.

A previously optimized E. coli chassis capable of efficiently de novo producing naringenin was used to evaluate eleven prenyltransferases (PTs) for the production of PN compounds. As PT reaction requires dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) as extended substrate that has limited availability inside the cells, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 12a (Cas12a) (CRISPR-Cas12a) was used to construct ten boosted DMAPP-E. coli strains. All the PTs, in combination with the naringenin biosynthetic pathway, were tested in these strains. Experiments in 96-well deep well plates identified twelve strains capable of producing PN.

Pathogenic variants in GRIN2A gene, encoding the NMDAR GluN2A subunit, can cause gain or loss of function of receptors containing the affected subunit, and are associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in patients. While in-vitro studies of recombinant receptors have yielded some insights, animal experimental models are essential to better understand the relationship between the molecular pathology of the variants and the disease. Here we introduce a zebrafish model of GluN2A loss of function to study system-level effects of zebrafish grin2Aa and grin2Ab gene deletion. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between receptors containing zebrafish GluN2Aa/b and GluN2Bb paralogs comparable to mammalian receptors containing GluN2A vs. GluN2B subunits. Both grin2Aa-/- and grin2Ab-/-, as well as double-knockout grin2A-/- zebrafish larvae showed increased locomotor activity in a novel environment. Proteomic analysis suggested that the relative proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs may be increased in grin2A mutant fish. Our results highlight fundamental similarities between zebrafish and mammalian NMDAR signaling and validate the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the neurodevelopmental role of NMDARs. The newly created transgenic zebrafish strains complement the rodent models of GluN2A loss of function and can be used for high-throughput testing of pharmacological or genetic treatment strategies for patients with GRIN2A gene variants.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

These disorders, like frontotemporal dementia (FTD-Tau), currently lack effective therapies and can occur sporadically or be inherited when associated with MAPT gene mutations. The MAPT gene region encompassing exon 10 and adjacent introns is a hotspot for pathogenic variants, including splicing mutations that enhance exon 10 inclusion and increase 4R tau expression, and gain-of-function mutations that generate aggregation-prone mutant 4R tau protein. For these 4R-specific tauopathies, a targeted mRNA splicing approach that promotes exon 10 exclusion may offer therapeutic benefit. In this study, we discovered novel splicing modulator compounds (SMCs) that promote MAPT exon 10 exclusion, and demonstrated their efficacy in FTD patient-derived neuronal models carrying the tau-P301L gain-of-function mutation or the tau-S305N splicing mutation. Treatment with SMC reduced 4R tau expression and decreased the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), oligomeric and insoluble tau, thereby rescuing tau-associated neuronal toxicity. Importantly, our lead SMC corrected the 3R/4R splice ratio in vivo and significantly reduced pTau in the brain of a gene-replacement (GR) mouse model expressing the human tau-N279K splicing mutation. These findings support the therapeutic potential of this class of small molecules and establish MAPT pre-mRNA splicing modulation as a promising strategy for the treatment of 4R tauopathies.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The parasite secretes immunomodulatory substances, and its protoscolex proteins (PSCs) have been identified as potential diagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates. Although transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches have been employed to investigate echinococcosis, the impact of PSCs on the functionality of host immune cells and the expression of immunomodulatory-related genes remains largely unexplored. Methods In this study, immunofluorescence analysis was employed to determine the binding of PSCs to lymphocytes. The CCK-8 assay was utilized to evaluate the impact of varying concentrations of PSCs on cell viability, while ELISA was performed to quantify the levels of cytokines such as IL-9 and IL-4. Furthermore, by integrating LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics and RNA-Seq-based transcriptomics technologies, a systematic analysis was conducted to investigate the metabolic reprogramming and differential gene expression in lymphocytes following PSCs treatment, thereby elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its immune regulatory effects. Results PSCs proteins inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, promoted IL-9 secretion at low concentrations, enhanced IL-4 expression at medium concentrations, and continuously up-regulated TGF-{beta} with increasing concentrations. Transcriptomic analysis identified 1,840 differentially expressed genes (991 up-regulated and 849 down-regulated), and KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted metabolic pathways, including phenylalanine metabolism. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the functions of these genes were primarily associated with immunometabolic reprogramming and regulation of the intestinal barrier. Metabonomic profiling detected 12 significantly altered metabolites (8 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated). These findings suggest that PSCs reshape the host immune microenvironment via a metabolic-gene network. This study systematically elucidates how PSCs regulate immune cell function and metabolic homeostasis through multiple targets, providing novel insights into the immune escape mechanisms of parasites. Conclusion PSCs can induce host immune metabolic reprogramming, characterized by the activation of pyrimidine metabolism and the inhibition of bilirubin-mediated oxidative stress, through concentration-dependent regulation of Th9 cytokines (IL-9, IL-4/TGF-{beta}) and suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This process remodels the immune tolerance microenvironment. The aim is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying parasite escape via multi-dimensional immunometabolic regulation, thereby providing a novel direction for the targeted treatment of echinococcosis.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

In this study, we compared the gut microbiota composition and enzymatic responses to dietary shifts in two neotropical termite species with contrasting feeding strategies: the polyphagous Silvestritermes euamignathus and the litter-feeding specialist Cornitermes cumulans. High-throughput sequencing and enzymatic assays revealed that S. euamignathus maintained stable microbial communities and enzymatic profiles across diverse diets, including artificial and fiber-rich substrates. In contrast, C. cumulans exhibited significant shifts in bacterial abundance and reduced enzymatic activity under altered diets, particularly those differing from its natural litter-based diet. Functional gene predictions further indicated broader metabolic potential in S. euamignathus, particularly in response to complex substrates, while C. cumulans showed transcriptional suppression of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. These results suggest that S. euamignathus benefits from a more flexible and functionally resilient gut symbiosis, enabling adaptation to heterogeneous or disturbed environments. In contrast, the narrower metabolic scope of C. cumulans may limit its capacity to respond to dietary change. Our findings highlight how feeding ecology shapes microbiome plasticity and digestive function in termites, with implications for understanding their adaptability under environmental stress and climate-driven shifts in resource availability.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Despite their global distribution, Rhizaria ecology and biogeography is poorly understood due to a paucity of datasets and use of differing methodologies. Here we present the first characterization of Rhizaria ecology in the northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA), a variable yet productive subarctic ecosystem with important fisheries that is experiencing long-term warming. Seawater samples were collected from CTD-secured Niskin bottles at stations within the NGA Long-Term Ecological Research study area during summer 2023. We report some of the highest Rhizaria abundances (25 cells L-1) from any ocean environment to date and thus suggest a restructuring of the current biogeographical paradigm that posits highest abundances at the equator and decreases at higher latitudes. Acantharia was the most ubiquitous subgroup. Distinct depth niches were also revealed: Foraminifera dominated surface waters, Radiolaria exhibited a cosmopolitan distribution, and Phaeodaria were the deepest living. Prey captures and algal interactions primarily occurred offshore in the upper water column. A wide range of taxa had captured prey while the hosts to presumptively symbiotic algae were mainly Foraminifera and Acantharia. We highlight Rhizaria as key players in NGA food web dynamics as evidenced by their wide depth distributions, taxonomic diversity, and variable nutrition strategies.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The members of Archaeplastida are the descendants of the eukaryote that took up and transformed a cyanobacterial endosymbiont into a primary plastid. Archaeplastida has been well studied as one of the major eukaryotic assemblages in science, as this assemblage initiated the diversity and evolution of eukaryotic phototrophs, and are significant players in the past, modern, and future planetary environments. Recent phylogenetic analyses of multiple proteins (phylogenomic analyses) stably recovered the monophyly of Archaeplastida, but an uncertainty remains in the internal relationship among the three sub-clades. The phylogenomic analyses of nucleus-encoded proteins (nuc-proteins) put Rhodoza at the base of the Archaeplastida clade, albeit Glaucophyta was often inferred as the basal lineage in the phylogenomic analyses of plastid-encoded proteins (pld-proeins). In this study, we challenged the previously recognized but as-yet-explicitly addressed issue in the tree of Archaeplastida (ToA). The in-depth assessments conducted here revealed that taxon sampling can introduce phylogenetic artifacts, one from fast-evolving positions and the other from heterotachious positions, into the phylogenomic analyses of nuc-proteins and those of pld-proteins, respectively.

An ideal tool for analyzing gene regulation processes would provide simultaneous measurements of the dynamics of many components in the gene regulatory network, but existing methodologies fall short of simultaneously tracking the dynamics of components over long periods of time. Here, we present CytoTape-a genetically encoded, modular, and scalable analog recorder for continuous, multiplexed in situ recording of gene regulation dynamics over multiple days and weeks at single-cell resolution. CytoTape consists of a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via AI-guided rational design. Gene regulation dynamics, together with timestamps for reconstruction of the continuous time axis, are directly encoded via distinct molecular tags distributed along single CytoTape assemblies in live cells, to be readout at scale after fixation via standard immunofluorescence imaging. CytoTape recorders are modularly designed to record gene expression driven by a variety of activity-dependent promoters. We demonstrated the utility of CytoTape in mammalian embryonic kidney cells, cancer cells, glial cells, and neurons, achieving simultaneous recording of five cell plasticity-associated transcription factor activities and immediate early gene expression levels, namely CREB, c-fos, Arc, Egr1, and Npas4 activities, within single cells in a spatiotemporally scalable manner.

A central principle in biology is that all cellular membranes descend from a common ancestral membrane, as they cannot be generated in the absence of preexisting lipid structures. It is thus unclear how the first protocell membranes originated from membrane-less precursors. Here we demonstrate the de novo generation of lipid bilayers in the absence of any preexisting membranes, membrane-bound proteins, or lipid nanostructure templates. Using acetate as a two-carbon precursor, lipid tails are constructed by soluble enzymes and spontaneously conjugate to cysteine backbones, forming diacyl lipids that assemble into vesicles. Pore-forming peptides facilitate precursor transport into vesicles, allowing the continuous generation of new lipids. Formation of glycolipid membranes creates compartments that can maintain proton gradients. The de novo formation of membrane bilayers using primitive chemical building blocks may have been an intermediary step between primitive prebiotic biochemistry and the emergence of cellular life.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Although SLN has been extensively studied, due to technical difficulties, most data were obtained during fictive locomotion, and data about activity of spinal neurons during locomotion with intact sensory feedback from limbs are extremely limited. Here, we overcame the technical problems and recorded activity of putative spinal interneurons from spinal segments L4-L6 during treadmill locomotion (with intact sensory feedback from limbs) evoked by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region in the decerebrate cat. We analyzed activity phases of recorded interneurons, by using a new method that took into account the previously ignored information about stability of neuronal modulation in the sequential locomotor cycles. We suggested that neurons with stable modulation (i.e. small dispersion of their activity phase in sequential cycles) represent the core of SLN. Our analysis allowed to reveal functional groups of neurons with stable modulation presumably generating the vertical and horizontal components of the step, and to characterize their location in the spinal cord. Analysis of relationships between activity phases of these groups revealed possible connections between them, suggesting a novel model for generation of locomotion that combines reciprocally active half-centers with a ring consisting of four sequentially active groups, each inactivating the preceding one and activating the next one.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the effect of repeated restraint stress (RRS) on post-surgical somatosensory hypersensitivity and affective responding in male rats and examined underlying mechanisms mediating these effects. We showed that RRS induced behavioural despair in the forced swim test, reduced body weight gain and elevated faecal corticosterone levels in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following paw-incision surgery, animals pre-exposed to RRS exhibited exacerbated mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, pain-related aversion, and anxiety-like behaviour compared to non-stress counterparts. RNAseq analysis revealed alterations in glial and neuro-immune pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in the RRS + paw incision group compared to paw incision alone, data further confirmed by increased microglial activity and inflammatory gene expression (iba1, itgam, il-1{beta} and nlrp3). Intrathecal administration of IL-1Ra or MCC950 (an NLRP3 inhibitor) attenuated the RRS-induced increase in pain-related aversion and mechanical hypersensitivity post-surgery. Chronic administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prevented RRS-induced despair-like behaviour but did not alter the effects of RRS on pain-related aversion or mechanical hypersensitivity post-surgery. In contrast, chronic administration of propranolol, a {beta}-adrenergic receptor antagonist and sympathetic nervous system inhibitor, not only prevented the RRS-induced despair-like behaviour but also attenuated exacerbation of mechanical hypersensitivity, pain-related aversion, and anxiety-like behaviour post-surgery. These findings suggest that RRS exacerbates and prolongs post-surgical somatosensory and affective pain responding via {beta}-adrenergic receptor activation and increased spinal microglial NLRP3-IL1{beta} signalling. These data provide further insight into the mechanisms by which chronic stress and mood disorders exacerbate and prolong post-surgical pain.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

While most prophages remain stably integrated into their host over two years, we discover that ~5% of phages are dynamically gained or lost from persistent bacterial hosts. Within the same sample, we find evidence of population heterogeneity in which identical bacterial hosts with and without a given integrated prophage coexist simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phage induction, when detected, occurs predominantly at low levels (1-3x coverage compared to the host region).

Human milk samples from 97 mothers (stratified by BMI) were collected at 48h, one month, and three months postpartum, with HMOs quantified via UPLC-MS/MS. In a subsample of this population, infant fecal microbiome composition was analyzed using metagenomics tools. Mothers with obesity exhibited reduced 2'-FL, LNnT, 3'-SL, 6'-SL, LNFPI concentration at 48h postpartum. Infants born to these mothers showed diminished early colonizers such as Gammaproteobacteria at 48h, alongside lower antigen and polyamine biosynthesis pathways. Conversely, late colonizers like Lachnospiraceae species were more abundant at one and three months postpartum. Sialylated and neutral HMOs negatively correlated with these late colonizers, which metabolize such oligosaccharides. These findings suggest maternal obesity alters HMO profiles, potentially disrupts pioneer microbial establishment and accelerating late-colonizer dominance. Reduced keystone bacteria and shifted metabolic pathways may impair immune priming, with long-term health implications.

To address this gap in the streptococcal molecular toolbox, we benchmarked five different fluorescent proteins.

We leveraged genomic, ecological, and phenotypic trait data from naturally sampled strains from nearly all known species in subphylum Saccharomycotina to examine the evolution of resistance to eight antifungal drugs. The phylogenetic distribution of drug resistance varied by drug; fluconazole resistance was widespread, while 5-fluorocytosine resistance was rare, except in Lipomycetales. A random forest algorithm trained on genomic data predicted drug-resistant yeasts with 54-75% accuracy. In general, frequency of drug resistance correlated with prediction accuracy, with fluconazole resistance being consistently predicted with the highest accuracy (74.9%). Fluconazole resistance accuracy was similar between models trained on genome-wide variation in the presence and number of InterPro protein annotations across Saccharomycotina (74.9% accuracy) and those trained on amino acid sequence alignment data of Erg11, a protein known to be involved in fluconazole resistance (74.3-74.9% accuracy). Interestingly, the top Erg11 residues for predicting fluconazole resistance across Saccharomycotina do not overlap with, are not spatially close to, and are less conserved than those previously linked to resistance in clinical isolates of Candida albicans. In silico deep mutational scanning of the C. albicans Erg11 protein revealed that amino acid variants implicated in clinical cases of resistance are almost universally destabilizing while variants in our most informative residues are energetically more neutral, explaining why the latter are much more common than the former in natural populations. Importantly, previous experimental analyses of C. albicans Erg11 have shown that amino acid variation in our most informative residues, despite having never been directly implicated in clinical cases, can directly contribute to resistance.

However, a major challenge of Cas9-based editing in human embryos is the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities caused by Cas9 cleavage. Furthermore, mosaicism - different genetic outcomes in different cells, prevent accurate genotyping using a single embryo biopsy. Through timed analysis of editing outcomes during the first cell cycle and timed inhibition of Cas9 using AcrIIA4, we show that most edits occur at least 12 hours post Cas9 injection and therefore after the first S-phase. This timing limits the ability to achieve uniform editing across cells. We found that segmental chromosomal abnormalities and the consequential loss of heterozygosity are common at Cas9 cleavage sites throughout the genome, including at MYBPC3 and at CCR5 loci, for which this has not previously been reported. Surprisingly, inhibiting Cas9 activity 8-12 hours before mitosis does not eliminate chromosomal aneuploidies. This suggests that double-strand break (DSB) repair in human embryos is exceedingly slow, with breaks remaining unrepaired for many hours. Thus, the timing of DSB induction and repair relative to the first S-phase and the first mitosis is intrinsically limiting to preventing mosaicism and maintaining genome stability in embryonic gene editing.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

These structures play crucial roles in many biological processes, often mediated or influenced by interactions of carbohydrates with other biomolecules. However, studying these interactions is particularly challenging due to the structural complexity of carbohydrates, their dynamic conformational behavior, and the low binding affinities often involved. To address these challenges, we are developing a novel method that leverages mass spectrometry-based radical footprinting of carbohydrates (RFC). We monitored changes in the solvent accessibility of specific regions within oligosaccharides by measuring variations in the apparent rate of hydroxyl radical and trifluoromethyl radical-mediated oxidation. In our studies, a collection of trisaccharide isomers and N, N',N''-triacetylchitotriose (NAG3) shows no significant change in modification in non-binding protein solutions. However, in the presence of two proteins that bind NAG3 specifically, NAG3 oxidation is reduced. We find that the free reducing end is the primary site of hydroxyl radical oxidation under covalent labeling conditions, allowing it to distinguish interactions at the glycan reducing end. Trifluoromethyl radicals, conversely, label broadly across the trisaccharide by substitution into a C-H bond. Overall, this approach offers a powerful new approach for identifying glycan-protein interactions and mapping the binding interface of glycans.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

We identify 30 J-domain proteins (2 DNAJAs, 10 DNAJBs, 18 DNAJCs), 6 Hsp70s, and 5 nucleotide-exchange factors that mitigate TDP-43 toxicity. Specific chaperones reduce TDP-43 aggregate burden and detoxify diverse synthetic or disease-linked TDP-43 variants. Sequence-activity mapping unveiled unexpected, modular mechanisms of chaperone-mediated protection. Typically, DNAJBs collaborate with Hsp70 to suppress TDP-43 toxicity, whereas DNAJCs act independently. In human cells, specific chaperones increase TDP-43 solubility and enhance viability under proteotoxic stress. Strikingly, spliceosome-associated DNAJC8 and DNAJC17 retain TDP-43 in the nucleus and promote liquid-phase behavior.

Driven by advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and the continuous decline in associated costs, metagenomic studies have expanded exponentially, generating massive amounts of sequencing data and opening new avenues for data-driven disease modeling. Conventional approaches to microbiome analysis predominantly rely on the alignment of DNA sequencing reads against reference databases to infer microbial composition and profiling at the species level.

Single-nucleus assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) are an efficient strategy to identify putative gene regulatory elements active in a given tissue at single-cell resolution, and have unprecedented potential to provide new insight into evolutionary divergence of regulatory programs. However, no dedicated framework exists to integrate and compare snATAC-seq data across species, whilst methods designed for single-cell gene expression data have serious limitations. Here, we present sPYce, a cross-species snATAC-seq integration method that relies on sequence composition similarities through k-mer histograms. In contrast to other approaches, sPYce does not require orthologous genes or genome alignments to anchor data from different species. Instead, it uses similarity in non-coding regulatory sequence motifs to uncover conserved cellular identities. sPYce can embed datasets from multiple species into the same mathematical space and permits further downstream analysis steps, such as dimensionality reduction, visualisation, clustering, cell type annotation transfer, and motif enrichment. We benchmarked sPYce against existing approaches on two publicly available datasets spanning more than 160 million years of evolution, demonstrating that it successfully uncovers conserved cellular programs whilst preserving biologically relevant species-specific differences. sPYce also implements a significance test for divergence of regulatory motifs between species. By comparing cerebellar development in mouse and opossum, we discovered regulatory divergence in granule cell differentiation programs, particularly driven by Nuclear Factor 1 (NF1).

Predicting fMRI activity from EEG activity could give us the best of both worlds, and open new horizons for neuroscience research and neurotechnology applications. Here, we formulate this prediction objective both as a classification task (predicting whether the fMRI signal increases or decreases) and a regression task (predicting the value of this signal). We follow two distinct strategies: training classical machine learning and deep learning models (including MLP, CNN, RNN, and transformer) on an EEG-fMRI dataset, or leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models. We show that predicting fMRI activity from EEG activity is possible for the brain regions defined by the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas, in the context of subjects performing a neurofeedback task. Interestingly, both strategies yield promising results, possibly highlighting two complementary paths for our prediction objective. Furthermore, a Chain-of-Thought approach demonstrates that LLMs can infer the cognitive functions associated with EEG data, and subsequently predict the fMRI data from these cognitive functions. The natural combination of the two strategies, i.e., fine-tuning an LLM on an EEG-fMRI dataset, is not straightforward and would certainly require further study.

These patterns are often attributed to passive loss from factors such as thymic atrophy and cumulative immune exposures but such processes fail to explain the systematic variation observed across populations. Here we challenge this view by analyzing TCR$\\beta$ repertoires from ${\\sim}30,000$ individuals showing that TCR diversity is almost entirely determined by repertoire size and the frequency of the 1,000 most abundant clones. These two intrinsic features of the repertoire explain 96\\% of the variance in TCR diversity, capturing its dependence on age and sex and defining a robust relationship that holds even under strong immune perturbations such as Cytomegalovirus infection. This relationship arises because the frequency of abundant clones captures a repertoire-wide pattern of coordinated clonal expansion---termed intrinsic clonality---which may be a fundamental, previously unrecognized property of the immune system. We propose that TCR diversity emerges as a system-level property mediated by repertoire size and intrinsic clonality, both of which are likely homeostatically regulated.

Given the established role of dihydropyridines as inhibitors of mammalian L-type calcium channels and our observation that drug treatment perturbed calcium and manganese levels in host phagocytes, we initially hypothesized a host-directed mechanism of action. However, dose-response assays in axenic medium revealed that these drugs can directly inhibit B. ovis growth. To investigate the genetic basis of B. ovis susceptibility to dihydropyridine treatment, we selected for mutants capable of growing in the presence of cilnidipine. Cilnidipine-resistant isolates carried single-base deletions in the bepE pseudogene that restored an open reading frame encoding an RND-family transporter subunit. B. ovis is an ovine venereal pathogen that has experienced significant pseudogenization in its recent evolutionary history. Frameshift mutations that restored bepE function in B. ovis increased its resistance not only to dihydropyridines but also to a broad range of membrane-disrupting agents, including bile acid. Conversely, deleting bepE in Brucella abortus, a related zoonotic species that retains an intact version of the gene, increased its sensitivity to bile acid in vitro and to cilnidipine in the intracellular niche.

Comparative transcriptomic analysis suggested that a gene system encoding an environmental stress-sensing receptor controlled the transcription of boxA, a Mn(II)-oxidizing gene. These findings indicate that two conditions are required for bacterial Mn(II) oxidation: the presence of a Mn(II)-oxidizing gene and an environmentally responsive regulatory system capable of activating its expression.

Transcriptomic profiling revealed a robust positive correlation between boxA expression and genes encoding two-component signal transduction systems.

E.", "abstract": "RNA decay is essential for maintenance of normal RNA abundances, however RNA abundances are regulated by two opposing processes, transcription and decay, yet how decay contributes to abundance change is poorly understood. Here, we measured rates of RNA abundance change, RNA half-lives (t1/2s), and transcription rates in stimulated Arabidopsis leaf cells. This revealed two mechanisms in which decay influenced RNA abundance changes. The biggest changes in RNA abundances resulted from t1/2 changes that reinforced transcriptional regulation (synergistic). Smaller RNA abundance changes arose from a second mechanism in which t1/2 changes opposed transcriptional regulation (oppositional). RNA decay also contributed to stimulus-induced buffering of RNA abundances. Oppositional and buffering regulation shared excessive rate changes where changes in decay rates were commensurate and opposing transcriptional changes. We call this common mechanism countercyclical regulation. Its mirroring of rate changes implies coordination between nuclear and cytoplasmic processes, and it is widespread, accounting for 90% of the RNA t1/2 regulation.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

It is challenging to predict how ARID1A loss impacts cancer therapy response because it participates in many different cellular pathways. G quadruplex (G4) binding ligands, such as pyridostatin, have shown anticancer effects, but the pathways and genetic determinants involved in the response to G4 ligands are still not fully understood. Here, we show that ARID1A deficient cells are selectively sensitive to pyridostatin when compared with isogenic controls. Sensitivity to pyridostatin was apparent in ovarian and colorectal cancer cell line models, and in vivo studies suggest that G4 ligands hold promise for treating ARID1A deficient cancers. While we find that ARID1A impacts on pyridostatin-induced transcriptional responses, we find that pyridostatin-mediated toxicity in ARID1A-deficient cells is driven by defective DNA repair of topoisomerase-induced breaks. We show that ARID1A-deficient cells are unable to efficiently accumulate non-homologous end joining proteins on chromatin following pyridostatin exposure. These data uncover a role for ARID1A in the cellular response to G4 ligands, and link remodelling to G4 ligand-induced transcriptional and DNA damage responses.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

R.; Castro-Piedras, I.; Shanmugam, S.; Ponomarev, I.", "abstract": "Excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption is a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Activation of innate immune system and proinflammatory signaling in the brain may play a key role in promoting alcohol consumption and development of AUD in humans. Innate immune activation by toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in rodents is associated with release of proinflammatory cytokines and changes in alcohol consumption, and these effects are genotype- and sex-dependent. For example, C57BL/6J male, but not female mice increase alcohol intake after TLR3 activation. In order to better understand the interactions between neuroimmune signaling, genotype, and sex and their effects on ethanol drinking, males and females of more genotypes need to be tested. The goal of this study was to test the effects of innate immune activation on ethanol consumption and neuroimmune molecular profiles of F1 hybrid mice from reciprocal crosses between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mouse strains, which are animals with high levels of ethanol intake. Animals were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal injections of either saline, Poly(I:C) (PIC, 2 or 10 mg/kg), a TLR3 agonist, or lipopolysaccharide, (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg), a TLR4 agonist, administered every 4 days for a total of 10 injections and subjected to a 2-bottle choice every-other-day ethanol drinking paradigm for a total of 18 dinking sessions, which generated high levels of voluntary ethanol consumption. Six and 24 hours after the last injection, brains were removed, frontal cortex dissected, and levels of 3 proinflammatory cytokines (Tnfa, Il1b, Ccl5), as well as Tlr3, and Tlr4 were measured using qPCR. Immune activation by PIC produced escalation of ethanol drinking, while LPS resulted in a reduction of ethanol consumption or a trend to reduce drinking in males but not females of both FVB/B6 and B6/FVB crosses. Furthermore, activation of TLR3 by PIC produced sex-specific time course responses of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may, at least in part, explain behavioral differences. Taken together, these results validate previous findings that the effects of immune activation on ethanol consumption depend on genotype, sex, and mode of activation (TLR3 vs TLR4) and suggest that FVB/B6J and B6J/FVB F1 males are a suitable model to study TLR3-dependent escalation of alcohol drinking.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

FTO has an intrinsic preference and significantly faster demethylation rates in vitro for m6Am modifications located at the 5' mRNA cap structure, but the structural basis for FTO's ability to discriminate m6A versus m6Am modifications has remained unknown. Here we utilize molecular dynamics simulations of FTO-RNA cap complexes to identify conserved aromatic residues on the surface of FTO involved in 5' cap recognition. Subsequent mutagenesis and enzymology experiments validate the specificity of these residues in engaging the 5' cap structure to promote m6Am demethylation. We also identify a nonpolar surface on FTO that interacts with the 2'-O-methyl group of m6Am to impact demethylation kinetics. This work provides the first structural insights into how FTO selectively catalyzes m6Am versus m6A demethylation on mRNA, suggests why FTO is sensitive to different 5' cap modifications, and furthers our understanding of how FTO activity is regulated by diverse mechanisms to help control the epitranscriptome.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

The current study addressed this gap by demonstrating a biphasic response in TYMS protein levels upon 5-FU treatment. Indeed, we observe an initial reduction within the first few hours, followed by a marked increase at 24 hours. These changes occurred independently of transcriptional regulation, as TYMS mRNA levels remained stable during the early phase and showed only a moderate increase later. We further showed that neither autophagy nor proteasomal degradation contributed to this dynamic, but instead it is driven by change in its translation. Using thermal proteome profiling, we identified SIN1, a key component of the mTORC2 complex, as a key regulator of TYMS protein levels. Functional studies revealed that SIN1 depletion negatively alters TYMS levels and dynamics and sensitizes cancer cells to 5-FU-mediated cell death. These findings uncover a novel mechanism controlling TYMS protein levels and suggest that targeting SIN1 may represent a promising strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of 5-FU-based treatments.", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, we developed a robust, sample-independent method utilizing liposome encapsulation that preserve macromolecules in a solution-like and near native environment throughout sample preparation. Using equine spleen apoferritin and the Escherichia coli (E. coli) ribosome as model systems, we demonstrate efficient particle incorporation into liposomes and successful high-resolution structure determination.

Here, we report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags (mgTag and cTag) of 36 and 50 amino acids (aa) that, to the best of our knowledge, are the smallest reported. These tags exhibit transferase-type reactivity with their ligands to append any moiety of interest to the tag. cTag utilizes an engineered C1 domain-bearing cysteine that undergoes group-transfer reaction with its ligand. Likewise, mgTag utilizes an engineered zinc-finger domain-bearing cysteine that undergoes group-transfer reaction with its molecular-glue ligand in the presence of cereblon (CRBN). We applied these tags in the context of cell signaling and proximity induction. While the fusion of HaloTag (297 aa) to the KRASG12D (188 aa) disrupted its ability to activate the growth-signaling pathway, fusion of mgTag or cTag did not. Group-transfer of BRD4 binder to tags appended to Abelson kinase (ABL) induced proximity between ABL and BRD4, resulting in the phosphorylation of the latter. Deletion of the transferase-type reactivity reduced phosphorylation levels, suggesting that proximity-inducing chimeras with group-transfer design may be more efficacious in certain scenarios.

It may also make community composition less deterministic since a wider range of species have a chance establishing themselves and affecting subsequent community assembly processes. However, the relationship between microbial diversity and the diversity of resources exogenously supplied is complicated by cross-feeding between microbes, since much of the resource diversity encountered will be generated by the community. Here, we assembled microbial communities in simple growth media (where cross-feeding will be important) with 1 to 3 carbon sources and asked how increasing nutrient diversity affects diversity within and between communities. While there was (i) no clear difference in alpha-diversity, increasing the number of carbon sources led to communities that varied (ii) more within and (iii) less between the different abiotic conditions. (i) is at odds with classical ecological theory, but fits predictions from a consumer-resource model that accounts for cross-feeding. (ii) shows an increase in the stochasticity of community assembly. (iii) demonstrates strong abiotic selection in the single carbon source communities. We then went on to show that this is leads to phylogenetic clustering (co-occurrence of more closely related strains).", "date": "2025-05-10", "journal": ""}

L.; Garcia, D. M.", "abstract": "Mutations in tRNA-modifying enzymes are associated with severe mitochondrial disease in humans. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to model the impact of these mutations due to enzyme conservation and the ease of phenotyping mitochondrial defects in yeast. Yet the mature sequences of all its mitochondrially-encoded tRNAs (mt-tRNAs), including the positions of chemically modified bases, have not been determined in their entirety. We used Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) of mitochondrially-enriched RNA combined with enzyme knockouts to map base modifications across 24 mt-tRNA isoacceptors in yeast. Analysis of mt-tRNAs from wild-type yeast revealed base miscalls that were coincident with known modification sites at annotated positions, as well as at previously undescribed sites. Comparison to yeast lacking the PUS4 gene, which encodes a conserved pseudouridine synthase, demonstrated that 23 of 24 mt-tRNAs are pseudouridylated by Pus4 to form {Psi}55 in the T-loop. We also mapped the uridines modified by Pus2, catalyzing {Psi}27 and/or {Psi}28 on several mt-tRNAs, a function matching its paralog Pus1 that modifies cytosolic tRNAs at the same positions. In yeast lacking the PUS2 gene, some mt-tRNAs also showed changes at other positions inconsistent with being Pus2-pseudouridylated sites. These include U34 that is modified to cmnm5s2U34 in the anticodon of mt-tRNALys(UUU), and A21 in mt-tRNAHis(GUG) that is not previously known to be modified. Sequencing of a strain lacking the DUS2 dihydrouridine synthase gene also permitted determination of the dihydrouridine sites catalyzed by Dus2. Loss of this D20 modification also led to pleiotropic effects on other putative modification sites, those presumed catalyzed by Dus1 and Trm1, in many mt-tRNAs. In summary these data provide a comprehensive analysis of S. cerevisiae mt-tRNA sequences, including modifications. They also suggest previously unknown RNA modification <q>circuits</q> in mt-tRNAs, in which loss of Pus2-catalyzed {Psi}27/{Psi}28 and Dus2-catalyzed D20 causes increases or decreases in other modifications.
