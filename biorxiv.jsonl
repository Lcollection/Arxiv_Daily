Identifying accurate representation of functional neuroanatomy substrates of mental processing could inform understanding of its neural mechanism. The challenge is that it is unclear whether a specific mental process possesses a 'functional neuroanatomy fingerprint', i.e., a unique and reliable pattern of functional neuroanatomy that underlies the mental process. To address this question, we utilized a multi-task deep learning model to disentangle the functional neuroanatomy fingerprint of seven different and representative mental processes including Emotion, Gambling, Language, Motor, Relational, Social, and Working Memory. Results based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of two independent cohorts of 1235 subjects from the US and China consistently show that each of the seven mental processes possessed a functional neuroanatomy fingerprint, which is represented by a unique set of functional activity weights of whole-brain regions characterizing the degree of each region involved in the mental process. The functional neuroanatomy fingerprint of a specific mental process exhibits high discrimination ability (93% classification accuracy and AUC of 0.99) with those of the other mental processes, and is robust across different datasets and using different brain atlases. This study provides a solid functional neuroanatomy foundation for investigating the neural mechanism of mental processing.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

While drinking water-based administration is ideal for sustained exposure in high feasibility, available compounds are limited, with thioacetamide (TAA) being the primary option. Here, we aimed to establish a novel drinking water-induced mouse model of cholestatic liver injury using 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), and to characterize its pathological trajectory in comparison to the TAA model. Methods: Mice were administered MDA via drinking water for 28 Days. To elucidate the early events that give rise to chronic pathological divergence, we conducted a multi-layered analysis comprising plasma biochemical assays, immune cell profiling by flow cytometry, and hepatic transcriptomics at five time points during the early phase. The MDA model was evaluated against the established TAA model. Results: MDA administration led to sustained ALT elevation, peribiliary fibrosis, and spatially irregular focal hepatocellular necrosis, in contrast to the centrilobular injury observed with TAA. Early-phase analysis revealed increased serum ALP and TBIL, enhanced fibrinolysis-related gene signatures, and a lack of eosinophil accumulation in the MDA-administered mice. These early molecular and immunological differences are likely to underpin the model-specific chronic pathological outcomes. Conclusions: We present the MDA model as the first drinking water-based cholestatic liver injury model that is longitudinally tractable and mechanistically distinct from TAA. This model provides a versatile platform for studying the temporal dynamics of liver disease progression and resolution.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

However, the precise mechanisms through which CL influences mitochondrial morphology are not well understood. In this study, employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we determined that CL molecules extensively engage with the paddle domain (PD) of mitochondrial fusion protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1), which controls membrane-shaping mechanisms. Structure-function analysis confirmed the interactions between CL and two conserved motifs of OPA1 at the membrane-binding sites. We further developed a bromine-labeled CL probe to enhance cryoEM contrast and characterized the structure of OPA1 assemblies bound to the CL-brominated lipid bilayers. Our images provide direct evidence of CL enrichment within the OPA1-binding leaflet. Last, we observed a decrease in membrane remodeling activity for OPA1 in lipid compositions with increasing concentrations of monolyso-cardiolipin (MLCL). This suggests that the partial replacement of CL by MLCL, as observed in Barth syndrome-associated mutations of the tafazzin phospholipid transacylase, alters the malleability of the membrane and compromises proper remodeling. Together, these data provide insights into how biological membranes regulate the mechanisms governing mitochondrial homeostasis.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Cells can adjust the packing of their lipids by increasing the number of cyclopentyl rings during lipid synthesis, thereby decreasing membrane permeability and fluidity to maintain cellular function at high temperature, acidic pH, or nutrient limitation. Archaea of the class Nitrososphaeria synthesize an iGDGT, crenarchaeol, with four cyclopentyl rings and a cyclohexyl ring, the function of which is unknown. Structural modeling suggests the cyclohexyl ring may increase membrane fluidity, potentially optimizing membranes for mesophilic conditions. To begin to investigate this hypothesis, iGDGT composition was quantified in forty-one thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA, and contextualized within a global thermal spring iGDGT compilation with pH values of 1.1 to 10.1 and temperatures of 16 to 95 C. pH was the strongest predictor of both crenarchaeol relative abundance and the number of cyclopentyl rings per iGDGT. Crenarchaeol relative abundance exhibited a nonlinear relationship with pH and temperature, with highest relative abundances at pH 7.4 and 46 C, then decreasing above and below these values. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the cyclohexyl ring of crenarchaeol optimizes archaeal cellular membranes for circumneutral and moderate temperature environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated insecticide resistance in the invasive blue-green aphid, Acyrthosiphon kondoi, which reproduces clonally in Australia and has rapidly developed resistance across geographic locations. Using genomic, transcriptomic, and experimental approaches, we explored the evolutionary origins and molecular mechanisms of resistance. We developed the first nuclear genome assembly for A. kondoi (443.8 Mb, 28,405 annotated genes, BUSCO score 97.5%) and a partial mitochondrial assembly (11,598 bp). All resistant strains shared a common ancestor, supporting the spread of a resistant 'superclone' lineage that is distinct from susceptible strains. Resistance was associated with over-expression of an esterase gene that was homologous to E4/FE4 esterases in other aphid pests that are linked to resistance. Functional experiments in Drosophila melanogaster confirmed a causal role of this E4-like esterase in resistance to organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids. These findings highlight how clonal dispersal and insecticide overuse can transform local adaptation into a widespread pest management issue. Our results suggest a parallel macroevolutionary response to insecticide selection in A. kondoi and other aphid species at the gene family level, but with a distinct regulatory mechanism in A. kondoi. Given the rapid spread of the resistant superclone, alternative management strategies, including expanded chemical control options and enhanced biological control, are urgently needed to mitigate this growing pest problem.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The early onset of peripheral deafness significantly disrupts the proper development of the auditory system. Likewise, exposure to loud noise during early development produces a similar disruptive effect. Before hearing onset in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that activates primary afferents and propagates into the central nervous system. This activity is crucial for auditory system maturation and is modulated by the medial olivocochlear efferent (MOC) feedback via 910 nicotinic cholinergic receptors present in inner hair cells. In adults, these receptors are restricted to outer hair cells, where they mediate feedback from the MOC system to regulate cochlear amplification. Although the MOC system's protective role to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in adulthood is well-established, its influence during early developmental stages -especially in response to exposure to loud noise- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the effect of the MOC system in the ears of sound-exposed mice during the early postnatal developmental period, by using genetically modified mice ,9 knockout and 9 knock-in models, with either absent or enhanced cholinergic activity. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing, along with long-range alterations in the number and morphology of ribbon synapses. Furthermore, exposure to loud noise during early development causes long-lasting damage in both wild-type and 9 knockout mice, which lack functional MOC feedback, with effects persisting into adulthood. In contrast, mice with enhanced cholinergic activity were protected from noise-induced damage, with no long-term effects on auditory function. These results highlight the increased susceptibility of the auditory system during early postnatal development. Moreover, they indicate that an enhanced MOC feedback shields the auditory system from noise damage during this period.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Cannibalism is thought to delay sporulation by enabling one subpopulation to produce the sporulation delay protein SDP, the sporulation killing factor SKF and the epipeptide EPE. These toxins are thought to lyse susceptible nonproducers, thereby releasing nutrients to prevent premature sporulation. However, the molecular mechanisms orchestrating this bacterial programmed cell death during biofilm development are poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized mutants defective in either toxin production or the corresponding autoimmunity by a multiscale approach, combining luminescence reporters, colony biopsy, multi-parameter flow cytometry and MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging to resolve cannibalism function and distribution. The toxins are produced in distinct, only partially overlapping areas of the colony and interdepend in their spatial distribution. Both EPE and SDP, but not SKF, are crucial for delaying sporulation. Loss of EPE or SDP autoimmunity resulted in severe morphological changes and stress-induced occurrence of suppressor mutants. The absence of all three toxins led to small, hyper-sporulating colonies with excessive wrinkle formation, indicating that cannibalism is essential for maintaining biofilm structure and lateral expansion. Our results provide the first evidence for the complex interactions between the cannibalism toxins that shape biofilm architecture through bacterial programmed cell death. Localized toxin production and their spatial distribution affect the spatiotemporal organization, morphology and subpopulation dynamics within B. subtilis biofilms.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Here we propose an integrated approach in which the same time course dataset will be analysed both in the progress curve as well as steady state perspectives at different reaction timescales across replications and substrate concentrations. Our theory shows that there exists an optimum reaction time at which the error in the estimation of KM using various progress curve and steady state methods show the least possible value so that the coefficient of variation of the median KM values obtained across various methods attains a minimum. Using detailed stochastic simulations, we confirm that the KM value obtained with minimum coefficient of variation across various methods is actually the reliable estimate that is close to the original KM value.

Here, we introduce an adaptation of Group Task-Related Component Analysis (gTRCA), a novel multivariate signal decomposition method, to automatically extract TEP components that are maximally reproducible across both trials and subjects. Following the validation of a new permutation-based statistical test for gTRCA using simulated data, the method was applied to two independent TMS-EEG datasets, in which stimulation was targeted to the primary motor cortex (M1) in cohorts of 16 and 22 healthy participants. We found that gTRCA reliably identified TEP components that were reproducible at the group level. Notably, the main gTRCA component captured the key spatial, temporal, and spectral features of motor TEPs, remained robust despite reduced number of stimuli and participants, and was consistent across different recordings. These findings demonstrate that gTRCA affords a more reliable characterization of TEPs at the group level, thereby facilitating the translation of TMS-EEG research into clinical practice.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

However, SMF approaches have been limited either in their resolution or in labeling readout accuracy. To address these limitations, we have developed a high-resolution strand-specific single molecule footprinting approach (C[-&gt;]U/T-ssSMF) based on the application of highly active sequence context-independent endogenous methylation-insensitive double-strand DNA (dsDNA) deaminases (CseDa01 and LbDa02), which convert accessible cytosines into uracils (and in turn into thymine after amplification).

We present the first high-resolution cryo-EM structure of MtbCBS bound to aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), and employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, and comparative inhibition studies to reveal the molecular basis and determinants governing irreversible PLP-enzyme inhibition.

By merging data from 58 such nanocrystals, we obtained diffraction to 0.85 A resolution with an overall correlation coefficient of over 99% and solved the structure ab initio using a five-residue helical fragment to initiate density modification. The resulting map was of exceptional quality, enabling fully automated model building and resolving individual hydrogen atoms.

The synthesis and translocation of protein subunits in membrane complexes occur through distinct pathways. A range of assembly rates were considered to guarantee a high yield of assembly given the existing time scales of the gene expression with derived formula to rationalize the choice. By alleviating the undesired dead-end intermediates in ATP synthase assembly, the efficiency was improved, while the heterogeneity of subunit synthesis at the single-cell level greatly undermine it.

However, due to logistical challenges of sampling such species throughout their distribution across steep and varied terrains, studies often lack comprehensive evidence to understand patterns of population divergence, local adaptation, and how current adaptations may influence future vulnerability. In this study, we utilized the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae), a high-altitude endemic bird found between 2800 and 5000 meters across the arid western and humid northeastern regions of the Sino-Himalayan landscape. This regions complex topography-characterized by tall mountains, deep valleys, and contrasting climatic conditions provided opportunities for investigating population divergence, local adaptation, and climate-related vulnerability. We integrated population-scale whole-genome sequencing with ecological, climatic, landscape, and morphological data to examine current patterns of local adaptation and forecast future risks. Our findings show that both biogeographic barriers and climatic variation drive rapid population divergence in P. hodgsoniae, reflected in distinct morphological traits and population genetic structure. Western populations, inhabiting dry and fragmented landscapes, exhibit adaptations to temperature extremes with low genetic diversity, reduced habitat suitability, limited gene flow, and weak connectivity, factors that increase their vulnerability to future environmental changes. In contrast, northeastern populations, living in more humid regions, show genetic adaptations linked to precipitation, maintain high genetic diversity and habitat connectivity, and may serve as evolutionary refugia under future climate scenarios.

However, some excitable systems produce little or no detectable EPs, for reasons that remain poorly understood. Here we show mathematically that homogeneous excitable cells and tissues -- with spatially uniform ion channel distributions and no external stimulation -- are extracellularly silent even in the presence of full action potentials. Specifically, an isolated, autonomous cell with uniform membrane properties generates zero EP, independent of shape, kinetics, or model complexity. The result extends to coupled cells provided the tissue remains fully homogeneous. EPs emerge only from spatial inhomogeneities, propagating electrical waves, or applied currents. We demonstrate the physiological relevance of this principle in Purkinje neurons, where clustering of sodium channels enables ephaptic synchronization, while uniform cells remain asynchronous and undetectable extracellularly. We further show that connected human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and pancreatic {beta}-cells exhibit EPs in proportion to cellular or tissue-level heterogeneity.

Here, we characterize AFDT in Nakaseomyces glabratus (formerly Candida glabrata), the second most common cause of candidiasis. Using disk diffusion and supra-MIC growth assays, we quantified AFDT across six clinical isolates and a reference strain. Our results mirror findings in C. albicans, demonstrating reproducible AFDT across N. glabratus strains in response to multiple azoles. Importantly, tolerance did not correlate with resistance profiles, underscoring AFDT as a distinct phenotype. Isolates were categorized into high- medium- and low-tolerance groups based on variability. Highly tolerant strains showed reduced clearance in a Galleria mellonella infection model, aligning with previous AFDT studies. Tolerance was modulated by environmental factors such as media, temperature, and azole, yet relative strain tolerance remained stable--suggesting a heritable, strain-specific trait shaped by genetic and environmental factors.

Among teleost ISGs, the grass carp reovirus-induced gene (gig) families 1 and 2 (gig1 and gig2, respectively) are absent in mammals but conserved in fishes and amphibians, and they have been implicated in resistance to viral infections across several aquaculture species. In particular, gig1 and gig2 genes are transcriptionally induced by viral stimuli in teleosts such as zebrafish, grass carp, and salmonids, and recent studies have highlighted their potential involvement in resistance to economically important diseases like pancreas disease in Atlantic salmon. Yet, the rapid evolution of these genes hinders a comprehensive understanding of their diversification process and regulatory mechanisms. This study investigated gig gene evolution across teleosts, with a focus on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Phylogenetic analysis across representative ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), including both teleosts and non-teleost outgroups such as the spotted gar (Holostei), indicated that gig1 is restricted to teleosts, with no identifiable homologs in non-teleost lineages. In contrast, gig2 genes are present in both teleosts and the spotted gar, suggesting an origin prior to the teleost-specific whole genome duplication (Ts3R), likely in early non-amniote vertebrates. Whole-genome duplication drove lineage-specific expansions, particularly of gig2 in salmonids. Structural and transcriptomic analyses showed that gig1 and gig2 differ in domain composition, repeat content, and regulation. Our findings suggest the complex interplay of duplication history, structural divergence, and transcriptional regulation in shaping immune gene repertoires in teleosts, with implications for understanding host-pathogen interactions and aquaculture disease responses.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

We re-examined 110 fossil seeds previously assigned either to one of the six taxa or unplaced within the family. All fossils were imaged and measured for 14 discrete and continuous characters, and a subset of 22 well-preserved specimens was additionally subjected to micro-CT scanning. In parallel, we scored the same set of characters for seeds from 354 extant taxa of Solanaceae. We carried out a multivariate analysis of the combined extinct and extant dataset to visualize the placement of fossil seeds within Solanaceae seed morphospace. This analysis revealed a wide spread of fossils across morphospace, including a variety of shapes, sizes and testal wall features. For one fossil taxon (Hyoscyosperma daturoides Deanna & S.D.Sm. gen. et sp. nov.), the micro-CT images confirmed the presence of an elaiosome, otherwise only known in the family from the genus Datura L. Based on these analyses, we re-circumscribe three species and describe six new taxa (four in new genera), doubling the number of fossil seed species in the family.

Oral eCF506 inhibited morphine tolerance in C57BL/6J mice. Exposure of PathHunter CHO cells to eCF506 did not affect inhibition of cAMP accumulation by the  agonist, DAMGO, but reduced {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment. This effect, mimicked by targeted degradation of c-Src, occurred through inhibition of c-Src catalytic function as evidenced by its diminution by the catalytically inactive Src250-536(K298M) construct.

In previous work (Mazuski & OKeefe, 2022), we characterized populations of neurons in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) that were strongly tuned to social conspecifics. In this current study, we asked whether these or other populations in the BLA encode properties necessary for social interaction: individual recognition, familiarity detection and reward association. In addition to cells in the rat lateral amygdala (LA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), we recorded from cells in the anatomically-related piriform cortex (PIR) to see how much of the amygdala response was inherited from this input. Here, we show that these three interrelated areas encode distinct features of social conspecifics at the population and single neuron level. We recorded from large populations of neurons using 4-shank Neuropixels probes while rats learned a social discrimination task, where one male conspecific was paired with a food reward (S+) and the other its absence (S-). For comparison, two unfamiliar animals were presented on occasional probe trials. After successful discrimination learning, we looked for transfer effects to our previously studied task where implanted rats freely interacted with all four conspecifics in an open-field environment. The LA dynamically encoded social reward learning. Initially, LA neuronal population activity could not distinguish between the S+ and S- conspecifics, but after learning distinct representations emerged. In contrast, the PIR showed no effect of social reward learning. Single PIR units encoded social identity with strong tuning to individual conspecifics both before and after learning. The BLA encoded both reward learning and social identity suggesting this is where the PIR and LA information streams converge. Unexpectedly, the BLA and LA strongly coded for the unfamiliarity of the rat - single neurons responded to the probe trial animals with firing rates 2-5x higher than to the task animals. This cross-region encoding of identity, reward and unfamiliarity was reactivated during social interaction in the new open-field environment, demonstrating that the learning was not context specific.

Previous work from our group has shown that knockdown of Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 (TOMM40), which encodes a component of the mitochondrial importer TOM complex, increases expression and activity of the nuclear receptor-family transcription factor, liver X receptor (LXR) in hepatocytes. As LXR agonists have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 activation, we confirmed the prediction that TOMM40 knockdown has this effect in THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. Further, we demonstrated that TOMM40 KD upregulates LXR-mediated macrophage expression of the ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes which encode transporters that promote cellular cholesterol efflux, the first step in reverse cholesterol transport to the liver. Taken together, these findings identify a novel mechanism whereby increased LXR activity induced by suppression of TOMM40 expression in macrophages may retard atherogenesis both by inhibiting inflammation and promoting reverse cholesterol transport.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

While antibiotic resistance is driving a renewed interest in phage therapy, most studies have been conducted in in vitro systems, offering limited insight into the complexity of such dynamics in physiological contexts. Here, we use Citrobacter rodentium (CR), a natural mouse-restricted enteric pathogen and well-established model for human enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) infections, to investigate phage-pathogen interactions in vivo. We isolate and characterise Eifel2, a novel lytic phage infecting CR, and generate anti-phage specific antibodies that enable the visualisation of phage infections in vitro. In a murine model of CR infection, oral administration of Eifel2 led to robust phage replication in the gut without reducing the bacterial burden or infection-associated inflammation, confirming the establishment of a stable coexistence in the gut. Despite the emergence of a sub-population of phage-resistant CR mutants in vivo, they did not undergo clonal expansion, indicating that additional selective pressures impaired their widespread dissemination in the gut. Together, our findings demonstrate that imaging approaches can capture key infection stages in vitro, while in vivo models are essential for capturing the complexity of phage-bacteria interactions.

Having confirmed a basal ATPase activity of PldP, we aimed to explore if the {Delta}pldP-related phenotype could be a consequence of the mislocalized secreted proteins, as the loss of extracellular proteins involved in cell wall metabolism results in a similar phenotype characterized by disrupted separation of daughter cells.

D.", "abstract": "The bait-lamina test is an easy and efficient method to quantify the feeding activity of soil invertebrates, commonly performed under field conditions to measure the impact of chemicals on soils. However, under natural conditions, feeding activity is also influenced by environmental factors such as soil moisture content. The extent of this influence on the results of the bait-lamina test is still poorly described and this can complicate their interpretation. In this study, we optimized the bait-lamina test under laboratory conditions, to assess the influence of soil moisture content on feeding activity of the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the enchytraeid Enchytraeus albidus, using LUFA 2.2 soil as a substrate. Feeding activity increased linearly with increasing soil moisture until a peak was reached, at a moisture content of 52 % of the maximum water holding capacity (WHC) for earthworms, and 68 % WHC for enchytraeids. Above the optimal moisture content, feeding activity was reduced and was less dependent on soil moisture. The increase in feeding activity up to the optimal moisture content was described by different slopes for the two species. Earthworms consumed the bait faster (on a per unit weight basis) than enchytraeids. Among the two species, the relationship established for E. albidus was the more similar to the response obtained in field conditions. Within the range of soil moistures considered by the model, our results demonstrate that feeding activity is positively correlated with soil moisture for two important soil invertebrates, but this increase, as well as the optimal soil moisture content, and the speed of bait consumption are species dependent. The model produced represents a first step for normalizing results from bait lamina tests in the field laying the foundation for future studies to validate its applicability across different soil types and field conditions.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

D.; Steinsaltz, D.", "abstract": "Developing population dynamic models that can flexibly adapt to different species remains a challenge due to the context-dependent nature of demographic studies. This work introduces ABC_GP IPM, a novel Integral Projection Model (IPM) framework, aimed at mitigating key limitations associated with traditional IPMs, including (i) reliance on predefined vital rate models with restrictive assumptions, (ii) omission of potential vital rate interactions, and (iii) limited flexibility in incorporating domain- or user-specific knowledge. The purpose of this work is to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of IPMs across various ecological and evolutionary studies. Our methodology integrates Gaussian Process (GP) models with Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). GP models introduce a non-parametric structure that accommodates a broader range of demographic patterns, reducing sensitivity to specific model choices. The incorporation of ABC methods allows IPMs to integrate additional population-level information, enabling potential interactions among vital rates to be reflected in model outcomes without requiring additional datasets. The information can be user-modified, facilitating the tailoring of IPMs to specific requirements or domain-specific knowledge. Recognising the inherent challenge of selecting appropriate summary statistics in ABC applications, we further propose a systematic procedure tailored to navigate this complexity effectively when applying ABC_GP to IPMs. The method demonstrated strong flexibility and adaptability across different modeling scenarios. In simulation studies, ABC_GP IPM showed notable improvements over traditional GLM-based IPMs across multiple population metrics commonly used in biological research. When applied to real-world datasets, the method captured complex demographic patterns more effectively, supporting its potential as a practical and adaptable alternative to existing IPM frameworks. The ABC_GP IPM framework provides greater flexibility in model specification, accommodating potential non-linearities with fewer assumptions. It also facilitates the incorporation of user expertise and domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its applicability to context-dependent demographic studies. While offering a more adaptable modeling approach, the method remains accessible to users without specialized expertise in statistical modeling. Importantly, ABC_GP IPM delivers these improved outcomes using identical datasets as standard IPMs, facilitating easier adoption for studies that have applied traditional IPMs.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

However, whether spinescence evolved primarily in response to herbivory, or whether abiotic conditions also played a role, remains unknown. We integrated phylogenetic, geographic, and trait data for 2,686 species of an ecologically diverse and spiny pantropical lineage, mimosoid legumes, with data for 235 extant and 185 extinct mammalian herbivores >10 kg. Using structural equation models, we assessed how herbivores, climate and fire directly and indirectly affected the proportion of spinescent mimosoids across global and continental assemblages. The proportion of spinescent mimosoids in assemblages increased with extant and extinct herbivore richness, drought and heat, while fire influenced spinescence indirectly, by affecting herbivore richness. Notably, correlations of spinescence differed between Africa and America, with increasing importance of extinct herbivores in Africa, illustrating legacy effects on spinescence. Megaherbivores have shaped spinescence in mimosoids, especially in dry environments, where losing plant tissues is costly. Spinescence originated ~35 Mya, with the transition of mimosoids to seasonally dry environments, pre-dating the Miocene expansion of savannas. Our study suggests that both long-term climatic transitions and the emergence of open, herbivore-rich landscapes played crucial roles in the evolution and distribution of spinescence.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

However, in heterogeneous environments, behavioural plasticity (a source of within-individual variation) may also contribute to the phenotypic variance that can be selected on. If so, a complete picture of evolutionary potential, requires estimation of genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE). Here we investigate the quantitative genetics of 'shy-bold' behavioural variation in the red cherry shrimp, Neocaridina davidi, an emerging decapod model for behavioural, genetic, and ecotoxicological research. Using a suite of behaviours associated with shy-bold personality variation we demonstrate moderate to high behavioural repeatabilities and show how a multivariate approach allows characterising the 'shape', not just the amount, of variation. Using a half-sib full sib breeding design in which shrimp from known families were tested under either control conditions or with predator (fish) cues present, we jointly estimate the plastic response to elevated risk, and the contribution of genetic factors to phenotypic variance. We find that genetic variance does underpin among-individual differences in behaviour. We also find evidence of plasticity, with individual shrimp shifting towards a 'shyer', or more risk averse, average phenotype in the presence of fish cues. However, we found no variation in plasticity either among-individuals (IxE) or among-genotypes (GxE). This implies that average behaviour can evolve under predator-mediated selection, but further adaptive evolution of behavioural plasticity may be constrained by a lack of GxE.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Therefore, developing DarG selective inhibitors may represent a promising and novel strategy to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, no small molecule inhibitors targeting DarG have been identified to date and establishing a high-throughput screening assay based on its DNA ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity would be challenging.

We generated a FRET pair of M. tuberculosis DarG macrodomain and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptide fused with compatible fluorophores. Screening the target-focused phenotypic library using this method led to the identification of pranlukast, which selectively inhibited the DNA ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of DarG in M. tuberculosis and its orthologues without affecting human mono-ADP-ribosyl binders and erasers.

Can the effects of teas with different fermentation levels and black coffee on the body be explored via the urine proteome? In this study, urine samples were collected from rats before and after seven consecutive days of consuming green tea, oolong tea, black tea, Pu-erh tea, or black coffee. Both before-and-after comparisons and between-group comparisons were performed, and the samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the urine proteome reflected the changes in rats after one week of consuming teas with different fermentation levels or black coffee. Biological processes and pathways enriched from differential proteins included fat cell differentiation, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, fatty acid transport, and immune response. Furthermore, the effects of teas with different fermentation levels and black coffee on the body exhibited a high degree of specificity. Additionally, several differential proteins identified in this study have been reported as biomarkers for diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This suggests that beverage consumption, including tea and black coffee, should be considered in clinical application of urine biomarkers of diseases and related studies. And the use of biomarker panels may be necessary to improve accuracy.

Antiviral drugs are inhaled as fine droplets or mist, forming a thin liquid film along the airway walls of critical areas where respiratory viruses initially reside. The method employs an Eulerian-Lagrangian discrete phase model (DPM) to track individual droplet trajectories, and combines with an Eulerian wall film (EWF) model to predict the formation of the liquid coating upon droplet impact. This strategy overcomes the limitations of previous investigations that relied solely on DPM and ignored post-impact drug behavior. The patient-specific analysis focuses on airflow dynamics, deposition efficiency, and surface coverage for 1-10 m particle sizes. It has been found that the large particles (10 m) deposit primarily in the upper airways due to inertial impaction, while smaller particles (1-3 m) reach deeper zones. The short and forceful breathings of COPD patients create complex asymmetric velocity distribution. As a result, even higher depositions are noticed along the upper airways (~5.28%) than the lower ones (~2.52%), limiting the drug penetration into deeper lung areas. For 10 m particles, the maximal area coverage for the ideal (55.2%) and healthy (63.5%) profiles is on the left lower lobe, while in COPD, coverage shifts toward the carina (71.5%). These findings signify optimization efforts, such as breath-actuated inhalers and pursed-lip breathing for COPD patients to enhance drug delivery efficacy.

This heterogeneity is primarily attributed to genetic and molecular variations among individuals and their tumors. Understanding the impact of these differences on treatment outcomes is widely believed to be a key step for developing effective precision medicine strategies. However, the complexity of most biological pathways makes it difficult to predict the effect of genetic variation on cells and tissues, let alone predict a patient's response to therapy. As a result, high-throughput genetic and chemical perturbation screens have emerged as valuable tools for precision medicine-related tasks, such as disease modeling, target discovery, cellular programming, and pathway reconstruction. This approach is fundamentally limited, however, because the number of possible combinations of cell types, cell states, perturbation targets, and perturbation types is huge and cannot be exhaustively tested experimentally. This calls for computational approaches that can simulate such experiments in silico, guiding in vitro experiments towards perturbations that are more likely to produce the desired effect.

K.", "abstract": "Inter-subject, pairwise similarity models provide a methodological resource for flexibly measuring complex, non-linear relationships between brain and behavior. Similarity models, however, can extend beyond brain behavior relationships and can be readily applied to any data where they may be useful. The work presented in this paper introduces a new way of modelling similarity, termed punctuated similarity, where dissimilarity is modelled at a specific point within a given sample of continuous data. With this model researchers can select a value at which they expect dissimilarity or similarity to occur and evaluate it against real similarity distributions. To demonstrate how this model works two separate experiments were conducted, the results of which are reported in this paper. The first investigated puberty as a critical time-point for growth in a sample of children aged five to nineteen obtained from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. The second investigated the COVID-19 pandemic as a critical time-point for market volatility in stock price data for market indices from seven different countries. Both experiments showed that the similarity model presented in this paper was effective at modelling critical time points for increased variance in stock market prices and growth development of children. Finally, this paper is accompanied by an open-source R library to recreate the similarity models presented, providing a tool for future researchers to use in their own analysis.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}
{"title": "GatorST: A Versatile Contrastive Meta-Learning Framework for Spatial Transcriptomic Data Analysis", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.01.662625", "authors": "Wang, S.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Song, Q.; Bian, J.", "abstract": "Introduction: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular functions by providing gene expression profiles with rich spatial context. Effectively learning spatial representations is crucial for downstream analyses and requires robust integration of spatial information with transcriptomic data. While existing methods have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture both local (neighbor-level) and global (tissue-wide) spatial contexts. Moreover, they tend to rely heavily on augmentation strategies, which can introduce noise and instability. Objectives: This study aims to introduce and demonstrate a novel, versatile framework called GatorST, which explicitly combines graph-based modeling with advanced learning strategies to generate spatially informed representations of ST data. GatorST is designed to improve various downstream tasks, including identification of spatial domains, gene expression imputation, batch effect removal, and trajectory inference. Methods: GatorST constructs a spot-spot graph by connecting each node to its k nearest spatial neighbors and extracts two-hop neighborhood subgraphs to capture local context. At the global level, gene expression profiles are clustered using soft K-means to generate pseudo-labels, which serve as weak supervision signals within a contrastive learning framework. This process encourages the alignment of embeddings with shared pseudo-labels while separating those with different labels. GatorST further adopts an episodic training strategy inspired by meta-learning, wherein each episode consists of a support set for contrastive optimization and a disjoint query set for embedding classification, guided by the pseudo-labeled data. This design enables the model to classify unseen samples based on learned embeddings, thereby enhancing its generalization to new spatial contexts. Results: Comprehensive comparisons with fifteen state-of-the-art methods across fourteen spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that GatorST consistently achieves superior performance in identifying spatial domains, imputing gene expressions, and removing batch effects. The results showcase the versatility and strong generalization capabilities of GatorST across diverse tissue types and experimental settings. Conclusion: GatorST effectively integrates spatial topology and global gene expression through graph-based modeling, pseudo-labeling, and contrastive meta-learning. This framework generates biologically meaningful representations and significantly improves key downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, gene expression imputation, batch effect removal, and trajectory inference.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Brewer, G. J.; Digman, M. A.", "abstract": "Lipid homeostasis plays a crucial role in neuronal function, yet its dynamics during aging and neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood. Our study unveils critical age-related changes in lipid polarity and lipid droplet characteristics in hippocampal neurons from non-transgenic (NTg) mice and from an Alzheimer's disease-model (3xTg-AD). Using advanced spectral imaging and phasor analysis techniques, we tracked lipid polarity with Nile Red in vitro across various cellular compartments and quantified lipid droplet features. We discovered that NTg neurons exhibit a progressive increase in global lipid polarity from young to middle age, followed by a slight decrease in old age. This pattern suggests that neurons actively regulate their lipid composition throughout the lifespan, potentially in response to changing cellular needs. In contrast, AD-like (or 3xTg-AD) neurons fail to show this age-related increase in lipid polarity, instead displaying a consistent reduction in lipid polarity across all ages. Lipid droplet analysis revealed a transient accumulation of larger droplets in middle-aged NTg neurons, while AD-transgenic neurons showed early and persistent increases in lipid droplet size and number. Principal component analysis uncovered coordinated changes in lipid polarity and droplet characteristics, highlighting distinct patterns of lipid partitioning in NTg and AD-affected neurons. These findings suggest that AD-associated genetic modifications disrupt normal age-related adaptations in lipid metabolism and organization. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between lipid homeostasis, aging, and AD-genotypic stress. Understanding these dynamics may open new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies to maintain neuronal health and potentially slow AD progression.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

K.; Zhao, L.; Buscher, K.; Solanki, S.; Renslo, A.; Shah, Y. M.; Hsu, P. P.", "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. CRC tumors exhibit aberrant iron accumulation, which supports tumor cell proliferation through multiple metabolic pathways. However, the oncogenic benefits of elevated iron must be counterbalanced by its potential to catalyze oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species generated from labile, redox-active iron. Ferroptosis is a regulated, non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process is tightly controlled by the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid peroxides and can be pharmacologically inhibited by agents such as RSL3 and JKE1674. A key source of redox-active iron is the labile iron pool (LIP), yet its role in regulating ferroptosis remains incompletely defined. To examine this, we supplemented CRC cells with exogenous iron following pharmacologic induction of ferroptosis. Iron supplementation significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting that expansion of the LIP potentiates ferroptotic cell death. However, whether ferroptosis is accompanied by dynamic changes in the LIP, and if such changes are mechanistically required for its potentiation, was unknown. To further characterize this response, we profiled the expression of iron regulatory genes under ferroptotic conditions and observed no change in transcriptional response in iron homeostasis genes. When using a fluorescent probe for labile iron, we found that the LIP did not measurably increase during ferroptosis induction. These findings suggest that the LIP itself does not expand after the initiation of ferroptosis to become the primary driver of ferroptotic potentiation.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Dual genetic ablation of PTPN1/2 in cancer cells enhances Type I and II interferon signaling, MHCI and CXCL9 expression, and sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated killing. The small-molecule inhibitor KQ791 phenocopies these effects and synergizes with anti-PD1 therapy to suppress tumor growth in murine models, including immunotherapy-refractory cancers. Mechanistically, PTPN1/2 loss augments STAT1/3/5 signaling and primes cancer cells for immunogenic cell death via IFNg/TNFa induced pathways. Moreover, PTPN1/2 inhibition enhances antigen release and cross-presentation, promoting robust antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses.

Using a multimodal imaging workflow that combines enhanced darkfield hyperspectral imaging (EDF-HSI) with confocal immunofluorescence for microglia (CD68/Iba1) and amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques (Thioflavin S), we mapped the localization and spectral properties of UFPM in situ. UFPM accumulation was elevated in TRAP-exposed females, suggesting sex-specific vulnerability in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability or particle retention. Particles near plaques showed red-shifted spectral signatures, consistent with biochemical transformation. Dimension reduction revealed clustering of particle spectra by TRAP exposure and plaque proximity. However, UFPM was rarely found within plaques or microglia, implying indirect neuroimmune modulation.

We analysed liver and monocyte kinome profiles in a chronic ethanol-fed pre-clinical rat model to identify therapeutic targets that could mitigate inflammation in ALD. Method: Kinome profile was performed in liver and circulating monocytes at baseline, and after 8,12,16,20 and 24-weeks of 40% ethanol administration. Pathway-specific inhibitors, including PS1145 (IKK-phosphorylation inhibitor), PH-797804 (MAPK14 inhibitor), resveratrol and prednisolone were tested for their anti-inflammatory effects in ALD-rats, PBMC from patients and NIAAA mouse model. Results: Kinome profiling identified 497 liver and 345 monocyte kinases in ALD rats (FDR<0.01). A time-dependent increase in MAPK14-associated kinases was observed in both tissues (FC>1.5, p<0.05). By 24 weeks, 172 liver and 48 monocyte kinases were significantly upregulated, particularly those linked to MyD88-TLR4, PI3K-Akt, TNF, TGFB and cellular senescence pathways. Key contributors included TGFBR1, ROS-generating kinases, and IL-1-driven MAPK14 and IKK phosphorylation. Targeting this axis, PS1145 (an IKK inhibitor) suppressed NFKB activation and inflammation in THP1 and HepG2 cells, as well as PBMCs from healthy and SAH patients, outperforming PH797804, resveratrol, and prednisolone (p<0.05, FC>1.5). PS1145 significantly reduced IL-6, TNFA, and NFK;B, while increasing IL-10. In vivo, PS1145 treatment in the NIAAA mouse model markedly reduced hepatic steatosis, cellular stress and inflammatory pathways (cytokine signalling, IL-36 signalling and others) more effectively than standard therapies, Notably, it also downregulated IL36R, impairing TLR receptor dimerization, suggesting a dual mechanism of action (p<0.05) highlighting its therapeutic potential in ameliorating systemic inflammation in ALD. Conclusion: Our study highlights the key role of MAPK14 and MYD88-TLR4 pathway kinases in driving systemic inflammation in SAH. The IKK inhibitor PS1145, by blocking both IKK phosphorylation and TLR dimerization, effectively suppresses inflammatory signalling and improves liver pathology, positioning it as a promising targeted therapy for ALD.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

L.; Smith, M.; Farmer, B.; Yankey, K.; Howard, T.; Kraft, G.; Cherrington, A.; Edgerton, D.", "abstract": "The second meal phenomenon refers to the improved glycemic response observed after consuming a second identical meal. It is well known that postprandial hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) is determined by the combined effects of three regulatory factors: insulin action (hyperinsulinemia; HI), glucose effectiveness (hyperglycemia; GE), and glucose delivery into the hepatoportal circulation (portal glucose signal; PGS). While our previous studies demonstrated the importance of morning (AM) hyperinsulinemia in priming the liver for increased HGU later in the day, the question remains as to which aspect of the afternoon (PM) response is enhanced by morning insulin. Thus, to provide insight into the underlying mechanism of the 2nd meal effect, we sought to determine the extent to which PM HI, GE, and the PGS are impacted by AM hyperinsulinemia. Dogs underwent an AM clamp with either a 4h hyperinsulinemic prime (Prime, n=8) or basal insulin delivery (No Prime, n=8). After a 1.5h non-clamp period, both groups were challenged with a PM hyperglycemic clamp (with the PGS) in the presence of basal insulin. During the PM clamp, net HGU was significantly elevated in Prime vs. No Prime group (mean of 2.2{+/-}0.3 vs. 0.1{+/-}0.3 mg/kg/min, respectively, P<0.005), indicating an enhancement of GE and/or the PGS. There was no difference in PM non-HGU (4.5{+/-}0.3 vs. 4.0{+/-}0.3 mg/kg/min). In previous experiments, when all three factors (HI, GE, PGS) were present in the PM, net HGU was 6.3{+/-}1.7 vs. 2.4{+/-}1.1 mg/kg/min in groups receiving an AM insulin prime vs. basal insulin, respectively. Therefore, the AM insulin prime enhanced the effects of HI, GE, and the PGS on PM HGU by 3.9 mg/kg/min, whereas it enhanced the effects of glucose (GE and the PGS), in the absence of a rise in insulin, by 2.1 mg/kg/min. Taken together, the data show that AM HI enhanced PM insulin action and GE (including the PGS) to an equal extent. This suggests that AM insulin priming enhances cellular targets common to both insulin and glucose signaling in the PM.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Pregnant CD1 mice were exposed daily to {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant cannabis smoke (12-14% THC, 0-2% CBD) or filtered air from embryonic day (E)6.5 to E18.5 or parturition.

Moreover, Cyp1a1, a smoke-inducible enzyme, was induced by 4-fold in cannabis smoke-exposed placentae. No changes in offspring body weights were observed; however, there was a marked decrease in the brain-to-body weight ratio of exposed postnatal day 1 (PND1) offspring.

Key trophoblast differentiation markers (Tfap2c, Tpbpa, Pcdh12) and placental endocrine regulators (Pl2, Igf1r) were significantly downregulated following cannabis smoke exposure in placentas. Furthermore, transcript levels of placental nutrient and vascularization markers, Glut1, Vegfa and Pparg were significantly decreased in cannabis smoke-exposed placentas.

Here, we demonstrate that hybrid seed from synthetically induced apomictic sorghum hybrids can be generated and maintained across multiple seed generations. This was achieved through the combination of avoidance of meiosis and induced parthenogenesis. Avoidance of meiosis was generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the sorghum meiosis genes Spo11, Rec8, and OsdL1 and OsdL3. Parthenogenesis was induced in the resultant diploid egg cell using a maize egg cell promoter to express the Cenchrus ASGR-BBML2 gene coding sequence. Two strategies incorporating these components were used to induce synthetic apomixis in two different sorghum hybrids. Each hybrid used Tx623 as a female parent and either Tx430 or the African landrace Macia as a male parent. Seed yields in the induced apomictic hybrids were consistent and stable for multiple generations following self-pollination but reduced relative to the sexual hybrids. Sorghum contains two copies of the Osd1 gene that function in meiotic non-reduction. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of both OsdL1 and OsdL3 loci was sufficient to produce clonal hybrid progeny in conjunction with the other apomixis induction components, but this led to a significant reduction in seed set. By contrast, a single in-frame edit of either OsdL1 or OsdL3 significantly improved seed set of clonal hybrid progeny. Fine-tuning OsdL activity appears to be essential to optimizing fertility. As the efficiency of seed set in the induced synthetic sorghum apomicts was lower than that of the sexual hybrid control, additional improvements are required to unlock the agronomic potential of synthetically induced apomictic sorghum in the field.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Our previous studies using the Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse model of NDDs demonstrated that nighttime light exposure increases behaviors such as excessive grooming, reduces social interactions, and disrupts daily locomotor rhythms. To further evaluate the effects of nighttime light exposure, we exposed wild-type (WT) and Cntnap2 KO mice to an ultradian lighting cycle (T7), which alternates 3.5 hours of light and 3.5 hours of darkness. Circadian rhythms in activity, corticosterone levels, and clock gene expression are maintained under T7 lighting despite the presence of light during the usual night phase, whilst animals display increased depressive-like behaviors and reduce performance on the novel object recognition test. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that T7 lighting would mimic the impact of nighttime light exposure seen in standard light-dark cycles with dim light at night (DLaN). However, in this study, adult WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under the T7 cycle did not show the increased grooming behavior or reduced social interaction observed in Cntnap2 KO mice exposed to DLaN. Regarding locomotor activity rhythms, the T7 cycle lengthened the circadian period and weakened the rhythm amplitude but did not abolish rhythmicity in either genotype. Finally, opposite to DLaN, neither the T7 cycle nor constant darkness (DD) elicited an increase in cFos expression in the basolateral amygdala in WT and KO mice. These results demonstrate that the adverse behavioral and neurobiological effects of nighttime light exposure in a model of a neurodevelopmental disorder depend on circadian disruption rather than light exposure alone, highlighting the importance of circadian stability as a protective factor in NDDS.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Two critical aspects remain underexplored: the choice of binning window (i.e., grouping data into time intervals) and the statistical treatment of the interdependencies among sleep phases. While one-hour bins are commonly used, this choice is often based on convention rather than empirical justification. Additionally, sleep architecture data are typically expressed as proportions of time spent in each sleep phase, forming compositional datasets, non-negative values that represent parts of a whole and are constrained by a constant sum (e.g., 100%). Such data violate the assumptions of traditional statistical methods, yet their compositional nature is often overlooked, compromising analytical validity. In this study, we address two key methodological challenges in sleep architecture analysis: (1) determining the optimal binning window through a data-driven approach that balances information retention and noise reduction, and (2) applying isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation to account for the compositional structure of the data, enabling the use of conventional statistical tests.

The Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) pathway is an important functional regulator of microglia in AD, promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, debris and pathogenic proteins including amyloid beta. Additionally, genome-wide association studies have identified risk bearing polymorphisms in several members of the pathway including INPP5D, encoding the inositol phosphatase SHIP1. Recent studies utilising in vitro macrophage and microglia models and preclinical mouse models have identified a role for SHIP1 in both modulating TREM2 signalling and modulating neurotoxic microglial activation. In this study, we characterised the role of SHIP1 in regulating TREM2 signalling and global microglial functions using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived macrophages as a physiologically-relevant in vitro model of microglia. Isogenic parent and SHIP1 knockout (SHIP1 KO) lines were generated and macrophage phenotype and functions investigated. Knocking out SHIP1 was associated with a decreased expression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-receptor CD14, which translated to lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines on stimulation with LPS. Additionally, SHIP1 KO hiPSC-derived macrophages showed decreased signalling upon TREM2 stimulation, which was further reflected in a reduced level of phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons compared to the parental line. The observed attenuated TREM2 signalling did not correspond to decreased TREM2 protein levels nor increased shedding of the receptor. Examination of macrophage scavenger receptor expression revealed reduced cell surface levels of CD163 and CD206 involved in resolution of inflammation but increased levels of the phagocytic receptor MerTK, while morphological analysis revealed a less amoeboid activated phenotype and increased adhesion.

The clinical relevance of AIM2 in asthma is supported by analysis of blood or endobronchial biopsies from patients with severe asthma, showing increased AIM2 but not NLRP3 expression.

AIM2 expression was elevated in lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from allergen-induced groups compared to controls. In the OVA-LPS model, deletion of Aim2 led to reduced airway smooth muscle actin expression and DNA damage, contributing to decreased AHR and lung inflammation in whole body Aim2-/- mice. Surprisingly, cell-specific deletion in CD4+ T cells but not regulatory T cells or myeloid cells significantly affected AHR, indicating AIM2 in CD4+ T cells is a main driver of pathogenesis. Additionally, in HDM-induced asthma, Aim2-/- mice also exhibited reduced AHR. Cell-specific deletion reveals that AIM2 in CD4+ T cells promotes AHR and cytokine production, while AIM2 in myeloid cells modulates IgG1 levels and IL-13-producing CD4+ T cells, and the percentage of alveolar macrophages in BALF. These findings reveal that AIM2 differentially regulates HDM-induced allergic asthma through distinct exacerbating roles in T cells and myeloid cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGF{beta} and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

J.; Coute, Y.; Eves-van den Akker, S.", "abstract": "Background - The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, is a highly destructive parasite that manipulates host plant processes through effector proteins, affecting agriculture globally. Despite advances in genomic and transcriptomic studies, the regulatory mechanisms controlling effector gene expression, especially at the chromatin level, are still poorly understood. Gene regulation studies in plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) face several challenges, including the absence of transformation systems and technical barriers in chromatin preparation, particularly for transcription factors (TFs) expressed in secretory gland cells. Conventional methods like Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) are limited in PPN due to low chromatin yields, the impermeability of nematode cuticles, and difficulties in producing antibodies for low-abundance TFs. These issues call for alternative approaches, such as dCas9-based CAPTURE (CRISPR Affinity Purification in siTU of Regulatory Elements) that allows studying chromatin interactions by using a catalytically inactive dCas9 protein to target specific genomic loci without relying on antibodies. Results - This study presents an optimized in vitro dCas9-based CAPTURE for M. incognita that addresses key challenges in chromatin extraction and stability. The protocol focuses on the promoter region of the effector gene 6F06, a critical gene for parasitism. Several optimizations were made, including improvements in nematode disruption, chromatin extraction, and protein-DNA complex stability. This method successfully isolated chromatin-protein complexes and identified four putative chromatin-associated proteins, including BANF1, linked to chromatin remodelling complexes like SWI/SNF. Conclusion - The optimized in vitro dCas9-based CAPTURE protocol offers a new tool for investigating chromatin dynamics and regulatory proteins in non-transformable nematodes. This method expands the scope of effector gene regulation research and provides new insights into parasitism in M. incognita. Future research will aim to validate these regulatory proteins and extend the method to other effector loci, potentially guiding the development of novel nematode control strategies.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Our analysis of 42 adjacent surface sediment sample replicates shows that deeper, central samples, with reduced influence from aquatic taxa, exhibit greater taxonomic richness compared to near-shore samples. By comparing these results to systematic vegetation surveys, we demonstrate that central cores are optimal as they capture the main taxonomic richness in the catchment, while marginal samples near inflows are essential for detecting rarer, spatially restricted taxa.

We developed a multiscale model linking pooled Ct values to mosquito viral kinetics, bird-to-mosquito transmission, and seasonal force of infection.

This study investigated the diversity, distribution, and pathogenicity of Fusarium species associated with cotton and corn fields across 10 counties in the Northern High Plains. A total of nine Fusarium species were isolated: F. incarnatum, F. equiseti, F. solani, F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. clavum, F. oxysporum, F. flocciferum, and one unidentified Fusarium sp. The highest species diversity was observed in Sherman County. Fusarium solani was the most frequently isolated species (39%) across all counties, followed by F. equiseti (22%), while F. flocciferum was the least frequent (2%). Pathogenicity assays conducted under greenhouse conditions showed that F. incarnatum caused significantly higher disease severity on aerial parts of cotton, while F. flocciferum and F. proliferatum caused significantly higher disease severity on roots. On corn, F. proliferatum caused significantly higher disease severity. Fusarium isolates were recovered from both symptomatic and asymptomatic roots following pathogenicity trials, suggesting endophytic colonization. This study revealed a complex Fusarium community capable of cross-infecting cotton and corn, with implications for regional disease management. The absence of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum race 4 indicates that it may not yet have been introduced into the Northern High Plains; however, continued surveillance is warranted given its detection in New Mexico and adjacent counties in Texas.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

D.; Steinsaltz, D.", "abstract": "Many complex systems are modelled using modular models, where individual sub-models are estimated separately and then combined. While this simplifies inference, it fails to account for interactions between components. A natural solution is to estimate all components jointly, but this is often impractical due to intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides a likelihood-free alternative, but its standard implementations are computationally inefficient, particularly when applied to high-dimensional modular models, or when sub-models involve costly machine learning methods, like Gaussian Process (GP) models. The ABC-Population Monte Carlo (ABC-PMC) framework improves on vanilla ABC by using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with adaptive tolerances and proposal kernels, yielding much higher acceptance rates and more efficient exploration of parameter space. Existing ABC-PMC algorithms are not, however, especially efficient in the high-dimensional parameter setting typical of modular models. We introduce a novel modification of the ABC-PMC method that leverages model modularity. Our approach refines the prior distribution and perturbation kernel by using precomputed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from individual sub-models, making parameter updates more efficient. Additionally, we employ an adaptive summary statistic weighting strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution of different statistics, reducing the influence of less informative statistics. These modifications greatly reduce overall computational cost. In our case studies, the runtime for 10,000 simulation attempts drops from over 20 days to under 1 minute, following a one-off preprocessing step that consists of standard MCMC sampling for each sub-model (typically 3-10 hours, depending on model complexity). We apply our method to an ecological case study using an Integral Projection Model (IPM) for Cryptantha flava, where survival, growth, and reproduction processes are modelled using GP models. The results of the simulated and the real case studies demonstrate greatly improved computational efficiency while preserving inference quality. While the case study focuses on ecology, the method is applicable to a broad range of modular models where capturing interactions among sub-models is essential.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

We studied Arabis nemorensis and A. sagittata, two endangered species that currently hybridize in a single hotspot. We measured 22 phenotypic traits and mapped their genetic basis in an F2 population, after generating high quality genome assemblies for both species. In total, 58 QTLs were identified for 20 traits, with additive and dominance effects best fitting Gaussian and logistic distributions, respectively. Six large-effect QTLs were linked to significant hybrid fitness loss. Two genomic regions showed strong transmission bias favoring A. sagittata alleles, potentially accelerating their introgression. However, 48% of QTLs were unlinked to reduced fitness or segregation distortion and may generate genotypes exceeding parental performance. Notably, a major QTL affecting flowering time explained 23% of phenotypic variation and implicated TFL1 as a candidate gene for life history adaptation. While most QTLs lacked overlap with past selective sweeps, indicating limited recent positive selection, 5 of 7 QTLs for rosette size overlapped with sweep signatures in the parental lineages.

However, lmx1bb expression in median fins is unaffected by removal of the LARM, suggesting its regulation is an evolutionary innovation specific to the paired appendages.

Here, we aim to investigate the genetic relationships between the Corinthian metropolis and the Amvrakia colony, the contribution of the local population to the founding genetic pool, as well as the demography of Amvrakia in subsequent periods. During its foundation in the Archaic period, Amvrakia appears to have been shaped by genetic influences from at least two different sources. The first source migrated from the Corinth territory, represented by the Archaic Tenea population and is supported via an Identity By Descent (IBD) analysis. The second source shows a direct ancestry from Late Bronze Age (LBA)/Iron Age Greece, including a local LBA population represented by the Ammotopos site located in close proximity to Amvrakia, as shown by a plethora of independent population genomics analyses. During the subsequent Classical and Hellenistic periods, the population of Amvrakia appears to have slightly differentiated, yet evidence of genetic continuity over time is observed.

Among these secreted factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) amplify key stages of angiogenesis. Disruptions in their secretion have been implicated in poor vascular network formation. Current methods for exploring variations in the phased presentation of multiple different proteins are limited, which has restricted our ability to explore the effect of growth factor timing on angiogenesis. To address this knowledge gap, we developed affibodies, which are alpha-helical binding proteins, to phase the release of VEGF-165, FGF-2, and PDGF-BB from a single drug delivery vehicle via specific protein-affibody affinity interactions. We used yeast surface display to engineer three VEGF-, three FGF-2-, and two PDGF-specific affibodies with different affinities for their target proteins. We demonstrated that the cumulative release of VEGF and FGF-2 are inversely correlated with the strength of the protein-affibody affinity interaction and that hydrogels containing multiple protein-specific affibodies can independently control the release of VEGF, FGF-2, and PDGF, largely in accordance with the strength of the affinity interactions. Using a rat-derived intact microvascular fragment model of in vitro angiogenesis, we revealed that sequential delivery of soluble VEGF, followed by FGF-2, and then PDGF enhances vascular network formation and branching. We then designed an affibody-conjugated hydrogel to mimic this sequence of protein delivery, resulting in increased vascular branching and network length compared to all other hydrogel compositions and the sequential delivery of soluble growth factors.

Here, we propose a visual-like template diffusion method, named TDFold, to achieve accurate and highly efficient single-sequence 3D structure prediction for proteins. Given a protein sequence, TDFold initially generates high-quality inter-residue geometries (distances and orientations) as templates from a probabilistic diffusion perspective. Since inter-residue geometries can be encoded as multi-channel feature matrices (each channel for either the inter-residue distance or orientation correlation), analogous to image features, we construct an image-level template diffusion module by adapting the stable diffusion (SD) model from text-vision generation to sequence-template diffusion for proteins. Subsequently, a lightweight sequence-template co-evolved learning (SCL) network is constructed to facilitate accurate and efficient protein structure prediction. As a result, TDFold possesses three highlights: (i) better single-sequence prediction performance: TDFold greatly outperforms existing protein language models (PLMs), including ESMFold (also known as ESM2), OmegaFold, trRosettaX-Single, and RGN2, on homology-insufficient datasets such as Orphan and Orphan25, while also achieving promising results on the popular CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks; (ii) low resource consumption: By utilizing the lightweight SCL architecture, the GPU memory consumption of TDFold is generally lower than that of popular methods such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold; (iii) higher efficiency in training and inference: TDFold can be trained within a week using a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Furthermore, the inference time of TDFold is significantly shorter (about 10x to 100x) than that of existing methods (ESMFold and AlphaFold2) for long protein sequences.

While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually-curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

This study aims to measure the force exerted by the kinesin-3 motor protein KIF1A, mutations of which cause KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND) and are associated with reduced force and motility. Unlike kinesin-1, KIF1A detaches easily under perpendicular loads, which can occur in optical tweezers experiments.

While their effects on tumor growth and survival have been widely investigated, their impact on immune checkpoint regulation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) and a high-CBD extract (CBD-HCE) on the expression of HLA-G in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells. HLA-G is a non-classical HLA class I molecule associated with immune escape in tumors. Both CBD and CBD-HCE were found to reduce cell proliferation and migration, increase apoptosis, and significantly downregulate HLA-G expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. This inhibitory effect was observed to be both dose- and time-dependent, and it was completely reversible after the treatment was removed, indicating a dynamic and CBD-dependent modulation. These results provide the first experimental evidence of HLA-G downregulation by CBD and CBD-HCE, highlighting a novel immunomodulatory mechanism with potential therapeutic implications. By simultaneously targeting tumor cell viability and immune evasion, CBD-based compounds may enhance antitumor immune responses and improve the efficacy of immunotherapies.

Systematic nanozyme screening identified iridium (Ir) as a dual RO/NS scavenger that inhibits alpha-synuclein (aSyn) preformed fibrils (PFF)-induced propagation. In contrast, we discovered that incorporating copper (Cu), a known environmental neurotoxicant, consistently transforms various nanozymes into potent RNS generators. This effect was so pronounced that our copper-doped iridium nanozyme (Ir3Cu), despite its excellent ROS-scavenging capabilities, paradoxically and significantly exacerbated aSyn pathology by amplifying RNS. This RNS-driven pathology was confirmed mechanistically: pharmacological RNS inhibition blocked the exacerbated pathology, while transcriptomics revealed that the Ir3Cu+PFF treatment exacerbated a Parkinson-like gene trajectory which was robustly reversed by the same inhibition. Consequently, the broadly-scavenging, Cu-free Ir nanozyme, demonstrated robust efficacy in diverse alpha-synucleinopathy models, including brain-first, body-first, and co-pathology.

We previously developed a mouse model of GC-OHT delivering the potent GC dexamethasone (DEX) and observed strain-specific disparities in the development of GC-OHT. We now compare phenotypic and transcriptomic differences between five genetically distinct inbred mouse strains to identify biomarkers of GC susceptibility, and to better understand the molecular mechanisms of GC-OHT.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain tumor that is associated with a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options. Previous findings suggest that cannflavins can produce promising effects for pancreatic and bladder cancers, but the efficacy of these phytochemicals in attacking brain tumour cells remains unknown. Our study evaluates the potential of cannflavin A and cannflavin B against GBM cells using a range of in vitro approaches. Results: We conducted experiments using A-172 and U-87 GBM lines to assess the impact of cannflavins A and B on cell viability, cycle, migration, and invasion capacity. Our results revealed a consistent dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in both lines after the addition of cannflavin B to the culture media. Interestingly, we found that chrysoeriol (the non-prenylated synthesis precursor of cannflavins in the Cannabis sativa plant) only has a limited adverse effect on survival using the same approach, while techtochrysin (an O-methylated flavone) has none. Using time-lapse live-cell imaging and a scratch assay, we also show that cannflavins can inhibit tumor cell migration at concentrations below those that produce significant cell death.

Understanding thermal physiology is critical for predicting how commercially and ecologically important populations could be affected by the increasing risk of rising temperatures. Heatwave risk assessments often examine extremities of time scales: immediate impacts or long-term consequences. However, little is known about how consistently increasing mid-term thermal stress shapes aerobic performance in commercially important species such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which may face heat stress in rivers, especially at the juvenile life stage. By measuring how salmon juveniles manage their aerobic capacity at 16, 19 and 22 {degrees}C using intermittent respirometry, we test if their thermal performance curve shows a decline at temperatures commonly occurring during heatwaves. Whole-animal metabolism was measured from control individuals kept at 16 {degrees}C before and after the heatwave, and after 4-5 days exposure at 19 and 22 {degrees}C during the heatwave. We show that standard metabolic rate increases with temperature, but maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope do not change between these temperatures. These findings suggest that juvenile Atlantic salmon may have limited capacity to increase aerobic performance during moderate heatwaves, leaving them vulnerable to cumulative effects of oxygen limitation to vital functions such as growth and stress responses. As climate change intensifies, incorporating thermal performance curves into conservation strategies can be utilized for predicting population resilience and informing effective management.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Existing ex vivo placental support models study the organ in isolation, without the uterus and fetus. We report our early experience with a novel model of extracorporeal placental support by perfusing a sheep's gravid uterus. METHODS A sheep gravid hysterectomy was performed after cannulating the uterine vessels. The isolated uterus was maintained in a warm crystalloid tank. Oxygenation, electrolyte supplementation, and glucose were provided through an extracorporeal life support circuit, while monitoring the fetal heart rate and pressure. Our primary objective was to establish the feasibility of the model, confirm the ability to transition the organ to ex vivo support (fetal survival for >30 minutes after hysterectomy), and measure the duration of fetal survival after uterine explantation. RESULTS A total of 51 surgeries were performed, and 76% were successfully transitioned to extracorporeal support. Growing experience throughout the study period led to technical adaptations and more prolonged survival. Uteri with a singleton fetus had longer mean survival times, when compared to twins (253 minutes vs. 104 minutes, p=.019). Anemia and coagulopathy were frequently encountered, and most of the uteri had significant clot formation around the placentomes at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION Using a model of extracorporeal placental support in sheep, we were able to maintain a live fetus within the uterus for more than 16 hours after hysterectomy. This technique is feasible and could provide an avenue to study fetoplacental physiology in an ex vivo environment.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

G.; Saez, P. L.; Cavieres, L. A.", "abstract": "Temperature significantly influences plant morphology and photosynthesis at high altitudes, shaping distinct altitudinal patterns. Lower temperatures at higher elevations typically increase leaf mass per unit area (LMA), potentially reducing mesophyll CO2 diffusion (gm) and chloroplast CO2 availability, which can limit photosynthetic rates (AN). However, most evidence comes from field studies where elevation-related factors, like gas pressure, water, and light, covary. Habitat type further affects plant responses, as wetland (azonal) plants may be more sensitive to thermal changes due to water buffering effect on temperature fluctuations. To isolate temperature effects, we conducted a controlled experiment with plants from two elevations (2600 and 3550 m a.s.l.), exposing them to two daytime temperatures (15 and 20 {degrees}C). We measured LMA, gm, and AN . Growth temperature significantly influenced photosynthesis and gm but not LMA. Plant origin and habitat type (zonal vs. azonal) also shaped responses. Our findings reveal that temperature impacts photosynthesis by altering mesophyll diffusion independently of LMA. Furthermore, adaptations to specific elevations and environments, such as wetlands, contribute to the variability in responses.

The developmental and metabolic aspects of trichomes have not been studied in banana (Musa acuminata). In the present study, we report that banana cultivars with AAA genome contain trichomes on inflorescence stalk. Transcriptome analysis of epidermal tissues of trichome-rich and trichome-free banana cultivars suggested that genes concerning defence response and specialized metabolism are differentially regulated. Based on the gene expression and phylogenetic analysis, two transcription factors, MaTFR (trichome and flavonol related R2R3-MYB) and MaHDZIV6 (HDZIP-IV), were identified as candidate regulators of trichome development. Both genes partially complemented the glabrous phenotype of trichome-related mutants of Arabidopsis. Transient overexpression and silencing in banana embryogenic cells (ECS) suggested that both MaTFR and MaHDZIV6 regulate the transcription of flavonol biosynthesis genes and modulate flavonoids content. Furthermore, MaTFR was found to directly activate the expression of MaHDZIV6. Trichome-enriched cultivars have enhanced active JA content compared to trichome-free cultivar suggesting the involvement of JA signalling in regulating trichome development. Two JAZ repressors, MaJAZ5 and MaJAZ8 interacted with MaTFR and attenuated the flavonoid biosynthesis.

Now, growing evidence suggests that cycles longer than circadian, so-called \"multidien\" cycles, are of crucial importance in physiological fluctuations spanning multiple days with repercussions in health and disease. Unlike circadian clocks, multidien cycles may not be genetically encoded, given their heterogeneity within and across individuals and systems. Here, we propose that multidien cycles may be generated by the interaction between partially-coupled circadian oscillators. To demonstrate this possibility theoretically, we use a ring model of coupled circadian oscillators and study how synchrony within this network evolves over time. We found that a free-running, about-weekly period robustly emerges from the network's dynamics. A range of additional multidien cycles resulted from subtle variations in the coupling parameters within the network with periodicities reminiscent of those observed across different species. Thus, our model of emergent multidien cycles from partial circadian synchrony constitutes a credible hypothesis for explaining the timing of a myriad of events on the scale of weeks and months in health and disease.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence indicates that lysosomal dysfunction within ATMs exacerbates lipid retention, promoting the release of anti-lipolytic factors that suppress adipocyte lipolysis and perpetuate adipose dysfunction. In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the immune receptor CD300e in this regulatory network. Using a Cd300e -/- mouse model under high-fat diet conditions, we demonstrate that loss of CD300e exacerbates adipocyte hypertrophy, aggravates hepatic steatosis, and impairs glucose and insulin tolerance. Mechanistically, CD300e-deficient ATMs exhibit increased lipid accumulation, while adipocytes shift toward enhanced lipogenesis and reduced lipolysis. These findings advance our knowledge on immunometabolic crosstalk governing metabolic homeostasis within adipose tissue and identify CD300e as a critical sensor modulating lipid handling in ATMs, thus maintaining the metabolic dialogue between these cells and adipocytes.

However, the molecular mechanisms within inflamed joints that link innate and adaptive immune activation remain poorly defined. This study aimed to define the transcriptional and clonal landscape of synovial CD4 T cells in sJIA and to identify inflammatory signals driving their differentiation. Methods Synovial fluid CD4 T cells from patients with sJIA and oligo/polyarticular JIA (o/p-JIA) were analyzed using flow cytometry, scRNA and TCR sequencing. Cytokine secretion and B helper function were assessed in vitro. The effects of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 on T cell differentiation were evaluated using bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex ELISA. Results sJIA joints harbored a dominant population of clonally expanded CD4 T cells with a T helper (Tph) cell state, marked by IL-21 and CXCL13 expression and robust B cell help. scRNA-seq revealed a heterogeneous CD4 T cell landscape, with transcriptional convergence of Tph and regulatory (Treg) programs particularly in sJIA. A subset of these cells exhibited molecular features consistent with differentiation from Tph precursors. In vitro, IL-1{beta} and IL-18 promoted Tph differentiation, aligning with the transcriptional profiles of expanded effector Tph cells observed in sJIA joints. Conclusion These findings identify Tph cell-driven adaptive immunity as a key feature of chronic arthritis in sJIA and link IL-1{beta} and IL-18 to Tph cell induction. This challenges the classical autoinflammatory paradigm and suggests that early cytokine-targeted therapy may modulate T cell fate and disease course.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Sex in haplodiploids is commonly determined by the alleles present at a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, with heterozygosity triggering the female developmental pathway. The identity of this locus differs among taxa and is only known in a few species. Here, we map a single CSD locus to a 2 kbp region in the genome of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. It overlaps the long noncoding RNA ANTSR, which has been identified as the sex-determining gene in the invasive ant Linepithema humile. This locus is homozygous in diploid males and exhibits extremely high levels of haplotype diversity, consistent with the action of frequency-dependent selection. The elevated levels of heterozygosity in the CSD locus enable us to fine-map potentially functional genetic variation within it.

The rapid evolution of peptide toxins, such as the conotoxins produced by venomous marine cone snails, often complicates efforts to infer their evolutionary relationships based solely on sequence information. Structural bioinformatics, however, can provide robust support. Here, we first solve the NMR structure of a macro-conotoxin from the MLSML superfamily, Tx33.1, which is composed of 124 residues, including 12 cysteines. We then apply deep learning-based methods for structure prediction and comparison to identify structural similarities between this toxin and five additional, previously uncharacterized conotoxin superfamilies. Although only three of these superfamilies exhibit sequence homology, a combined approach incorporating structure prediction, structure comparison, and gene structure analysis supports the conclusion that all six superfamilies share a common evolutionary past. The Tx33.1 NMR structure displays similarity to the first two domains of Argos, a secretory protein from Drosophila melanogaster that comprises three domains, each harboring two short {beta}-stranded loops ('fingers'). Consequently, we propose the name 'two-finger toxin (2FTX)' fold for this type of domain. Finally, using structure similarity searches, we identify a wide range of 2FTX proteins in protostomes, including non-venom-derived, secretory cone snail proteins. This study demonstrates how structural bioinformatics can be employed to uncover evolutionary relationships among rapidly evolving genes. It simultaneously identifies a large, previously unrecognized group of protostome 2FTX proteins, many of which exhibit close structural similarity to Argos and may perform a similar function in regulating EGFR signaling.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Plecia longiforceps, a species of lovebug flies native to southeast China and Taiwan, has recently been expanding in Okinawa in Japan and Seoul in South Korea, where massive outbreaks are garnering public attention. Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 150 individuals across China, Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan, including a newly identified northern Chinese population from Qingdao. We found a deep divergence between continental (Korea-China) and insular (Okinawa-Taiwan) populations and specify northern China and Taiwan as sources for Korea and Okinawa, respectively. Severely reduced genetic diversity in Korea and Qingdao suggests serial founder events during their northward expansion. An old split time between Qingdao and Korea (~3,500 generations ago) and multiple gene flows into Qingdao reject a simple scenario of a single recent northward migration. Selection signals in northern groups include genes associated with pigmentation, thermal sensing, lipid metabolism, and immunity. We observed a markedly reduced genetic diversity on X chromosome in northern populations, indicating ongoing strong sex-biased selection. Our findings portrait details of the northward range expansion in the species and highlight the role of adaptation for successful invasion at higher latitudes.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

S. solidus reproduces in its terminal host either by exchanging gametes with similarly sized individuals or selfing. Fertilized eggs then pass through the feces of the host and hatch at the bottom of freshwater lakes. Previous work found that selfing greatly depresses egg hatching rates, presumably as a result of inbreeding depression. We predicted that S. solidus may have evolved quorum sensing (QS) during hatching as a mechanism to facilitate synchronized infection, thereby increasing the opportunity for outcrossing in its terminal host. We tested whether density-dependent hatch rates were present across three parasite populations, examining both outcrossed and selfed progeny. We predicted that if QS was present, it would be common across all populations, and that increasing egg density would result in higher hatching rates. We also expected that outcrossed eggs would hatch at higher rates than those produced via selfing. While we found different hatching rates between populations, there was no effect of egg density. Selfed eggs did hatch at significantly lower rates than outcrossed eggs, replicating previous findings. Although we failed to find density dependent hatching in our limited sample, we conclude by discussing the conditions in which QS may evolve in isolated S. solidus populations.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Current therapies focus on restoring CFTR function but many gut-related pathologies persist, highlighting the need for complementary treatments to improve the quality of life of patients living with CF. In this study, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to investigate the gut-specific effects of Cftr loss. We demonstrate that enterocyte-specific knockdown of Cftr in flies recapitulates several CF pathologies, including reduced intestinal motility, nutrient malabsorption, and decreased energy stores. Using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we identify significant transcriptional changes in the CF model gut, including the upregulation of acetylcholine esterase (Ace, human AChE), which leads to reduced cholinergic signaling. Cholinergic signaling has been shown to affect CFTR function but this is the first time CFTR loss of function has been shown to alter cholinergic signaling. Functional assays confirm that cholinergic sensitivity is diminished in CF guts and restoring cholinergic signaling via Ace knockdown rescues multiple CF-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, we identify the transcription factor Forkhead (Fkh), the Drosophila homolog of human FOXA1/FOXA2, which is known to be a positive regulator of Cftr in the intestine, as a positive regulator of Ace expression in CF guts. This study establishes the Drosophila gut as a powerful model to investigate CF pathogenesis, genetic modifiers, and identifies Ace and Fkh as genetic modifiers. This work also suggests that enhancing cholinergic signaling may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal manifestations of CF.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted a proof-of-concept study integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We compared gene expression changes driven by musical stimuli in healthy individuals exposed to music with transcriptomic data from TBI patients, identifying 154 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affected in TBI and impacted by music, including STK35, HNRNPA0, MT-CYB, and MT-ND2. These genes are notably involved in mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegenerative processes. Epigenomic analysis revealed that 92 of these DEGs also exhibited significant differential methylation in TBI samples, particularly in genes associated with neurodevelopment, neuroinflammation, and mood regulation. Pathway enrichment and cross-validation in independent datasets of TBI patients highlighted the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, a key regulator of memory and plasticity. Co-expression network analysis further revealed six gene modules significantly associated with TBI, including modules centered on TXNIP and ALG13, genes previously implicated in neuroinflammation and epilepsy, two conditions commonly associated with TBI. Interestingly, several hub genes from these modules also showed sensitivity to musical stimuli, suggesting that music may target biologically relevant networks involved in TBI pathology. These findings provide preliminary evidence that music exposure may modulate gene expression and methylation in ways that support neural repair and functional recovery. This molecular insight reinforces the potential of music as a biologically grounded component of neurorehabilitation. Future studies should directly assess transcriptomic and epigenomic responses to music-based interventions in BD patients.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be. Here we present multiple viable options for room temperature collection and/or shipment for arthropod samples.

However, the lack of well-defined binding pockets and structural information on native interactions has hindered structure-guided ligand discovery against Flpp3. Here, we used a combination of physics-based and deep-learning methods to design high-affinity miniprotein binders targeting two distinct sites on Flpp3. We identified four binders for site I with binding affinities ranging between 24-110 nM. For the second site, an initial binder showed a dissociation constant (KD) of 81 nM, and subsequent site saturation mutagenesis yielded variants with sub-nanomolar affinities. Circular dichroism confirmed the topology of designed miniproteins. The X-ray crystal structure of Flpp3 in complex with a site I binder is nearly identical to the design model (C root-mean-square deviation: 0.9 [A]).

Using an extended parameter space (0.7-8 MHz), calcium waves were shown to be selectively elicited by cavitation or acoustic radiation force. Cavitation, predominant at frequencies under 5 MHz, induced dispersed and unpredictable responses that could lead to cell damage. FUS radiation force however, predominant at frequencies over 5 MHz, elicited focal and predictable responses, without affecting cell viability. FUS-evoked intercellular calcium waves were shown to propagate across the surrounding neural network via intracellular and extracellular pathways driven by calcium amplification mechanisms.

Eigen-image based method was compared with the elbow point and hard thresholding method when selecting MB signals after SVD of raw data, acquired from phantom and in vivo experiments. Image reconstructed by eigen-image based method was also compared with unregistered difference image for GV localization when moving GVs in a phantom were collapsed by ultrafast plane waves. The eigen-image based MB signal detection method resulted in higher vessel density (VD) visualization in both the phantom and in vivo mouse tumor. It also achieved increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both cases. Moreover, this method localized moving GVs more efficiently than the difference imaging method, without requiring pixel registration based on landmarks. The eigen-image based method offers a reliable and automated approach to MB and GV signal detection for both SRUS and point target localization.

Hyperactivation is essential for various aspects of fertilization, particularly effective migration within the tract. However, how hyperactivation facilitates this migration remains elusive. Here, we profiled bull sperm hyperactivation in Newtonian and complex fluids near microfluidic surfaces, mimicking generic swimming conditions in the tract. We identified three swim gaits: wandering (persistent random walks), circling, and an intriguing circling-and-wandering mode marked by stochastic transitions between the two. All gaits exhibit diffusive behavior over long time scales, with wandering showing a tenfold higher diffusivity than circling, and the diffusivity of circling-and-wandering falling in between. We found that while wandering sperm scatter from convex and concave surfaces, circling sperm become trapped around pillars, highlighting the distinctive nature of each phase. Additionally, stochastic simulations of swimming in porous media showed that as the geometrical complexity of the environment increases, circling-and-wandering outperforms either strategy alone in spreading through the media. Our findings suggest that while wandering promotes exploration and circling supports local exploitation, circling-and-wandering combines the strengths of both strategies by balancing exploration and exploitation to adapt motility, enhance migration, and potentially improve target search.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

K.; Newman, E.", "abstract": "The dynamic forces contributing to arteriosclerotic plaque separation were studied in-vitro using fresh porcine arteries and artificial plaques of different thicknesses mounted on thin ferro-magnetic strips. The arteries were subjected to pulsatile perfusion using an apparatus in which dynamic and rheological variables could be varied and controlled. The plaques were held on the inner wall of the artery by the force exerted by an externally-mounted electromagnet. The pressure retaining the artificial plaque to the wall could be regulated by varying the power supplied to the magnet. The separation of the plaque from the vessel wall, characterised by the appearance of a cleft beneath it with each pulsation, was observed with M and B mode ultrasound. In this way the critical detachment force (CDF), acting on the plaque at the moment of first separation of the plaque, could be calculated. 10 arteries were used during the study, using multiple observations in single arteries to reduce inter-artery variation. The CDF was found to correlate closely with pulse pressure (r= 0.9, p<0.001). Wall stiffness was found to determine pulse pressure when other parameters were kept constant, irrespective of whether the stiffness was induced by raising mean arterial pressure or by stiffening the artery artificially with formalin. In comparing plaques producing approximately 20% and 40% occlusion there was roughly a doubling of CDF, but no further increase between 40% and 60% (t = 4.0, p<0.001). Longitudinal tortuous movement of the artery (arc bending) had a profound effect on CDF, increasing progressively with the angle of bend (Rs 1.0, p <0.001). In this model the main dynamic contributions to plaque stress are: (i) moderate stenosis in the presence of sustained flow; (ii) high pulse pressure, to which arterial wall stiffness in distributive arteries contributes (iii) arc bending. The clinical implications of the findings of this study are discussed, and it is proposed that recurrent dynamic wall stress, in addition to its direct effects on the plaque, may also play a part in the inflammatory determinants of plaque vulnerability.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

To characterize immunity at the primary site of pathogen colonization in BRD, we evaluated stress responses in lung cells from beef stocker cattle to understand mucosal immune changes. Stocker calves were sampled via bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection within 24 hours of auction and transport to a new facility (Stressed, n=12), or allowed to acclimate for 2 months at the new facility before sampling (Acclimated, n=7). Lavage cellular RNA was extracted and sequenced for bulk RNA-seq gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis of RNA sequencing data demonstrated a profound upregulation of inflammatory genes in Stressed calves compared to Acclimated calves, including expression of CXCL8, CSF3R, IL1B, and CCL22. Top pathway upregulation in Stressed calves involved neutrophil migration and chemotaxis, and cytokine signaling. To predict cellular population proportions from the data, CIBERSORTx was used to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq gene counts. This analysis showed that Stressed calves had significantly increased BALF neutrophils compared to Acclimated calves (p =0.003). Neutrophilic infiltration occurred in the absence of pathogen colonization of the lungs in most calves, as demonstrated by a multi-pathogen respiratory qPCR screen.

We applied a Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS), whereby individual conflicts were scored on a scale of 1-5 (minimal to highest known impact); these were used to determine the potential impact (sum of all conflicts) and actual impact (sum of all conflicts corrected for geographical distribution) of individual mammals so they could be ranked on their level of impact. Forty-eight mammals were involved in a total of 200 separate conflicts. The highest ranked conflicts (scoring 5) were all measurable on an economic scale (involving rabbit, badger, brown rat and grey squirrel). We estimated a conservative annual economic cost of human-wildlife conflicts in excess of {pound}0.5 billion, which could exceed {pound}1 billion if health and environmental conflicts could be monetarised. The most common conflicts were health related (reservoir of disease and zoonotic disease), although generally, health conflicts were scored low (mostly 1 or 2). Overall, there was no statistical difference in impact score depending on status (native or non-native); however, when considered by subcategory, non-native species scored higher in relation to damage to woodland, agricultural interests and property, and reservoir of zoonotic disease, whilst native species caused more conflict with construction and development, and predation of livestock. Non-native species had a higher potential impact score compared to native species, but not actual impact. However, actual impact was predicted to increase, relative to population size, at a higher rate for non-native species compared to native, highlighting the need for surveillance and monitoring. Where mammals represent a cost to some, they may provide a benefit to others, e.g. fox predation of rabbits, and as such may require a holistic approach to management. We concluded that a GISS approach is a useful tool for identifying conflict species and could form part of a package of measures to ensure a balance between the need to conserve and enhance biodiversity, whilst also considering the interests of those directly affected by human-wildlife conflict, is achieved.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

M.; Pespeni, M.; Cheney, N.", "abstract": "The magnitude and shape of phenotypic variation depends on properties of the genotype-to-phenotype (GP) map, which itself can evolve over time. The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata (CA) rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

B.; Pearce, M. E.; Liu, C. T.; Finkel, J. M.; Darrow, K. S.; Vo, T. V.", "abstract": "Heterochromatin is a repressive epigenetic state that suppresses transcription and safeguards genomic integrity. However, the full mechanism of how it is regulated remains elusive. Here, we focus on a previously described Pol II variant called rpb2-N44Y, which has a single substitution mutation within the Rpb2 subunit of Pol II that reduces RNAi-dependent heterochromatin. Through CRISPR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, we find that rpb2-N44Y is a gain-of-function mutation. Furthermore, the heterochromatin defects of the rpb2-N44Y mutant requires a subunit of the Elongator complex called Elongator Protein 1 (Elp1), a protein that canonically promotes in mcm5s2U34 tRNA modifications. Intriguingly, we find that loss of Elp1, but not of other Elongator subunits such as Elp3, can robustly suppress heterochromatin defects in the rpb2-N44Y mutant. Elp1 acts independently of the mcm5s2 U34 tRNA modification to suppress RNAi-dependent heterochromatin at the pericentromere and the levels of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) at affected heterochromatin. Overall, our study reveals two distinct Rpb2-centric pathways, via RNAi or Elp1, that can positively or negatively regulate heterochromatin, respectively. Furthermore, our findings reveal the first evidence of a chromatin function for Elp1 that is distinct from its canonical role in tRNA modifications. This work expands our understanding of how Elp1 can influence chromatin biology.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

However, persistent insulin resistance can lead to beta cell dysfunction and T2D onset. Here, leveraging cell-type-specific methylome data from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP), we investigate the epigenomic basis of beta cell adaptation by mapping genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns across the human lifespan. In healthy donors, we identify progressive age-related demethylation enriched in cis-regulatory elements at beta cell identity and function genes, suggesting that epigenetic remodeling supports functional adaptation to metabolic demand over time. In contrast, alpha cells show the opposite trajectory, with subtle, age-related hypermethylation. In T2D beta but not alpha cells we observed further demethylation compared to healthy controls, underscoring a unique capacity of beta cells to respond to changes in metabolic demand. Together, our findings suggest that DNAm remodeling in healthy beta cells reflects a long-term adaptation to metabolic demand, which in T2D is accelerated as part of a compensatory response that ultimately fails under sustained insulin resistance.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

In this work, we sequenced the complete genome of the new species Embleya australiensis MST-11070 and validated the assembly using optical mapping. The genome of E. australiensis MST-11070 consists of a 7.1 Mb linear chromosome and three additional replicons, including a 4.2 Mb linear replicon, EEC1, significantly larger than all previously described secondary replicons from bacteria. EEC1 is typified by its similar composition to the chromosome in terms of GC-content, codon usage and gene functions. It also carries terminal inverted repeats identical to the chromosome. EEC1 is enriched in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including the only copy of the BGCs for the spore pigment and the surfactant peptide SapB, metabolites essential for the organism's lifecycle. EEC1 contains an origin of replication with at least some chromosomal properties, and its replication is likely to depend on functions provided by chromosomally located genes. Further comparison of Embleya spp. genomes suggests that EEC1-like replicons are conserved across the genus, in contrast to other known large linear extrachromosomal replicons (megaplasmids) in the order. EEC1 is thus a hallmark of the Embleya genus and is central to its evolution within the Streptomycetaceae family.

Mechanistic insights into the antimicrobial action were studied through acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining, which revealed the ability of AMPs to form pores in bacte-rial membranes. Furthermore, the wound healing efficacy of these peptides was assessed in vivo using rat model, where they significantly accelerated the healing process. Following the identification of their bacteriostatic activity against pathogenic strains, we also examined the effects of combining these AMPs with conventional antibiotics, namely ampicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin. Epinecidin-1 and its variants displayed synergistic and additive in-teractions with these antibiotics at certain concentrations. This combination approach is particularly promising for treating infections in both human and livestock populations, thereby potentially mitigating the risk of environmental pathogen outbreaks and complications of multidrug resistance.

Traditional computational methods, such as database searching, are constrained by the scope of existing libraries and can be computationally intensive. While recent deep learning models have advanced the field, they often struggle to capture the complex, long-range dependencies within MS/MS spectra required for accurate inference. To address these challenges, we present GlycoBERT and GlycoBART, novel transformer-based models for glycan structure prediction from MS/MS data. GlycoBERT, a sequence classifier, achieves 95.1% structural accuracy on test data, surpassing the current state-of-the-art deep learning model, CandyCrunch. However, classification-based methods are inherently limited to predicting structures present in the training data. To overcome this, we developed GlycoBART, a generative sequence-to-sequence model capable of de novo glycan inference. On independent validation datasets, both models demonstrate robust performance. Critically, when applied to an MS/MS dataset from human embryonic kidney cells, GlycoBART generated two de novo glycan structures absent from the training set, one of which is a novel structure not catalogued in major glycan databases. Together, GlycoBERT and GlycoBART establish a new benchmark for glycan analysis, offering a powerful framework that enables more accurate and comprehensive exploration of glycan diversity and discovery.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the relevance of RAC1 for cross-organ injury and cross-agent-induced normal tissue toxicity is unknown. Here, we employed a Mx1-Cre-based mouse model that enables an inducible Rac1 knockout across different organs in order to comparatively analyze the influence of RAC1 on doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (CisPt)-induced acute stress responses of the heart, kidney and liver. Following DOX treatment, the extend of DNA-double strand break (DSB) formation and the percentage of apoptotic cells were reduced in all three organs (i.e. heart, liver, kidney) of RAC1 deficient (Rac1-/-) animals as compared to the wildtype control (Rac1+/+). By contrast, in the absence of RAC1, CisPt-induced DNA damage was reduced only in the liver and the frequency of CisPt-stimulated apoptotic cell death remained unaffected by the Rac1 status in all organs. These findings demonstrate a strikingly organ- and agent-specific relevance of RAC1-regulated mechanisms for normal tissue damage evoked by genotoxic anticancer therapeutics. Accordingly, protein levels of phosphorylated DNA damage response (DDR)-related factors were also reduced in the kidney and liver of DOX treated Rac1-/- animals, but not in the heart. Yet, DOX-triggered mRNA expression of surrogate markers related to inflammation, fibrosis and senescence was preferentially reduced in the heart and kidney of Rac1 deficient mice. Taken together, RAC1 plays a so far unknown distinct role in the pathophysiology of anticancer drug-induced normal tissue damage by influencing DNA damage formation, activation of DDR, apoptosis induction as well as inflammation-, fibrosis- and senescence-associated responses in a pronounced agent- and organ-specific manner. Targeting of RAC1 appears particularly effective in the context of anthracycline-based therapeutic regimen for conferring broad organoprotection to both the heart and detoxifying organs.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription.

GdpP integrates environmental signals through its sensory PAS domain to control its C-terminal catalytic domain activity, but the molecular basis for this allosteric communication has remained unknown due to the lack of structural data for the complete cytosolic region. Here, we present the first Cryo-EM structures of the cytosolic region of Streptococcus mutans GdpP (SmGdpP74) in multiple conformational states, revealing a sophisticated tetrameric architecture that enables asymmetric catalytic regulation. Our structural and functional analyses demonstrate that SmGdpP74 operates through substrate-induced conformational transition, with the DHHA1 domain interface serving as the primary determinant of asymmetric catalysis. The non-canonical GGDEF domain functions as a tetrameric scaffolding hub that positions the DHH-DHHA1 catalytic domains, representing the first detailed example of a GGDEF domain repurposed to stabilize heterologous catalytic domains. We identify a flexible GGDEF-DHH linker as a critical coupling element that transmits conformational signals between domains, with the conserved KRSR motif acting as a molecular switch for heme-mediated inhibition. Additionally, the flexibility of this linker is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Based on these findings, we propose a comprehensive mechanistic model where SmGdpP74 integrates substrate availability with conformational changes for efficient hydrolysis and allosteric control of its enzymatic activity through the PAS domain.

We previously established a system to generate replication-dependent double-ended DSBs at the sites of nicks induced by the Cas9D10A nickase in the budding yeast genome. Here, we suggest that these DSBs form in an asymmetric manner, with one break end being blunt or near blunt, and the other bearing a 3' ssDNA overhang of up the size of an Okazaki fragment. We find that Mre11 preferentially binds blunt ends and is required for the removal Ku from these DSB ends. In contrast, the ends predicted to have 3' overhangs have minimal Ku binding, and end resection at these break ends can proceed in a mostly Mre11-independent manner through either the Exo1 or Dna2-Sgs1 long-range resection pathways. These findings indicate that resection proceeds differently at replication-dependent DSBs than at canonical DSBs, and reveals that Ku selectively binds nearly blunt ends, potentially explaining why replication-dependent DSBs are poorly repaired by non-homologous end joining.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Several bacterial pathogens secrete multi-domain enzymes known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) that are important for virulence. One example is the Vibrio cholerae virulence factor GbpA (VcGbpA), in which an N-terminal LPMO domain is followed by two domains of unknown function called GbpA2 and GbpA3, and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain, called CBM73. In-depth functional characterization of full-length and truncated variants of VcGbpA and a homologue from V. campbellii (previously V. harveyi; VhGbpA) showed that the catalytic LPMO domains of these proteins exhibit properties similar to natural single-domain LPMOs with established roles in chitin degradation. Interestingly, binding to chitin and efficient degradation of this substrate were affected by the presence of the GbpA2 and GbpA3 domains. Combined with structural predictions and analyses of sequence conservation, our data suggests that GbpA3 has evolved to interact with the reduced copper site to prevent off-pathway reactions in the absence of substrate. Substrate binding by CBM73 weakens this interaction, enabling the activation of the LPMO only when substrate is present. These observations shed new light into the functionality of these multi-domain LPMOs and uncover a novel mechanism for regulating LPMO activity.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

State-of- the-art generative models are trained on computationally derived structures from AlphaFold2 (AF), as experimentally determined structures are relatively scarce. The resulting models are therefore limited by the quality of synthetic datasets. Since the accuracy of AF predictions degrades with increasing protein length and complexity, de novo generation of long, complex proteins remains challenging. Ambient Protein Diffusion overcomes this problem by treating low-confidence AF structures as corrupted data. Rather than simply filtering out low-quality AF structures, our method adjusts the diffusion objective for each structure based on its corruption level, allowing the model to learn from both high and low quality structures. Empirically, Ambient Protein Diffusion yields major improvements: on proteins with 700 residues, diversity increases from 45% to 86% from the previous state-of-the-art, and designability improves from 68% to 86%.

R.; Labeit, S.; Moriscot, A. S.", "abstract": "Background: Disuse-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (DIDD) is characterized by the rapid and progressive loss of diaphragm contractile function and mass in response to inactivity. DIDD compromises respiratory function and enhances morbidity and mortality risks in patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation or phrenic nerve injury. Muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) expression is rapidly upregulated under diaphragm mechanical unloading, and is hypothesized to play a role in DIDD pathophysiology. We previously reported that small-molecule inhibition of MuRF1 protects against early DIDD in rats. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms underlying MuRF1 inhibition-mediated protection against DIDD in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral diaphragm denervation (UDD) for 12 hours to induce DIDD. Immediately after UDD, animals received a placebo (vehicle) or MuRF1 inhibitor (MyoMed-205, 50 mg/kg bw) treatment and were compared with Sham-operated controls. Diaphragm was used for histological, morphometric, transcriptomic (RNA-seq), and protein content (Western Blot) analysis. Results: UDD induced diaphragm slow- and fast-twitch muscle fiber atrophy (~18%, p < 0.05) after 12 hours, which was prevented by MuRF1 inhibition. Mechanistically, UDD perturbed mechanisms involved with myofiber ultrastructure and contractility, mitochondrial function, proteolysis, and tissue remodeling in the diaphragm. Notably, MuRF1 inhibition enhanced mechanisms required for sarcomere integrity, calcium handling, antioxidant defense, chaperone-mediated unfolded protein response, and muscle growth. Moreover, MuRF1 inhibition downregulated intramuscular lipid accumulation and fibrosis responses triggered by prolonged disuse. Conclusion: Small-molecule inhibition of MuRF1 protects against early DIDD in rats undergoing 12 hours of UDD. Mechanistically, this involved augmented control of muscle structure and function, chaperone-mediated unfolded protein, and muscle growth factors, while intramuscular fat accumulation and fibrosis responses associated with DIDD were attenuated.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

The objectives of this study were to (i) optimize phage screening method for microbial samples obtained from different cattle body sites, (ii) isolate lytic phages against key bovine pathogens and commensal bacteria, and (iii) characterize the isolated phages and their bacterial hosts. A total of 1,214 samples from different cattle body sites (n = 1194) and environmental sources were screened using 13 phage detection methods, including one high-throughput approach. Eighty-three phages were isolated, primarily from ruminal fluid (59), feces (15), vaginal (7) and nasopharyngeal swabs (1), and fetal ruminal fluid (1). The bacterial hosts inhibited by these phages were from 29 genera, with Bacillus (34), Escherichia/Shigella (8), Shouchella (5), Corynebacterium (4), and Lysinibacillus (4) being the most common. No phages were identified against bovine pathogens including Trueperella pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, or Moraxella bovis. Method 12 demonstrated the highest efficiency in phage recovery, particularly from ruminal samples.

L.", "abstract": "Hysteresis--where a system retains memory of a transient stimulus--is common in signaling but can also arise in intracellular organization. DNA repair foci, a type of biomolecular condensate, are initiated by the short-lived noncanonical nucleic acid poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PAR recruits proteins with prion-like domains (PrLDs), such as Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), and initiates their condensation, which persists even after PAR degradation. How FUS transitions from PAR-dependent to PAR-independent condensation remains unclear. Here, we show that PAR binding triggers a conformational switch in FUS, enabling sustained condensation. PAR binds to the C-terminal arginine-rich region of FUS, displacing intramolecular contacts, and exposing the N-terminal PrLD. This conformational opening allows PrLD interactions in trans, stabilizing condensates independently of PAR. FUS thus undergoes a regulated, nucleated conformational conversion--reminiscent of classical prions. This mechanism implies a paradigm of nucleic acid-induced conformational memory that may underlie hysteresis in intracellular organization in health and disease.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows: the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of such biases.

Its genome encodes a conserved set of putative chitin-active enzymes, including a peculiar lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO), termed EcLPMO, which we functionally characterized in this study. EcLPMO is a tetra-modular protein consisting of an auxiliary activity family 10 (AA10) catalytic domain, two central domains of unknown function (DUF-A and DUF-B), and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM73). Functional assays using full-length EcLPMO and its truncated variants demonstrated that the AA10 domain oxidatively cleaves chitin at the C1 position. The CBM73 module enhances chitin binding and promotes synergy with endogenous chitinases. Notably, EcLPMO displayed a particularly strong synergistic effect with the unimodular chitinase EcChiA, leading to up to 14-fold and 60-fold increases in GlcNAc release from - and {beta}-chitin, respectively. Deletion of both DUFs reduced EcLPMO activity. While DUF-A alone and the association of DUF-A and DUF-B showed limited chitin binding, DUF-B alone exhibited no binding, suggesting a distinct role. Unexpectedly, using state-of-the-art structural modelling (AlphaFold3), we observed that the DUF-B domain contains two highly conserved histidines that coordinate the AA10-bound copper, forming a previously unreported inter-domain tetra-histidine copper coordination center. These findings highlight the structural and functional complexity of EcLPMO and suggest that its accessory domains, particularly DUF-B, may contribute to enzyme stability and substrate interaction. We speculate that DUF-B may protect the LPMO active site from oxidative damage, a feature that could prove crucial in its ecological and pathogenic contexts.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

In the past decade, enormous experimental efforts have been undertaken through the development of functional assays, mutagenesis screenings, and computational prediction algorithms to characterize these variants. Indeed, most efforts have been focused towards identifying degrees of loss-of-function (LoF) effects on the three-dimensional structures of proteins, but gain-of-function (GoF) mutations remain poorly understood. Herein, we performed a case study of the PIEZO1 mechanosensitive ion channel protein whose GoF variants (n = 56) are implicated in hereditary xerocytosis (HX) and LoF variants (n = 6) in lymphatic dysplasia (LD), respectively. This study evaluated the abilities of AlphaMissense (AM) to decipher both mutation types, and benchmarked its performance against other algorithmic approaches, including Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) v1.7, evolutionary model of variant effect (EVE), and Evolutionary Scale Modeling-1b (ESM-1B). We found that all approaches excelled in identifying LoF variants but were often ambiguous in their predictions for GoF PIEZO1 variants. ESM-1b was a notable exception that demonstrated balance sensitivity to both GoF and LoF variants as it likely identified certain sequential features not utilized in other approaches. Secondly, our findings suggest that GoF variants of HX do not significantly destabilize the PIEZO1 structure and are not generally identified by conventional signatures of damage from these algorithms. GoF variants are not synonymous with direct changes in changes in free energy upon mutations. Furthermore, we validated computational structure predictions of PIEZO1 against resolved cryo-EM structures, and provided biophysical data for variants located on unresolved residues of this ion channel. We formulated a weighted ensemble model that performed similarly to AM and outperformed all other traditional approaches evaluated in this study. Overall, this is the first study to directly evaluate the capabilities of pathogenicity prediction algorithms for deciphering GoF and LoF variants, and underscores the limitations present in current approaches.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

The model was identified against dynamic in vivo recordings of Phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic Phosphate (Pi), and pH in rodent hindlimb muscle and verified against independent data from in vivo experiments and muscle biopsies. Step response testing revealed that mass action kinetics in combination with feedback control were sufficient to accomplish myoplasmic ATP homeostasis over a 100-fold range of ATP turnover rates. This vital emergent property of the metabolic model was associated with dynamic behaviour of intermediary metabolite concentrations similar to a second-order underdamped system that remains to be verified. The simulations additionally predicted that the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction makes substantial contributions to redox balance across the physiological range of ATP demands in this myofiber phenotype, while its role in slowing cellular acidification is minimal. Yet, LDH knock-out simulations revealed that oxidative recycling of myoplasmic NADH in and by itself sufficed to maintain redox balance over ATP turnover rates in the range of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We conclude that aerobic lactate production in working muscles is a byproduct of the metabolic flexibility of FOG myofibers afforded by expression of high levels of LDH and OxPhos enzymes to support continual myoplasmic redox balance and ATP synthesis under conditions of high-intensity mechanical work. In the future, the presented simulation framework may be used to further enhance the understanding of how experimental observations in muscle emerge from the integrative behaviour of the metabolic network for carbohydrate metabolism in FOG myofibers.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}

A higher-order SD cassette structure of 105 kbp in length, flanked by 25 kbp long inverted repeats, drives this variation and emerged in the human-chimpanzee ancestral lineage later expanding in humans ~1.0 [0.8-1.2] million years ago. African LCRA haplotypes are significantly longer (p=0.0047) when compared to non-Africans yet are predicted to be more protected against recurrent microdeletions (p=0.00053) due to a preponderance of flanking SDs in an inverted orientation. Conversely, we identified nine distinct inversion polymorphisms, including five recurrent ~2.28 Mbp inversions extending across the critical region (LCRA-D) and four smaller inversions (two LCRA-B, one LCRC-D, and one LCRB-D); 7/9 of these events were identified in haplotypes of African and admixed American ancestry. Finally, we sequence and assemble four families and show that LCRA-D deletion breakpoints map to the 105 kbp repeat unit while inversion breakpoints associate with the 25 kbp repeats adjacent to palindromic AT-rich regions. In one family, we observe evidence of more complex unequal crossover events associated with gene conversion and multiple breakpoints. Our findings suggest that specific haplotype configurations are protective and susceptible to chromosome 22q11.2DS while recurrent large-scale inversions help to explain why this syndrome is less prevalent among individuals of African descent.", "date": "2025-07-05", "journal": ""}
