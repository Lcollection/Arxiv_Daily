However, the mechanism by which these two areas interact to support navigation remains unclear. Here, we designed an object-matching task where human participants unknowingly manipulated object variants arranged in a ring-like structure around a central prototype. Functional MRI revealed a 3-fold spatial periodicity of hippocampal activity, which tracked the navigation trajectories from the original object variants to the central prototype in the object space. Importantly, this spatial periodicity of the hippocampus was phase-locked with the well-documented 6-fold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting a periodic mechanism connecting these two areas. In addition, the 3-fold periodicity was replicated in human behavior, which varied with a function of spatial directions and phase-locked with hippocampal activity. Finally, we proposed an EC-HPC PhaseSync model, illustrating a framework of the hippocampal-entorhinal network, in which the 6-fold spatial periodicity of entorhinal grid cell populations embeds vector fields that are represented in the hippocampus for conceptual navigation.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Moreover, we show that osteocytes are functional targets of cholinergic signaling for bone mechanoadaptation. We report sexually dimorphic patterns in bone structure and mechanobiology based on nAChR function. In females, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was decreased at small force magnitudes and tissue level deficits were recovered with anabolic loading. In males, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was increased in some groups and anabolic loading had very little effect on overall tissue architecture. This work establishes a new signaling paradigm wherein osteocytes interface with cholinergic nerves and bone mechanotransduction is regulated by osteocyte cholinergic signaling in a sexually dimorphic way.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Here using a G-deleted rabies system in mice, we found that more than two-thirds of excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs also target D1-SPNs, while only one-third do so vice versa. Optogenetic stimulation of striatal D1- vs. D2-SPN-projecting cortical neurons differently regulate locomotion, reinforcement learning and sequence behavior, implying the functional dichotomy of pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits. These results reveal the partially segregated yet asymmetrically overlapping cortical projections on striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs, and that the pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits distinctly control behavior.

Central to this regulation is a class of transporters that sense and transport specific nutrients and transduce the signal downstream to control genes responsible for growth and survival. In this study, we identified SUL1, a plasma membrane transporter responsible for regulating the entry of extracellular sulfate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a key gene for regulating lifespan. We conducted a systematic analysis to delineate the downstream mechanism underlying the lifespan extension by SUL1 deletion. Surprisingly, we found that the lifespan extending effect of SUL1 deletion is not due to decreased sulfate transport. The SUL1 deletion mutant exhibited decreased PKA signaling, resulting in a series of downstream effects, including increased stress-protective trehalose and glycogen, increased nuclear translocation of MSN2, elevated expression of general stress response genes, enhanced autophagy, and reduced expression of amino acid biosynthetic and ribosomal genes. We demonstrated that the observed increase in lifespan is dependent on MSN2 and autophagy pathways. Our findings exemplify the influence of nutrient signaling rather than the nutrient itself on lifespan regulation and further substantiate the pivotal role of the PKA pathway in this process.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Our model constitutes a cell population model in which each cell is individually described by one of multiple discrete and plastic phenotype states that are directly linked to drug-dependent net growth rates and, by extension, drug resistance. Data-matched simulations reveal that phenotypic adaptation in the cells is directed towards states of high net growth rates, which enables evasion of drug-effects.

L.; Allard, J.", "abstract": "The 3d organization of the genome - in particular, which two regions of DNA are in contact with each other - plays a role in regulating gene expression. Several factors influence genome 3d organization. Nucleosomes (where ~100 basepairs of DNA wrap around histone proteins) also bend, twist and compactify chromosomal DNA, altering its polymer mechanics. How much does the positioning of nucleosomes between gene loci influence contacts between those gene loci? And, to what extent is polymer mechanics responsible for this? To address this question, we combine a stochastic polymer mechanics model of chromosomal DNA including twists and wrapping induced by nucleosomes with two data-driven pipelines. The first estimates nucleosome positioning from ATACseq data in regions of high accessibility. Most of the genome is low-accessibility, so we combine this with a novel image analysis method that estimates the distribution of nucleosome spacing from electron microscopy data. There are no fit parameters in the biophysical model. We apply this method to IL6, IL15, CXCL9, and CXCL10, inflammatory marker genes in macrophages, before and after immune stimulation, and compare the predictions with contacts measured by conformation capture experiments (4C-seq). We find that within a 500 kilo-basepairs genomic region, polymer mechanics with nucleosomes can explain 71% of close contacts. These results suggest that, while genome contacts on 100kbp-scales are multifactorial, they may be amenable to mechanistic, physical explanation. Our work also highlights the role of nucleosomes, not just at the loci of interest, but between them, and not just the total number of nucleosomes, but their specific placement. The method generalizes to other genes, and can be used to address whether a contact is under active regulation by the cell (e.g., a macrophage during inflammatory stimulation). Importantly, our findings suggest that gene function may have evolved through selective pressures that co-opted contact-mediated regulatory mechanisms reliant largely on polymer mechanics.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Adelges tsugae, hemlock woolly adelgid, was introduced from East Asia and reproduces parthenogenetically in North America, where it has rapidly decimated Tsuga canadensis and Tsuga caroliniana (the eastern and Carolina hemlocks, respectively). Adelges abietis, pineapple gall adelgid, introduced from Europe, forms distinctive pineapple-shaped galls on several native spruce species. While not considered a major forest pest, it weakens trees and increases susceptibility to additional stressors. Broad-spectrum insecticides that are often used to control adelgid populations can have off-target impacts on beneficial insects. Whole genome sequencing was performed on both species to aid in development of targeted solutions that may minimize ecological impact. The assembled A. tsugae and A. abietis genomes, pooled from several parthenogenetic females, are 220.75 Mbp and 253.16 Mbp, respectively. Each consists of eight autosomal chromosomes, as well as two sex chromosomes (X1/X2), supporting the XX-XO sex determination system. The genomes are over 96% complete based on BUSCO assessment. Genome annotation identified 11,424 and 12,060 protein-coding genes in A. tsugae and A. abietis, respectively. Comparative analysis across 29 Hemipteran species and 14 arthropod outgroups identified 31,666 putative gene families. Gene family analysis revealed contrasting gene family dynamics across a range of functional categories with significant expansions in immune-related aminopeptidases (ERAP1) and juvenile hormone binding proteins (JHBP), contractions in juvenile hormone acid methyltransferases (JHAMT) in developmental pathways, and conservation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR).

Recent precision fMRI studies have also revealed sensory-biased PFC patches adjacent to MD regions. To investigate if this topographic arrangement extends to other domains, we analysed two independent fMRI datasets (n=449 and n=37) utilizing the high-resolution multimodal MRI approaches of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Both datasets included cognitive control tasks and stimuli spanning different categories: faces, places, tools and body parts. Contrasting each stimulus category against the remaining ones revealed focal interdigitated patches of activity located adjacent to core MD regions. The face and place results were robust, replicating across different executive tasks, experimental designs (block and event-related) and at the single subject level. In one dataset, where participants performed both category and sensory tasks, place patches overlapped with visually biased regions, while face patches were positioned between visual and auditory biases. Our results paint a refined view of the fine-grained functional organization of the PFC, revealing a recurring motif of interdigitated domain-specific and domain-general circuits.

In diabetes, the impaired immune system could partially be explained by the altered gut microbiota. Understanding gut microbiota and their association with the metabolite profiles in DMTB conditions may help design adjunct therapeutics. Method: Nicotinamide (NA) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice were aerosol infected with 100-120 CFU of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. At different time points (2 days pre-infection and 3- and 8 weeks post infections; wpi), faecal samples were collected for microbiome and metabolome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), respectively. Results: Diabetic mice showed gut dysbiosis, 16 bacterial genera were significantly altered between DMTB and TB at 3 wpi, which reduced to 11 at 8 wpi. Out of 93 identified faecal metabolites, a set of 11 and 10 deregulated (log2FC>(+/-)1.0, p<0.05) metabolites were observed in the DMTB compared to TB groups at 3 and 8 wpi, respectively.

Stronger metabolite-microbiota correlations were observed in DMTB comorbid conditions compared to TB. Correlation analysis also revealed phylogenetic distance-dependent synchrony in amino acid metabolism in five clades of 3 or more bacterial genera. Conclusion: The present study highlights that the comprehensive landscape of gut microbiome and metabolome of DMTB are significantly different from TB.

In this study, we investigated MpCAFA (combined CAPS and FAP115; Mp1g04120) in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The N-terminal and near C-terminal regions of MpCAFA show similarity to calcyphosine (CAPS), a mammalian EF-hand protein, and to FAP115, a ciliary protein of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, respectively. MpCAFA is expressed specifically in antheridia, and its orthologs are found in some algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes and cycads, but not in most of seed plants. Spermatozoids of mutants that lack functional MpCAFA exhibited significant decrease in swimming speed. Notably, these mutants showed no obvious morphological defect, including the 9+2 axoneme arrangement, and retained chemotactic capability and fertility, forming normal spores. This suggests that MpCAFA is required for spermatozoid motility but not for sperm chemotaxis or subsequent reproductive processes. Introduction of MpCAFApro:MpCAFA-mCitrine fully complemented the mutant phenotype and revealed MpCAFA-mCitrine was localized along the entire length of the two spermatozoid cilia. Both the CAPS-like and FAP115-like regions were essential for MpCAFA function and subcellular localization in spermatozoid, whereas the C-terminal proline-rich region was dispensable.

Devising effective controls against P. vivax infections presents unique challenges due to the parasite's exclusive invasion of reticulocytes, a transient developmental stage of red blood cells. The ephemeral nature and limited availability of reticulocytes complicate efforts to establish continuous in vitro cultures to study the parasites biology and receptor-ligand interactions. Here, the potential of the erythroid cell lines JK-1 and BEL-A as alternatives to reticulocytes was confirmed through successful parasite invasion, marking the first report of P. vivax entry to BEL-A cells. Furthermore, LC-MS was used to quantitatively compare the membrane proteomes of these cell lines with those of reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes. This analysis revealed significant similarities between the membrane proteomes of JK-1, BEL-A, and reticulocytes. In addition to the known Plasmodium receptors, transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1 or CD71), CD98hc, and basigin (BSG), potential receptor candidates involved in the parasite's invasion pathway were identified, including prohibitin-2 (PHB2), CAT-1 (SLC7A1), ATB(0) (SLC1A5), CD36, integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), and Metal transporter CNNM3. Proximity labeling using TurboID enabled the identification of specific interactions between PvRBP1a158-650 and TfR1, BSG, and prohibitin-2 in the erythroid cell lines. Notably, this is the first report of prohibitin-2 as a receptor for P. vivax. These findings advance the understanding of P. vivax receptor-ligand interactions and underscore the potential of JK-1 and BEL-A cell lines as alternative models for the study of parasite biology.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

The role of niche signals in driving these processes remains poorly understood. Using the Drosophila testis, we identify a regulatory axis in which age-related decline of niche signals (BMPs) lead to upregulation of the co-repressor Hairless, which downregulates the RNA-binding protein Imp in aged germline stem cells (GSCs). Reduced Imp causes loss of Chinmo, a key factor in GSC aging and competition. Reduced Chinmo causes ectopic Perlecan secretion which accumulates in the testis lumen and causes GSC loss. Aging of the testis is reversed by increasing BMPs in the niche, or by overexpressing Imp or depleting Hairless in GSCs. Furthermore, GSC clones with reduced Imp or increased Hairless are more competitive, expelling wild-type neighbors and monopolizing the niche. Thus, BMPs regulate testicular niche aging through the Hairless/Imp/Chinmo axis and winning GSCs usurp these aging mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

This multi-level approach balances fine-grained precision with computational efficiency, enabling conformational landscape sampling in hours rather than the weeks required by traditional simulations. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that OC2 accurately reproduces experimentally determined protein and RNA ensembles, generates conformational distributions comparable to millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, and captures functionally relevant transitions in important biological scenarios including allostery, induced-fit mechanisms, and cryptic pocket formation. OC2 also effectively models small molecule conformations, maintains competitive accuracy on structure prediction benchmarks, and scales to ultra-large molecular assemblies exceeding 15,000 residues. By bridging static structure prediction and dynamic ensemble characterization, OC2 advances our understanding of how biomolecular dynamics give rise to biological function.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

C. sativa is a crop that has a wide variety of applications, some of which depend on the sex of the plant. Females are, for example, used for the cannabinoid production, as cannabinoids are produced in the female inflorescence. However, while adult C. sativa individuals present high sexual dimorphism, it is not possible to phenotypically distinguish male and female plants before flowering. Here we present the identification of a highly conserved sex marker, CsPDS5, and the development of a robust, reliable and affordable PCR-based method to determine the sex genotype. In contrast to other sex genotyping methods, our approach relies on a gene polymorphic between the X and Y chromosomes and therefore requires only a single PCR with one pair of primers. The method was tested in 14 cultivars and 6 crossings, with different tissues and developmental stages, on a total of 600 samples, with 100% accuracy. Our assay allows early sex identification and hemp selection, which is useful for both research and industrial purposes. Finally, the pipeline presented here to identify genes polymorphic between the X and Y chromosomes can serve to discover new sex markers, not only in C. sativa, but other dioecious plants and other organisms with 2 sexes.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we show that a model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 triggered defense responses in all tested accessions of a wild Solanaceae species, Solanum americanum. Pto DC3000-triggered immunity in S. americanum required type III secretion system. We show that seven Pto DC3000 effectors (AvrPto, HopAD1, HopAM1, HopC1, HopAA1-1, HopM1, and AvrE1) triggered hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. americanum accession SP2273. Significantly, sequential deletion of the HR-triggering effectors from Pto DC3000 resulted in enhanced virulence in S. americanum. However, the well-conserved effectors, HopM1 and AvrE1 were indispensable for virulence. We conclude that the immunity triggered by multiple effectors contributes to nonhost resistance in S. americanum against P. syringae. We propose that the identification of the corresponding disease resistance genes for HopM1 and AvrE1 in S. americanum would accelerate development of durable immunity to P. syringae pathogens in Solanaceae crops.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

A putative arabinan arabinosyltransferase (AraT) is the Arabidopsis ARABINAN-DEFICIENT1 in GT family 47 clade B (GT47B), but its role is inferred by its mutant cell wall phenotypes, and not through in vitro assays. With seven other genes in the clade, investigating the function of the members in GT47B is hampered by the high genetic redundancy in Arabidopsis. Instead, we probe the function of the only two genes in GT47B in the liverwort model organism Marchantia polymorpha, named MpARAD-Like 1 (MpARADL1) and MpARADL2. Mparadl1 and Mparadl2 loss-of-function mutants and overexpression lines were generated, and their cell wall composition was probed using Comprehensive Microarray Polymer Profiling (CoMPP), glycosyl linkage analysis and immunolabelling. Interestingly, Mparadl2 mutants have much less of the 1,5--L-arabinan epitope in elaters since LM6 antibody recognition showed a notable reduction. However, 5-linked Araf levels in the Marchantia thallus tested with glycosyl linkage analysis are comparable between mutants and wild type, suggesting that there is another enzyme forming 5-Araf linkages in Marchantia. Our attempts to obtain the biochemical activity of these enzymes through the expression and purification of AtARAD1, MpARADL1 and MpARADL2 proteins in the HEK293 cell heterologous expression system were unsuccessful. Therefore, we suspect that an evolutionarily conserved, and clade-specific mechanism is required to confer solubility for purification and subsequent activity characterisation of GT47B proteins. Previous studies have shown that co-expression of protein interaction partners can enhance protein solubility in the HEK293 cell system, but co-expression of MpARADL2 with AtARAD1 and MpARADL1 did not yield soluble proteins, prompting further investigation into the protein-protein interactors of GT47B proteins.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

While some transcription factors (TFs) responsible for pigmentation and cuticle decoration have been identified, little is known about the developmental processes that first establish the regions in the petal where these regulators are active - the pre-patterning phase. Here, we developed a computational model of the evolution and development of petal patterns. We selected for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that could generate the proximo-distal bullseye pattern of Hibiscus trionum petals, which resulted in robust patterning dynamics and a variety of bullseye proportions. The evolution of these bullseye patterns was often accompanied by the spontaneous emergence of a third cell type at the boundary between the proximal and distal region with a unique gene expression profile, which appeared in the majority of simulations despite not being explicitly selected for. We experimentally validated the presence of such a boundary cell type by identifying genes with a distinct boundary-localised expression pattern in H. trionum petals. Although boundary cell types could appear spontaneously without apparent function, they were more often important for pattern formation and more evolutionarily stable when gene expression was noisy. This suggests that this emergent cell type can become functionalised to buffer bullseye formation against developmental variability. Altogether, these results show how novel cell types can arise spontaneously and repeatedly from selection on other features, and then potentially become recruited to fulfil a function during or after development", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Plants coordinate growth and development with environmental signals. Specifically, temperature and photoperiod are important regulators to time the transition from vegetative to floral growth. Through utilising these environmental signals potential reproductive success is optimised, which is critical for the production of high crop yields. For cereals, some require a winter before undergoing reproductive development, this extended period of cold exposure enables the process of vernalization and is also important for the synchronized timing of the floral transition. The cereal-specific floral repressor VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) has an integral role in this pathway, yet this locus remains poorly characterised in hexaploid wheat. Our research in a facultative wheat, suggests that the tandemly duplicated genes comprising the VRN2 locus, ZCCT1 and ZCCT2, respond to multiple environmental factors and have differences in gene expression patterns at a gene and subgenome level. These genes also show co-regulation, forming a regulatory loop between ZCCT-D1 and ZCCT-D2. The function of these genes beyond the classic vernalization response is explored in a facultative wheat with VRN-D2 identified to regulate early tiller development, with an accelerated rate of secondary tiller emergence and presence of coleoptile tillers. This phenotype increases ground coverage more rapidly, which provides agronomic benefits including improved competition with biological stressors. The findings identify that the VRN2 loci in bread wheat is formed of multiple genes which have overlapping but also unique regulation and function. Selecting these genes individually may offer a route to alter wheat plant architecture without directly impacting vernalization requirement.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

We imposed a 6-week drought on two-year old, potted saplings of Norway spruce and analysed chiral monoterpene emissions and tissue concentrations from needles and roots. Isotopically labelled pyruvate was used to compare tissue-specific contributions of de novo synthesis to chiral monoterpene concentrations. While de novo synthesis of (-)--pinene and both enantiomers of limonene was apparent in needle emissions, no label was incorporated in roots. Drought reduced chiral monoterpene emissions to 30% of control levels, but increased needle and root tissue concentrations by 150 and 230%, respectively. Aboveground monoterpene concentrations were dominated by (-)-limonene, whereas belowground concentrations mainly consisted of the (-)-enantiomers of -pinene, {beta}-pinene, {beta}-phellandrene and camphene. Chiral composition in needles shifted in response to drought but remained stable in roots. We conclude that chiral monoterpene composition is tissue-specific and likely related to tissue-specific functioning.

However, current agricultural practices have negatively impacted both wild populations of agave through overexploitation and habitat destruction, as well as cultivated plants by reducing available landraces and promoting the use of homogeneous plant material. Using genomic data (RADseq) and over 50,000 SNPs, we aimed to assess how local social and political decisions may have influenced genomic diversity and differentiation in intensively managed, clonally propagated Agave angustifolia (Espadin) in the state of Oaxaca, as well as in the cultivated A. angustifolia used to produce mezcal known as Bacanora in the state of Sonora and their wild counterparts from both regions. We found evidence suggesting that Espadin recently aroused through farmer selection of a clonal lineage with desirable mezcal production attributes (i.e., hybrid vigor), apparently from a cross between genetically distinct wild populations or by hybridization between wild and cultivated varieties. Espadin samples were represented by closely related heterozygous genotypes, with considerable genetic differentiation from wild plants. On the other hand, the genomic composition of cultivated Bacanora agave apparently was influenced by a recently lifted ban (in 1992) on its cultivation and distillation, which, along with the relatively lower popularity of this beverage, allowed cultivated Bacanora agave to maintain the genetic diversity found in wild populations of the regions.

Increased cell volume was measured in FBP/SBPase-expressing lines under different growth conditions. However, increased growth and biomass productivity were observed only in mixotrophy when light and CO2 were limiting, leading to increased starch, protein, and lipid content on a cellular basis.

The main taxane in T. baccata needles was 10-deacetylbacatin III (DAB), with concentrations ranging from 267.8 (Mt Vourinos) to 517.6 (Mt Olympus) mg kg-1 dw. Besides metabolite variation, notable levels of genetic diversity and significant population differentiation were revealed. These results, in conjunction to the high levels of total methylation found in all populations, indicate their potential adaptability under climatic change. The findings of this study pave the way for prospective breeding and conservation strategies of these important Taxus baccata L. populations for artificial selection of highly producing taxane trees and protection of local germplasm.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

We examined the possible effects of zeatin concentration in the plant regeneration medium, explant source, and species. Plants were grown to maturity under greenhouse conditions, pollen was collected and germinated. Flow cytometry analysis verified the utility of the pollen germination method for determining differences in ploidy, which was based on the number of pollen tubes produced with one tube representing diploid and two indicating polyploid. As for zeatin concentration, we assessed the effect of our standard method of initiation on medium containing 2 mg/l followed by 1 mg/l 2 weeks after culture initiation in comparison with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/l throughout the culture lifetime. There were no major correlations for zeatin concentration on ploidy status across the species except for plants regenerated from S. lycopersicum hypocotyl explants where the percentage of polyploid regenerants increased with increasing concentrations. As for species and explant effects, P. grisea plants regenerated from hypocotyl explants had the highest percentage of polyploid plants at 81% compared to 43% and 35% for S. lycopersicum and S. prinophyllum, respectively. From cotyledons, 8% of S. lycopersicum and 20% of S. prinophyllum were polyploid. A comparison with P. grisea could not be made because cotyledon explants do not regenerate on zeatin-containing medium. The results indicated the incidence of polyploidization cannot be generalized for zeatin concentration, however, an influence of explant type and species was observed. Effects of increased ploidy on plant morphology were primarily larger flower and seed size; however, no significant differences were observed in plant or fruit size.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

However, the cytological mechanism underlying its production remains poorly understood. Previous research has demonstrated that P-SEP is generated when M1 macrophages (M1 M{Phi}s) phagocytose neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and degrade internalized CD14. In this study, we demonstrated that M1 M{Phi}s phagocytose NETs and that proteinase 3 (PR3) within M1 M{Phi}s degrades NET-derived CD14, resulting in the production of P-SEP. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between the amount of NETs and P-SEP levels, indicating that NET phagocytosis is a key process in P-SEP generation. Our findings also suggest that PR3 released extracellularly along with NETs may degrade CD14 in plasma, contributing to elevated P-SEP levels. This mechanism may contribute to increased P-SEP concentrations observed in autoimmune diseases associated with NET accumulation, proposing P-SEP as a potential biomarker of disease activity beyond sepsis.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

By generating 20 endogenously tagged mitochondrial proteins, we identified a specialized mitochondrial subpopulation within the C. elegans anchor cell (AC) that localizes to the BM breaching site and generates elevated ATP to fuel invasion. These ETC-enriched high-capacity mitochondria are compositionally unique, harboring increased protein import machinery and dense cristae enriched with ETC components. High-capacity mitochondria emerge at the time of AC specification and depend on the AC pro-invasive transcriptional program. Finally, we show that netrin signaling through a Src kinase directs microtubule polarization, which facilitates metaxin adaptor complex dependent ETC-enriched mitochondrial trafficking to the AC invasive front. Our studies reveal that an invasive cell produces high ATP by generating and localizing high-capacity mitochondria.

In some yeast species, a large multi-nucleate mother cell grows multiple buds (daughters) simultaneously. Here we address how mothers partition growth equally among their buds in the multi-budding yeast Aureobasidium pullulans. Bud growth is directed by actin cable networks that appear to be optimized for even partitioning despite complex cell geometries. Even partitioning does not rely on compensatory mechanisms to adjust bud volumes, but rather stems directly from effective equalization of polarity sites.

Consensus indicates that CH4 emissions are stimulated by heat and UV, while CO release is additionally stimulated by visible light. The mechanisms producing these emissions are yet to be discovered. To get closer to finding these mechanisms, this study examined whether photosynthesis might influence CO and CH4 leaf emissions. Five plant species of different photosynthesis pathways were analysed for their photosynthesis performance, as well as CO and CH4 emissions under different temperatures and visible light intensities. Findings reveal CO release rates to be positively correlated with light intensity and temperature but suggest a separate dark metabolism. CH4 rates were independent of light intensity and temperature. Much lower CH4 release from excised leaves compared to their connected counterparts, indicates that such is dependent on stomatal opening, supporting the hypothesis that CH4 is dissolved in transpired water. CO release rates are similar between attached and detached leaves, suggesting that CO is produced at epidermal level.

However, cultivation of fruit-bearing crops such as tomatoes remains limited due to their high light demands, long growth periods, and tall plant structure. In this study, we aimed to develop an efficient cultivation system for tomatoes in a multilayer plant factory. Mini-tomatoes were hydroponically cultivated using white LEDs in a five-tier shelf system under two different cultivation methods. The conventional I-shaped method involved vertical growth on the top tier with downward lighting, while the novel S-shaped method trained each plant horizontally across the 2nd to 4th tiers with lateral lighting on each level. The S-shaped method enabled even light distribution, resulting in consistent photosynthetic rates throughout the canopy. In contrast, the I-shaped method suffered from strong light attenuation in the lower tiers, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency in shaded parts. Although total yield did not differ significantly between the two methods, the S-shaped method promoted earlier fruit maturation and improved fruit quality, including higher sugar content. Compared with greenhouse cultivation, plant factory conditions ensured stable temperature and lighting, leading to compact plant morphology, shorter internodes, and higher SPAD values. Moreover, fruit quality was more consistent year-round, with higher lycopene and sugar contents. This study demonstrates that the S-shaped cultivation system offers significant advantages in light use efficiency, plant management, and fruit quality. It represents a scalable approach for enhancing tomato production in plant factories and may facilitate the introduction of other high-light-demanding fruit crops into vertical farming systems.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

The study investigates the role of the SUMO interacting motif (SIM) in the subcellular targeting and cellular functions of EPAC1. It reveals that the SIM is a critical structural element for EPAC1's association with RanBP2/Nup358, a nucleoporin of the cytoplasmic filament component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Mutational disruption of EPAC1 SIM interferes with EPAC1's ability to activate its canonical effectors, small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2, and non-canonical functions, such as the formation of nuclear condensates and cellular SUMOylation. Because SIM is also directly involved in cAMP binding, RanBP2's association with EPAC1 with the SIM attenuates EPAC1's cAMP binding affinity to generate an EPAC1 signaling microdomain with reduced cAMP sensitivity around the NPC. The coupling between EPAC1's scaffold association and cAMP binding enables EPAC1 to tune its sensitivity to stress stimuli spatially depending on the cellular locations. These findings provide novel structural insights into EPAC1 signaling, highlighting the importance of SIM in EPAC1's cellular functions and potential novel strategies for therapeutically targeting EPAC1.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Loss of LRP10 resulted in aberrant Golgi accumulations of progranulin and prosaposin and their reduced abundance in lysosomes. Disease-linked LRP10 missense mutations failed to support this lysosomal trafficking.

A key event during apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which typically proceeds in a rapid all-or-none fashion. If MOMP occurs only in a subset of mitochondria (minority MOMP), it can be sublethal and contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Similarly, individual mitochondria escaping widespread MOMP (majority MOMP) can allow cancer cells to recover if apoptosis execution fails. How such heterogeneities in mitochondrial MOMP responsiveness arise within cells is incompletely understood. In particular, whether stochasticity in subcellular protein distributions and interactions across cytosol and mitochondria can realistically contribute to mitochondrial MOMP heterogeneity has not yet been studied. To assess this, we sequentially built and experimentally parameterized a particle-based, cell-sized model including cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and that featured a reduced interactome of MCL-1, BAK and tBID. High-performance computing enabled cell-scale simulations of protein distributions and interactions to understand how and under which conditions stochasticity could contribute to heterogeneity in MOMP susceptibility. Our results show that stochastic effects strongly predispose sub-pools of fragmented mitochondria to MOMP under low apoptotic stress. At higher apoptotic stress, fractions of small mitochondria were more likely to escape MOMP than large mitochondria. Retrospective quantification of mitochondrial sizes in experimental scenarios of minority and majority MOMP confirmed these findings. We therefore conclude that stochasticity substantially contributes to enabling small or fragmented mitochondria to undergo MOMP in minority MOMP scenarios and to escape MOMP in majority MOMP scenarios.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

We jointly investigated sensory integration and rule discovery in a visual prediction task where a hidden rule governed predictable changes in the sensory properties of presented stimuli - a rule that only half of tested participants discovered. Participants' performance in sensory integration during the control blocks (without a hidden rule) accurately predicted their ability to discover the rule. Conversely, discovering the rule modified participants' sensory integration strategy. Using computational modeling of human behavior and simulations of recurrent neural networks, we show that minimizing leak during sensory integration is the sole parameter with a selective causal impact on subsequent rule discovery.

However, the collective impact of demographic traits on DNA methylation and subsequent gene expression across human tissues remains unexplored. Here, we quantify the contributions of sex, age, genetic ancestry, and BMI on DNA methylation variation across 9 human tissues and 424 individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Results: We observe that inter-individual DNA methylation variation is higher than inter-individual gene expression variation. We show that genetic ancestry and age have a greater impact on DNA methylation than does sex, with aging effects being more widespread but less pronounced. On average, less than 10% of the gene expression variation in sex, age, and ancestry is mediated by DNA methylation differences, with ancestry showing the largest percentage of mediation. We show that DNA methylation differences between populations accumulate at regions with outlier DNA methylation profiles (high/lowly methylated) and are largely under genetic control. The female genome is predominantly hypermethylated across tissues, likely driven by the polycomb repressive complex. Ultimately, we demonstrate how aging increases DNA methylation levels at targets of the polycomb repressive complex in most tissues except the gonads. Conclusions: Overall, our multi-individual and multi-tissue analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of the main drivers of human DNA methylation variation under healthy conditions, laying the foundations for clinical studies considering demographic perspectives.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Our in silico models predicted therapeutic synergy of two iterations of conformation-specific RAF inhibitors: Type I[1/2] + Type II and Type I + Type II. Predictions were validated in vitro in AML cell lines and patient samples, with synergy verified by the Loewe Additivity model. Lifirafenib (Type II) + encorafenib (Type I[1/2]) was highly synergistic against both NRAS- and KRAS-mutant lines, while synergy of lifirafenib + SB590885 (Type I) was specific to NRAS-mutants. Immunoblotting confirmed that combination efficacy correlated strongly with decreased RAS pathway activation. Leveraging the pharmacokinetic predictions of our in silico model, both combinations were then assessed in a pre-clinical NRAS-mutant AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, showing significantly improved leukaemia growth delay and event-free survival compared with single agent approaches. Assessment of leukemia burden in bone marrow and spleen during treatment further showed site-specific efficacy against circulating and spleen-resident blasts for both combinations.

However, relatively few studies have investigated whether diapause can independently trigger increased glycerol production. In other words, little research has been dedicated to analyzing whether diapause and glycerol upregulation are linked. If a linkage between these two elements in insects exists, then photoinduced diapausing insects should upregulate glycerol production, even without exposure to cold temperatures. The current study examines whether this linkage exists in the tobacco hornworm pupae (Manduca sexta). Tobacco hornworms will enter a pupal diapause if presented with consistently short photoperiods, most notably 12 hours of daylight followed 12 hours of darkness. Regarding temperature, photoinduction of diapause in the tobacco hornworm is optimal at 26 degrees celsius. Using a spectrophotometric assay, glycerol levels in hemolymph were assessed in non-diapausing pupae shortly after pupation and in diapausing pupae after 16 days of pupation. Interestingly, non-diapausing pupae contained significantly higher glycerol levels in hemolymph compared to diapausing pupae. Furthermore, non-diapausing pupae produced approximately .099 M glycerol and diapausing pupae produced .085 M glycerol. This study provides evidence that glycerol upregulation and diapause are not linked in Manduca sexta, but are rather two separate events with two distinct causes. Nevertheless, the results are valuable since non-diapause specimens produced more glycerol than diapausing specimens, and moderately high concentrations of glycerol were found in both diapausing pupae and non-diapausing pupae.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Three different visual perturbations were applied: fixating a stationary target at eye level while the background moved to the right (MB), tracking a target moving rightward over a stationary background with head rotation (MT-HR), and tracking the moving target with eye movement only (MT-EM). Linear models were fit to the kinematics data to predict foot placement from CoM state at mid-swing. Over the whole trial, MT-HR and MT-EM caused an increase in step width variability, CoM position variability and foot placement residual error. During visual perturbation epochs specifically, in MB, a left deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed from the start of background movement. In MT-HR and MT-EM, a right deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed only after the target had stopped moving. Contrary to our expectations, foot placement errors did not coincide with subsequent CoM deviations in the opposite direction. An obvious change in frontal plane trunk orientation was found only in MT-HR. While all visual perturbations affected control of the CoM trajectory in the frontal plane, these effects appeared caused by effects on heading as well as balance control.

We find that the same ten insect families, consisting mostly of small species, dominate the abundance and diversity, accounting for over half the species across climates, habitats, and sites. Surprisingly, five of the ten have non-significant or even an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient, while the remaining five exhibit only weak to average gradients compared to 470 other terrestrial taxa. Three of the top-ten taxa are parasitoid families, but only one, ichneumonid wasps, display a strong inverse gradient, thus indicating that parasitoidism alone cannot explain this unusual gradient.

Error-corrected DNA sequencing techniques, such as Duplex Sequencing (DS), have error rates low enough to revolutionise genetic toxicology testing by directly measuring in vivo mutagenesis within days of exposure. Here, DS was performed on liver samples from an OECD-compliant, Transgenic Rodent Gene Mutation Assay (TGR) conducted under GLP standards. MutaTMMouse specimens were orally dosed with NDMA using either a repeat-dose 28-day regimen (0.02-4 mg/kg(bw)/day) or single bolus doses of either 5 or 10 mg/kg(bw) administered on day one. Dose-dependent increases in mutation frequency were detected by DS in liver, enabling a No-Observed Genotoxic Effect Level (NOGEL) of 0.07 mg/kg(bw)/day to be determined, supported by mechanistic analyses of trinucleotide mutation spectra. Benchmark dose (BMD) modelling determined similar BMD50 values from either DS or TGR, demonstrating concordance across the two techniques albeit with greater precision from DS due to smaller inter-animal variation. DS offers a fundamental change in mutagenicity assessments enabling more precise point-of-departure determinations with mechanistic clarity and 3Rs advantages compared to the standard TGR approach.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

They form the component of protective immune response and are shown to be enriched in the effector memory expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) in humans. However, the lack of understanding about their lineage, molecular characters, and cytolytic potential in comparison to CD8-CTLs has restricted their utility. Thus, in this study, by parallelly analysing the CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs, we demonstrate that they are indistinguishable for the cytolytic program, with both showing similar gene expression profile and T cell antigen-receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in humans. Further, using an integrative multi-omics analysis combining the transcriptome, TCR repertoire, and open chromatin profile of CD4+ naive (CD4-TN) and memory T-cell subsets, we discovered a distinct stem-cell memory subset (TSCM-CTL) that is pre-committed to the cytolytic program that shared significant TCR clonotypes with expanded CD4-CTL-effectors. Further, through an in vitro differentiation model, we developed CD4+ T-cells with cytolytic potential (iCD4-CTLs) from CD4-TN cells that showed gradual and progressive acquisition of cytolytic program, exhibiting progressive chromatin accessibility at cytotoxicity-associated genes. Of particular interest was the property of iCD4-CTLs that co-expressed longevity-associated genes along with cytotoxicity-associated genes, hence generating long-lived CD4-CTL-effectors. Overall, the process of generation of iCD4-CTLs from CD4-TN, deciphered the molecular signatures of early commitment to the cytotoxicity program. Together, our study advocates for exploring both CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs for vaccine development, vaccine efficacy testing, as well as immunotherapies and cell-based therapies for precision medicine.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Despite advances in computational BGC detection, current methods face challenges, including time-consuming sequence alignments, dependence on known homologs and manually defined rules, limiting its robustness and generalizability. To address these, we present CoreFinder, a deep learning framework that integrates protein language models (pLMs) and genomic contexts to predict product class and decipher gene functions within BGCs without alignment. CoreFinder demonstrated higher precision of 0.945 (842/891) and recall of 0.821 (842/1,025) than antiSMASH for core gene annotation in over 700 experimentally validated fungal BGCs. Built on CoreFinder, we introduced an end-to-end scalable workflow for BGC screening and deciphering, which is about 240 times faster than antiSMASH. Applied to 256 genomes spanning 197 taxa, CoreFinder identified 6,414 core genes within 4,585 BGCs. Further analysis indicates that a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) family likely existed prior to the divergence of Fusarium and Aspergillus and evolved into function-specific gene clusters.

Moreover, variations in data quality can be high and unpredictable, which necessitates further flexibility and interactivity. While individual components exist, there is an unmet need for a coherent toolbox that offers end-to-end coverage of the workflow, flexibility, and automation.

We demonstrate spatialproteomics on a set of images of reactive lymph nodes or different forms of B cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BNHL) from 132 patients. We showcase an end-to-end analysis from raw images to statistical characterization of cell type composition and spatial distribution across indolent and aggressive lymphomas.

R.", "abstract": "Aims: Molecular clocks in the vasculature contribute to the normal circadian blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Glucocorticoids are known to synchronise molecular clocks within peripheral tissues. Disruption of the endogenous glucocorticoid rhythm causes ''non-dipping'', a BP pattern associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. The mechanisms for this are unclear but vascular changes likely contribute. We examined the effect of impaired glucocorticoid rhythmicity on the time-of-day dependent vascular function and define the circadian transcriptome under control conditions and under arrhythmic glucocorticoids. Methods and Results: Male C57BL6J mice kept on a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle were implanted with a subcutaneous slow-release pellet containing vehicle or corticosterone (~3.7mg/kg/day), which flattened the endogenous glucocorticoid rhythm. After 7 days, renal arteries were isolated at 7am and 7pm to measure vasoreactivity using wire myography. Other arteries were taken 2-hourly over a 48-hour period for RNA sequencing. In control arteries, endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation was elevated at wake-phase compared to the sleep-phase. This temporal variation was absent in the renal arteries from corticosterone treated mice. Using CircaCompare and LimoRhyde, we found circadian rhythms in 459 of the 14 225 protein-coding transcripts in control arteries. Following corticosterone treatment, 156 genes lost their rhythm, including canonical clock genes, genes involved in ''peroxide homeostasis'' such as Nox4 and ''TNF signalling'' like Mmp14. Paradoxically 492 genes gained a rhythm and were predominantly mitochondrial-related. Conclusions: This study expands the molecular landscape for understanding circadian vascular physiology and emphasises the impact of glucocorticoid rhythm on temporal changes in gene expression and vascular function. This is clinically relevant to the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction associated with perturbed glucocorticoid signalling for e.g. in metabolic syndrome and chronic stress.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Necroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death, is activated in aging livers, and genetic (Ripk3-/- or Mlkl-/- mice) or pharmacological (RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1s) inhibition of necroptosis attenuates liver inflammation and pathology. However, the cell type-specific role of necroptosis in liver aging remains unclear. Given that MLKL is expressed in hepatocytes, and its expression increases with age, we generated hepatocyte-specific MLKL-overexpressing mice (MLKLHepOE) to determine its role in liver aging. Unexpectedly, MLKL overexpression in hepatocytes did not induce necroptosis, but instead upregulated markers of cellular senescence (cell cycle arrest genes and SASP factors), increased macrophage infiltration, and elevated M1 macrophage marker expression. Electron microscopy and mitochondrial analyses revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology, elevated oxidative stress, and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, while lipidomics demonstrated alterations in hepatic lipid metabolites. In agreement with our observations in MLKLHepOE mice, MLKL overexpression in AML12 hepatocytes impaired mitochondrial respiration, increased proinflammatory extracellular vesicle (EV) release, and induced senescence markers, without triggering cell death. Together, these findings reveal a non-lethal, non-necroptotic role for MLKL in promoting hepatocyte senescence and metabolic dysfunction via mitochondrial impairment and EV-mediated inflammation. Our study highlights MLKL as a novel driver of liver inflammaging and a potential therapeutic target for age-related liver disease.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that the spontaneous doubling of chromosome III in the orc5-1 set1{triangleup} mutant accelerates proliferation, a benefit resulting from a reduction in the negative effect of the orc5-1 mutation. Enhanced proliferation is also observed when a fragment from a different chromosome is introduced, demonstrating that the benefit is not simply due to extra copies of specific genes. A comparable growth-enhancing effect of an extra chromosome is observed for mutations affecting other proteins involved in DNA replication licensing. The suppression of orc5-1 growth defect is also observed in the absence of the G1 cyclin Cln3, which lengthens the G1 phase, while overexpressing CLN3, which shortens G1, has the opposite effect. Additionally, Cln3 loss mirrors the effect of an extra chromosome for other mutations. These findings indicate that the severity of mutations impacting origin licensing hinges on the length of the G1 phase. Thus, we propose that the fitness-enhancing effect of an extra chromosome in DNA replication licensing mutants largely stems from its ability to extend G1, compensating for inefficient origin licensing.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

We applied this framework to an expanded SIDERITE database containing 918 siderophore structures. To demonstrate practical applications, we identified specific precursors utilized by the beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens but not by the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.

These mappings, referred to as individual (cortex) parcellations, aim to capture individual variability in areal organization by learning from both structural and functional data. However, a strict supervised learning approach using the group parcellation as labels would have no incentive to learn individual differences that registration is unable to reconcile (e.g., atypical 55b topologies).

However, the metabolic rules that determine product chain length have remained elusive. Here, we combine 13C isotope tracing, proteomics, and metabolic modelling to show that distinct acetate utilization strategies underlie the divergence between butyrate- and MCFA-producing CEB. MCFA-producing strains sustain redox balance while recycling acetate to maximize lactate use under acetate limitation, but at the cost of slower growth due to increased protein burden. In contrast, butyrate-producing strains grow faster due to lower protein costs by favoring acetate assimilation, at the cost of restricted lactate utilization when acetate is scarce. These physiological trade-offs are encoded in the substrate specificity of coenzyme A transferase, the terminal enzyme in reverse {beta}-oxidation. Our findings uncover a fundamental constraint shaping chain-length selectivity in CEB and offer new strategies to optimize MCFA production from organic waste streams.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

While Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-based methods have provided static snapshots of chromatin architecture, the kinetics of chromosomal encounters in live cells remain poorly characterized. In this study, we employ Chemically Induced Chromosomal Interaction (CICI) to measure encounter times between multiple loci pairs in G1-arrested budding yeast. Our results show that chromosome motion closely follows the Rouse polymer model, with similar diffusion parameters at all tested loci. Surprisingly, we find that long-range intra-chromosomal encounters occur significantly faster than inter-chromosomal encounters at similar 3D distances. Using targeted depletion experiments, we identify condensin, but not cohesin, as the complex responsible for these rapid intra-chromosomal interactions. This is further supported by Hi-C analysis, which reveals that condensin promotes long-distance intra-chromosomal interactions in G1 yeast. Through polymer simulations, we estimate that condensin extrudes chromatin at ~2 kb/s with a density of one complex per 1-2 Mb and a processivity of 120-220 kb. These findings uncover a novel role for condensin in shaping the interphase genome organization and provide new insights into chromosomal search dynamics in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

PFAS are known to both bioaccumulate and biomagnify, therefore, species higher on the food chain, such as marine mammals, are highly exposed to these chemicals. Although studies suggest that considerable maternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants occurs via lactation, data is lacking on the temporal trends associated with PFAS exposure. Here, we utilized a set of dolphin breastmilk samples from an individual mother across a two-year lactation period to evaluate longitudinal trends in PFAS concentrations and profiles. Thirty-six PFAS were detected using a multidimensional platform combining liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS), and of these, 17 PFAS were detected continuously across the nursing window of 103-706 days. Quantitative analysis specifically showed concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) alone surpass weekly intake recommendations from the European Food Safety Authority and Food Standards Australia New Zealand by 1,000-fold but decreased slightly over time, possibly due to transfer from feedings. Non-targeted analysis also identified 13 additional compounds including two long-chained perfluorosulfonic acids not traditionally targeted, as well as the PFOS precursors, perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS) and 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido)ethyl phosphate (SAmPAP).

However, the efficiency of PDT is often hindered by the limited penetration of visible light into tissues, requiring the use of infrared activable PS. Furthermore, PS are usually prone to aggregation and present solubility issues limiting their bioavailability. In this study, we explore the functionalization of temoporfin (mTHPC), a clinically approved second-generation PS, with two-photon absorption (TPA) chromophores to enhance its efficiency in deep tissues. Three TPA-temoporfin conjugates (DTP1-mTHPC, DTP2-mTHPC, and DPP-mTHPC) have been designed and their properties have been investigated using a combination of quantum mechanics (QM), molecular dynamics (MD), and hybrid QM/MM simulations. Computational analysis revealed that the TPA cross-section ({sigma}) of the parent DTP moieties significantly increase when anchored to mTHPC, thus allowing efficient absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Additionally, we have shown that their encapsulation with {beta}-cyclodextrins ({beta}-CDs) improved solubility and prevented aggregation without altering the optical properties of the PS. Simulations in a biological membrane model confirmed favorable interactions and localization of the candidate PDT agents within lipid bilayers, supporting their potential for enhanced clinical applications. This study demonstrates that rational molecular design can improve both the optical properties and the drug-delivery proficiency of temoporfin, paving the way for more effective deep-tissue PDT treatments.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Interstitial fluid flow plays a critical role in maintaining function and homeostasis in neural tissue, and dysregulation of this flow due to injury or disease results in mechanical stress that is associated with several neuropathologies, including traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, and glioma. Glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia are known to respond to mechanical forces like fluid shear stress but the impact of this stress on their functionality and any subsequent impact on neurons remains poorly defined. To investigate how pathologically high fluid shear stress modulates astrocyte and microglia function and to determine whether glial responses to fluid shear influence neuronal survival and morphology, we applied low pathological levels of fluid shear stress (0.1 dynes/cm2) to cultured human astrocytes and microglia and assessed functional changes including metabolic activity, metabolite release, lipid droplet accumulation, and phagocytic activity. Conditioned media from these glia were then applied to differentiated SH-SY5Y neurons to evaluate effects on cell survival and neurite outgrowth. We then focused on identifying the soluble factor mediating the observed neurotoxicity. We found that fluid shear stress promotes distinct functional responses in astrocytes and microglia, including increased metabolic activity in astrocytes, increased lipid droplet accumulation in microglia, and heightened release of extracellular ATP in both cell types. Exposure to shear-conditioned glial media significantly reduced neuronal survival and neurite length. This neurotoxic effect was abolished by activated charcoal filtration but not by boiling and was prevented through P2X7 receptor inhibition in neurons, suggesting extracellular ATP as a causative agent. These findings indicate that high fluid shear stress promotes glial-mediated neurotoxicity via purinergic signaling. This study helps to characterize glial-neuronal mechanobiological interaction in the context of neuropathology and provides support for targeting purinergic signaling pathways as a therapeutic approach for neuropathologies associated with altered interstitial fluid flow.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Many studies employ these algorithms to compare signaling between conditions and lack methods to statistically identify signals that are significantly different. We previously developed the cell communication inference algorithm Domino, which considers ligand and receptor gene expression in association with downstream transcription factor activity scoring. We developed the dominoSignal software to innovate upon Domino and extend its functionality to test statistically differential cellular signaling. This new functionality includes compilation of active signals as linkages from multiple subjects in a single-cell data set and testing condition-dependent signaling linkage. The software is applicable for analysis of single-cell data sets with multiple subjects as biological replicates as well as with bootstrapped replicates from data sets with few or pooled subjects. We use simulation studies to benchmark the number of subjects in compared groups and cells within an annotated cell type sufficient to accurately identify differential linkages. We demonstrate the application of the Differential Cell Signaling Test (DCST) in the dominoSignal software to investigate consequences of cancer cell phenotypes and immunotherapy on cell-cell communication in tumor microenvironments.

We characterized 17 high frequency oncohistone mutations in H2A H2B, and H3 that are enriched in breast cancer samples and occurred at glutamate (E), aspartate (D), serine (S), and arginine (R) residues. Many of these mutants co-occur with PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer samples. The oncohistone mutants were expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells or MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells and screened for effects on oncogenic phenotypes in a variety of cell- and tumor-based assays (i.e., proliferation, migration, invasion, competitive outgrowth, transformation). In addition, we examined the effects of selected mutants on DNA damage and gene expression. Our results indicate that the collection of oncohistone mutants that we screened have varying phenotypic and functional effects. Some can promote cancer-related phenotypes, with H2B-E76Q, H3-E97K, and H3-E105K eliciting strong oncogenic phenotypes and alterations in gene expression. All three of these mutants showed cooperativity with an activating mutation in PIK3CA (E545K), or a chemical activator of PI3K (UCL-TRO-1938), in assays of MCF-10A proliferation. H3-E105K also strongly promoted transformation of MCF-10A cells in an assay of growth on low attachment substrate independently of PIK3CA.

However, whether such immune imprinting influences susceptibility to sterile inflammatory diseases like colitis remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate whether a resolved Citrobacter rodentium (CR) infection in mouse alters host susceptibility to chemically induced colitis and to identify the underlying immune mechanisms. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were infected with wild-type CR or CR lacking Map and EspF, a mutant lacking tight junction-disrupting effectors. 3 weeks post clearance, mice were subjected to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Disease severity was assessed by weight change, colon length, histopathology, and myeloperoxidase levels. Colonic immune cell populations were characterised by flow cytometry, and cytokine levels were measured from colon explants. Functional roles of IL-17A were evaluated using recombinant cytokine administration and neutralising antibody treatment. Results: Mice that cleared CR infection fared better following DSS treatment compared to uninfected or CRdelMap_EspF-infected mice. This protective phenotype was not directly dependent on microbiota, as confirmed by co-housing experiments. Protected mice displayed elevated numbers of colonic Th1 and Th17 cells and higher levels of IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-2 cytokines. Prophylactic treatment with IL-17A conferred protection in naive mice, whereas IL-17A neutralisation in previously infected mice abrogated the benefit, identifying IL-17A as a key mediator of protection. Conclusions: Resolved intestinal infection with CR confers long-term protection against colitis via persistent IL-17A-mediated immune reprogramming.

In this study, we identified berberrubine as a compound that promotes MITOL expression and activates mitochondria. We further assembled a group of berberrubine-based compounds, including its quinoid form and a newly developed water-soluble derivative, and collectively named them 'Mitorubin' as mitochondria-activating compounds with therapeutic potential.

Although the structure, function, and regulation of these pathways has been well established for many organisms, an understanding of their ecological and evolutionary dynamics lags behind. Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) deliver effectors between competing Gram-negative bacteria, including among mammalian gut Bacteroidales, resulting in the evolution of elaborate defense mechanisms that protect against T6SS attack. One such mechanism is the recombinase-associated acquired interbacterial defence (rAID) system, which harbors arrays of orphan immunity genes that diverge in sequence from T6SS-associated cognate immunity genes. It is not known if such sequence divergence impacts rAID orphan immunity function, or how rAID distribution across microbiomes relates to the T6SS. Here, we show that divergent rAID orphan immunity factors that possess dual SUKH domains allow bacteria to survive intoxication by cognate effectors. Such protection is due to high affinity protein-protein interactions between orphan immunity and effector that are comparable to that of cognate effector-immunity. Unlike other examples of T6SS effector-immunity interactions, we find that the binding interface is comprised of electrostatic interactions with a high degree of redundancy underlying its protective capacity. Finally, we quantify orphan immunity and effector gene abundance and dynamics across human gut metagenomes, revealing patterns of co-occurrence indicative of positive selection. Population genetic analyses of longitudinal data suggests that orphan immunity genes accumulate non-synonymous mutations that lie at the predicted protein interface.

Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts -rather than taxonomic changes alone- play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying translation termination, recycling, and quality control remain unclear. Here, via high-resolution mitochondrial Ribo-Seq and Disome-Seq, we revealed: the specificity of release factors for different kinds of stop codons; the role of mtRF1 in vertebrates, which do not have noncanonical stop codons in their main ORFs; the recycling-coupled translation of internal ORFs; and the rescue of mitoribosomes in the early elongation stage. mtRF1L is a universal release factor that recognizes all stop codons, whereas mtRF1 recognizes only AGA/AGG noncanonical stop codons. Additionally, mtRF1 terminates the translation of out-of-frame ORFs that end with AGA/AGG. We also found that mtRRF and mtIF3 are required for mitoribosome recycling on stop codons and for the reinitiation of internal ORF translation. Mitoribosomes that stall at start codons are major substrates of the rescue factors ICT1, mtRF-R, and mtRES1. Moreover, HEMK1-mediated methylation of release factors enhances the termination reaction on stop codons. Our results provide insights into the mitoribosome dynamics that are associated with the completion of protein synthesis.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Using this method, we revealed that selection primarily occurs within a narrow developmental window during germline cysts differentiation. At this stage, the proportion of the deleterious mtDNA variant decreases without a reduction in its absolute copy number. Instead, the healthier mtDNA variant replicates more frequently, thereby outcompeting the co-existing deleterious variant.

However, progress in resistance breeding is hindered by the limited capability of current approaches to measure highly quantitative disease phenotypes under field conditions with high precision and sufficient throughput. Here, we present an imaging protocol and a modular image processing pipeline that enables wheat disease detection and severity estimation directly from very-high-resolution canopy imagery, eliminating the need for physical interaction with the monitored plants as required in previously proposed sensor-based methods capable of symptom-level diagnosis. The pipeline combines deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, and depth estimation to diagnose and quantify disease symptoms and extract the analyzable reference plant surfaces for severity estimation. By leveraging estimated relative depth and analyzing image texture, well-focused areas with sufficient quality were accurately segmented. Despite the challenging nature of canopy images and frequent symptom ambiguity, symptom detection and segmentation models trained on a new dataset reached a similar performance as already described in more simplified scenarios where detached, flattened leaves were analyzed. Plot-level severity estimates of Septoria Tritici Blotch, a major wheat disease, obtained using the new method and a precise but more laborious reference method were highly correlated (Pearson R=0.83) across a range of morphologically contrasting cultivars. Validation of the new method on data collected by different operators at different sites demonstrated the robustness of the approach.

Gelation time assays demonstrated that the P407-peptide formulation solidified more quickly than P407 alone at equivalent concentrations. Rheological analysis revealed a 1.5kPa increase in storage modulus in the hybrid hydrogel, confirming improved mechanical integrity. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed using human chondrocytes, with MTS assays and LIVE/DEAD staining indicating no cytotoxicity across tested concentrations. To evaluate in vivo applicability, a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye was incorporated into the hydrogel and injected intra-articularly into an osteoarthritis (OA) mouse model. The labeled formulation allowed for successful tracking and demonstrated localized gelation, supporting its suitability for site-specific, sustained delivery.

They play a vital role in maintaining ecological equilibrium and promoting the health of their hosts. Consequently, understanding the diversity in terms of strains in microbial communities is crucial, as variations between strains can lead to different phenotypic expressions or diverse biological functions. However, current methods for taxonomic classification from metagenomic sequencing data have several limitations, including their reliance solely on species resolution, support for either short or long reads, or their confinement to a given single species. Most notably, most existing strain-level taxonomic classifiers rely on the sequence representation of multiple linear reference genomes, which fails to capture the sequence correlations among these genomes, potentially introducing ambiguity and biases in metagenomic profiling. Here, we present PanTax, a pangenome graph-based taxonomic profiler that overcomes the shortcomings of sequence-based approaches, because pangenome graphs possess the capability to depict the full range of genetic variability present across multiple evolutionarily or environmentally related genomes. PanTax provides a comprehensive solution to taxonomic classification for strain resolution, compatibility with both short and long reads, and compatibility with single or multiple species. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that PanTax drastically outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, primarily evidenced by its significantly higher precision or recall at strain level, while maintaining comparable or better performance in other aspects across various datasets.

However, this approach suffers from low throughput and subjectivity. Here, we introduce BoostMut (Biophysical Overview of Optimal Stabilizing Mutations), a computational tool that standardizes and automates mutation filtering by analyzing dynamic structural features from MD. BoostMut formalizes the principles guiding manual verification, providing a consistent and reproducible stability assessment. Rigorous benchmarking across multiple datasets showed that integrating BoostMut's biophysical analysis improves prediction rate regardless of the initial thermostability predictor. Given a modest amount of existing mutant stability data, BoostMut's performance can be further enhanced with a lightweight machine learning model. Upon experimentally validating BoostMut predictions on the enzyme limonene-epoxide hydrolase, we identified stabilizing mutations previously overlooked by visual inspection, and achieved a higher overall success rate.

To probe this proposed limitation, we developed a large and diverse dataset comprising paired RNA sequences and their corresponding secondary structures. We assess the utility of this enhanced dataset by retraining two deep learning models, SincFold and MXfold2. We find that SincFold exhibited improved generalization to some previously unseen RNA families, enhancing its capability to predict accurate de novo RNA secondary structures. By contrast, retraining MXfold2 proved too computationally expensive for the large RNASSTR dataset and did not achieve high performance on the testing set. The RNASSTR dataset provides a substantial advance for RNA structure modeling, laying a strong foundation for the development of future RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Automated ML classifiers trained on these sets achieved accuracies of 96-99% on held-out test data (macro-average F1 scores of 0.93-0.99), surpassing clinical deployment thresholds. Interestingly, multiple distinct, non-overlapping gene subsets exhibited comparable predictive performance, indicating that resistance acquisition broadly impacts the expression of diverse regulatory and metabolic genes.

G.; Chiew, M.", "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a non-contrast MRI method for the simultaneous acquisition of time-resolved 3D angiographic, perfusion and multi-contrast T1-weighted structural brain images in a single six-minute acquisition. Methods: The proposed Combined Angiographic, Structural and Perfusion Radial Imaging using Arterial Spin Labeling (CASPRIA) pulse sequence uses pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) to label inflowing blood, an inversion pulse to provide background suppression and T1-weighted contrast, and a continuous 3D golden ratio spoiled gradient echo readout. Label-control subtraction isolates the blood signal and can be flexibly reconstructed at high/low spatiotemporal resolution for angiography/perfusion imaging. The mean signal retains the static tissue, allowing T1-weighted structural images to be reconstructed at different effective inversion times. CASPRIA was compared with conventional time-of-flight (TOF) angiography, 3D-gradient and spin echo (3D-GRASE) PCASL perfusion imaging and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) structural imaging (10 minutes total) in healthy volunteers. Results: CASPRIA gave improved distal vessel visibility and fewer artefacts than TOF angiography, whilst also providing dynamic information, with blood transit time and dispersion maps. CASPRIA perfusion images were comparable to 3D-GRASE data, but without through-slice blurring or artefacts in inferior brain regions. Comparable quantitative cerebral blood flow maps were produced, with CASPRIA being significantly more repeatable. Structural CASPRIA images were comparable to MP-RAGE, but also yielded a range of T1-weighted contrasts and allowed quantitative T1 maps to be estimated. Conclusion: CASPRIA is an efficient single acquisition to provide intrinsically co-registered quantitative information about brain blood flow and structure that has considerable advantages over conventional methods.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate analysis offers a fast and noise-resistant approach by classifying the states of brain signals into spatial distribution patterns (templates). Each EEG segment was assigned the template with the highest spatial correlation, reducing the information to a one-dimensional representation. However, prior BCI studies have often ignored the polarity of spatial distributions in these templates. Incorporating polarity during labeling may enhance classification performance. This study investigated the effectiveness of polarity-considered microstate labeling for classifying infrequent stimuli in an auditory-visual oddball task with implications for BCI applications. Method: EEG recordings were analyzed using polarity-considered microstate labeling to classify infrequent stimuli. This study examined the effects of stimulus modality (auditory or visual), modality conditions (unimodal: stimulus and response in the same modality; cross-modal: stimulus and response in different modalities), and response type (key-press task vs. mental counting task) on classification accuracy. Machine learning models were used for classification, including support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, CatBoost and K-means methods. Results: Polarity-considered labeling outperformed the non-polarity approach, especially in decision-tree-based models (20.1% improvement in the key-press task and 22.2% improvement in the mental counting task). A significant interaction was observed between stimulus modality and response type, with the highest accuracy achieved when the infrequent stimuli in the key-press task involved cross-modal visual information.

Our findings reveal that Pg, upon translocating to this new niche, significantly attenuated lung damage by reducing viral loads during respiratory viral infections in the lungs of wild-type mice. This protective effect was attributed to the activity of gingipains, cysteine endopeptidases produced by Pg, which cleaved envelope glycoproteins on RSV as well as on related murine-specific Sendai virus (SeV), thereby impairing their infectious capacity. Notably, the reduction in viral loads was independent of interferon lambda (IFN-{lambda}) signaling, which is actively suppressed by Pg in airway epithelial cells. However, the complete absence of IFN-{lambda} signaling resulted in a stronger inflammatory response despite a low viral load. Thus, we show a previously undescribed role for the oro-respiratory bacterial colonizer Pg in creating bottlenecks to viral infection by the activity of its proteases.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

The average fecundity of C. maculipennis was 39.13 eggs, with an intrinsic rate of increase (r) of 0.137, and a mean generation time (T) of 19.73 days. The population doubling time was 5.05 days, with the highest survival rate observed in the first instar larvae (0.95), and the lowest in the adult stage (< 0.38). The population doubling time was 5.05 days. Survival was highest in first-instar larvae (0.95) and lowest in adults (< 0.38). Life expectancy peaked at age zero (e0 =15.57 days) and decreased with pivotal age. The reproductive value (Vx) peaked between 13 and 19 days post-field appearance. Pupal development was fastest, with a significantly higher adult-emergence recorded in sandy clay loam soil (9.67 days); however pupal development and adult-emergence were severely impacted in black cotton and marshy soils. Moderate soil moisture (20%) favored pupation and eclosion rate, while dry (10%) and saturated (30%) soils hindered pupation and emergence. Population projections over 90 days, starting with 133 eggs, estimated an adult population of 3,80738. These findings highlight pupal and adult stages as critical targets for management.

Recent genomic analysis of wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains shows that this species has rapidly spread from its ancestral environments in the Hawaiian Pacific regions out to the rest of the world in the past 100-200 years(8, 9). This recent history sets the stage for addressing how C. elegans behavior has adapted to novel environments in this colonization process. We focus on the evolution of collective behavior, which is ecologically relevant for this boom-and-bust species(10). We selected a panel of 13 genetically diverse wild strains of C. elegans sampled from around the globe, categorized them into environmentally-relevant climate groups, and conducted aggregation behavior experiments and analysis to capture subtle natural variation among these populations. We found that the strains from the more recently colonized temperate regions show decreased spatial magnitude and temporal persistence in their aggregation behavior compared to strains from the ancestral sub/tropical regions. Furthermore, the observed behavioral divergence between the two climate groups closely aligns with genetically predicted phenotypic evolution, potentially reflecting heritable behavioral adaptation to temperate environments as the species spread globally.

Double-digest restriction-associated-DNA (ddRAD) sequencing was used to collect genome-wide sequence data for 228 peninsular lizards. Using phylogenetic analyses of concatenated loci and population admixture analysis of unlinked SNPs, we identified 24 potential lineages within the five co-distributed complexes. Four of the five complexes exhibited contact zones between lineages at the Isthmus of La Paz, and all five did in the Vizcaino Desert. To generate data for a species tree model, we subsampled two lizards from each of these 24 lineages for use with a target sequence capture (TSC) protocol. The resulting time-calibrated species tree shows that within each genus, the La Paz divergences are older than those across the Vizcaino Desert. A full-likelihood Bayesian comparative phylogeographic approach was also used to test the simultaneous divergence hypothesis for the Isthmus of La Paz and Vizcaino Desert, providing strong support for at least three independent divergence events at each contact zone, thereby rejecting the simultaneous divergence hypothesis. Finally, we demonstrate through expanded geographic sampling (n=142) and ddRAD that zebra-tailed lizards (Callisaurus), in which the most divergent lineages are endemic to the southern BCP, exhibit a clear pattern of Pleistocene range expansion from the northern BCP into the deserts of the western United States and mainland Mexico. The most deeply nested individuals in our tree occur at the northern, eastern, and southeastern range limits in temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes, respectively.

We further applied this approach to study glucose metabolism in synaptosomes isolated from the 5X-FAD mouse model of AD treated with the antidiabetic sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor Dapagliflozin. Treatment with Dapagliflozin preserved steady-state levels of synaptosomal metabolites and enrichment from labeled glucose into citrate that was reduced in the 5X-FAD model.

Closed-biased LplA variants exhibited greater sequence-specificity than wild-type, enabling targeted fluorophore labeling of proteins in living cells, while open-based LplA variants were far more promiscuous, enabling proximity-dependent proteome tagging in cells. Due to its straightforward and rapid implementation (https://github.com/alicetinglab/ConformationalBiasing/), CB should be a versatile tool for engineering conformational bias into a wide range of proteins, resulting in altered or novel functions with utility for basic science, biotechnology, or medicine.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}

K.; Thomas, A.", "abstract": "Lamin A/C (LMNA), a key component of the nuclear envelope, is essential for maintaining nuclear integrity and genome organization [1]. While LMNA dysregulation has been implicated in genomic instability across cancer and aging, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood [2]. Here, we investigate LMNA's role in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by extreme genomic instability [3, 4]. We demonstrate that LMNA depletion promotes R-loop accumulation, transcription-replication conflicts, replication stress, DNA breaks, and micronuclei formation. Mechanistically, LMNA loss disrupts nuclear pore complex distribution, reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation and impairing RNA export efficiency. Furthermore, we show that LMNA expression is epigenetically repressed by EZH2 during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states. Clinically, low LMNA levels correlate with significantly worse survival in SCLC patients. These findings uncover a novel role for LMNA in safeguarding genome integrity and shaping tumor heterogeneity, with broad implications for cancer and aging.", "date": "2025-05-03", "journal": ""}
