Recent studies have demonstrated intergenerationally inherited changes in the olfactory system in response to fear conditioning, resulting in increases in olfactory sensory neuron frequencies and altered responses to odors. We investigated changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory epithelium in response to an aversive stimulus. Here, we achieve volumetric cellular resolution to demonstrate that olfactory fear conditioning increases the number of odor-encoding neurons in mice that experience odor-shock conditioning (F0), as well as their unconditioned offspring (F1). We demonstrate that the increase in F0 is due, in part, to the biasing of the stem cell layer of the main olfactory epithelium. Detailed analysis of F1 behavior revealed subtle odor-specific differences between the offspring of unconditioned and conditioned parents, despite the absence of an active aversion to the conditioned odor. Thus, we reveal intergenerational regulation of olfactory epithelium composition in response to olfactory fear conditioning, providing insight into the heritability of acquired phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) components play a critical role in neurodegeneration. This study investigates the effects of modulating the levels of different karyopherins on mutant Ataxin-1 (mATXN1)-induced neurodegeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) Drosophila and cell models. Our findings reveal that ATXN1 [82Q] interacts with KPNAs in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. Increasing KPNA levels ameliorates ATXN1 [82Q]-induced neurodegeneration and progressive neuronal dysfunction. Surprisingly, elevated KPNA levels did not increase nuclear mATXN1, instead, mechanistic analyses demonstrate that KPNA retains mATXN1 in the cytoplasm, reducing its nuclear accumulation. Moreover, higher KPNA leads to a decrease in soluble oligomeric mATXN1. Interestingly, inhibition of a different karyopherin, KPNB1, elevated KPNA levels and reduced nuclear mATXN1 in human neuronal precursor cells. Consistently, knockdown of KPNB1 attenuates ATXN1 [82Q]-induced neurodegeneration and reduces its nuclear aggregation in Drosophila. These results indicate that KPNAs may act as chaperones for mATXN1, preventing its nuclear translocation and reducing its pathological effects. Importantly, they also constitute a proof of principle that retaining mATXN1 in the cytoplasm represents an attractive and viable therapeutic option. Given the dysregulation of karyopherins in many neurodegenerative diseases and their emerging role as chaperones, the results presented here may extend beyond SCA1 into other disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain functions, leading to these vulnerabilities, is a mystery. To understand ELAs impacts, investigations into neural activity affected by ELA must go beyond localized areas toward simultaneous recordings from multiple widely distributed regions over time. Such studies will expose relative activity between regions and discover shifts in regional activity in response to different experiences. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to measure degrees of brain-wide neural activity in ELA-exposed mice across a series of experiences in adulthood. To ascertain whether ELA resulted in atypical brain activity, results were compared to those of the standard mouse (Std). MEMRI captured activity in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after exposure to TMT, a naturalistic predator threat. Images were normalized and aligned then analyzed with statistical mapping and automated segmentation. We found that neural activity in the home cage was greater in ELA compared to Std in multiple striatal-pallidal and hypothalamic regions. Upon acute threat, neural activity in Std increased in these regions to become more similar to that in ELA, while new hyperactive responses in ELA emerged in the midbrain and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity in ELA persisted within locus coeruleus and increased within posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus. These results reveal functional imbalances that arise between multiple brain-systems after ELA, which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences into adulthood.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, most of this sequence data is unassembled, or where assembled was done so with no consistent assembler or quality control. Although this data has great potential, these inconsistencies make it unsuitable for large-scale analyses, and inaccessible for most researchers to reuse. Therefore in our previous effort, we released a uniformly assembled set of 661,405 genomes, consisting of all publicly available whole genome sequenced bacterial isolate data up to a cutoff of November 2018, enriched with various search indexes to make the data easier to sort and use. In this study, we first extend the dataset up to August 2024 with the same consistent assembly pipeline, more than tripling the number of genomes available. We also expand the scope of the dataset beyond genomes, as we begin a global collaborative project to generate annotations, species-specific analyses, evolutionary data, new search indices, and protein structural data. Our collaboration is therefore grass-roots, driven by the needs of different research communities within microbiology. In this paper, we describe the project as of release 2024-08, comprising 2,440,377 assemblies. All 2.4 million genomes have been uniformly reprocessed for quality criteria and to give taxonomic abundance estimates with respect to the GTDB phylogeny. We further enrich the dataset with sequence annotations from Bakta, antimicrobial resistance predictions from AMRFinderPlus, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions for the 17.7M hypothetical proteins. By applying an evolution-informed compression approach, the full set of genomes is just 130Gb: a reduction of about 23x compared to compressing individual assemblies. To make the resource as accessible as possible, we also provide multiple search indexes, a method for alignment to the full dataset, and cloud-based access to all the genomes.

Neutrophils, as primary rapid responders during infections, quickly generate an enormous number of mature cells for immune defense. This immune phenomena is effected by cell cycle kinetics. Our previous study redefined progenitors and reformed the hierarchy of hematopoiesis. How exactly lineage commitment and cell cycle are coordinated remain to be elucidated. Here, we aim to elucidate the cell cycle kinetics and chronological order of progenitor states, providing new insights into immune phenomena. We revealed the changes in cell cycle kinetics from differentiation (lineage commitment) to proliferation (cell division) in peripheral hematopoiesis. Differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are maintained in the G1 phase of cell cycle, regulated by DNA replication. CDCA7 was identified as an essential factor for DNA replication, facilitating the transition of progenitor cells from G1 to S phase. Once the progenitors complete their commitment, cell cycle states of progenitors convert from G1 to S phase, switching from lineage commitment to cell division with DNA replication begins. Lineage commitment and cell division of MPCs are independent processes, and fate determination takes precedence over proliferation. Since the differentiating HPCs do not undergo cell division, a committing progenitor will destined to mature into only one committed progenitor cell along its designated differentiation trajectory. The chronological order of quiescence, self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation, was clearly delineated. Our study proposed the concept of temporal sequence control, emphasizing that fate determination necessarily precedes division during lineage commitment, thereby providing a new dimension for modeling hematopoietic dynamics. Our study reveals that initial progenitors in adult peripheral blood exhibit self-renewal capabilities, which are absent after lineage commitment is completed during hematopoiesis. Neutrophil present the shortest differentiation trajectory in the hematopoietic hierarchy, which decide their role as rapid responders. Our results provide a clear characterization of the cell cycle kinetics of HPCs lineage commitment and cell division, facilitating advancements in inflammation and disease treatment.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

These axonal projections arise from PFC subregions with unique brain-wide connectivity and functional repertoires, which may provide the architecture for modular feedback intended to shape sensory processing. Here, we used axonal tracing, axonal and somatic 2-photon calcium imaging, and chemogenetic manipulations in mice to delineate how projections from the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACA) and ventrolateral Orbitofrontal Cortex (ORB) of the PFC modulate sensory processing in the primary Visual Cortex (VISp) across behavioral states. Structurally, we found that ACA and ORB have distinct patterning of projections across both cortical regions and layers. ACA axons in VISp had a stronger representation of visual stimulus information than ORB axons, but both projections showed non-visual, behavior-dependent activity. ACA input to VISp enhanced the encoding of visual stimuli by VISp neurons, and modulation of visual responses scaled with arousal. On the other hand, ORB input shaped movement and arousal related modulation of VISp visual responses, but specifically reduced the encoding of high-contrast visual stimuli. Thus, ACA and ORB feedback have separable projection patterns and encode distinct visual and behavioral information, putatively providing the substrate for their unique effects on visual representations and behavioral modulation in VISp. Our results offer a refined model of cortical hierarchy and its impact on sensory information processing, whereby distinct as opposed to generalized properties of PFC projections contribute to VISp activity during discrete behavioral states.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

To support conservation efforts through remote sensing, we disentangled the nested effects of genetic and environmental influences on reflectance spectra, leveraging spectroscopy to assess plant adaptations to temperature. Specifically, we quantified the relative effect of plasticity and heritability on Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) leaf reflectance using clonal replicates propagated from 16 populations and grown across three common gardens spanning a mean annual temperature gradient representing the thermal range of P. fremontii. We used variance partitioning to decompose phenotypic variation expressed in the leaf spectra into genotypic and environmental components to estimate broad-sense heritability. Heritability was strongly expressed in the spectral red edge (~680-750nm) and shortwave infrared (~1400-3000nm), though the heritability peak in the red edge was sensitive to extreme temperatures. By comparing distances of group centroids in principal component space, we determined that P. fremontii intraspecific spectral variation was shaped by the interaction between common garden site conditions and source population. Support vector machine models indicated pronounced environmental influence on spectral variation, as P. fremontii source population and garden location were classified at 71.8% and 92.6% accuracy, respectively. These findings emphasize the utility of reflectance data in separating genetic and environmental influences on plant phenotypes, offering a pathway to scale these insights across broader landscapes and aid in the conservation and management of vulnerable ecosystems in a warming climate.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Detecting structural variants (SVs) on chromosomes has informed the study of speciation, sex determination, adaptation, and some of the earliest divergences in the tree of life. Here we present a computationally non-intensive approach, based on geometric morphometrics, that uses conserved DNA sequences as landmarks to quantify structural disparities of focal chromosomes across multiple species, individuals, or cell types. Based on two approaches, we show that this geno-metric method can be applied at micro- and macroevolutionary scales to discover and diagnose SVs. Using human X-linked genes and ultraconserved elements as landmarks, we provide empirical demonstrations with amniote sex chromosomes, the Drosophila virilis group, and placental mammal genomes. Landmark-based structural disparity analysis effectively identifies chromosomal rearrangements and has parallels with traditional morphometrics regarding chromosome size, landmark orientation and landmark availability. Using simulations, we show that structural disparity inferred from ultraconserved elements is correlated with overall levels of chromosome evolution; an attribute which is consistent with observed disparity between and within mammalian orders. We found that the disparity patterns of SVs have significant phylogenetic signal, giving them broad importance for studying evolutionary biology. Structural disparity analyses are a valuable addition to the comparative genomic toolkit in that they offer an intuitive, rapid mechanism for detecting SVs associated with single copy genetic landmarks and the potential to reveal broader patterns of chromosome evolution related to expansions, contractions, rearrangements and phylogeny.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Super-resolution microscopy revealed that ~93% of RNase E localizes to the inner membrane and exhibits slow diffusion similar to polysomes. Comparing the native amphipathic MTS with a transmembrane motif showed that the MTS confers slower diffusion and stronger membrane binding. The CTD further slows diffusion by increasing mass but unexpectedly weakens membrane association.

Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we identify Papss, an enzyme that synthesizes the universal sulfate donor PAPS, as a critical regulator of tube lumen expansion. Papss mutants show a disorganized apical membrane, condensed aECM, and disruptions in Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. SG-specific expression of wild-type Papss, but not the catalytically inactive form, rescues the defects in Papss mutants, suggesting that defects in sulfation are the underlying cause of the phenotypes. Additionally, we identify two zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, Piopio (Pio) and Dumpy (Dpy), as key components of the SG aECM. In the absence of Papss, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in dpy or pio, or in Notopleural, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of pio leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen.

Direct anatomical evidence from Neodiapsida, which includes the reptile crown-group Sauria and its closest extinct relatives, shows that this diversity originates from a single common reptilian ancestor that lived some 255 million years ago in the Paleozoic. However, the evolutionary assembly of crown reptile traits is poorly understood due to the lack of anatomically close outgroups to Neodiapsida1-7. We present a substantially revised phylogenetic hypothesis, informed by new anatomical data derived from high-resolution synchrotron tomography of Paleozoic reptiles8-12. We find strong evidence placing the clade Millerettidae as a close sister to Neodiapsida, which uniquely share a suite of derived features among Paleozoic stem reptiles. This grouping, for which we name the new clade Parapleurota, replaces previous phylogenetic paradigms by rendering the group Parareptilia as a polyphyletic assemblage of stem reptiles, of which millerettids are the most crownward. Our analysis presents hypotheses that resolve long-standing issues in Paleozoic reptile evolution, including the placement of captorhinids on the amniote stem lineage and firm support for varanopids as synapsids, which taken together provide a greatly improved fit to the observed stratigraphic record. Optimizations of character evolution on our phylogenetic hypothesis reveals gradual assembly of crown reptile anatomy, including a Permian origin of tympanic hearing, the presence of a lower temporal fenestra in the amniote common ancestor, with subsequent modifications on the reptile stem lineage, leading to the loss of the lower temporal bar.

In light of this, understanding to which degree these traits covary and are organised into syndromes are key to improve distribution forecasting under climate change. We quantified life history, dispersal and thermal range covariation among 4000 Western European arthropod species spanning eight orders, considering phylogenetic relationships to account for shared ancestry. We demonstrate the existence of two independent axes of life history variation: the fast-slow continuum and the reproductive strategy axis. Notably, species at the fast end of the continuum tend to have higher dispersal capacities and broader thermal niches than slower species. The resulting syndromes were surprisingly consistent across orders, indicating a relatively uniform pattern of trait covariations across arthropod groups. These trait combinations, which generally enhance range-shifting potential, point to the emergence of two distinct groups of arthropods: those well-suited and those less equipped to mitigate the effects of future climate change.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we use the state-of-the-art model Enformer to predict DNA accessibility and RNA transcription across these engineered sequences when delivered at their endogenous loci. At high level, we observe a good correlation between accessibility predicted by Enformer and experimental data. But model performance was best for sequences that more resembled the reference, such as single deletions or combinations of multiple DHSs. Predictive power was poorer for rearrangements affecting DHS order or orientation. We use these data to fine-tune Enformer, yielding significant reduction in prediction error. We show that this fine-tuning retains strong predictive performance for other tracks. Our results show that current deep learning models perform poorly when presented with novel sequence diverging in certain critical features from their training set. Thus an iterative approach incorporating profiling of synthetic constructs can improve model generalizability and ultimately enable functional classification of regulatory variants identified by population studies.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Making use of the TM-score to prioritize local structural similarity, Structome-TM excels at identifying these otherwise obscured relationships, allowing users to build a comprehensive structural neighbourhood of proteins suitable for comparison. To facilitate this dataset assembly, the resource accepts both RCSB PDB identifiers and protein sequences as inputs. When querying using a protein sequence, protein structures are predicted in real-time and their respective neighbourhoods determined, enabling analysis when experimentally determined structures may not be available.

C.; Wright, R.; Cvetkovska, M.", "abstract": "Viridiplantae, a diverse group of green plants and alga that have evolved from a common ancestor, are unified in their ability to produce and use two types of chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b) to capture light energy. In addition to playing a role in light harvesting, chlorophyll b is required at the appropriate level for the accumulation, assembly, and stability of light harvesting complexes within the photosynthetic apparatus. Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by the enzyme chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), a Rieske-type mononuclear non-heme iron oxygenase. A regulatory degron sequence, described in detail only in land plants, regulates the stability of CAO proteins based on the availability of chlorophyll b. Recent identification of CAO gene duplication in bryophyte and green algal species, combined with expanded availability of sequenced genomes within the Viridiplantae, prompted further investigation into the role of gene duplication in the evolution of chlorophyll b biosynthesis. Examination of genomes from 246 plant and algae species revealed independently occurring CAO duplications throughout the Viridiplantae, with a higher prevalence of duplication in land plants compared to their algal relatives. Additionally, we demonstrate that the degron sequence is poorly conserved in chlorophytes, but first appears as a conserved sequence in charophytes, and is very highly conserved among the embryophytes. The evolutionary history and functional role of CAO throughout the Viridiplantae lineage is discussed based on these key observations, adding to our understanding of chlorophyll b biosynthesis and the role of CAO in photosynthetic species.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

To identify such phenomena, we generated a spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mice infected with the RML prion strain. Thalamus and cerebellum experienced severe neuronal loss, developed intense microgliosis and, starting from 30 weeks post-inoculation, accumulated a novel microglial subpopulation characterized by strong expression of Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (Gpnmb). Elevated GPNMB levels were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of sCJD patients, suggesting its possible usefulness as a biomarker of disease progression. The transcriptional profile of Gpnmb microglia reflected a state of enhanced phagocytic activity with upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal function, including vacuolar ATPase V0 domain subunit d2 (Atp6v0d2) and Galectin-3 (Lgals3). In microglia-like murine BV2 cells, Gpnmb upregulation was induced by soluble find-me signals released during apoptosis, but not by apoptotic bodies or prion accumulation. Likewise, human iPSC-derived microglia showed marked upregulation of GPNMB when co-cultured with apoptotic human neurons. Gpnmb ablation impaired the ability of BV2 cells to clear apoptotic cells, underscoring its role in maintaining microglial phagocytosis. Our findings define Gpnmb microglia as a distinct, apoptosis-driven phagocytic state, linking neuronal loss to microglial activation and positioning it as a key regulator of microglial responses to prion propagation.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

To break free from these limitations, we introduce a new alternative: designing proteins directly from plain-language specifications. To achieve this, we trained MP4, a transformer-based model that maps natural language prompts to protein sequences, on a dataset of 3.2 billion points and 138k tokens. In a benchmark of 96 prompts representing a wide array of functions and contexts, MP4 excelled by simultaneously improving on three key metrics: sequence realism, predicted fold quality, and alignment to the requested function. This high performance is particularly significant as it was achieved using only text as input which is a major departure from other models. Experimental validation confirmed our computational predictions: two de novo designs were experimentally shown to be both expressible and thermostable, with high-resolution crystallography (1.30 [A] and 1.77 [A]) ultimately revealing one to possess a paradigm-shifting novel fold. Functionally, the designs were also active, demonstrating both ATP binding and hydrolysis in vitro. This work demonstrates the realization of natural-language intent as functional proteins that express, crystallize, and catalyze. Although the underlying approach is still in early development with incomplete coverage and controllability, MP4 delivers a profound impact: it lowers the barrier to protein design and vastly expands the space for creative exploration in molecular programming.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Our approach combines: (1) fork propagation simulated from single-cell replication timing data, (2) Monte Carlo modeling of loop extrusion and epigenetic state transitions, and (3) 3D reconstruction using OpenMM, where loops are modeled as harmonic bonds and epigenetic states drive compartmental interactions. Chromatin is represented as a graph where both the links and the node states change over time.

This represents the most extensive and highest homology observed to date between a viral protein and an MHC class I molecule. Phylogenetic analysis of MHC class I-like sequences from primate HLA-A orthologs and SBHV4 suggests that SBHV4-S9 was likely acquired via LINE-1-mediated horizontal gene transfer from the African Old World monkey Papio anubis or a close ancestor 43.7-74.3 million years ago. SBHV4-S9 shows evidence of strong purifying selection following divergence from Piliocolobus tephrosceles. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the SBHV4-S1 gene and primate SLAMF6-like genes indicates this gene was acquired after divergence from a close ancestor of the New World monkey Saimiri oerstedii and Saimiri sciureus. Comprehensive evaluation of the similarity between eight SBHV4 genes, including S1 and S9, and their homologous sequences in individual primate species,assessed using k-mer based Wasserstein distances, revealed that the overall similarity between SBHV4 genes and the homologous gene set of Saimiri oerstedii was greater than that between the SBHV4 genome and the homologous genes of Piliocolobus tephrosceles. This overall similarity to SBHV4 in Saimiri oerstedii was comparable to that observed in certain lemur species inhabiting Madagascar. Notably, S1 and S9 genes were more distantly related to these lemurs than to Saimiri oerstedii. Given that comparisons between Saimiri oerstedii and these lemurs were based on homologous S1, S9, and S28 genes, the S28 gene appears to be especially closely related to those of the lemurs. Although the route by which SBHV4, originating from the African Old World monkey Piliocolobus tephrosceles, was transmitted to the genus Saimiri remains unclear, our results suggest that SBHV4 has spread across diverse primate lineages from Africa to South America, initiating the acquisition of novel genomic features in its new hosts.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, our understanding of the dynamic neural mechanisms that underlie congruency effects are under-explored. Using MEG, we examine how the congruency between an object and a prior scene results in changes in the oscillatory activity in the brain, which regions underpin this effect, and whether congruency results arise from top-down or bottom-up modulations of connectivity. We observed that prior scene information impacts the processing of visual objects in behaviour, neural activity and connectivity. Processing objects that were incongruent with the prior scene resulted in slower reaction times, increased low frequency activity in the ventral visual pathway, and increased top-down connectivity from the anterior temporal lobe and frontal cortex to the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results reveal that the recurrent dynamics within the ventral visual pathway are modulated by the prior knowledge imbued by our surrounding environment, suggesting that the way we recognise objects is fundamentally linked to their context.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Pharmacologically blocking the OHC motor protein prestin inverted this dynamic; the OHC's mechanical contraction became faster, while the normally rapid electrical potential became nearly ten times slower.

Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for accurately reconstructing evolutionary histories, as failing to account for discordance can lead to misinterpretations of species boundaries, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeographic patterns. We investigate the evolutionary drivers of mitonuclear discordance in the Tropidurus spinulosus species group, which contains nine species of lizards inhabiting open tropical and subtropical environments in South America. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenomic approaches applied to mitochondrial and nuclear data, we identified different instances of gene flow that occurred in ancestral lineages of extant species. Our results point to a complex evolutionary history marked by prolonged isolation between species, demographic fluctuations, and potential episodes of secondary contact with genetic admixture. These conditions likely facilitated mitochondrial genome capture while diluting signals of nuclear introgression. Furthermore, we found no strong evidence supporting incomplete lineage sorting or natural selection as primary drivers of the observed mitonuclear discordance. Therefore, the unveiled patterns are most consistent with neutral demographic processes, coupled with ancient mitochondrial introgression, as the main factors underlying the mismatch between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies in this system. Future research could further explore the role of other demographic processes, such as asymmetric sex-biased dispersal, in shaping these complex evolutionary patterns.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Akuamoah-Boateng, Y.; Afrane, Y. A.; Reece, S. E.", "abstract": "Background: Transmission of vector-borne pathogens follows daily rhythms, occurring at the time of day that vectors forage for blood. Control measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) have been particularly successful for reducing malaria transmission, because they exploit the nocturnal biting behaviour of the Anopheles spp. that vector malaria. However, shifts in biting behaviour to earlier or later hours when people are unprotected can undermine the efficacy of ITNs. Despite the implications for malaria transmission, the mechanisms underlying these shifts remain poorly understood. Because food availability mediates activity and foraging rhythms, and ITNs block access to human blood as a food source, we hypothesized that nutritional deprivation could cause mosquitoes to shift their biting behaviour to earlier or later in the diel cycle. Methods: We provided female Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes with a blood meal on day 3 post-emergence, and access to one of three feeding treatments that varied in nutritional resources: (i) 0.5% sucrose, (ii) 10% sucrose, or (iii) 10% sucrose plus an additional blood meal on day 6. We released mosquitoes into a semi-field system on day 10 with human-mimic traps to investigate how food availability impacted the time of day that mosquitoes host seek. Results: Nutritional resources determine both the likelihood and time of day that host seeking occurs. Specifically, low-resourced mosquitoes were 2-3 fold more likely to host seek overall, and 5-10 fold more likely to host seek at an earlier time of day than well-resourced mosquitoes (fed 10% sucrose with and without an additional blood meal), which predominantly sought a host in the second half of the night time. Conclusions: We reveal that mosquito nutritional condition drives plasticity in biting time of day, suggesting it is an underappreciated contributor to residual malaria transmission. Furthermore, our results suggest that targeting mosquito nutrition (e.g. sugar-baited traps) could influence mosquito behaviour in ways that affect the success of ITNs. More broadly, understanding the drivers of biting time of day variation is crucial for the future success of vector control tools and controlling malaria transmission.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) are recognized as key mediators in neuropathic pain. However, the combined effects of simultaneous inhibition of these targets remain unexplored. This current study investigated the therapeutic potential of concurrently antagonizing 5-HT2AR and mGluR5. Using spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and formalin-induced pain models in male Sprague-Dawley rats, we demonstrated that the simultaneous administration of both antagonists significantly enhanced anti-allodynic and anti-nociceptive effects, resulting in increased allodynia thresholds and reduced pain-related behaviors. This dual antagonism provided pain relief comparable to that of gabapentin and morphine. Furthermore, novel small molecules designed to simultaneously antagonize 5-HT2AR and mGluR5 exerted anti-nociceptive effects by suppressing excitatory postsynaptic responses and inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT signaling molecules. Notably, the dual antagonist maintained anti-allodynic efficacy with repeated administration, unlike morphine, which exhibited clear tolerance development with daily use. Moreover, when administered intravenously, the dual antagonist demonstrated a low potential for abuse. These findings indicate that the simultaneous antagonism of 5-HT2AR and mGluR5 represents a promising pharmacological target for the management of chronic pain.

Here we reappraise this view by investigating the target-specificity of the spatiotemporal evolution of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). To this end, we compared TEPs elicited by targeting the premotor and primary motor cortices in 16 healthy subjects, under conditions designed to optimize TMS effectiveness on the cortex while minimizing peripheral confounds. As a counterfactual, we conducted the same comparison on the EEG responses evoked by realistic sham TMS and high-intensity somatosensory scalp stimulation. We found that EEG responses to motor and premotor TMS can exhibit distinct spatiotemporal evolutions, lasting up to 300 ms, both at the group and single-subject levels. These differences were absent or marginally detectable in both realistic sham TMS and high-intensity somatosensory scalp stimulation. Our findings suggest that, when effectiveness is optimized and peripheral confounds are controlled, TMS elicits specific long-lasting genuine EEG responses that reflect the initial engagement of specific cortical targets.

Analyses of the dissociation trajectories predict multiple dissociation pathways for A22 and found key gatekeeper residues at specific-sites facilitating ligand dissociation. Comparison of A22 with other known inhibitors suggest that A22 binds actin with relatively lower affinity, however, exhibits site-specific unbinding kinetics. Thus, our study provides a detailed mechanistic overview of A22-actin interaction, its various binding modes, and unbinding kinetics. It also shows the importance and usage of infrequent metadynamics in exploring rare events like ligand-protein interaction. Deeper insights gained from this study expands our understanding of cytoskeletal ligand dynamics. These knowledges will be paramount in designing drug targeting cytoskeletal protein actin.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, a comprehensive characterization of these thresholds has long been considered intractable due to the psychophysical curse of dimensionality. Here, we address this challenge using a novel semi-parametric Wishart Process Psychophysical Model (WPPM), which leverages the feature that the internal noise limiting color discrimination varies smoothly across stimulus space. The model was fit to data collected with a non-parametric adaptive trial-placement procedure, enabling efficient stimulus selection. Together, through the combination of adaptive trial placement and post hoc WPPM fitting, we achieved comprehensive characterization of color discrimination in the isoluminant plane with only ~6,000 trials per participant (N = 8). Once fit, the WPPM allows readouts of discrimination performance for any stimulus pair. We validated these readouts against 25 probe psychometric functions, measured with an additional 6,000 trials per participant held out from model fitting. In conclusion, our study provides a foundational dataset for color vision, and our approach generalizes beyond color to any domain in which the internal noise limiting performance varies smoothly across stimulus space, offering a powerful and efficient method for comprehensively characterizing various perceptual discrimination thresholds.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Although oak species are major contributors to isoprene emission, there is considerable variation in isoprene emission capacity within the Fagaceae family. To unravel the evolutionary origins of isoprene emission, we investigated the molecular evolution of terpene synthase (TPS) genes across eight species within the Fagaceae. We identified a Fagaceae-specific TPS-b subclade in which potential isoprene synthase (IspS) activity evolved independently in two gene lineages within subgenus Quercus. Ancestral sequence reconstruction revealed that the acquisition of a diagnostic amino acid residue for IspS function arose convergently in these lineages and was subject to positive selection, suggesting adaptive evolution. Ancestral-enzyme assays targeting the gene lineage with high gene expression revealed that the early protein primarily produced monoterpenes from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), whereas their descendants shifted substrate preference to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), evolving into dedicated isoprene synthases. Our results indicate that IspS activity was not ancestral in Fagaceae, but evolved approximately 56 million years ago within the subgenus Quercus, and has been retained ever since. These findings emphasize the roles of enzyme structural innovation and regulatory shifts in the diversification of volatile terpenoid biosynthesis.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Inactivation/Stability Centers (I/SCs) are recently described autosomal loci that exhibit epigenetic regulation of allelic expression and replication timing, with differences that can be comparable to those observed between the active and inactive X chromosomes 1. Here we characterize hundreds of autosomal loci with allele-specific epigenetic regulation of replication timing and gene expression, defining them as I/SCs. I/SCs are approximately 1 megabase in size and can contain both protein-coding and noncoding genes. In different single cell derived clones, these genes may be expressed from a single allele, the opposite allele, both alleles, or not expressed at all. This stochastic, yet mitotically stable, pattern indicates that the choice of which allele is expressed is independent of parent of origin and independent of the expression status of the other allele. Similarly, alleles within I/SCs show varying replication timing, either earlier or later, that is also independent of the other allele. Additionally, we find corresponding I/SCs in the mouse genome that display conserved synteny with human I/SCs. This allele-restricted regulation creates extensive cellular mosaicism through a stable epigenetic mechanism. This mosaicism impacts numerous dosage-sensitive genes associated with human diseases such as Parkinson, epilepsy, deafness, and impaired intellectual development.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

While intragenic insertion-free sequences have been considered as a reliable indicator for gene essentiality, so far, no exact probability distribution for these sequences has been proposed. Further, many methods require setting thresholds or parameter values a priori without providing any statistical basis, limiting the comparability of results. Here, we introduce Consecutive Non-Insertions Sites (ConNIS), a novel method for gene essentiality determination. ConNIS provides an analytic solution for the probability of observing insertion-free sequences within genes of given length and considers variation in insertion density across the genome. Based on an extensive simulation study and real world scenarios, ConNIS was found to be superior to prevalent state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with a low or medium insertion density. In addition, our results show that the precision of existing methods can be improved by incorporating a simple weighting factor for the genome-wide insertion density. To set methodically embedded parameter and threshold values of TraDIS methods a subsample based instability criterion was developed. Application of this criterion in real and synthetic data settings demonstrated its effectiveness in selecting well-suited parameter/threshold values across methods.

In order to establish in the liver, metastatic cells require a metastatic niche providing prosurvival signals. Here, we demonstrate that bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) establish immunosuppressive niches in the liver that promote metastatic colonization in PDAC. Using an immunocompetent orthotopic PDAC mouse model, we show that BMDCs form clusters enriched in myeloid progenitors and display upregulation of migratory, adhesive, and immunoregulatory programs in response to tumor derived cues. CD44 and its splice variant CD44v6 are found to be highly expressed on these cells. Hematopoietic specific deletion of Cd44 or Cd44v6 using Cd44/Cd44v6fl/fl;VavCreERT2 mice markedly impairs BMDC clustering, reshapes the BMDC transcriptome, disrupting pathways critical for migration, adhesion, and immunosuppression thereby reducing metastatic burden. Mechanistically, CD44 inhibition blocks BMDC migration toward CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL12, and impairs adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin. Functionally, Cd44 deficient BMDCs exhibit reduced expression of immunosuppressive mediators such as Arginase 1, Ido1, and Il10, and fail to suppress T cell proliferation. Our findings position CD44 as a pleiotropic regulator of BMDC mediated metastatic niche formation and identify it as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt the prometastatic microenvironment in PDAC.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

While this secretion plays many critical roles in homeostasis, the potential roles for endothelial secretion in vascular disease remain under-studied. METHODS: We treated polarised monolayers of primary human endothelial cells with native and oxidised LDL and identified the proteins secreted from the apical and basal endothelial surfaces by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Treatment with either native or oxidised LDL led to increased secretion of a cohort of 21 mostly pro-fibrotic proteins. We focussed on fibronectin, which was secreted apically or basally, depending on the direction of LDL treatment. LDL-stimulated fibronectin secretion did not require well-characterised endothelial LDL receptors but was instead mediated by the poorly characterised scavenger receptor Scarf1 and the cholesterol-sensitive SNARE proteins syntaxin 4 and 6. This LDL-stimulated secretion did not involve increased fibronectin expression but instead appeared to result from a decrease in fibronectin turnover and a re-routing of intracellular sorting. CONCLUSIONS: This novel endothelial secretory pathway links circulating LDL to the release of pro-fibrotic proteins from the endothelium, supporting a role for endothelial cell secretion in the progression of lipid-induced fibrotic disease.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Phagophore assembly and expansion require ATG9A-positive seed compartments, the lipid transfer protein ATG2A, and the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1). PI3KC3-C1 synthesizes phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a key lipid that drives downstream processes for phagophore expansion, including ATG8 lipidation. We find that ATG9A compartments contain only traces of phosphatidylinositol (PI), likely insufficient for efficient PI3P production or recruitment of PI3P-binding effectors. Nevertheless, ATG2A is recruited to these compartments and mediates lipid transfer, including PI, into them. Remarkably, even without detectable PI3P, ATG9A compartments can support ATG8 lipidation, and ATG8 proteins themselves enhance ATG2A-mediated lipid transfer. In cells, ATG2A is essential for the appearance of PI3P on ATG9A compartments. Together, these findings support a model in which a lipid transfer-driven feedback loop, rather than pre-existing PI content, is required to activate ATG9A compartments for phagophore expansion.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Studies of RPE65-/- mice have shown dramatic depletion of 11-cis-retinal in the retina, resulting in a slow retinal degeneration. However, a number of studies suggest that RPE65 may not be necessary for the regeneration of photopigment in all photoreceptor types.

However, there is no progressive degeneration of rods or cones. Via electroretinography we found greatly reduced but significant responses to light under scotopic and photopic conditions.

Phylogenetic analyses classify ZIKV into two major lineages: African and Asian. Despite their genetic similarity, only the Asian lineage has been linked to congenital anomalies. ZIKV possesses a single-stranded RNA genome and replicates by remodelling the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form membrane-bound replication complexes, which support viral RNA synthesis, virion assembly, and immune evasion. ZIKV also induces the formation of convoluted membranes (CMs), whose function remains unclear. Most ultrastructural studies of ZIKV replication have relied on transmission electron microscopy, which, despite its value, can alter membrane architecture due to sample preparation. To overcome these limitations, we employed cryo-focused ion beam milling combined with electron tomography to visualize ZIKV replication in a near-native state. By comparing infections with African and Asian ZIKV lineages, we uncovered lineage-specific ultrastructural features, despite similar replication dynamics and growth curves. In cells infected with the Asian strain, virions at different maturation stages were often co-packaged within the same compartment. In contrast, the African lineage ZIKV showed distinct compartmentalization of virions and vesicles. Furthermore, the ER-virion spacing was uniform in African-lineage-infected cells, while morphological heterogeneity was evident in the Asian lineage, including irregular viral sacs. Vesicle diameter was also significantly larger in cells infected with the Asian lineage. Together, these findings reveal both conserved and distinct replication structures between ZIKV lineages.

T.; Paez, P. M.; Khadra, A.", "abstract": "Calcium signaling has emerged as a central regulator of activity-dependent myelination in oligodendrocytes. These calcium signals encompass both the stimulus-independent spontaneous calcium local transients (SCaLTs) generated intrinsically in a voltage-independent manner or facilitated by the membrane voltage, as well as evoked responses triggered by ATP and glutamate release. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying this combined spiking activity, we developed a stochastic spatiotemporal flux-balance model of calcium transients in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The model incorporates all the relevant fluxes in these cells and integrates membrane voltage dynamics with a calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) mechanism using parameters fitted to calcium fluorescence recordings. The model reproduced the intrinsic and voltage-facilitated SCaLTs in OPCs in the absence of purinergic and glutamatergic receptors, and captured the three distinct patterns of evoked calcium responses induced by ATP and glutamate identified using machine classifier. The model highlighted the role of ATP and glutamate concentrations in generating these clusters, and showed that the fast dynamics of CICR is key to producing these evoked responses. Further analysis of the model also revealed that voltage-gated L- and T-type calcium channels slightly increase the frequency of SCaLTs, while stimulation with ATP and glutamate, using randomly distributed pulses mimicking in vivo conditions, leads to an increase in both the amplitudes of calcium spikes (i.e., the combination of SCaLTs and evoked responses) and the prevalence of wide spikes, especially upon glutamate stimulation. Bifurcation analysis of the deterministic version of the model, in the absence of diffusion, demonstrated that ATP and glutamate stimulation can shift the system into an oscillatory regime, thereby increasing the deterministic component of SCaLT dynamics. This study thus offers a comprehensive representation of OPC calcium transients linking recorded in vitro behaviors to in vivo dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Heterozygous Chchd10 knock-in mice modeling the human CHCHD10S59L variant associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD) develop a mitochondrial cardiomyopathy driven by CHCHD10 insolubility and aggregation, which is associated with chronic activation of the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mtISR). Here, we demonstrate that cardiac dysfunction in Chchd10S55L/+ mice carrying the orthologous pathogenic variant is associated with dual defects originating at the onset of disease: (1) early bioenergetic dysfunction linked to defects in mitochondrial copper homeostasis and oxidation of cytochrome c and (2) maladaptive mtISR signaling via the OMA1-DELE1-HRI axis. Using Oma1E324Q/E324Q knock-in mice, we show that the catalytic inactivation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 in Chchd10S55L/+ mice delays cardiomyopathy onset without rescuing CHCHD10 insolubility, proteomic remodeling, cristae defects or OXPHOS impairment, demonstrating that mtISR can be uncoupled from the bioenergetic collapse triggered by mutant CHCHD10.

The centriculum is adjacent to the centrosome pericentriolar material (PCM) and to abundant, short peri-centrosomal microtubules that surround the centrosome. Here we show that the centriculum serves as a microtubule filter, preventing the extension of a fraction of microtubules due to their collision with the centriculum. Changing microtubule number or stability results in a corresponding change in centriculum size, independent of the PCM, indicative of centriculum-microtubule interactions. Moreover, the porosity of the centriculum correlates with the density of microtubules extending beyond the peri-centrosomal region, consistent with the centriculum acting as a microtubule filter. Finally, if microtubule-centriculum collisions result in microtubule catastrophe, the filter function of the centriculum could also explain the high concentration of soluble tubulin at the C. elegans centrosome.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

We investigated the mechanisms of action of FFAR4 on hormone secretion in mouse and human islets. The effects of the FFAR4 agonist Compound A (Cpd A) on insulin and SST secretion were investigated in islets from mice following ablation of delta cells, deletion of SST and deletion of the G protein Gz (Gnaz-/-), in purified mouse beta and delta cells, in human EndoC-bH5 cells, and in human islets. Ca++ dynamics in response to Cpd A were measured in delta cells from Gnaz-/- mouse islets and in human islets. The insulinotropic effect of Cpd A was lost in delta cell-ablated and SST-deficient mouse islets and was absent in purified mouse beta cells. Gz deletion prevented Cpd A inhibition of SST secretion but not the potentiation of insulin release. Cpd A diminished Ca++ transients in mouse delta cells, an effect that was lost in Gz deficient islets. In human islets, FFAR4 activation increased insulin secretion and intracellular Ca++ transient independent of SST secretion. Consistent with a direct effect on beta cells, Cpd A potentiated insulin secretion in human EndoC-bH5 cells. We conclude that FFAR4 activation stimulates insulin secretion from mouse islets indirectly via Gz-coupled inhibition of SST secretion from delta cells, while in human islets, it stimulates insulin release via a direct effect on beta cells.

During this process, daughter cells must acquire a full complement of organelles, which may be inherited from the mother, formed de novo, or assembled through a combination of both mechanisms. To date the fate of maternal components during replication remains poorly understood. We previously showed that F-actin-driven dynamics generate the intravacuolar network, which defines the residual body (RB) and facilitates recycling of microneme proteins. However, the inheritance and recycling of other organelles have not been systematically analysed. To address this, we employed a dual HaloTag-based pulse-chase fluorescence labelling strategy to distinguish between de novo-synthesized and recycled proteins in replicating tachyzoites. This approach reveals three distinct organelle inheritance patterns: (1) direct transmission of intact maternal organelles (e.g., rhoptries, micronemes), (2) expansion and division of pre-existing maternal organelles with incorporation of newly synthesized components (e.g., Golgi apparatus, apicoplast), and (3) degradation of maternal structures without recycling (e.g., inner membrane complex).

E.; Jiang, J.; Welch, M. D.", "abstract": "After invading host cells and accessing the cytoplasm, many Rickettsia species undergo actin-based motility driven by two bacterial proteins, RickA and Sca2. In the spotted fever group species R. parkeri, this motility occurs in temporally and mechanistically distinct phases. Early in infection, RickA drives motility by activating the host Arp2/3 complex to nucleate actin; later, Sca2 independently drives motility by directly nucleating and elongating actin via a formin-like mechanism. The distantly related and non-pathogenic species R. bellii also expresses RickA and Sca2 orthologs, but how each contributes to the mechanism and timing of motility remains unclear. R. bellii Sca2 differs substantially from R. parkeri Sca2 in primary sequence, and we found that the R. bellii protein nucleates and elongates actin using an unusual N-terminal actin monomer-binding domain yet does not processively associate with growing actin filaments like R. parkeri Sca2 or eukaryotic formins. Notably, actin-based motility in R. bellii occurs only later in infection and strongly correlates with a highly polarized localization of Sca2 at one bacterial pole. In contrast, R. bellii motility is independent of RickA localization and Arp2/3 complex function. Compared to R. parkeri, R. bellii moves more slowly and along less direct paths, with actin tails exhibiting a distinct organization that reflects differences in Sca2 mechanism and localization. Together, these findings demonstrate substantial evolutionary flexibility in actin-based motility mechanisms within the Rickettsia genus and suggest similar adaptability among other intracellular microbes.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Pyrogens activate a unique set of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which contribute to inflammation, yielding distinct transcriptomic activation signatures. In this paper, we capture the unique expression signatures of activated monocytes through bulk RNA sequencing and introduce a data preprocessing pipeline that allows the training of a machine-learning model to classify pyrogenic contaminants.

Compared to other antitumor CD8+ T cells and bystanders, neoantigen-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) upregulated gene signatures of T cell activation and exhaustion. In the tumor draining lymph node, we identified TCF1+TOX- TSCM, TCF1+TOX+ TPEX, and TCF1-TOX+ effector-like TEX subsets among neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Clonal tracing analysis of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells revealed greater clonal expansion in divergent clones and less expansion in clones biased towards TEX, TPEX, or TSCM. The TPEX subset had greater clonal diversity and likely represented the root of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell differentiation, whereas highly clonally expanded effector-like TEX cells were positioned at the branch point where neoantigen-specific clones exited the lymph node and differentiated into TEX TILs. Notably, TSCM differentiation of neoantigen-specific CD8+ clones in the lymph node negatively correlated with exhaustion and clonal expansion of the same clones in the tumor. In addition, the gene signature of neoantigen-specific clones biased toward tumor infiltration relative to lymph node residence predicted a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor.

We conducted sequential experiments of Cyp1a1(-/-) and Cyp1b1(-/-) knockout mice compared with wild type C57BL/6J mice to determine if genotype changes the response to developmental BaP exposure. We treated pregnant dams from gestational day 10 to postnatal day 25 (P25) with BaP in corn oil-soaked cereal or the corn oil vehicle and tested one male and one female offspring beginning at P60. We found increased exploratory behavior in the elevated zero maze for Cyp1a1(-/-) knockout mice, but no significant differences in Cyp1b1(-/-) knockouts. In contrast, Cyp1b1(-/-) knockout mice buried fewer marbles in a second test of anxiety-like behavior. There were no significant differences when Cyp1a1(-/-) knockout mice were tested. BaP decreased immobility time in Cyp1a1(-/-) knockouts in the forced swim test, but increased immobility time in wild type and Cyp1b1(-/-) knockout mice. We measured plasma corticosterone levels at baseline and following the forced swim test and monoamine neurotransmitters at the end of behavioral testing. BaP treatment increased corticosterone in wild type mice, but decreased it in Cyp1a1(-/-) knockout mice.

However, this requires the development of a practical method to quantify resilience and measure it in living individuals, as well as identifying heterogenous pathways associated with resilience in different individuals. Here, we approach this problem by using a data-driven framework to quantify and characterize molecular signatures underlying cognitive resilience. Using multimodal contrastive trajectory inference (mcTI) on bulk RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic data from 898 post-mortem brain samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), we derived individual-level molecular pseudotime values reflecting the molecular path from high to low resilience across individuals. Additionally, we identified two distinct molecular subtypes of resilience, each characterized by unique transcriptomic and proteomic signatures, and differing associations with several phenotypes. To translate our brain-derived pseudotime and subtypes to living individuals, we developed prediction models with paired genetics, ante-mortem blood omics, clinical, psychosocial, imaging and device data from the same individuals, demonstrating the potential to predict brain molecular resilience profiles in living persons. Our findings establish a framework for quantifying resilience based on multi-level molecular signatures, identify molecularly distinct resilience subtypes, and demonstrate the feasibility of translating brain-derived molecular profiles to living individuals, laying the groundwork for the development of targeted resilience-promoting interventions in cognitive aging.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Within this framework, the motor neuron pool behaves as a linear amplifier of the cCI. However, this framework overlooks the possibility that motor neurons could also be driven by impulsive common inputs (iCI), which can induce synchronization among them and disrupt the linear transmission of other synaptic inputs at the pool level. To test this hypothesis, computational simulations and experimental data from human subjects were used to characterize different aspects related to motor neuron spiking synchronization at the pool level. Our findings suggest that, indeed, iCI can account for relevant features observed in experimental data such as the presence of synchronization events at the pool level. We also observed that such impulsive inputs can affect the linearity in the transmission of cCI by the motor neuron pool.

Further, combined with optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies, these tools can accelerate our understanding of neural circuits underlying itch and scratching. To that end, we have developed Scratcher, a GUI-based computational tool based on a real-time object detection algorithm that allows semi-supervised automated analysis of scratching behaviour in mice in a computationally inexpensive manner. We recorded chloroquine-induced acute itch as it developed, and determined the consequence of nail-trimming on acute-itch induced scratching with Scratcher. To probe the neural mechanisms underlying itch, we combined Scratcher with genetic circuit dissection using the Fos-TRAP mouse line. By targeting itch-activated neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) - a key brainstem hub for pruritic signal transmission - we demonstrated that LPBN activity modulates itch-evoked scratching. Together, we present a novel, easy-to-use computational tool to dissect molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of itch and scratching.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

To further assess the role of this gene in ethanol-related traits, we tested Dpp6 knockout (KO) mice for ethanol conditioned place preference (CPP), locomotor activity, and ethanol-induced anxiolysis. Male homozygous KO mice (HOM) showed greater preference for the ethanol-paired context compared to wild type littermates (WT) and heterozygous KO mice (HET), while female mice showed no genotypic difference. HOM of both sexes exhibited greater novelty-induced hyperactivity in the CPP apparatus than HET and WT mice in the first two minutes. In a separate experiment, HOM mice showed enhanced locomotor activity following a 1.5 g/kg ethanol injection; however, they also displayed greater locomotor activity during habituation, suggesting basal locomotor differences. Following 1.5 and 2 g/kg injections, HOM mice exhibited EtOH-induced anxiolysis in the first 5 minutes, while the HET and WT mice did not. Lastly, HOM mice displayed a significant sedative response compared to WT animals following a 2 g/kg injection of ethanol. Ultimately, these findings validate a role for Dpp6 in modulating ethanol's rewarding, anxiolytic, and sedative effects in a sex-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, the pathways by which protein misfolding in these proteinopathies lead to neuronal death remain unclear. Proteinopathies can be modelled in transgenic animals by expressing disease-causing mutations that promote protein aggregation, or in wild-type animals by injecting misfolded proteins (e.g. RML scrapie) that spread in a prion-like manner and recapitulate key neurodegenerative features, including gliosis, ER stress, and neuronal loss. Here, we map region-specific histopathological features of scrapie-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum during early (12 weeks post-inoculation) and late (20 weeks) stages of disease. Using a streamlined time-efficient protocol, we achieve reproducible paired sample collection and high-quality immunohistochemistry that is compatible with best practice in decontamination and containment. We found that among the tested markers of early pathology, thalamic astrocytic activation and spongiform degeneration were the most sensitive. By the late stage, there was widespread upregulation of IBA1+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes, accompanied by strong immunoreactivity of lysosomal marker LAMP1. LAMP1 expression in healthy brains was largely neuronal, but by 20 weeks it was significantly upregulated in astrocytes, suggesting their involvement in lysosomal pathology. The ER stress marker p-PERK was elevated in CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons but minimal in the thalamus and cerebellum, where neuronal loss was most pronounced, suggesting region-specific mechanisms of degeneration. Overall, the thalamus and hippocampal CA1/CA3 areas exhibited the greatest pathological burden. Our shorter time-course, new pathological insights and safe handling protocols, and improved welfare, supports broader adoption of the RML scrapie model for resource-efficient studies of neurodegeneration and its prevention.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

We provide evidence from RNA-seq experiments that the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) system plays a role in maintaining mutually exclusive choice of human exons 5a and 5b, and characterize their splicing patterns across tissues and developmental stages. Comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences among paralogs identified two highly conserved complementary intronic elements, IRE1 and IRE2, possibly forming RNA structure that impacts splicing. Indeed, blocking of IRE2 by antisense oligonucleotides significantly changed the 5a/5b ratio without the loss of mutually exclusive pattern. IRE1 and IRE2 are conserved from human to Elephant shark and may represent an ancient, evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism that is shared across many SCN genes.

While the biomechanical drivers of LVH are well established, growing evidence points to a critical role for cardiac and systemic metabolism in modulating hypertrophic remodeling and disease pathogenesis. Despite the efficiency of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), LVH hearts preferentially increase glucose uptake and catabolism to drive glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Development of therapies to increase and enhance LFCA FAO are underway, with promising results. However, the mechanisms of systemic metabolic states and LCFA dynamics in the context of cardiac hypertrophy remain incompletely understood. Further, it is unknown to what extent cardiac metabolism is influenced by whole-body energy balance and lipid profiles, despite the common occurrence of lipotoxicity in LVH. In this study, we measured whole-body and cellular respiration along with analysis of lipid and glycogen stores in a mouse model of LVH. We found that loss of the cardiac-specific gene, Myosin binding protein-C3 (Mybpc3), resulted in depletion of adipose tissue, decreased mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, increased lipid accumulation in both heart and liver, and loss of whole-body metabolic flux. We found that supplementation of exogenous LCFAs boosted LVH mitochondrial function and reversed cardiac lipid accumulation, but did not fully reverse the hypertrophied heart nor systemic metabolic phenotypes. This study indicates that the LVH phenotype caused systemic metabolic rewiring in Mybpc3-/- mice, and that exogenous LCFA supplementation boosted mitochondrial function in both cardiac and skeletal muscle.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

It is still an open question to what extent distinct modes of functional connectivity dominate in different stages of human brain development, and whether cognitive tasks can differentially modulate them. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the development of linear and nonlinear functional brain connectivity in infants and adults while they socially interacted. Using simultaneous EEG recordings in parent-infant dyads performing two different experiments (N = 160; 80 adults and 80 infants), we computed functional connectivity capturing distinct dynamics: a linear measure capturing phase synchronization (weighted phase lag index; WPLI), and a nonlinear measure capturing information sharing (weighted symbolic mutual information; WSMI). In both tasks, adults showed higher WSMI than infants, whereas infants showed higher WPLI than adults. Moreover, infant age predicted only task-related connectivity values computed with the nonlinear measure and not with its linear counterpart, suggesting that the information-theoretic measure was more sensitive to developmental changes in task-relevant neural processing. These findings suggest that over development, a shift in dominance from linear to nonlinear modes of brain communication may be essential for supporting emerging higher cognitive abilities, such as precursors to executive function (here, attention shifting) and social decision-making. Further, this work highlights the importance of using nonlinear measures in addition to traditional linear ones, which collectively permit a more robust capture of maturational changes.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

We introduce a novel approach to constructing a computational neuron population model that, when applied to the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), captures the firing heterogeneity observed across slice and in vivo recordings. This model reproduces the diversity of SNr neuron responses to stimulation of GABAergic input terminals, yielding new insights into the mechanisms underlying this variability.

While VEGFs are known to promote endothelial proliferation, their broader roles in tissue organization remain under investigation. Using a lymphatic vessel-on-a-chip platform, we examine how lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) respond to VEGF-A, VEGF-C, or their combination. We find that co-stimulation synergistically enhances lymphangiogenic sprouting while preserving barrier integrity. Co-stimulation also induces axial polarization of the tissue along the vessel axis, even in the absence of external mechanical stimuli. This polarization requires activation of the VEGFR2/VEGFR3 heterodimer and is disrupted by inhibition of the Src-dependent mechanotransduction pathway. Further co-stimulation enhances LEC motility and triggers vessel contraction. Modeling suggests that the tubular geometry of the lymphatic monolayer imposes intrinsic mechanical anisotropy--softer in the circumferential than axial direction. This geometrically-encoded stiffness landscape directs cell migration along the stiffer axis, uncovering a form of durotaxis driven by curvature-induced anisotropy. These results highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism by which biochemical and biophysical cues direct lymphatic tissue polarization, offering new insight into how geometry and mechanosensing shape lymphatic function.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, since the recordings capture light emission generated by the fluorescence of the calcium indicator, the neural activity that drives the calcium changes is masked by the dynamics of the calcium indicator. In this study, we develop and evaluate new methods to deconvolve fluorescence traces into the underlying neuronal spiking rates driving them. Our new inference methods take into account both the noise in the recordings and the temporal dynamics of the calcium indicator response. Our first proposed method, termed 'Dynamical-Binning', estimates spiking rates that are constant over discrete time bins. The size of each time bin depends on the data and is determined dynamically. Our second method, 'Continuously-Varying,' estimates the spiking rate as a continuous function. This method aims at studies seeking to find slow rate fluctuations rather than identifying abrupt changes in the spiking rate. The third method, 'First-Differences', aims to give a quick estimate of the spiking rates, which is beneficial for exceptionally large datasets, typical of mesoscale recordings. Our fourth method, is a modified 'Weiner Filter.' It estimates spiking rates by efficiently removing noise with a fixed ratio compared to the signal. This approach is beneficial for datasets exhibiting large fluctuations in fluorescence magnitudes. We compare the accuracy of our methods against the existing 'Lucy-Richardson' image recovery algorithm in its adapted form to recover temporal dynamics. Our results demonstrate that all our proposed methods surpass the performance of 'Lucy-Richardson' on both synthetic and recording datasets, including concurrent recordings of fluorescence and spike counts from the exact origin by multichannel silicon probes. Furthermore, we illustrate that our findings are indifferent to the choice of removing hemodynamic signals. Lastly, we demonstrate that the reliance on calcium signals for advanced analytical approaches can lead to distorted results. For example, they can show correlations between the activity of different brain regions that are unrealistically high compared to the correlations of the underlying spiking rate between the same areas. This highlights the critical importance of temporal inference for further accurate and reliable analysis in understanding the complexities of brain activity.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

These include layer-by-layer (LbL) NPs, modular electrostatically assembled carriers with tunable surface properties altered by changes to the outer polyion layer. Variations in these polymers dictate intracellular trafficking and biodistribution patterns. As NPs are administered, a layer of protein adsorbs to their surfaces, forming a protein corona that affects NP properties, alters biodistribution, and ultimately, impacts therapeutic efficacy. We hypothesized that some differences in LbL NP performance are due, in part, to variations in the resulting protein coronas. To study them, we first optimized an ultrafiltration method to effectively isolate LbL NPs with their protein corona. Following incubation in conditioned media, anionic homopolypeptide outer layers, such as poly-L-aspartic acid (PLD) and poly-L-glutamic acid (PLE), and LbL NPs with the bioinert polymer poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) had the lowest amount of protein associated, lower than conventional PEG liposomes. While mass spectroscopy revealed changes in the protein composition among LbL NPs; albumin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and apolipoprotein B were most abundant. In vitro, pre-formed protein coronas reduced uptake in macrophages but increased uptake in ovarian cancer cells for certain LbL NP outer layers. In vivo, LbL NP outer layer influenced both serum half-life and biodistribution.

Forty male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, model (BLM), low-dose COCA, high-dose COCA, and pirfenidone. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal BLM administration in the model and treatment groups. Pathological evaluation, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and Western blot were conducted. The results showed that COCA significantly alleviated BLM-induced inflammation and fibrosis. ELISA demonstrated decreased serum levels of TNF- and IL-6 in the treated groups compared to the BLM group (P < 0.01). Immunofluorescence indicated reduced expression of Col-I and Col-III in the treated groups (P < 0.01).

Cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) contribute to age-related endothelial dysfunction by promoting mitochondrial oxidative stress and inflammation, which reduce nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. However, the molecular changes in senescent endothelial cells and their role in endothelial dysfunction with aging remain incompletely unclear. As such, in this study we sought to identify the endothelial cell senescence-related signalling pathways, endothelial-derived SASP factors, and their impact on endothelial function with aging. Methods: Single-cell transcriptomics was performed on aortas from young (6 months) and old (27 months) mice with and without in vivo senolytic treatment with fisetin (100 mg/kg/day administered in an intermittent dosing paradigm) to characterize endothelial cell senescence and transcript expression changes. Circulating levels of SASP factors were measured to validate transcriptional changes. Plasma exposure and protein addition and inhibiton experiments were conducted in isolated mouse arteries and cultured human endothelial cells to determine the causal role of the circulating SASP milieu and specific SASP factors in mediating endothelial dysfunction and underlying mechanisms-of-action. Results: Senescent endothelial cells exhibited elevated expression of SASP factors, particularly Cxcl12, which was reversed by fisetin supplementation, with responses also reflected in circulating CXCL12 concentrations. Plasma from old mice impaired endothelial function by inducing vascular cell senescence, reducing NO, increasing mitochondrial oxidative stress, and promoting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition--effects partially driven by CXCL12 and prevented by fisetin.

While aqueous-based clearing overcomes these challenges, there is a clear need for a method that is optimized for clearing musculoskeletal tissues and that can easily be implemented in a standard lab environment. Here, we present KneEZ Clear, a simple, rapid, and flexible aqueous-based method that renders mineralized and non-mineralized tissues of murine knee joints optically transparent. We show that KneEZ Clear, which is based on the EZ Clear method, is highly flexible, demonstrating efficacy in a wide range of murine musculoskeletal tissues including the vertebral column, hindlimb, skull, and teeth. Critically, KneEZ Clear does not require specialized equipment and retains endogenous signal from fluorophores and fluorescent proteins. Additionally, following clearing and wholemount imaging, precious samples can still be processed for subsequent 2D histological analyses for validation or further study.

Here, we molecularly characterize two helical truncated isoforms of the human glutamate transporter EAA1. Using an integrative multi-omics and computational approach, we show that these isoforms, particularly one derived from the N-terminus, do not adopt the canonical transporter fold. Instead, they self-assemble into stable, {beta}-sheet-enriched oligomers, a structure previously unobserved for this protein family. Furthermore, we identified a water-soluble truncated isoform (A0A7P0TAF5) of the membranous canonical EAA1, revealing that self-assembly is not confined to membranous isoforms of EAA1. This finding uncovers a previously unrecognized functional class of truncated isoforms capable of initiating assembly in the soluble state. Our 500ns molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that the N-terminal truncation alters the native conformational dynamics, promoting a transition into semi-helical {beta}-structures over time. In a model bilayer, {beta}-Sheet-driven octamerization of the helical EAA1 isoform A0A7P0Z4F7 induces localized upper leaflet membrane pitting during 250ns all-atom simulation.

Our findings thus uncover a potential new mechanism for glutamate transporter involvement in neurodegeneration and identify the N-terminal domain as a promising therapeutic target.

Missense mutations to hepatic and glial cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), also known as GlialCAM, are responsible for approximately twenty-five percent of MLC cases. HepaCAM is highly enriched in astrocytes and plays important roles in astrocyte territory establishment, gap junction coupling, branching organization, synaptic function, and development of the gliovascular unit. The molecular mechanisms through which MLC-causing missense mutations alter hepaCAM function in vivo and facilitate MLC pathogenesis during brain development remain largely unknown. Here, we used new viral tools and proximity-based proteomics to examine how three different dominant MLC-causing mutations impact hepaCAM subcellular localization and protein interactome in astrocytes of the developing mouse cortex. We found dramatic defects in hepaCAM distribution throughout the astrocyte, which were common to all mutants tested. We also observed significant changes in protein interactome between wild type and mutant hepaCAM, including decreased association with previously described hepaCAM-interacting proteins Connexin 43 and CLC-2. Moreover, we identified changes in association between hepaCAM and a number of previously undescribed potential hepaCAM-interaction partners, including the epilepsy-associated potassium channel KCNQ2. Collectively, our data provide new insights into hepaCAM function in astrocytes during brain development, reveal altered hepaCAM protein dynamics with MLC missense mutations, and provide a new resource to explore the molecular underpinnings of MLC pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, the neural mechanisms supporting social decisions in older adults within varied social contexts remain largely unknown. This study investigated how age and partner similarity modulate neural activation and network connectivity during fairness-related decision making and whether individual differences in behavioral sensitivity to fairness norm violations correlate with neural activities. Methods: Younger (18-35) and older (65-80) adults underwent fMRI while playing an ultimatum game with ostensible partners of a similar or dissimilar age. We used regression to model choice behavior and whole-brain fMRI analyses to examine functional activation and connectivity of the Default Mode (DMN) and Executive Control (ECN) networks. Results: Behaviorally, choices did not differ by age, partner similarity, or their interactions. In contrast, neuroimaging revealed interactions between age, partner similarity, and individual sensitivity to norm violation. Younger adults exhibited positive DMN-anterior cingulate connectivity when interacting with a similar-aged partner, whereas older adults showed a negative connectivity. Furthermore, younger adults demonstrated a negative correlation between their sensitivity to norm violation and the partner-identity effect in ECN-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity, whereas older adults showed a positive correlation. Discussion: Our findings indicate a brain-behavior dissociation where different neural mechanisms support similar behavioral outcomes across age groups. These opposing patterns of neural responses suggest age-related functional reorganizations, which may represent compensatory strategies that enable older adults to preserve behaviors similar to that of their younger counterparts.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Despite its promise, the presence of TMS-induced artifacts poses significant challenges for accurately characterizing and interpreting evoked neural responses. In this study, we present a practical preprocessing pipeline for single pulse TMS-iEEG data, incorporating key steps of re-referencing, filtering, artifact interpolation, and detrending. Using both real and simulated data, we systematically evaluated the effects of each step and compared alternative methodological choices. Our results demonstrate that this pipeline effectively attenuated various types of artifacts and noise, yielding cleaner signals for the subsequent analysis of intracranial TMS-evoked potentials (iTEPs). Moreover, we showed that methodological choices can substantially influence iTEPs outcomes. In particular, referencing methods might strongly affect iTEP morphology and amplitude, underscoring the importance of tailoring the referencing strategy to specific signal characteristics and research objectives. For filtering, we recommend a segment-based strategy, i.e., applying filters to data segments excluding the artifact window, to minimize distortion from abrupt TMS-related transients. Overall, this work represents an important step toward establishing a general preprocessing framework for TMS-iEEG data.

Alternative splicing of claudin-5 within the microvascular endothelium may modulate BBB structural and functional dynamics, potentially influencing neuronal damage and recovery following ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that ischemic stroke induces temporal changes in claudin-5 protein isoform expression that correlates with worsened neurological outcomes. Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent thromboembolic stroke. Claudin-5 isoform expression was assessed at 3, 6, and 24h post-stroke onset, with additional groups receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at 4 hours post-stroke. Brain edema, infarct volume, hemorrhage, and cerebral blood flow was evaluated using 9.4T MRI. Ipsilateral and contralateral cerebrovascular claudin-5 expression was quantified via western blotting while neurological function was assessed by 28-point neuroscore. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis was performed to identify novel splice variants. Results: A time-dependent increase in claudin-5 isoform 1 (35kDa) expression levels in the ipsilateral cerebrovasculature at 6 h was observed. Isoform 2 (25kDa) and fragment (10kDa) isoforms of claudin-5 remain unchanged. Treatment with rt-PA maintained the elevated levels of isoform 1 claudin-5 protein expression within the ipsilateral hemisphere. Increased claudin-5 isoform 1 expression within the ipsilateral hemisphere correlated with increased brain edema, hemorrhage, and worsened neurological function at 24h post-stroke onset. RNA sequencing revealed novel CLDN5 splice isoforms in post-stroke rat brain tissue which resemble structural similarity to known human CLDN5 isoforms. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that ischemic stroke induces temporal, hemisphere-specific alterations in claudin-5 isoform expression that correlate with BBB dysfunction and poor neurological outcomes. The potential indication of novel alternative splice variants suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of claudin-5 represents a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to endothelial tight junction dysfunction and stroke pathophysiology.

Here, we performed ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse hippocampal slices to characterize FC neurons. We found that FC cells are functionally distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, exhibiting significantly reduced excitability, delayed spike initiation, and enhanced afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents, consistent with strong potassium conductance. Notably, we identified two electrophysiologically distinguishable FC neuron excitatory cell subtypes, differing in excitability and potassium channel activity. Pharmacological analyses demonstrated that Kv2.1 and Kv7 potassium channels play a key role in shaping the intrinsic properties of FC neurons, underlying their reduced excitability. These findings suggest that the FC is a heterogeneous structure, molecularly and functionally specialized for gating excitability within the hippocampal circuit.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Ictal chirps, transient frequency-modulated patterns, were semi-automatically annotated to assess their relationship with seizure onset zones (SOZs) and surgical outcomes. Preprocessing included notch filtering (60 Hz, 120 Hz) and bandpass filtering (1-60 Hz), followed by segmentation into 60-second windows. Spectrograms were generated via Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a Hann window (87.5% overlap) and converted to dB scale. Chirps were annotated by manually drawing bounding boxes, followed by automated ridge detection, model fitting, and feature extraction (start/end time-frequency, duration, direction, RMSE, R2). Spatial, Spectro-temporal, and clinical features were analyzed using heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U), and outcome prediction models. Patient-channel mappings revealed clustering of chirp patterns among specific patient pairs, correlating with shared clinical profiles. Flow-based analysis demonstrated prognostic value: very high spectral durations in SOZ regions were associated with favorable surgical outcomes (80.43% success rate), whereas very high temporal durations in SOZ correlated with poorer outcomes (51.35% risk). Statistical comparisons showed significant differences between SOZ and non-SOZ chirps: SOZ chirps exhibited longer spectral durations (*p* < 0.001), shorter temporal durations (*p* = 0.006), and higher spectro-temporal ratios (*p* < 0.001).

Results: The sVF was able to induce a behavior profile in naive animals characterized by a hind paw flinching and withdrawal reflex. This behavioral response was affected by intraplantar lidocaine, which prone to the increase in mechanical thresholds related to sVF and validate it as pain related behavior. On the aVF method, the animals displayed no alterations at their mechanical thresholds in presence or absence of lidocaine, suggesting minimal stimulation of hind paw by the modified methodology. In animals where an osteoarthritic phenotype was induced by MIA, the aVF was able to detect a significant reduction on joint mechanical thresholds. The behavior linked to aVF was significantly affected by systemic delivery of morphine, confirming a nociceptive-like phenotype and suggesting a pain behavior predominantly triggered by joint flexion.

Aquaglyceroporin 1 (AQP1) is a membrane channel that, in L. major, localizes to the flagellum and mediates antimony uptake and cell-volume regulation. Here, we show that in L. amazonensis AQP1 is instead targeted to glycosomes and that its expression is modulated by iron availability. A CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of AQP1 in L. amazonensis revealed its multifunctional importance. AQP1-null promastigotes displayed a significant growth defect, particularly under iron-depleted conditions, and were impaired in regulating cell volume under osmotic stress. The mutant parasites contained approximately 50% less intracellular iron than wild-type cells and showed an increase in total superoxide dismutase activity, underscoring a role for AQP1 in iron homeostasis and oxidative stress management. AQP1 deletion also markedly reduced virulence in murine macrophages and in infected mice. Strikingly, loss of AQP1 increased resistance to trivalent antimony (SbIII), a first-line antileishmanial drug. AQP1-knockout promastigotes showed a 70% increase in SbIII EC50 and accumulated more Sb intracellularly than wild-type, suggesting an altered antimony handling. Altogether, L. amazonensis AQP1 is a glycosomal protein that links iron metabolism, osmoregulation, and antimony susceptibility. Its glycosomal targeting and multifaceted roles differ from those of AQP1 orthologs in other Leishmania species. These findings suggest the existence of additional antimony uptake mechanisms beyond AQP1, with implications for understanding drug resistance.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we utilize tissue engineered models of the meningeal lymphatics and lymph node stroma to probe how leukemia cells interact with these key tissues. We first demonstrate that standard-of-care chemotherapeutics can damage meningeal lymphatic barriers. Next, we showed that soluble factors from the meningeal lymphatics can support leukemia cell growth while soluble factors from the lymph node model under flow can promote leukemia cell migration.

B.; Kahr, D.; Haage, F.; Zille, M.", "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a critical boundary between the peripheral circulation and the brain. Brain endothelial cells (BECs), which form the inner lining of cerebral blood vessels, play a key role in maintaining this barrier. They express tight junction proteins that prevent molecules from leaking between cells into the brain and efflux transporters that actively remove substances from the brain. As we age, the BBB becomes leaky and dysfunctional, leading to cerebrovascular diseases and dementia. Here, we investigated how BECs become senescent, a major feature of aging, and change their metabolic profile. First, we demonstrate that both the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, a known inducer of cellular senescence, as well as hydrogen peroxide, a mediator of oxidative stress, induce BEC senescence. This was indicated by positive senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase staining (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001 for doxorubicin and H2O2, respectively) and increased P16 gene expression (both P = 0.004). Next, we analyzed the metabolic profile of the senescent cells using mass spectrometry. We identified 47 significantly altered metabolites (P < 0.05) in cells and 65 in the supernatant samples of doxorubicin-induced senescent cells, as well as, 53 significantly altered metabolites in cells and 82 in the supernatant samples of H2O2-induced senescent cells. There was an overlap of 10 and 44 metabolites between both treatments in the cell and supernatant samples, respectively. Of those, 9 cellular and 12 supernatant metabolites have already been reported in the literature to be changed during senescence in the brain or other organs. We also identified new metabolites and provide pathway analyses of the significantly altered metabolites.

Here, we use in vitro reconstitution assays to investigate the microtubule binding behavior of metallopeptidase MATCAP1 and the mechanism by which it generates ?Y and ?C2 modifications of a-tubulin. We demonstrate that MATCAP1 preferentially binds to microtubules composed of tubulin subunits in an expanded conformation, which can be induced by preventing a-tubulin GTP hydrolysis, Taxol treatment, or kinesin-1 stepping. MATCAP1 binds to expanded microtubule lattices with long dwell time and sequentially removes the terminal tyrosine residue to generate ?Y-microtubules and the penultimate glutamate residue to generate ?C2-microtubules.

Training images for the full image regression approach required only a single label for training -- the analyte concentration -- eliminating the need for labor-intensive pixel-level labeling.

While much is known about COVID-19, studies exploring how host-pathogen interactions at the transcriptomic level influence disease severity are still limited. This research focuses on metatranscriptomic perspective of COVID-19 patients from different Bangladeshi cohorts. Metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed using the extracted RNA of forty different nasopharyngeal samples. After preprocessing and assembly of the genome sequence data, taxonomic identification and diversity along with antibiotic resistance pattern was analyzed using different bioinformatic pipelines. COVID-19 positive and asymptomatic positive patients had a higher abundance of pathogenic and multidrug resistant bacteria whereas the Healthy or recovered patients had higher fungal population. Differential gene expression analysis was also performed to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes responsible for different biological and immunological pathways of humans. Here, immunological response related genes were mostly upregulated in positive cases which was also evident in the proinflammatory cytokines upregulation. Moreover, asymptomatic positive cases showed low TLR-4 expression, which is key to recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and triggering pro-inflammatory immune responses. This study can clarify the gene expression and signaling pattern of COVID-19 patients with different severity. This may also suggest that some populations exhibit reduced basal expression of TLR-4, which may suppress innate immune activation following infection and contribute to asymptomatic clinical outcomes; however, this hypothesis requires further investigation.

The most commonly isolated causative agents are staphylococci, though the mechanisms underpinning survival and proliferation in synovial fluid are still not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to identify genes important for survival in synovial fluid using a transposon mutant library and RNAseq. We produced a transposon mutant library, containing approximately 57,000 unique insertion mutants, in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 846. This library was grown in Muller Hinton broth or processed human synovial fluid samples, and Transposon-directed Insertion Sequencing (TraDIS) was used to identify genes involved in survival in synovial fluid. This identified importance of the his, pur and cnt operons. These genes were also upregulated in both Staphylococcus epidermidis 846 and the model Staphylococcus epidermidis strain RP62A when exposed to human synovial fluid. All these key pathways contribute to production of the metallophore staphylopine. To confirm staphyopine production is essential for survival in synovial fluid, a defined transposon insertion in the gene encoding for staphylopine export (cntE) mutant was used. This demonstrated impaired survival in synovial fluid compared to the wild type. RT-qPCR also showed that cntE was more highly expressed after exposure to infected synovial fluid (where metals will be depleted) than non-infected fluid. In conclusion, TraDIS and RNASeq both identified the importance of staphylopine for survival in human synovial fluid.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each microorganism is determined at different light fluence rates within a clinically relevant range. Our results demonstrate that curcumin-mediated PDT effectively inactivates E. coli and C. auris, while exhibiting only partial inhibition against P. fluorescens at curcumin concentrations up to 60 M. Notably, within the tested fluence rate range, the total light dose appears to be a more critical determinant of antimicrobial efficacy than the specific fluence rate itself.

We found that when antibiotic resistance selection pressure was removed, lower temperature and nutrient limitations, especially iron (Fe) deficiency, fostered a better fitness to resistant mutants when co-cultivated with the wild type, whereas changes in pH or salinity (Na or K) did not. Moreover, the growth advantage of resistant mutants under the selection pressure was reversed by suboptimal conditions like acidic/basic pH, high K salinity, and Fe limitation.

Fluorinated GDP-Fuc analogs can also act as feedback inhibitor of the de novo biosynthesis pathway of GDP-Fuc. To investigate the biological significance of distinct glycoconjugate classes, it is important to develop inhibitors that can selectively target specific FUT enzymes. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of GDP-2-F-Fuc analogs modified at C-6 of Fuc by various amides and ethers. We also prepared and examined corresponding prodrugs as potential FUT inhibitors of cellular glycosylation. Our findings reveal that two of the inhibitors potently inhibited FUT1, 3, 6, and 9, while displaying minimal activity against FUT8. However, the corresponding prodrugs did not inhibit cellular fucosylation, which is probably due to a lack of GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase activity.

While the structures and interactions of the receptors have been long established as mediators of signaling, increasing evidence suggests that the membrane itself plays an active role in both suppressing and enhancing signaling. Identifying and investigating this contribution have been challenging owing to the complex composition of the plasma membrane. We used cell-free expression to incorporate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) into nanodiscs with defined membrane compositions and characterized ligand-induced transmembrane conformational response and interactions with signaling partners using single-molecule and ensemble fluorescence assays. We observed that both the transmembrane conformational response and interactions with signaling partners are strongly lipid dependent, consistent with previous observations of electrostatic interactions between the anionic lipids and conserved basic residues near the membrane adjacent domain. Strikingly, the active conformation of EGFR and high levels of ATP binding were maintained regardless of ligand binding with high anionic lipid content typical of cancer cells, where EGFR signaling is enhanced. In contrast, the conformational response was suppressed in the presence of cholesterol, providing a mechanism for its known inhibitory effect on EGFR signaling. Our findings introduce a model of EGFR signaling in which the lipid environment can override ligand control, providing a biophysical basis for both robust EGFR activity in healthy cells and aberrant activity under pathological conditions. The membrane-adjacent protein sequence, likely responsible for the lipid dependence, is conserved among receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting that active regulation by the plasma membrane may be a general feature of this important class of proteins.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) commonly co-occur in contaminated environments, yet most toxicity studies focus on individual metals. We investigated the combined toxicity of Ni and Cu in Escherichia coli using environmentally relevant concentrations of each. While each metal alone caused minimal growth inhibition, their combination was synergistically toxic. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed unique alterations in gene expression and metabolites during the combined metal treatment. Key pathways uniquely impacted by the combined metal exposure included sulfur assimilation, cysteine biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Many of these responses appeared to be linked to dysregulation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster metabolism. We observed increased expression of the genes encoding ISC Fe-S cluster assembly machinery only during metal co-treatment. Growth experiments with deletion mutants confirmed that the ISC machinery was required for survival only under the combined metal stress. We also observed the activation of a sulfur starvation response during the combined metal stress that was consistent with increased sulfur demand for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Deletion of cysK, encoding cysteine synthase, impaired growth only under combined metal exposure. Because Fe-S clusters are universal across microbial taxa, the common co-occurrence of Ni and Cu in the environment represents a widespread and underrecognized threat to microbial life and the ecosystem processes they sustain.

Here we report that S. aureus was auxotrophic for L-alanine in CDM, and that this growth defect was rescued by glucose (or compensatory mutations), but only when the alanine racemase (alr1) and D-alanine aminotransferase (dat) genes were functional. No role was observed for the alanine dehydrogenase 1 (ald1) and ald2 genes. As previously reported, alr1 and, to a lesser extent, cycA mutations increased susceptibility to D-cycloserine (DCS). In contrast, only alr1 mutation increased susceptibility to {beta}-chloro-D-alanine (BCDA), suggesting distinct targets for these alanine analogue antibiotics, which act synergistically against MRSA. Genome sequencing of a BCDA-resistant mutant identified a C539T mutation in dat, predicted to result in a S180F substitution. Expression of the datC539T operon in wild-type increased BCDA resistance. alr1/dat::Em and alr1/datC539T double mutants were auxotrophic for D-alanine, indicating that Dat-S180F transaminase activity is impaired, a conclusion supported by in vitro enzyme assays. Structural modeling revealed an active-site loop shift in Dat-S180F that altered PLP co-factor binding. Molecular docking showed that the S180F substitution promotes BCDA-PLP adduct dissociation by releasing inactivated BCDA, thereby conferring resistance.

Analysis of the infection dynamics of the cDNA clone-derived PLRV isolates in potato plants indicated that the novel Scottish PLRV may accumulate to higher levels compared to the historic one. Analysis of the genetic diversity of PLRV in early and late field generations (FGs) of seed potatoes showed a significantly reduced genetic diversity of the PLRV structural genes in the early FGs, compared to the late FGs, while di-vergency of the non-structural genes remained similar across all FGs.

To assess functional novelty, we aligned predicted proteins to SwissProt and measured sequence dissimilarity to the nearest curated homolog. We find that uncultured MAGs, particularly among Archaea, harbor substantially more divergent proteins. To identify genomic traits predictive of culturability, we combined pathway-level enrichment with LASSO regression and permutation-based feature importance. Cultured MAGs were consistently enriched in Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) pathways related to vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis (e.g., thiamine, folate, B12), energy metabolism (e.g., TCA cycle), and CRISPR-Cas systems--functions often depleted in uncultured counterparts.

Our flow cytometric data from a diversity of taxa reveal that the density of microbes in mesopelagic fish guts is between 106-107 microbes ml-1: two to three orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding seawater. In light of the total estimated number of mesopelagic fishes, there are approximately 2.4x1020 -1.34x1024 gut prokaryotes in total, which without consideration of other biomass abundant animals is realistically within four orders of magnitude of the total prokaryote abundance in mesopelagic waters. Metagenomic analyses revealed distinct bacterial genotypes of the genera Acinetobacter and Psychrobacter that harbor extensive gene sets for synthesis of essential amino acids, cofactor and vitamins, and short-chain-fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as cellulose and chitin degradation. Given their abundance, mesopelagic fish gut microbiomes are likely playing a role in shaping the nitrogen and carbon cycles, including through calcium carbonate precipitation and sequestration.

L.; Fumagalli, M.; DeGiorgio, M.", "abstract": "Identifying genomic regions shaped by natural selection is a central goal in evolutionary genomics. Existing machine learning methods for this task are typically trained using simulated genomic data labeled according to specific evolutionary scenarios. While effective in controlled settings, these models are limited by their reliance on explicit class labels. They can only detect the specific processes they were trained to recognize, making it difficult to interpret predictions for regions influenced by other evolutionary forces. This limitation is especially problematic when analyzing empirical genomes shaped by a mixture of adaptive, demographic, and ecological factors. One-vs.-rest strategies offer a potential alternative, but suffer from the inherent complexity of modeling all other evolutionary and demographic processes as a catch-all ``rest'' class. Here, we explore positive-unlabeled learning as a more flexible framework for detection of adaptive events. Positive-unlabeled learning is a semi-supervised approach that permits identification of samples of a target class using only positive labels and an unlabeled background, without requiring explicit modeling of negative samples. To assess the utility of this approach, we focus on a binary classification setting for detecting selective sweeps (positive samples) arising from positive natural selection against a mixed background composed of both unlabeled sweeps and neutrally-evolving regions. To accomplish this goal, we introduce PULSe, a method that employs only a set of labeled sweep observations for training while treating all remaining data as unlabeled. By avoiding assumptions about the composition of the background, PULSe enables robust sweep discovery in realistic genomic landscapes. We systematically evaluate its performance across a range of demographic, adaptive, and confounding contexts, including domain shift arising from misspecified demographic models, and find that PULSe delivers high performance and generalizability. To demonstrate a practical application of PULSe, we analyzed European and Bengali in Bangladesh human genomes, treating the empirical genomes as unlabeled sets, and recapitulating several previously-identified sweep candidates.

However, understanding how variations in receptor sequence, ligand chemical structure, and binding impact signaling functions remains a challenge, hindering drug discovery. Here, we developed a computational protein structure and dynamics approach to infer and design GPCR responses to multiple ligands. We created 32 dopamine D1 and D2 receptor variants with widely reprogrammed agonist-induced signal transductions. Subtle natural and designed receptor sequence variations, predicted to alter specific structural and dynamic mechanisms of ligand responses, profoundly impacted ligand potency and efficacy in agreement with our calculations. Our study provides a rational blueprint for computing the effect of sequence polymorphisms on ligand-selective protein signaling and paves the way for advancements in pharmacogenomics, drug selectivity, and the design of signaling receptors from first principles.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

To better study such membrane interface interactions, it would be useful to employ surface-attached model lipid membranes derived from RBCs to enable surface-sensitive biophysical and biochemical measurements. Here, we present approaches to prepare two such types of RBC-derived model lipid membranes - supported lipid bilayers (RBC-SLBs) and tethered RBC liposomes. We present data characterizing and validating these model membranes, including assessing lipid mobility, the distribution and mobility of the glycophorin A membrane protein, the functionality of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, and the utility of the RBC-SLBs as binding targets for viral pathogens. We anticipate that our results and methodologies will be of interest to researchers studying molecular interactions with RBC membranes, as well as those interested in the engineering of model membrane platforms derived from other physiological membranes.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

P.; Boccaccio, G.; Parisi, G.", "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a key process underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates (BMCs), such as membrane-less organelles (MLOs), that compartmentalize biochemical processes inside the cells. While LLPS has been extensively studied in eukaryotes, its role in bacteria, archaea, and viruses remains far less characterized. Recent studies in bacteria have revealed that LLPS-driven condensates play critical roles in RNA processing, stress response, and pathogenicity. Similarly, many viruses exploit LLPS to facilitate crucial steps in their infection cycles, including viral entry, genome replication, assembly, and host immune evasion. In this work, we introduce a hand-curated database of LLPS proteins from bacteria, archaea, and viruses (BAV-LLPS Database). This resource, extended through sequence similarity searches, comprises over 5,000 proteins and integrates diverse data including biological annotations, sequence features, predicted disordered regions, LLPS per site probability, and AlphaFold2-based structural models. Additionally, our web server enables users to explore both the curated and homologous derived datasets, providing a platform to uncover evolutionary relationships and intrinsic and differential properties of LLPS proteins across various taxonomic groups. This work seeks to deepen our understanding of LLPS mechanisms beyond eukaryotic organisms, emphasizing their significance across diverse life forms. It also aims to foster the development of specialized predictive tools that will facilitate the exploration and characterization of LLPS processes in a wide array of living organisms, thereby contributing to advancements in both fundamental biological research and applied biomedical sciences.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Despite its physiological importance, the exact mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we uncover a previously unrecognized calcium-mediated gating mechanism in the MthK potassium channel that sheds new light on this essential process. By combining state-of-the-art proton-detected solid-state NMR spectroscopy with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that divalent calcium ions bind to a novel site just below the selectivity filter, physically obstructing the outward flow of potassium ions whereas inward flow is still possible - analogous to a molecular ball check valve. Secondly, the binding of Ca2+ to the newly identified site leads to stabilization of the selectivity filter and allows us to directly observe ion-ion interactions in the filter. These results offer direct experimental support for the long-debated \"direct knock-on\" mechanism, in which potassium ions move through the filter, without water co-transport.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Here, using high-speed atomic force microscopy, we directly visualized the dynamics of the Smc5/6 complex on DNA at submolecular resolution, resolving its individual domains. ATP-bound Smc5/6 stably binds DNA via the ATPase head domain, whereas following ATP hydrolysis, the DNA is entrapped within the SMC compartment and positioned around the opposite hinge domain. Furthermore, Smc5/6 topologically entraps two DNA segments together and stabilizes the DNA twist structures, promoting DNA compaction.

However, some microbial genomes encode an opsin but lack the gene for the final enzyme in retinal synthesis. To account for this paradox, we hypothesized that bacterial opsins play a role in membrane structure and/or biogenesis independent from their potential for light-driven signaling or proton pumping. After purifying actinorhodopsin from a cell-free expression system and from E. coli membranes upon overexpression, we demonstrated both in vitro and in silico that actinorhodopsin from Nanopelagicus ca. is a phospholipid scramblase, serving in its pentameric state as a retinal-independent phospholipid diffusion channel. Phospholipid headgroups move along a transbilayer path between actinorhodopsin protomers, to equilibrate lipid content in the inner and outer leaflets. Two profound activities, membrane biosynthesis and capture of light energy, are thus facilitated by one ancient bacterial polypeptide. Light-dependent activity and light-independent phospholipid scrambling are shared functions of eukaryotic, archaeal, and bacterial rhodopsins.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

Clarifying the lesion patterns that precipitate loss of consciousness can refine pathophysiological models and guide prognosis. Objectives: In this study, we aim to identify the brain regions most commonly affected in comatose AIS and determine whether specific combinations of lesions are necessary and sufficient to produce coma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 476 AIS patients (52 comatose) using diffusion-weighted imaging. Infarcts were automatically segmented, manually verified, and normalized to MNI space. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) quantified voxel-wise associations with coma, controlling for lesion volume. To assess the necessity and sufficiency of lesion combinations, we employed permutation-based nested logistic regression models comparing all subsets of four anatomical predictors: brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, and the rest of brain lesions. Results: SVR-LSM revealed that coma was strongly associated with lesions involving the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum, whereas non-comatose patients exhibited predominantly cortical infarcts. Nested model comparisons showed that concurrent lesions to both the brainstem and thalamus were necessary and sufficient for coma. Additional involvement of the cerebellum or cerebral cortex did not improve predictive performance. Conclusions: Coma after AIS results from a dual-node subcortical lesion pattern involving both the brainstem and thalamus. Cerebellar and cortical lesions, even when extensive, did not induce coma in the absence of the dual-brainstem and thalamic lesions. These observations emphasize the predominant role of lesion location over lesion volume in the pathogenesis of coma. They also support mechanistic models that position the brainstem and thalamic hubs as central to the neural circuitry underlying arousal. Furthermore, these findings delineate a specific anatomical substrate that may serve as a strategic target for circuit-based neuroprotective and neuromodulatory therapies.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

In 2023, an estimated 10.8 million new cases of TB and 1.25 million deaths were reported globally. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a heavy TB burden, worsened by high HIV-AIDS prevalence and rising drug resistance, making novel anti-TB therapies a pressing priority. This study investigated the efflux inhibition (EI) activity of compounds characterised from Berberisholstii Engl. extracts. Following in vitro evaluation of the antimycobacterial activity of aqueous and organic extracts against the non-pathogenic mycobacterial model, Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm), and Mtb. Thereafter, molecular docking of several compounds identified in chromatographic fractions onto Rv1258c, MmpS5-MmpL5 and Rv2333c Mtb efflux pumps (EPs) was undertaken to infer their binding modes and affinities. Subsequently, fractions containing potentially active compounds were tested in combination with spectinomycin (SPEC) and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values determined. Validation of Mtb efflux pump inhibition was performed using CRISPRi knockdown strains of Rv1258c and Rv2333c. MeOH extracts of the root and the stem bark, and aqueous extracts of the roots, exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC99) values of 906.25g/ml, 4500 g/ml and 1875 g/ml, respectively, against wild-type Msm. On the other hand, MeOH extract of the leaves and aqueous extract of the stem bark had MIC99 values of 60.43 g/ml and 1.74 g/ml respectively, against wild-type Mtb. Molecular docking of chillanamine, isoboldine, berberrubine, reticuline, N-methylcoclaurine, thalifoline, apoglaziovine, and orientine onto Mtb Rv1258c, MmpS5-MmpL5 and Rv2333c revealed string binding affinities of <-5 kcal/mol. Of the seven fractions containing the bioactive compounds evaluated in checkerboard assays, six were synergistic with SPEC (FICI <0.5), with two fractions lowering the MIC99 of SPEC by 8-fold against wild-type Mtb.

However, the extent to which environmental factors and vineyard management practices interact to shape these microbial communities and their functions remains poorly understood. We implemented a multidisciplinary citizen science collaboration together with winegrowers to sample 19 Pinot Noir vineyards across two distinct Swiss regions (N=38 samples). This allowed us to evaluate how a combination of environmental conditions and management practices (such as cover cropping and fungicide use) collectively impact soil and grape microbiomes, soil enzymatic activities, nutrient concentration in leaves, and grape chemistry. Regional differences were the primary drivers of variation, but multivariate analysis revealed a distinct, secondary influence from management practices on soil and berries. Berry quality was linked to functional soil properties, including microbial activity, which were further associated with key fermentative yeasts likely involved in wine fermentation. These findings highlight the interconnected nature of environmental, microbial, and agronomic factors in grapevine systems and offer novel insights into functional aspects of microbial terroir.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}

However, their potential persistence in soil raises concerns about ecological impacts, highlighting the need to understand microbial degradation rates and pathways. Results: This study reports the isolation of Arthrobacter sp. 11c, and its ability of fully degrading two hederagenin-based pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins: -hederin, hederacoside C, and the corresponding sapogenin hederagenin. All three compounds were fully metabolized within six hours when provided as carbon source. Fractionation experiments confirmed intracellular uptake and degradation of the saponins. Genome analysis of 11c revealed diverse and multiple glycosidase genes, yet basal glucosidase activity remained unchanged when cultured with these saponins. Comparative genomics with Arthrobacter sp. 12b, a closely related strain unable to degrade saponins, revealed two unique glycosidase gene clusters in 11c, suggesting a role in adaptation to saponin metabolism. Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of bacterial degradation of plant triterpenoid saponins and provide a foundation for evaluating their environmental fate. This knowledge supports the safe and sustainable use of saponin-based biopesticides in agriculture by identifying microbial partners that contribute to their breakdown in soil ecosystems.", "date": "2025-08-18", "journal": ""}
