Little is known about the neural mechanisms that enable remembering the \"when\" of memories stored for long durations in the episodic memory system - in contrast to interval-timing on the order of seconds and minutes. Based on a systematic exploration of neural coding, association and retrieval schemes, we develop model classes that span the space of possible mechanisms for the reconstruction of the time of past events. In concrete examples we show how network architecture, Hebbian plasticity, synaptic pruning or systems consolidation allow the retrieval of the time of past events. In a simulation, we demonstrate how these mechanisms would enable food caching animals like corvids to remember what they cached, where, and how long ago. To dissociate different hypotheses, we propose three kinds of novel, non-verbal experiments, that can be run with humans and animals. Our simulations predict the experimental results for different classes of models. Our study shows that remembering the \"when\" can be implemented by many biologically plausible mechanisms, and that carefully designed experiments are needed to pin down the actual neural implementation of the memory for the time of past events in different species.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

However, engineering neoantigens remains challenging due to the need for precise, tumor-specific antigen modification without affecting normal cells. To tackle this challenge, we developed Short Precise-Encodable ADAR Recruiting (SPEAR) ADAR-engagers, an approach that uses short guide RNAs to engage the endogenous RNA editor ADAR1 and direct it to regions of mRNA targets known to encode MHC-presented peptides. By precisely editing adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) in these contexts, we effectively mutate specific epitopes into neoepitopes (which we now term 'editopes'). As proof of concept, we targeted the known antigen MART-1 (Melanoma-Associated Antigen Recognized by T cells-1), and demonstrated that guided ADAR1 editing can generate immunogenic epitopes that activate T cells and promote tumor cell elimination. Building on this concept, we developed a computational pipeline to identify tumor-specific somatic mutations suitable for SPEAR-mediated editing. This strategy enables selective neoantigen generation in cancer cells, effectively increasing their apparent tumor mutational burden and potentially enhancing their susceptibility to immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We show that cell aspect ratio -a simple morphological feature- confers a competitive advantage. Using growth-based range expansion experiments, we show that longer bacteria conquer the expanding front, even when initially in minority. Using an agent-based model of dividing bacteria, to isolate the effect of aspect ratio, we reveal that the takeover mechanism is collective alignment: groups of locally aligned bacteria form \"nematic arms\" bridging the central region of the colony to the expanding front. Once at the front, bacteria align parallel to it and block shorter bacteria from access to nutrients and space. We confirm this observation with single-cell experiments and further generalise our findings by introducing a generic continuum model of alignment-dominated competition, explaining both experimental and cell-based model observations. Moreover, we extend our predictions to spherical range expansions and confirm the competitive advantage, even though the effect is less pronounced than in surface-attached colonies. Our results uncover a simple, yet hitherto overlooked, mechanical mechanism determining the outcome of bacterial competition, which is potentially ubiquitous among various bacteria.

M.; Sargolini, F.; Jacob, P.-Y.", "abstract": "In everyday life, mammals navigate through environments composed of multiple interconnected spaces. Understanding how the brain encodes space in such complex settings is essential to uncover the mechanisms that support flexible navigation in the real world. In this study, we investigated how the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus (HPC) encode spatial information in multi-room environments by recording neuronal activity in rats exploring environments composed of two or four connected rooms. These environments varied both in their structural layout and in their sensory features, allowing us to disentangle the influence of environmental geometry from that of local sensory cues. We found that two types of directional coding coexist within the RSC: classical head direction cells maintained a stable preferred firing direction across all rooms, while multidirectional cells expressed room-specific directional tuning that followed the geometric structure of the environment (e.g., 180 or 90 degrees rotations). In addition, non-directional RSC neurons displayed room-specific spatial firing patterns that repeated across rooms following geometric transformations, similar to the activity observed in multidirectional cells. In contrast, hippocampal place cells either remapped between rooms or showed simple translational repetition, without preserving any geometric alignment. Taken together, these findings reveal a functional dissociation between retrosplenial and hippocampal spatial codes. The RSC supports a structured, multi-scale representation of space, segmenting the environment into locally anchored reference frames embedded within a coherent global geometry. The HPC, by contrast, encodes room-specific representations independently for each compartment. This division may support flexible navigation in complex environments by integrating geometry-based spatial segmentation and unification in the RSC with context-specific encoding in the HPC, thereby enabling multi-level spatial coding across interconnected spaces.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Population variation in gene dosage -which significantly impacts gene expression-represents a unique paradigm to address this question. We developed a cerebral-cortex gene-set burden analysis (CC-GSBA) to associate a trait with genomic deletions and duplications that disrupt genes with similar expression profiles across 180 cortical regions. We performed CC-GSBA across 180 cortical regions to test associations with cognitive ability in 260,000 individuals from general population cohorts. Most cortical gene sets were associated with a decrease in cognitive ability when deleted or duplicated, and this novel approach revealed opposing cortical patterns for the effect sizes of deletions and duplications. These cortical patterns of effect sizes followed the cortical gradient previously characterized at the molecular, cellular, and functional levels. We show that genes with preferential expression in sensorimotor regions demonstrated the largest effect on cognition when deleted. At the opposing end of the cortical gradient, genes with preferential expression in multimodal association regions affected cognition the most when duplicated. These two gene dosage cortical patterns could not be explained by particular cell types, developmental epochs, or genetic constraints, highlighting the fact that the macroscopic network organization of the cerebral cortex is key to understanding the effects of gene dosage on cognitive traits.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "The Laurentian Great Lakes hold 21% of the world's surface freshwater and supply drinking water to nearly 40 million people. We provide the first evidence that wind-driven upwelling restructures microbial communities in Lake Ontario, with its effects sustained and redistributed by an internal Kelvin wave propagating along the shoreline. We combine 16S rRNA metabarcoding, absolute abundance quantification via flow cytometry, and hydrodynamic profiling to link physical processes to community composition. While thermal stratification organizes microbial communities by depth and season, this vertical structure arises from contrasting mechanisms: homogenizing selection in surface waters and dispersal limitation and drift in the hypolimnion. Kelvin wave-driven upwelling disrupts this scaffold, displacing rare taxa into the surface and creating novel coastal communities predicted to be enriched in methane oxidation and sulfur metabolism genes -- functional traits absent elsewhere in the lake. We observed a Kelvin wave lasting over two weeks and propagating eastward at ~60 km day-1. Given the ~10-12 day recurrence of wind events during the stratified season, at any time at least one segment of Lake Ontario's coastline is experiencing upwelling. These recurrent upwellings, sustained and redistributed by Kelvin waves, remodel microbial communities on ecologically relevant timescales. They act as a biological disturbance overriding stratification, mobilizing rare functional potential, and assembling novel coastal microbial communities. As climate change lengthens and intensifies stratified periods and reshapes large-lake circulation, understanding how physical forcing governs microbial assembly is essential for forecasting the biogeochemical future of Earth's great lakes -- especially in shoreline zones where ecological shifts directly affect human communities.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we address genetic differentiation among urban populations, among rural populations, and between urban and rural populations. We conducted an extensive population genomic double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing analysis of two non-model grassland lepidopterans, Coenonympha pamphilus and Chiasmia clathrata, across Europe. The genetic population structures of the study species were strikingly different: Co. pamphilus showed strong population differentiation, while this was almost absent in Ch. clathrata, which instead showed signs of high current and past gene flow among populations. Results of Co. pamphilus are consistent with multiple origins of urban populations, and multiple origins seem plausible also in Ch. clathrata.

With respect to sound, pure tone working memory in humans elicits hippocampal as well as auditory cortical and inferior frontal activity, and rodent work suggests that hippocampal cells that usually track an animal's physical location can also map to tone frequency when task-relevant. We generated a sound dimension based on the density of random-frequency tones in a stack, resulting in a percept ranging from low- (\"beepy\") to high-density (\"noisy\"). We established that unlike tone frequency, which listeners automatically associate with vertical position, this density dimension elicited no consistent spatial mapping. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, human participants held in mind the density of a series of tone stacks and, after a short maintenance period, adjusted further stacks to match the target (\"navigation\"). Density was represented most strongly in bilateral non-primary auditory cortex, specifically bilateral planum polare. Encoding and maintenance activity in hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, planum polare and posterior cingulate was positively associated with subsequent navigation success. Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus were among regions with elevated activity during adjustment, compared to a parity-judgment condition with closely matched acoustics and motor demands. Bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was more active when navigation was toward a target density than when participants adjusted density in a control condition with no particular target.

First, we uncover that the clostridial orders have significantly different adaptation rates. Second, we show that the Oscillospirales order has undergone extensive genomic and functional specialisation toward a host-associated lifestyle, while the Lachnospirales order tends to be at a lower level of host association, retaining a remarkably high number of free-living trait genes and a high degree of metabolic versatility.

A secondary, lower-confidence colocalization signal at FGF21 (PPcoloc = 0.6) further implicated metabolic-behavioural coupling as a convergent pathway. Downstream analyses of rs13107325 pQTLs indicated enrichment in synaptic development and cardiometabolic pathways. Together, these findings identify rs13107325 as a shared causal variant bridging neurodevelopment, immunity, and metabolism, and highlight metal-ion transport and FGF21 signalling as potential therapeutic entry points to address the intertwined psychiatric and metabolic burden of SZ.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Nuclear receptors, such as liver-X-receptors (LXR), orchestrate macrophage immunometabolic adaptations to infection and globally associate with tuberculosis (TB) protection. Here, we show that the \"signalling by nuclear receptors\" (SNR) pathway is detected in the whole blood of TB patients and that its expression correlates with disease severity. Accordingly, we also show that the activation of the LXR pathway progressively increases in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected C57BL/6 and C3HeB/FeJ mice. Pharmacologic activation of LXR, specifically at the chronic stage of infection, improved infection outcomes and significantly prolonged the survival of the highly susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice. Common to both mouse models and to in vitro macrophage infections, LXR activation enhanced bacterial control together with an increase in extracellular cholesterol levels. We propose that progressive LXR activation is required to fine-tune host cholesterol availability during M. tuberculosis infections and restrict access to this nutrient during chronic stages of infections. Collectively, we identify the SNR pathway as a potential biomarker of TB severity and timely LXR activation as a candidate host-directed therapy.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

They are implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes and proposed as a core mechanism for brain communication. Nonetheless, detecting genuine neural oscillations remains a methodological challenge, particularly due to the difficulty of distinguishing them from aperiodic background activity. To identify episodes of oscillatory activity directly at their sources, we developed pBOSC, which extends the BOSC (Better OSCillation detection) family of algorithms. Consistent with existing approaches, pBOSC detects oscillatory episodes that exceed both a defined power threshold and a minimum duration criterion. In pBOSC, however, the detection of oscillatory episodes also relies on identifying peaks (i.e., local maxima) in the power spectra as well as throughout the brain volume. Using a series of simulated signals, we tested the ability of pBOSC to detect and localize oscillations across multiple scenarios. Our results show that most oscillatory episodes were accurately detected at their sources, achieving around 95% accuracy under optimal conditions (i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio, lower frequency, and longer oscillation duration). In addition, we validated pBOSCs performance on real resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. By extracting the natural frequency of each brain voxel from the detected oscillatory episodes, we observed a topographic distribution consistent with previous work. In conclusion, pBOSC offers a novel approach for identifying oscillatory activity in electrophysiological signals. It extends previous algorithms by operating in source space and verifying the presence of genuine spectral peaks, thereby enabling new possibilities for exploring brain dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In the Japanese house bat, Pipistrellus abramus, mothers identify their pups using acoustic cues, particularly isolation calls (ICs) produced by newborns. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying such maternal recognition remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated maternal emotional responses of mother bats to pup calls by measuring heart rate (HR) changes during controlled playback experiments. We recorded ICs from 2-day-old pups and echolocation calls (ECs) from 30-day-old pups, then presented these sounds to mothers after their pups had become independent. HR significantly increased in response to calls from the mothers' own pups--both ICs and ECs--but not to calls from non-family pups. Among all stimuli, ECs from their own older pups evoked the largest HR increase, indicating strong physiological arousal and suggesting sustained maternal responsiveness despite developmental changes in call structure. In contrast, ECs from an unfamiliar adult also induced HR elevation, possibly reflecting general social arousal rather than maternal recognition. These findings demonstrate that P. abramus mothers exhibit selective physiological arousal to their own pups' vocalizations, and that HR provides a sensitive physiological index of maternal motivation and recognition based on dynamic acoustic information.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

However, recent work showed that twitches also occur during NREM sleep in human infants beginning around 3 months of age, a time when sleep spindles and the cortical delta rhythm are also emerging. Further, NREM twitches are coupled with sleep spindles, suggesting a unique contribution to sensorimotor development. Given that NREM sleep is composed of distinct substages, we investigated whether twitching and twitch-spindle coupling are differentially expressed during N2 and N3 sleep. In 6-month-old human infants (n=21; 7 females), we recorded EEG, respiration, and video during daytime sleep. We found high-intensity twitching during N2 and REM but not N3 sleep. In contrast, sleep spindles exhibited similar temporal characteristics during N2 and N3. Also, despite differences in the intensity of twitching during N2 and N3, significant twitch-spindle coupling occurred in both stages. Finally, the rate of twitching was inversely related to delta power across NREM periods. These findings suggest that although twitching occurs during REM, N2, and N3 sleep at this age, its expression is compatible with some sleep components (e.g., rapid eye movements, sleep spindles) but not others (e.g., cortical delta), highlighting the continuing need to better understand the dynamic organization of sleep and its individual components in early development.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Crucial components of such data in kingdom Plantae comprise of metabolomes - the vast array of compounds produced by plants; traits - measurable characteristics of plants that influence their growth, survival, and reproduction, and that affect ecosystem processes; and biotic interactions - relationships of plants with other living organisms, affecting the ecosystem functions.\n\nResultsIn this work, we present METRIN-KG (MEtabolomes, TRaits, and INteractions-Knowledge Graph) a powerful data structure simplifying the integration of diverse and heterogeneous data resources such as plant metabolomes, traits and biotic interactions.\n\nConclusionsThe proposed knowledge graph provides an interface to interactively search for data relating plant metabolomes, traits and interactions.

We recently characterized a phenomenon, which we termed n-Phosphate collaborations (nP-collabs), where bulk cations form stable bridges between several phosphoresidues in all-atom molecular dynamic simulations. nP-collabs were found to be sensitive to the combination of forcefields and cation types. Here, we attempt to assess the physical relevance of these nP-collabs by evaluating the strength of the cation/phosphate interaction through osmotic coefficient ({phi}) calculations on the model [Formula] and [Formula] salts, using different classical forcefields for phosphorylations. All force-fields were found to overestimate the strength of the interaction to various degrees. We thus designed new parameters for CHARMM36m and AmberFF99SB-ILDN using the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC) approach, which provide remarkable agreement for{phi} values for both cation types and over a range of concentrations. We provide a preliminary test of these ECC parameters for phosphorylations by simulating the sevenfold-phosphorylated rhodopsin peptide 7PP and comparing secondary chemical shifts to experimental data. Conformational ensembles resulting from the ECC-derived phosphorylated forcefields display both qualitative and quantitative improvements with regard to full-charge forcefields. We thus conclude that long-lasting nP-collabs are artifacts for classical forcefields born from the lack of explicit polarization, and propose a possible computational strategy for the extensive parameterization of phosphorylations. The presence of long-lived nP-collabs in simulations produced using classical forcefields is therefore a serious concern for the accurate modelling of multiphosphorylated peptides and IDPs, which are at the center of research questions regarding neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

First, we first identified epigenomic regions enriched in histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) across left and right atria from patients and controls, and associated them with differentially expressed genes to derive a set of dysregulated candidate loci, including NPPB and SCX. Second, by incorporating an independent replication cohort, we were able to validate gene expression and epigenomic differences for a subset of these candidate loci. Third, we profiled base-resolution DNA methylation levels and identified differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm samples. Integration of these data with histone modification levels and gene expression allowed us to propose epigenetic mechanisms underlying transcriptomic and epigenomic changes across dysregulated loci, such as disruption of transcription factor binding by DNA methylation at the LRRC4B locus.

Whether homologous RRAS/RRAS2 mutations are oncogenic and actionable drivers in lung cancer remains underexplored. Methods: An institutional cohort of 8,488 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) sequenced by comprehensive targeted DNA sequencing (MSK-IMPACT) between 2016-2024 was evaluated for RRAS/RRAS2 mutations. RRASQ87L or RRAS2Q72L were modeled in murine IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and immortalized human bronchiolar epithelial cells (HBECs). The oncogenic potential, signaling characteristics, and sensitivity to PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors, including the novel pan-RAS inhibitor RMC-6236, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: RRASQ87L or RRAS2Q72L, homologous to KRAS-codon Q61 substitutions, were found in ~0.45% of NSCLCs (38/8,488), with all but two lacking other MAPK pathway oncogenic drivers. RRASQ87L and RRAS2Q72L mutations transformed Ba/F3 and HBEC cells and robustly activated MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathway signaling. RMC-6236 suppressed proliferation of RRASQ87L and RRAS2Q72L mutant cell lines, reduced ERK phosphorylation, induced apoptosis, and impeded cell-cycle progression. In vivo, RMC-6236 significantly inhibited growth of RRASQ87L/RRAS2Q72L-mutant HBEC-derived xenografts. Conclusions: RRASQ87L and RRAS2Q72L are recurrent, oncogenic, and potentially actionable drivers in NSCLC.

Current consensus defines the body schema as the brain's internal representation of the body configuration in space used for both embodied perception and voluntary action. Despite extensive research, how the cortex efficiently encodes the vast repertoire of body postures to support natural behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the representational format underlying the body schema by combining large-scale electrophysiological recordings with full-body 3D tracking and joint angle computation in freely behaving mice. Across cortical regions, neurons encoded diverse postural features in distinct reference frames: posterior parietal cortex (PPC) populations preferentially encoded body midline-referenced features, while sensorimotor cortices utilized a gravity-referenced frame. Strikingly, during performance of different stereotyped actions, distinct cortical ensembles were selectively activated. These action ensembles fired in phase-locked sequences that tiled the full action cycle, providing a neural substrate for action awareness. A network model recapitulated these dynamics and identified low-dimensional action subspaces within population activity. Together, these findings reveal that the cortex organizes the body schema around actions, compressing high-dimensional kinematics into an efficient, body-midline- and gravity-anchored, action-aware neural code.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate. In murine and human organotypic brain slices, hypoxia led to a marked increase in HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Using neuronal cell lines and primary cortical neurons we show that HIF1 activation through HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings, replicating the effect of the OGD/R model.

They often exhibit prolonged persistence upon antibiotic treatment, even when they impose substantial burden on their hosts. This persistence has been primarily attributed to rapid horizontal transfer or low plasmid cost. However, these mechanisms cannot account for the slow decay of burdensome plasmids with poor mobility. Here, we show that the decoupling of time scales between slow segregation loss and fast growth competition leads to a slow-down in plasmid abundance decay at high initial plasmid abundance, reminiscent of the ghost effect from nonlinear dynamical systems. Integrating theory, simulations, and quantitative experiments across clonal populations and multi-species bacterial communities, we demonstrate that a transient antibiotic pulse can eliminate plasmid-free cells and create a ghost state that extends plasmid persistence from days to months. Our research reveals a generalizable mechanism for the prolonged ecological memory of antibiotic exposure and underscores the need for proactive strategies to curb the spread of AMR.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Spatial Attention and Session Day Independently Modulate Human Visual Cortical Plasticity", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.31.685945", "authors": "Limon, P. N.; Norcia, A. M.; Ash, R. T.", "abstract": "Stimulus-specific response potentiation (SSRP) is a non-invasive form of cortical neuroplasticity that can be induced through repeated presentation of high-contrast visual stimuli. Classically, SSRP, like long-term potentiation and related plasticity mechanisms, has been hypothesized to demonstrate input specificity, such that potentiation is confined to the neural populations and synapses driven by the induction stimulus. In addition, SSRP is observed to accumulate across days in rodent models. Despite growing interest in this phenomenon, it remains unclear whether factors such as selective attention influence the magnitude or specificity of a potentiated response. This study investigated whether covert endogenous attention could modulate the strength of SSRP in high-density EEG recordings from neurotypical human participants. An established SSRP paradigm was modified to include an attention task during induction. Pre-post response amplitudes were measured with frequency-tagged (6 and 7.5 reversals-per-second) bilateral hemifield contrast-sweep checkerboard steady-state visual-evoked potential stimuli. The 10-minute high-contrast 2 Hz sign-reversing SSRP induction stimulus was presented only in the left hemifield, with the right hemifield serving as a control. On two different experimental days, each participant deployed attention either toward or away from the potentiated hemifield during induction. Response amplitudes increased after SSRP, with increases in response amplitude manifesting in both the potentiated and control non-potentiated hemifields, weighing against the idea that SSRP is input-specific. Interestingly, significantly more response potentiation observed on the second session day compared to the first, independent of attention condition. Finally, we observed that attention enhanced SSRP in naive but not experienced observers (i.e. on Session-Day 1 but not Session-Day 2), identifying a significant interaction between attention condition and session day. Overall our results suggest that (1) SSRP in humans may not in fact be stimulus-specific (potentiation effects are not input- or retinotopically- specific), (2) visual spatial attention has a modest enhancing effect on SSRP in first-session participants, and (3) a second session of SSRP leads to a pronounced plasticity effect compared to the first session that occludes any attentional modulation.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.; Pohlschroder, M.", "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) enables microorganisms--including bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses--to coordinate collective behaviors in response to population density. Despite their ecological and evolutionary significance, QS mechanisms in Archaea remain poorly characterized. The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii provides a model for archaeal QS, transitioning from motile rods to non-motile disks in a density-dependent response to a secreted disk-forming signal (DFS). To identify components of the DFS regulatory network, we screened for spontaneous mutants that retained motility in DFS-containing soft-agar medium. One candidate, HVO_1357, encodes a predicted response regulator located adjacent to a histidine kinase (HVO_1356) and a second response regulator (HVO_1358), consistent with an extended two-component regulatory system (TCS). Based on our results, these genes encode quorum-sensing associated regulators (Qar), therefore, we propose rename them qarA (HVO_1357), qarB (HVO_1356), and qarC (HVO_1358). Deletion of qarA enabled cells to swim on DFS-containing soft-agar plates and conferred hypermotility on standard soft-agar media; however, these phenotypes were not due to changes in motility-related parameters, but a reduced sensitivity to DFS for induction of the non-motile, disk-shaped state. In contrast, {Delta}qarB and {Delta}qarC strains were non-motile and exhibited premature disk formation during normal growth. Suppressor mutations that restored motility to {Delta}qarB and {Delta}qarC mapped exclusively to qarA, suggesting QarA is the central regulator of this system. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that qarA deletion leads to upregulation of genes involved in motility and rod-shape formation. Together, these findings reveal qarABC as a DFS-responsive regulatory module and represent the first TCS in archaea shown to control QS-dependent behavior.\n\nIMPORTANCEArchaea are ubiquitous and play key roles across diverse ecosystems--including human microbiomes--yet little is known about how they communicate with one another and with other organisms, or how these interactions shape their ecological impact. Such intercellular communication, including quorum sensing (QS), allows microorganisms to coordinate behaviors critical for survival, adaptation, and community organization. In this study, we identify the first archaeal two-component regulatory system that is involved in QS-dependent regulation, providing a foundation for understanding how organisms in this domain sense and respond to population cues.

However, even in the well-studied sensorimotor system, inconsistencies remain concerning betas differential role in maintaining and terminating movement. Emerging evidence suggests that beta comprises two frequency ranges, a lower (<20 Hz) and a higher (>20 Hz) subrange. Moreover, beta occurs in transient  events which correlate with perception and action. We here use human whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and a Hidden Markov Model based analysis approach to discover whole-brain beta-band activity during rest and a naturalistic motor task in a data-driven manner. We successfully delineate two anatomically and functionally distinct beta band components which coexist throughout the neocortex. Low-beta (<20 Hz) events are very rare, high amplitude events, whereas high-beta (>20 Hz) is common but lower in amplitude. Both bands show state-specific anatomical distribution and modulation during a motor task: Low-beta is entirely absent during movement, whereas high-beta is only partially suppressed and reoccurs during postural maintenance. During post-movement beta rebound, low-beta event probability increases threefold, accompanied by strong low-beta event synchronization. A third state, probably corresponding to gamma activity, is active during task execution. Beta rebound occurs via a directed, sequential shift from gamma/active state via high-beta state to low-beta state. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for the coexistence of two functionally and anatomically distinct beta bands, and provide insights into their role in movement initiation, maintenance, and termination.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brain's entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals' groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatio-temporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence. Our results support the theory that the perception of groove is rooted in the brain's ability to entrain to ongoing dynamic temporal structures of music in the theta band. They further show that multivariate decoding models can be leveraged to predict subjective groove online from neural entrainment with high accuracy and temporal resolution. Summary - While participants (n = 30) rated their subjective groove perception of 9 popular songs and 12 MIDI clapping rhythms, we measured how their brains entrained to these musical stimuli using stimulus-brain coherence (SBC) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measures. - Both stimulus types strongly entrained delta-theta (1-7 Hz) oscillations. In univariate analyses, also both stimulus types at fronto-central, beat-related frequencies significantly predicted groove ratings. - Multivariate decoding using EEG entrainment patterns predicted individual groove ratings far better (up to Pearson r = 0.8), with combined ITPC patterns providing the most information.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity.

However, the splicing landscape of NRXN1 across distinct human brain cell types remains poorly defined. Because NRXN1 expression level is relatively low in adult brains and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons, single-cell Iso-seq RNA sequencing often provides insufficient coverage to capture its full isoform diversity, particularly across heterogeneous cell populations. To address this gap, we developed an integrative sequencing strategy that combines single-cell transcriptomics, targeted enrichment of NRXN1 transcripts, and long-read sequencing. This approach reveals a comprehensive catalog of cell-type resolved NRXN1 isoforms across adult and fetal human postmortem brains as well as hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. From the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) region, our analyses reveal distinct splicing programs across interneuron subtypes, pyramidal neurons, and glial lineages. Comparisons between prenatal and adult brains indicate that NRXN1 isoform profiles are established during early development and remain stable throughout neuronal maturation. In hiPSC organoid models, splicing profiles partially mirror both developmental and mature brain patterns, with a subset of splice sites exhibiting cell type - and stage-specific divergence. In the cerebellum of an autism case and in organoids derived from schizophrenia patients, carrying non-recurrent heterozygous NRXN1 deletions, we identify disrupted isoform expression and mutant NRXN1 isoforms and characterize their distribution across diverse cell types. These findings help understand the complex alternative splicing of NRXN1 in adult human brain and hiPSC-derived models and establish a framework for decoding cell type-specific isoform diversity for important genes with relatively low gene expression levels.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

If so, cerebellar rhythms should modulate their influence on movement depending on cue predictability. To test this, we used optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), which enables high-quality, movement-tolerant recordings of the brain with dense cerebellar coverage. Six participants performed an auditory-paced finger flexion-extension task at approximately 1 Hz with either regular or irregular cue timing to vary predictability. All participants exhibited clear 4-10 Hz intermittencies in their kinematics, synchronized to neural activity in the cerebellum and the posterior parietal cortex. Our connectivity analysis revealed for the first time, that cerebellar activity at this frequency, predominantly reflects sensory feedback, but during regular, predictable cueing, the cerebellum shifts to exert a greater feedforward influence on movement. Moreover, cerebellar oscillations were most persistently phase-aligned with motor intermittent rhythms during accurately timed actions, an effect that was absent under irregular cueing. These findings support the idea that the cerebellum implements an oscillatory forward model for motor timing and provide novel evidence for its ability to adjusting its role in coordinating sensorimotor integration according to sensory predictability. Motor intermittencies may thus represent the output of a cerebellar timing process that underpins precise voluntary action.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) regulates various social behaviors and is being used in clinical trials to improve social competency. However, the role of OXT in juvenile social play is largely unknown. To address this gap, we determined the involvement of hypothalamic OXT-producing neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), PVNOXT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and OXT signaling within the NAc, in the regulation of social play in juvenile male and female rats. We found that neither chemogenetic stimulation of SONOXT cell bodies nor PVNOXT projections to the NAc altered the expression of juvenile social play but instead increased social investigation. However, chemogenetic stimulation of PVNOXT cell bodies as well as intra-NAc infusion of OXT decreased social play in males without an effect in females. Lastly, social play duration correlated negatively with the proportion of activated NAcOXTR neurons, an effect driven by males. Together, these findings suggest that distinct OXT neuronal populations modulate different forms of social behavior and that PVNOXT neurons and NAc-OXT signaling sex-specifically modulate social play behavior.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "The role of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent gain control in auditory enhancement (AE) was investigated using a subcortical auditory model. AE refers to the influence of a precursor on detectability of targets. The absence (or presence) of a precursor component at the target frequency enhances (or suppresses) detection under simultaneous masking conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced target under simultaneous masking acts as a stronger forward masker for a delayed probe tone, known as AE under forward masking. Psychoacoustic studies of AE report findings that challenge conventional expectations, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, listeners with hearing impairment have AE under simultaneous masking but not forward masking (Kreft et al., 2018; Kreft and Oxenham, 2019), whereas listeners with normal hearing have level-dependent AE under forward masking (Kreft and Oxenham, 2019). Our model with MOC efferent gain control successfully replicated these findings. In contrast, a model without efferent gain control failed to capture these effects, supporting the hypothesis that MOC-mediated cochlear gain modulation may play a role in AE and its alteration by hearing loss.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We present a topologically organized spiking model of macaque BG with cortico-striatal inputs organized into competing channels, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), three-factor DA-modulated STDP for cortical synapses, asymmetric intra-striatal collaterals, and partially overlapping direct/indirect pathways. We validate resting activity and action selection, then study conditioning and generalization-discrimination learning using DA bursts (CS+) and dips (CS).\n\nTwo structural determinants emerged. First, pathway overlap ({lambda}) trades off selection efficiency and learning speed: higher overlap degrades GPi-based selection efficiency during conditioning, yet accelerates convergence during discrimination by strengthening D2 influence on GPi. Second, lateral inhibition from MSN-D2 to MSNs ({kappa}) helps constrain competing actions but is not sufficient alone; robust discrimination requires DA-dip-dependent up-modulation of D2 collateral efficacy (), which speeds and, at low overlap, enables convergence.\n\nSimulations under Parkinsonian and schizophrenia-like settings showed different deficits. A hypodopaminergic \"Parkinsonian\" STDP regime (D1 LTP loss, D2 LTD loss) impaired conditioning and failed to enhance discrimination. In contrast, attenuated D2 plasticity during DA dips (modeling methamphetamine-induced changes/schizophrenia-related dysregulation) selectively disrupted discrimination while sparing conditioning.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate efficient scaling on the Fugaku supercomputer to rodent and non-human primate-relevant sizes, supporting large-scale, biologically grounded BG simulations.

Adverse experiences early in life can increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, likely through alterations to this circuitry.

In this study, we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm as a translationally relevant model of early life adversity in genetically-identical C57BL/6J mice. After LBN-rearing, we assess the lasting behavioral and neurobiological impacts of this experience in adulthood. In robust sample sizes, our results validated previous findings of increased risk avoidance, enhanced acute response to alcohol, and greater voluntary alcohol drinking in socially-housed LBN-reared mice, especially males. Further, using autoradiography, we found LBN-reared mice had increased striatal D1-like receptor binding, skewing D1-to D2-like receptor balance relative to cross-fostered controls. However, after voluntary alcohol drinking, we found a strong downregulation in D1-like, and some D2-like, receptor binding, negating pre-existing differences in striatal dopamine receptor binding. We posit that via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, LBN-rearing upregulates striatal D1-receptor density and alters risk avoidance and acute alcohol stimulation to promote alcohol drinking among adversity-exposed mice.

Olive (Olea europaea), a non-climacteric fruit, requires high concentrations of ethylene-releasing compounds to reduce fruit removal force (FRF) for mechanical harvest. To elucidate mechanisms of fruit abscission zone (FAZ) development in olive, we integrated physiological, transcriptomic, and cellular analyses during natural maturation and after ethephon treatment. Olive fruits emitted low ethylene at color transition, coinciding with declining FRF, and application of 1500 ppm ethephon reduced FRF after one week. Transcriptome analyses of FAZ tissues, using a mesocarp-subtraction strategy to isolate FAZ-specific responses, identified 733 FAZ-specific genes shared between natural maturation and ethephon treatments, including genes of {beta}-1,3-glucanases, pectate lyases, and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Microscopy revealed lignification and alkalization of FAZ, accompanied by reduced low-methylesterified homogalacturonan and non-fucosylated xyloglucan. Increased glucanase activity and reduction in plasmodesmata callose likely facilitate cellular communication during abscission. Further, this study provides the first evidence of FAZ alkalization and implicates transporter upregulation in pH regulation preceding abscission. Our findings advance understanding of abscission biology in non-climacteric fruits and delineate conserved features of FAZ development.\n\nSummary StatementIntegrated physiological, transcriptomic, and cellular analyses reveal that fruit abscission zone development in olive involves lignification, alkalization, and coordinated cell wall remodeling, identifying {beta}-1,3-glucanases, pH-regulating transporters, and pectate lyases that facilitate cell separation in a non-climacteric fruit.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Location. Global. Methods. Using a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis, we prioritized areas based on: (a) ecosystem service value; (b) floristic value threatened by climate or land-use change; and (c) uncertainty in species richness estimates, stratified by biome and region. Regional prioritization maps for Africa & Madagascar; East, South and Southeast Asia; Siberia and the Russian Far East; South America; and North & Central America were reviewed by botanical experts for validation. Scalability was assessed by comparing regional and global analyses. Results. Data-driven priority maps, divided into tree-dominated and grassland/deforested areas, largely received expert support. High similarity between global and regional maps demonstrated scalability. Main conclusions. Our approach provides a framework for supporting national implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework. Variables and their weights can be tailored to national or local needs. The method's flexibility and adaptability extend to other taxonomic groups and objectives, such as protected area selection.

Ophiostoma clavatum Math.-Kaarik is the most frequently reported fungal associate, yet its occurrence had not been documented in Ukraine. While ophiostomatoid fungi are well studied in pine pathogenesis, the role of fast-growing associates such as Fusarium spp., remains poorly understood. This study aimed to identify the dominant Ophiostoma and Fusarium species associated with I. acuminatus in western Ukraine and to evaluate their pathogenicity on pine seedlings. Isolates from beetle abdomens and blue-stained wood were identified as O. clavatum based on morphology and molecular markers (ITS, TUB, TEF1-). Pathogenicity tests showed that O. clavatum acts as a weak phytopathogen. The dominant Fusarium morphotype from blue-stained wood was identified as Fusarium verticillioides (Sac) Nirenberg, which induced necrosis and tissue maceration on pine seedlings. In dual culture, F. verticillioides displayed strong competitive dominance over O. clavatum. This study provides the first record of O. clavatum associated with I. acuminatus in Ukraine, extending its known European distribution. The observed pathogenicity and competitive ability of F. verticillioides suggest it may contribute to Scots pine decline, warranting further investigation.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

This limited success likely reflects our incomplete understanding of hierarchical transcriptional programmes guiding cardiomyocyte specification. Here, we modelled cardiomyocyte differentiation aiming to uncover gene regulatory networks (GRNs) guiding early human ventricular cardiomyocyte development. Our study focused on defining how inhibition of WNT signalling remodels the transcriptional landscape underlying human cardiomyocyte differentiation, since both in vivo cardiac development and in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols require WNT inhibition. Methods: We modelled left ventricular cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells and experimentally manipulated WNT signalling to uncover transcriptional responses using single-cell RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis defined cell identities, reconstructed differentiation trajectories, and inferred WNT inhibition-dependent gene expression and regulatory networks driving cardiomyocyte specification. Results: We found that WNT inhibition (WNTi) decisively redirects mesoderm cells towards a cardiomyocyte progenitor fate, expanding their numbers while limiting alternative trajectories. GRN inference revealed both WNTi-dependent and -independent programmes and a hierarchical cascade of transcription factors driving the mesoderm-to-cardiomyocyte progenitor transition. Notably, MEIS2 emerged as a central WNTi-independent regulator, while WNTi-responsive networks featured early (ISL1, PBX3, TBX5 and KLF1) and late (MEF2-related genes, GATA-related genes, PBX1, CREM, FOXP1 and NKX3-1) factors. Mesodermal GRNs were primed for cardiomyocyte specification in WNTi-treated cultures but, in the absence of WNTi, mesodermal GRNs remained ambiguous, activating ISL1 and PBX3 but failing to establish cardiomyocyte commitment and subsequent differentiation into contractile cells. Conclusion: This work provides the first comprehensive dissection of WNTi-dependent and -independent regulatory hierarchies guiding human ventricular cardiomyocyte specification and highlights new transcriptional players which could improve cardiac reprogramming efficiency and fidelity.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

It has been widely prescribed to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions for decades, but its molecular mode of action in the brain is not fully known. Moreover, prenatal exposure to this drug is linked to developmental anomalies, cognitive deficits, and an increased risk of autism. To determine VPA's effect on the nervous system without requiring systemic drug application and inducing toxic effects, we exploited the well-characterized chemotaxis behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans are attracted to VPA, and this behavior is missing in animals lacking the tax-4 ion channel and the tax-4-expressing AWC chemosensory neurons. To test the idea that VPA directly activates the AWC neurons, we performed calcium imaging studies in a line expressing GCaMP6s in all amphid chemosensory neurons in the head. We found that VPA evoked calcium transients consistently in the AWC neurons and variably in AWB and ASH. As cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the active state of tax-4 increases upon the binding of cGMP. Within the worm's chemosensory nervous system, receptor guanylate cyclases (rGCs) facilitate the synthesis of cGMP and serve as chemoreceptors for various chemical cues. By performing chemotaxis assays and calcium imaging experiments with rGC mutants against VPA, we found that odr-1 and gcy-28 are essential for mediating VPA attraction, as their absence disrupts both behavior and control AWC calcium transients. However, given their broad use in chemosensation, odr-1 and gcy-28 most likely act as downstream effectors rather than as direct targets. These findings compelled us to investigate whether chemoreceptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family contribute to VPA sensing. We approached this hypothesis by conducting chemotaxis assays with G mutants and identified several (odr-3, egl-30, gpa-2;gpa-3) whose absence leads to a loss of VPA attraction. Thus, future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which GPCRs contribute to VPA sensing and cGMP signaling.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

However, the cellular dynamics bridging gastrulation and organogenesis remain elusive due to observational challenges. We developed a live-cell imaging platform for transgenic zebrafish that provides, for the first time, a continuous reconstruction of early neurogenesis across subcellular to organismal scales. Our analysis reveals that neurogenesis is a precisely orchestrated process. Neuronal cell bodies initially coalesce into discrete, linearly arranged clusters extending from the brain along the spinal cord. From these hubs, axons radiate outward to innervate the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the yolk sac surface. A primary pioneer neuron projects from the brain, coursing ventrally in parallel to the body axis. Secondary neurons then interconnect, forming a pervasive network that is subsequently refined through selective axonal apoptosis. The emergence of frequent Ca2+ flashes only after structural maturation indicates that functionality is contingent upon an established scaffold. We also observe concurrent material transport and a slow, directional flow of Ca2+ along axons, suggesting complementary signaling modalities. Furthermore, neurogenesis exhibits precise spatiotemporal coupling with histogenesis, particularly with the developing lateral line and vasculature. Our work, with refined spatial and time resolution, defines the kinetic pathway of early neurogenesis and underscores the critical interplay of subsystems in embryogenesis, offering fundamental insights for neural health and bio-inspired intelligence.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Relationships of activations with measures of sleep quality and physiology were examined. Between-group comparisons and whole-sample correlation with sleep parameters were examined in relation to large-scale brain networks using a liberal cluster-determining threshold. Localized activations were then identified using familywise error correction. Activations to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) that increased from the beginning to end (across) threat conditioning were more extensive within the GAD+ID group. Increased activations to the CS+ across extinction learning were greater within the GAD-ID than the GAD+ID group, and delayed 24h in the latter. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with decreased activations across threat conditioning, but with increased activations across extinction learning. Better sleep quality promoted greater engagement of neural substrates of extinction learning.

The Notch signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell communication processes ranging from animal development to cancer, is activated by mechanical forces generated by cell-cell interactions. The mechanosensing element of Notch is thought to be a 300 amino acid extracellular domain called negative regulatory region (NRR). Ligand binding exerts mechanical forces that are believed to partially unfold NRR, rendering it susceptible to cleavage by extracellular metalloproteases that leads to activation of signaling. However, some engineered notch-like receptors lacking the NRR can be activated upon ligand binding, although the mechanisms underlying this activation are not known. Here we observe that Notch molecules without the NRR, but with a 12 amino acid sequence present in the extracellular juxta-transmembrane domain (eJTMD) are also cleaved and activated upon interaction with their ligands in cultured cells and in transgenic animals. Furthermore, the ~12 aa eJTMD from notch genes from other species (chicken, xenopus, zebrafish and Drosophila), from other unrelated transmembrane proteins (erbB4, N-CAM, and E-Cadherin), or multiple artificial sequences of ~12 amino acids without any apparent structure or specific sequence can also convert proteins into ligand-dependent mechanosensors.

The plant hormone Gibberellic acid (GA), a central regulator of growth also has an impact on MT arrangements, however the causal relationship between these processes and underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here, examining the Arabidopsis thaliana root elongation zone, we show that MT reorientation occurs as a consequence of GA-induced cell elongation and that GA has also a direct effect on the rate of MT polymerization via a non-transcriptional mechanism. Preventing cell elongation blocked GA-induced MT reorganization, whereas GA still promoted elongation in the absence of intact MTs. On the other hand, GA promoted MT dynamics as revealed by the recovery of MTs following depolymerization or photobleaching. Live imaging revealed that GA directly promotes MT polymerization at their plus ends. This GA effect persists even when transcription or translation are inhibited, but still requires the DELLA canonical components of GA signalling and their interactors, the prefoldins (PFDs). Our results support a model where GA-induced DELLA degradation releases in nucleus sequestrated PFDs, enhancing their cytoplasmic function to promote MT polymerization. Hence, GA signalling branches into two mechanistically distinct modules: (i) canonical transcriptional pathway that promotes growth and indirectly drives MT reorientation; and (ii) the non-transcriptional DELLA-PFD axis that directly promotes MT polymerization. Such a dual mechanism enables plants to synchronize growth with cytoskeletal remodelling by coupling rapid, cytoplasmic responses to slower transcriptional programs.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Wave 1 mouse follicles undergo atresia in juvenile animals that amplifies thecal cells and androgen production during puberty. We identified three similar follicle waves in Drosophila by tracking >6,000 individual lineage-labeled clones from individual germline or somatic cells in developing pupal ovaries. 40 of ~100 larval primordial germ cells (PGCs) associate with forming germline stem cell (GSC) niches. After a delay of >30 hours during early pupal stages, GSCs begin division and ultimately produce cysts that ensure a lifetime supply of wave 2 eggs. Wave 1.5 follicles develop directly from many of the remaining PGCs to generate ~20 cysts and all 80 ovarian follicles present at adult eclosion. Adult-like but unstable follicle stem cells (FSCs) generate most follicle cells for wave 1.5, with a contribution from the basal stalk. Unexpectedly, a true wave 1 subpopulation arises from relatively few posterior PGCs. Drosophila wave 1 germ cells increase rapidly to 250-350 cells by dividing and then forming germline cysts. They subsequently interact with somatic swarm cells before undergoing an atresia-like process and exiting the ovary. Our results argue that production of specific ovarian follicle waves, including an initial wave that undergoes atresia during adult tissue development, has been conserved during evolution.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that replication introduces a window of genomic vulnerability in both - and {beta}-cells during neonatal growth, with -cells exhibiting higher replication rates and DNA damage. We show that neonatal {beta}-cells resolve DNA damage more efficiently during mitosis and favor error-free repair, while -cells compensate for their higher DNA damage vulnerability through increased cellular turnover. Using mouse models of overnutrition and diabetes, we show that {beta}-cells exhibit greater vulnerability to terminal DNA damage and impaired repair capacity under diabetogenic stress, with compensatory replication amplifying this vulnerability. We demonstrate that developmental epigenetic programs shape the differential DNA damage vulnerability of postnatal {beta}- and -cells.

Fixed sample analysis has revealed much about how genetic signaling cascades determine the major body axes and organize cell fate patterns into the germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. In toto live imaging of vertebrate development highlights that embryogenesis is a dynamic process that involves on the order of ten thousand cells, but hurdles related to data handling have hampered quantitative analysis. Therefore, our understanding of the rich physical aspects of multilayered tissue reconfigurations remains incomplete. Here, we reveal that modules of stationary and germ-layer-specific tissue flows shape the zebrafish gastrula. We combine in toto live imaging with tissue-specific markers and image analysis to reveal the global shape of the enveloping layer (EVL), ectoderm, and mesoderm over time. A user-friendly tissue cartography pipeline based on the Blender 3D software moves into the reference frame of individual tissue layers. We find distinct tissue flow patterns in the enveloping layer (EVL), epiblast, and mesoderm, respectively. The instantaneous tissue flow of these germ layers is organized in a temporal sequence of hours-long, constant flow patterns. This suggests that a sequence of stationary tissue flow modules transports cells to their destination during gastrulation. Mathematical decomposition suggests that ectoderm flow is strongly influenced by a superposition of rotational flow in the mesoderm, and divergent flow in the EVL. Molecular and cellular complexity notwithstanding, these results hint at surprisingly tractable physical processes that underlie vertebrate gastrulation and set the stage for investigations of how morphogens orchestrate dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Although traditionally considered a neural tube defect (NTD) alongside anencephaly and open spina bifida (myelomeningocele), encephalocele typically shows well-formed brain tissue, and is likely to represent a later-arising, post-neurulation developmental anomaly, with a different pathogenic mechanism from the open NTDs. A detailed understanding of encephalocele pathogenesis requires experimental studies and, recently, we developed a new mouse model in which the genes encoding FGF3, 4 and 15 are over-expressed in the embryonic day (E) 9.5 brain. Encephalocele subsequently develops as a broad forebrain-midbrain swelling, visible from E11.5, that resolves by birth into a focal brain herniation resembling human parieto-occipital encephalocele. A structural analysis of the brain in mutant embryos reveals absence of the posterior commissure and sub-commissural organ, and at later stages the pineal gland. These structures normally develop just rostral to the forebrain-midbrain boundary, and Pax6 immuno-histochemistry demonstrates that this boundary remains intact in the mutant embryos. Histological analysis reveals a more general change in tissue composition of the neural tube roof in the forebrain-midbrain region, with diminished thickness of the neuroepithelium and increased thickness of the overlying layer, including the non-neural ectoderm (future epidermis). We conclude that the posterior commissure and sub-commissural organ, previously implicated in hydrocephalus, may also be fundamental for development of the earlier-arising brain malformation, encephalocele.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we further investigated the timing and nature of requirement for m6A-methyltransferase (MTase) activity during human erythropoiesis, using a standardized in vitro erythroid differentiation assay for hHSPCs. We identified two critical m6A regulated developmental windows in BFU-E and during the transition from CFU-E to proerythroblasts. These windows of m6A-MTase requirement coincide with rising global m6A levels, which peak in proerythroblasts. After proerythroblast formation, however, m6A -MTase activity is dispensable for differentiation, proliferation, and survival. In BFU-E, m6A-MTase promotes proliferation but is dispensable for differentiation, while, in CFU-E, both m6A -MTase and the YTHDF family of m6A readers are essential for differentiation to proerythroblasts. Mechanistically, in CFU-E, m6A -MTase activity enhances translation of ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, thereby elevating global protein synthesis rates and enabling efficient erythroblast formation.

In this study, the commercial dye Acridine Orange (AO) was found to be suitable for long-term staining and live imaging of the cnidarian model Nematostella vectensis. Temporary incubation in media containing AO resulted in broad cellular labeling. Individuals stained with AO as zygotes retained the dye throughout embryogenesis, metamorphosis, and for longer than three months of growth, at which point the signal became restricted to subsets of cells. In contrast, staining of zebrafish zygotes with AO resulted in signal decay within the first couple of days of development and preferential accumulation in the yolk sac. AO is retained in N. vectensis adults after amputation and inherited by new tissue during regeneration. Surprisingly, AO was not found suitable for cell tracking via microinjection, as the dye dissipated within minutes of being injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes and blastomeres. Surprisingly, the subcellular distribution of AO signal did not match the pattern expected from it use in mammalian cell lines, where green fluorescence is observed when associated with cellular DNA and red fluorescence when bound to RNA. Instead, long-lived green fluorescence was observed throughout the cell surface and/or in the cytoplasm of N. vectensis stained with AO, whereas red emission was similarly distributed but short lived.

The activity of single hippocampal neurons is correlated with numerous perceptual features and task variables, raising the question of whether these response properties reflect distinct mechanisms or a single generalized computation. Here, we show that diverse hippocampal responses reflect unified event-driven dynamics in which population activity transitions between discrete ensemble states at behaviorally salient events. Recording from monkeys performing a virtual spatial alternation task, we found that population activity did not evolve smoothly over time but instead transitioned abruptly at each relevant event. These discontinuities segmented activity into distinct ensemble codes, effectively chunking conceptually defined task epochs. Notably, many neuronal responses persisted across visually distinct environments, demonstrating that these dynamics reflect abstract task structure rather than specific sensory features. These results reveal that the hippocampus constructs a temporal scaffold anchored to relevant behavioral events, with each neural state tracking a distinct task phase. This organizational principle may explain the diverse correlates observed across studies: rather than individually encoding task features, hippocampal neurons collectively signal which phase of a behavioral sequence is currently active. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus parses experience into meaningful elements and tracks \"position\" within a learned behavioral structure.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We combined high-resolution behavioral sequencing (Social-seq) with fiber photometry to resolve nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine during naturalistic juvenile interactions. Sex-divergent social strategies emerged: males exhibited peer play-dominant interactions with action-contingent dopamine release, while females favored environmental exploration with attenuated social dopamine. Shank3-deficient juveniles exhibited a triad of dopaminergic dysregulation-blunted signaling during social investigation, pathological inversion during active play, and hyper-responsive to non-social stimuli-recapitulating ASD-like phenotypes. Closed-loop activation of dopamine during play rescued social deficits, establishing a causal link between phasic dopaminergic signaling and social motivation. These findings identify NAc dopamine as a dynamic encoder of social valence and suggest that temporally precise modulation of dopaminergic circuits may offer therapeutic leverage for ASD-related social impairments.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

C.; Sarkar, P.; Thompson, L. M.", "abstract": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a conserved RNA and DNA binding protein that functions in transcriptional repression, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA stabilization. Under pathological conditions found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 shows aberrant mislocalization from the nucleus and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation. TDP-43 also appears to play a role in DNA damage repair, specifically in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), suggesting that nuclear depletion of TDP-43 may contribute towards the accumulation of DNA damage observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These TDP-43 pathological inclusions are decorated with post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation. SUMOylation (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) is a dynamic post-translational modification that regulates many protein properties and is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology. DNA damage repair proteins are commonly regulated through SUMOylation, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for efficient DNA repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Given these findings, we investigated TDP-43 SUMOylation and whether SUMO modification impacts TDP-43s DNA damage repair function. We show that TDP-43 can be modified by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 and confirm SUMOylation in response to oxidative stress. We also determine which regions of TDP-43 are SUMOylated and show that this modification is facilitated by the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4. Etoposide-induced DNA damage did not promote SUMOylation of TDP-43; studies are ongoing to determine the impact of TDP-43 SUMOylation on DNA repair.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the molecular underpinnings of the transition from alcohol exposure to alcohol dependence are not well-characterized. We used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in a preliminary discovery study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of alcohol-exposed Non-dependent (Non-dep) versus alcohol-dependent (Dep) mice that underwent the chronic intermittent ethanol (alcohol) - two-bottle choice (CIE-2BC) procedure and systemic anti-IL-6 Receptor antibody administration. CSF samples from individual mice were processed for proteomic analysis and digested with trypsin overnight. Peptides were analyzed via data-independent acquisition (DIA)-MS and data were processed in DIA-NN at 1% FDR. We identified 611 unique proteins across both groups, with 140 proteins differentially detected in CSF from Dep mice and 67 proteins specific to alcohol-exposed but Non-dep controls. The Dep-specific proteins revealed signatures of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, cellular stress responses, and complement system activation. In contrast, Non-dep-specific proteins indicated preserved protective mechanisms including complement regulation, anti-inflammatory signaling, and neuronal calcium homeostasis. Ethanol-dependent-specific findings include MMP2, BIP, and to a lesser extent VE-cadherin (CDH5) and VCAM1, indicative of the beginnings of endothelial damage and BBB disruption, alongside established neuroinflammation markers GFAP, CHI3L1, and CX3CL1. This work provides novel preliminary protein-level evidence that alcohol exposure and alcohol dependence are dichotomous; despite the small sample size and limited power for moderate effect sizes, there appears to be a clear molecular transition from maintained protective mechanisms to vascular damage, BBB breakdown, and sustained neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Proteomics-based approaches have identified MBPs in various systems but typically cannot determine the location of metal-binding sites or shed light on the functional roles of metals. Thus, a systems-wide map of metal binding sites and an understanding of the consequences of metal binding for protein function are still lacking. Here, we used limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) combined with chelator treatment to globally map metal-protein interactions and binding sites in native protein lysates. We applied the pipeline, named Metal-LiP, to Escherichia coli, identified 981 peptides on 297 proteins that exhibited dose responsiveness to chelator treatment, and quantified the relative metal-binding affinity. These proteins are strongly enriched for known or predicted MBPs, based on our novel compiled ground truth dataset of previously annotated (n=1013) and predicted (n=850) MBPs. Further, chelator-responsive peptides mapped at or near annotated metal-binding sites in 3D protein structures, showing that Metal-LiP can identify metal-binding sites, and provided novel experimental evidence for previously predicted sites. Notably, Metal-LiP identified 225 novel candidate MBPs and we validated five of these novel MBPs (GatZ, AhpC, GrxB, MsrC, TrhO) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to detect metal binding in purified proteins. Finally, we used orthogonal approaches to probe the broad functional consequences of metal binding. Using a combination of Metal-LiP, thermal proteome profiling, size-exclusion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and structural analyses, we identified cases where metal binding affects protein stability, modulates the assembly states of protein complexes, or is likely to affect enzymatic activity. We thereby propose functional roles for metal binding in 98 of our Metal-LiP hits and in 225 proteins in total. In summary, we describe an approach to identify bona fide MBPs with binding site-level resolution across the proteome. We have combined it with other methods to identify 424 candidate MBPs in the E coli proteome, to map known and novel candidate metal-binding sites for 297 of these proteins, and to suggest functional roles of metal binding.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Despite multimodal therapy, treatment options for relapsed or refractory RMS remain limited, highlighting the need for new therapeutic targets. The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains cellular proteostasis under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) axis serving as a key regulatory branch. While aberrant IRE1/XBP1 signaling has been implicated in several cancers, its role in RMS is unknown. Here, we show that the IRE1/XBP1 pathway is highly activated in both embryonal and alveolar RMS cell lines, as well as in patient tumor specimens. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of IRE1/XBP1pathway suppresses cell proliferation, enhances chemosensitivity, and promotes terminal differentiation in RMS cells. Moreover, IRE1/XBP1 inhibition reduces the cancer stem cell population and suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype. The IRE1/XBP1 signaling drives RMS progression through XBP1-mediated upregulation of BMPR1A, leading to the activation of BMP-Smad1 signaling. In addition, inducible knockdown of XBP1 significantly attenuates RMS tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Similarly, inhibition of IRE1 activity using a small molecule reduces RMS xenograft growth in mice. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the IRE1/XBP1 axis is a key regulator of RMS growth and differentiation and highlights that this pathway can be a promising therapeutic target for treatment of patients with RMS.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate the analgesic actions of PDX in a mouse model of tibial fracture-induced postoperative pain (fPOP) via activation of GPR37. Intravenous early-phase and late-phase treatment of PDX (100 ng/mouse) effectively alleviated fPOP. Compared to protectin D1/neuroprotectin D1, DHA, steroid, and meloxicam, PDX produced superior pain relief. While dexamethasone and meloxicam prolonged fPOP, PDX shortened the pain duration. The analgesic effects of PDX were abrogated in Gpr37 knockout mice, which displayed deficits in fPOP resolution. PDX binds GPR37 and induces calcium responses in peritoneal macrophages. LC-MS-MS-based lipidomic analysis revealed that endogenous PDX levels were ~10-fold higher than PD1 in muscle at the fracture site. PDX promotes macrophage polarization via GPR37-dependent phagocytosis and efferocytosis through calcium signaling in vitro, and it further enhances macrophage viability and efferocytosis in vivo via GPR37. Finally, PDX rapidly modulates nociceptor neuron responses by suppressing C-fiber-induced muscle reflex in vivo and calcium responses in DRG neurons ex vivo and reducing TRPA1/TRPV1-induced acute pain and neurogenic inflammation in vivo.

Progressive cognitive decline is a key clinical manifestation of JNCL, and no definitive treatment is currently available. The precise function of CLN3 in neurons remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted therapies. Using patch-clamp and AAV-mediated re-expression of CLN3 in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice, we demonstrate that CLN3 is essential for synaptic function. Loss of CLN3 caused defective synaptic vesicle release and reduced synaptic strength reflecting impairments in both pre- and postsynaptic function in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice before the occurrence of neurodegeneration. Moreover, we observed reduced network bursting and deficits in intrinsic neuronal excitability, indicating early functional disturbances independent of storage burden and neuronal death in CLN3-deficient mice. To assess whether CLN3 is required for proper pre- and postsynaptic function, we re-expressed CLN3 selectively in pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We found non-redundant requirements at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to sustain function. Importantly, AAV9-mediated gene rescue at early-disease stages corrected preexisting synaptic defects and restored function. Together, these findings demonstrate the requirement of CLN3 in maintaining synaptic function and show that the therapeutic window may extend to stages characterized by early functional deficits, highlighting the potential of targeted gene therapy to restore function and improve cognitive outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We compared recall of associative memory in different contexts, and found that memory is also consolidated during wakefulness, although in a qualitatively distinct way. Healthy participants performed a cued stimulus-response (S-R) learning task requiring speeded object classification. Learning was followed by 2 hours of sleep or wakefulness. Reaction times revealed stronger S-R memory after sleep than wakefulness with retrieval in the same context, and this benefit was linked to increased sleep spindle activity. In contrast, S-R memory was stronger after wakefulness than sleep when tested in a different context. This wake-dependent enhancement had a fast onset and was reversed by delayed sleep. We conclude that, unlike sleep strengthening the binding of an event with its context, wakefulness stabilizes event representations itself, i.e., not bound to a specific context.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

The most important bacterial diseases of banana include Moko and banana blood disease (BBD), caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia syzygii subsp. celebesensis, respectively, and banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum. Effective surveillance and disease management require point-of-care diagnostics, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), for on-site operation. In this study, three LAMP assays were developed to specifically detect the bacteria responsible for Moko, BBD and BXW, directly from banana tissues, using a simplified DNA extraction protocol. The BBD - and BXW-LAMP assays demonstrated 100% specificity, yielding negative results for a broad range of non-target bacteria, including closely related species as well as pathogenic and endophytic strains associated with banana, and positive results for all the tested target strains. For Moko disease, a duplex-LAMP assay was developed to detect all strains from the four globally most relevant sequevars: IIB-3, IIB-4, IIA-6, and IIA-24. The duplex-LAMP successfully detected all target strains, except one that was shown to be non-pathogenic to Cavendish bananas. All non-target strains tested negative, with the exception of a delayed signal for one strain belonging to Ralstonia thomasi, not associated with banana environment (hospital strain). These results were supported by an extensive in silico analysis conducted on 9,668 Burkholderiaceae and 7,483 Xanthomonadaceae genomes. Detection limits ranged from 0.1 pg/{micro}l to 1 pg/{micro}l DNA, and from 10? to 10? CFU/ml on banana tissues spiked with calibrated bacterial suspensions, depending on the assay. The LAMP assays prove highly effective for detecting target pathogens in both artificially inoculated banana plants and field samples, offering a promising tool for improving disease management strategies.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

To fill this gap, we used deep learning on four bulk RNA-seq datasets grouped by p53 expression and a single-cell TARGET-seq dataset classified by TP53 genotype. The bulk data revealed disruptions in chromatin regulation, DNA repair, and immune pathways, with the low-p53 state showing activation of chemokine and interleukin signaling. In the single-cell data, deep learning classifiers successfully distinguished WT from multi-hit TP53-mutant cells, while heterozygous TP53 cells remained transcriptionally similar to WT.

We combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing of murine gliomas treated in vivo with a MIRO1-binding compound and bulk RNA sequencing of human glioma resections treated with the same compound ex vivo. Cross-species transcriptomic integration reveals a conserved MIRO1-responsive program in the TME. Among shared targets, we identify PARP11/Parp11 as a consistently upregulated gene in glioma that is downregulated following MIRO1-binding compound treatment in both human and mouse gliomas. Cell-cell communication analysis shows that a specific cluster of macrophages (MAC1), which exhibits robust Parp11 and Pdl1 (encoding PD-L1) expression, sends immunosuppressive signals to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and may receive prostaglandin E2 signals from another cluster of macrophages (MAC4). Targeting MIRO1 eliminates this cell circuitry and reduces the tumor cell population. Our data suggest MAC4 as the originating MIRO1-driven cell cluster, which relays a macrophage-to-T cell signaling axis that may contribute to immune suppression in glioma through PARP11 regulation.

Compared with conventional arrayed CRISPRa libraries that use single or dual gRNAs and often require multiple gRNA candidates per target, a recently developed CRISPRa library (termed T. gonfio) incorporates four tandem gRNAs per lentivector per target, thereby reducing library complexity and representing the smallest arrayed genome-wide CRISPRa library.

The workflow comprises three pipelines: lentiviral library transduction, cell library passaging, and assay processing. These pipelines together establish and maintain the transduced cell library for extended screening times. This enables assay processing at desired extended time points and improves the likelihood of identifying phenotypes that require longer time to develop, making the workflow suitable even for rapidly proliferating cell models.

A multi-omics approach combining RNA sequencing and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) profiled changes in gene expression, nascent protein translation, steady-state protein levels, kinase-substrate phosphorylation patterns, and MHC-I peptide presentation in GBM cells within 72 hours of TMZ exposure. This analysis revealed rapid activation of DNA damage signaling and p53-associated stress pathways, alongside dynamic changes in protein synthesis and antigen presentation. A set of TMZ treatment-associated peptide antigens (TAPAs) was identified, including peptides derived from stress response proteins, phosphorylated MHC-I peptides, and those induced by other genotoxic treatments such as radiation. Several of these peptides were also detected in recurrent GBM patient tumors. Our findings suggest that TMZ not only triggers early adaptive and potentially resistance-associated stress programs but may also enhance the immune visibility of GBM cells. These data highlight potential windows for combination therapies with TMZ that bolster immune recognition of GBM, while the systems approach provides a framework to examine how genotoxic therapies across cancers alter tumor immunogenicity.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "We demonstrate that the translation initiation factor eIF2B, best known for its guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) function in mRNA translation initiation, also acts as a potent inducer of mutant KRAS signaling. eIF2B forms a distinct complex with Son of Sevenless (SOS), the canonical GEF for RAS proteins, and KRAS in its lipid-binding-competent state, showing a pronounced preference for KRAS mutants. Within this complex, the catalytic {varepsilon}-subunit of eIF2B interacts with the allosteric RAS-binding domain of SOS, thereby enhancing mutant KRAS GTP loading and activation. The resulting eIF2B{varepsilon}:SOS:KRAS complex localizes to the plasma membrane (PM), where it amplifies downstream KRAS signaling. Although eIF2B can act as a co-GEF for SOS on RAS in vitro, in cells it functions selectively through SOS on mutant KRAS 4B, but not on KRAS 4A, HRAS, or NRAS. This specificity arises from eIF2B-mediated translational upregulation of B4GALT5 mRNA, encoding a key enzyme of glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis, which promotes PM remodeling and anchoring of mutant KRAS. Consistent with this mechanism, genetic loss of eIF2B{varepsilon} suppresses mutant KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma in mice, while elevated eIF2B expression correlates with poor prognosis in mutant KRAS cancers, establishing eIF2B as a critical mechanistic link between translational control and oncogenic KRAS signaling.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We analyze recent (2020-2025) evidence and add pathway/hallmark context, cross-platform validation, and proteome-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) inference to guide translational panel design. We reviewed extensive prospective and multi-cancer studies using Olink, SomaScan, and mass spectrometry, contrasting case-control versus prospective performance. Candidates were organized into Known and Novel sets and mapped with GeneCodis (GO/KEGG/Reactome) and Cancer Hallmarks. Clinical relevance was assessed using GEPIA 3.0 Cox forest plots and TCGA-survival Kaplan-Meier curves (median split; log-rank). Protein-level corroboration used TPCPA/RPPA Z-score distributions across tumor types. To contextualize molecular crosstalk, we incorporated in silico PPI prediction to evaluate whether candidates cluster into interaction sub-modules relevant to secretory/TGF-beta, matrix remodeling, and immune-follicular biology. Beyond classic antigens/inflammatory markers (e.g., CEACAM5, WFDC2/HE4, GDF15), the Novel set converged on a matrix-immune-secretory axis comprising ECM proteases (MMP12, ADAM8), antigen presentation/B-cell programs (CD74, CXCL13), secretory/TGF-beta signaling (TGFB1), and epithelial invasion (CDCP1). Forest plots show adverse hazards for secretory/matrix genes across multiple epithelial cancers, while immune-follicular genes exhibited context-dependent effects; TCGA-survival curves reproduced these directions. TPCPA demonstrated tumor-type-specific protein elevation, supporting detectability. PPI inference organized candidates into coherent interaction modules (e.g., TGFB1-CDCP1-protease and CXCL13-CD74 hubs), reinforcing multiplex, not single-marker, readouts. Cross-platform agreement, augmented by PPI-defined interaction modules, supports a two-bucket MCED strategy that pairs high-risk secretory/matrix markers with immune-context sensors to enhance sensitivity, tissue-of-origin interpretability, and clinical triage.

A role for transcription factor FRA2 (Fosl2) was uncovered through single nuclear multiomic approaches relating to the regulation of PEC transcriptional/chromatin dynamics. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry assessed the FRA2 protein interactome in cultured PECs, revealing a potential role for FRA2 in alternative splicing. Fosl2 expression was then blunted through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in cultured PECs, revealing reduced proliferative capacity and the down-regulation of myofibroblast markers. In-vivo genetic lineage tracing of PECs after nephrotoxic serum revealed PEC-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation events. Finally, immunostaining of human kidney biopsies with various subtypes of glomerulonephritis confirmed Fosl2 expression in crescentic lesions of activated PECs, with single cell deconvolution strategies assigning PEC-skewed proportion ratios to bulk RNA-seq patient data from the NEPTUNE consortium.

Antibody production relies on interactions between various immune cell types, and it is unknown which are affected by PFAS exposure during development. To investigate this in a human-health relevant system, an in vivo model was established to delineate effects of developmental exposure to a mixture of four PFAS commonly found in human serum: PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA. Pregnant mice consumed water containing these PFAS throughout gestation and lactation. PFAS were measured in both mothers and offspring, and an exposure that avoided overt health issues was selected. The immune response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection was assessed in male and female offspring. Results showed that developmental PFAS exposure reduced IAV-specific antibody levels in both sexes. However, it diminished T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells--critical for antibody production--in only female offspring. These findings highlight possible sex-specific immune effects and identify potential cellular mechanisms behind reduced antibody levels. Since these immune cells are essential for antibody production in humans, this study provides valuable insights into how PFAS exposure may impact human health.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Design: Single-center retrospective cohort study. Animals: Dogs with MMVD that underwent MVR from July 2022 to July 2023. After data extraction, the ten most common breeds were selected, and mixed breeds as well as breeds known for inherent platelet abnormalities (Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Norfolk Terriers) were excluded. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 313 dogs representing seven breeds met the inclusion criteria. PLT levels were assessed preoperatively (Day 0) and daily for 4 days postoperatively (Days 1-4). Mean (standard deviation) PLT values were 393{+/-}127 x103/{micro}L on Day 0, 159{+/-}72 on Day 1, 137{+/-}67 on Day 2, 157{+/-}87 on Day 3, and 187{+/-}104 on Day 4. Postoperative thrombocytopenia (<100 x103/{micro}L) occurred in 124 of 313 dogs during Days 1-4. In a multivariable mixed-effects model, PLT declined significantly after surgery (Day 0 to 1; {beta}; = -207.17 [x103/{micro}L per day], P < 0.001) and showed a postoperative upward trend (Day 1 to 4; {beta}; = 20.62 [x103/{micro}L per day], P = 0.079).

Here, we applied a single-islet proteomics workflow to profile intra-donor islet heterogeneity in three stage 1 T1D cases with matched non-diabetic controls and define in situ protein signatures of pseudo-temporal islet dysfunction. Intra-donor analyses of ~100 individual islets per donor revealed highly consistent proteomic patterns reflecting pseudo-time progression of islet immune responses and beta-cell dysfunction. Several pathways, including extracellular matrix remodeling and mRNA processing, were identified as closely associated with progressive islet immune activation and loss of beta-cell function.

Selective activation of these neurons and their projection to ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) increased nociceptive threshold via opioid receptor signaling in vlPAG.

Yet, optimizing its clinical efficacy is a major challenge, often hindered by incomplete knowledge of how stimulation parameters and targets affect neural activity and behavior. VCVS DBS is thought to work in part by improving cognitive control, an important decision-making component that is impaired in OCD and other illnesses. The magnitude of this cognitive control enhancement was shown to be lateralized, with right-unilateral stimulation being the most effective. Prior work developed a preclinical model of VCVS DBS by leveraging the cognitive control construct, which can be measured in humans and rodents and is modulated by analogous brain circuits. However, this work did not address laterality effects observed in humans or examine left/right stimulation differences. These effects may be critical for maximizing therapeutic benefit while avoiding aversive outcomes. This study aimed to investigate lateralization in the rodent model, where bilateral stimulation of the mid-striatum was previously shown to improve cognitive control. Right and left-unilateral stimulation reduced response times without changing accuracy, replicating the cognitive control improvement from bilateral stimulation. With computational modeling, we show that bilateral and unilateral stimulation modifies the same decision-making variables to drive this behavior change. We also establish that females have the same cognitive control improvement from stimulation as males. These findings increase our understanding of cognitive control circuits and strengthen the validity of the rodent model as a translational platform to study VCVS DBS's therapeutic mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Here we evaluated one such network as a starting point for a new model of human lightness perception by testing whether it was susceptible to a range of classic lightness illusions. We implemented a CNN and trained it via supervised learning to estimate surface reflectance at each pixel in grayscale, rendered images of geometric objects. We examined the network's output on several illusions, including the argyle, Koffka, snake, simultaneous contrast, White's, and checkerboard illusions, as well as control figures. We included variants where low-luminance regions important to the illusions were generated either by low reflectance or by cast shadows. For comparison, we carried out a lightness matching experiment with human observers using the same stimuli, and also examined the outputs of three classic lightness and brightness models. The CNN largely removed lighting effects such as shading and shadows, and produced good reflectance estimates on a test set. It also qualitatively predicted the illusions perceived by humans in most cases, the exceptions being White's and checkerboard illusions. The CNN outperformed classical models, both at estimating reflectance and at tracking human lightness matches.

Here, we examined gait dynamics in Wistar rats following unilateral, low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animals were assessed weekly for six weeks in the horizontal ladder test, where running velocity and footfall accuracy were quantified with markerless pose estimation using DeepLabCut (DLC). Lesioned animals exhibited greater tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-reactivity asymmetry than controls, reflected behaviorally as persistent but gradually attenuating deficits in gait precision. Errors peaked at week three and remained above baseline through week six. Velocity was preserved across groups, but sex differences emerged. Control females accelerated more steeply over time, whereas lesioned females showed attenuated gains and greater variability, while males displayed more homogeneous velocity profiles across conditions. Together, these findings indicate that partial SNc lesions reveal sex-specific trajectories of motor adaptation, a feature relevant to modeling prodromal PD.

J.", "abstract": "The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value, i.e. whether environmental cues are good or bad. Rewarding cue value is aligned with a tendency to act or to inhibit in case of potential punishment, a so-called Pavlovian Bias. Value-related vmPFC activation may therefore impact Pavlovian bias. However, it remains unknown how the activity in the vmPFC modulates the Pavlovian bias. Thus, we applied continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive protocol that transiently reduces cortical excitability, over the vmPFC in a single-blinded, between-subject study. 90 healthy adults performed a motivational Go/NoGo learning task during fMRI after receiving cTBS (n=45) or sham (n=45) stimulation. Behaviourally, cTBS reduced overall Go response rates and slowed reaction times. Computational modelling showed a decrease in the learning rate, selectively for rewarding outcomes. Computational fMRI analysis showed stronger reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the vmPFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and left dorsal striatum after cTBS, without changes in neural signals at cue onset. These findings provide causal evidence that the vmPFC drives the action-invigoration component of the Pavlovian bias.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Resting-state scans were performed in 16-month-old male and female mice across four genotypes: WT, TSPO-/-, 3xTgAD or 3xTgAD.TSPO-/-. Using a data-driven approach, we identified key functional networks, including a bilateral hippocampal-amygdala limbic network. Dual regression analysis revealed increased engagement of the ventral hippocampus within the limbic network and elevated hemodynamic variance in 3xTgAD mice compared to WT. Moreover, co-activation patterns (CAPs) analysis showed abnormal activation/deactivation cycles involving the dorsal hippocampus, both of which were prevented by TSPO knockout without affecting amyloid or tau burden.

{"title": "Locally balanced inhibition allows for robust learning of input-output associations in feedforward networks with Hebbian plasticity", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.11.687798", "authors": "Cecchini, G.; Roxin, A.", "abstract": "In neural networks within the brain, the activity of a post-synaptic neuron is determined by the combined influence of many pre-synaptic neurons. This distributed processing enables mechanisms like Hebbian plasticity to associate sensory inputs with specific internal states, as seen in feedforward structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus. By modifying synaptic weights through Hebbian rules, sensory inputs can subsequently elicit outputs that consistently reflect their corresponding internal states. When input and output patterns are uncorrelated, this approach allows for the encoding of a large number of distinct associations, enabling efficient memory storage. Our study demonstrates a critical limitation when output patterns become weakly correlated with input patterns through the intrinsic feedforward network's connectivity. In these cases, the Hebbian rule preferentially strengthens synaptic weights shared across patterns, leading to a \"freezing\" of the network's structure. This results in highly correlated output patterns over time, effectively reducing the network's capacity to store diverse associations and limiting its flexibility in learning. To address this challenge, we find that including a mechanism of locally balanced inhibition, which has been shown to be a key feature of cortical circuits in-vivo, counteracts the undesired correlations between inputs and outputs. By dynamically regulating inhibitory input, locally balanced inhibition prevents the over-strengthening of shared weights, restoring the network's ability to maintain robust and flexible learning. This finding underscores the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in enabling efficient and adaptive information processing in neural circuits, offering insights into how biological networks maintain their remarkable capacity for associative learning.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Our natural reaches are usually coordinated with preceding eye movements. Despite this behavioral relevance, the potential linkage between preceding eye movements and memory formation for reaching has been largely overlooked. We show that two opposing visuomotor maps for reach, which normally prevent learning due to interference, can be learned when each is associated with a different immediately preceding eye movement. We further show that the generalization pattern of reach learning across different gaze conditions can be explained by the gaze state's distance computed with temporal weighting. These findings indicate that reaching memories are encoded in tight association with the recent history of preceding gaze states. Our results expand the functional role of eye-hand coordination beyond visual guidance, revealing its importance in orchestrating flexible motor learning.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Bulk RNA-sequencing revealed marked activation of Th1 and Th2 pathways (activation z-score +4.8, p = 3.8 x 10^-15), and immune cell deconvolution predicted higher proportions of T cell populations in Healers. Spatial proteomics in a second cohort identified elevated CD3+ T cell density and selective enrichment of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in vascular niches of the papillary dermis in Healers (p < 0.001).

However, allergens are typically encountered as repeated, subthreshold exposures, and how these cumulatively induce sensitization is unknown. We identify a sensory neuron-intrinsic mechanism of neuroimmune memory that enables this process. Initial activation by protease allergens induces sustained mTORC1 signaling and PGC-1-associated mitochondrial remodeling, establishing a metabolically primed state that amplifies neuroimmune responses upon allergen re-exposure. This heightened state, independent of adaptive immunity, drives enhanced itch, increased CD301b+ dendritic cell migration, and augmented Th2 differentiation. Disrupting neuronal mTORC1 signaling or mitochondrial stability abrogates this amplification while leaving primary responses intact. Importantly, this mechanism generalizes across distinct protease allergens, revealing mTORC1-driven metabolic reprogramming in sensory neurons as a form of innate neuroimmune memory underlying allergen cross-sensitization and polysensitization.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

By using lung tissues and pulmonary vascular cells from PAH and non-diseased human lungs, unbiased proteomics, network analysis, and gain-and-loss of function approaches, we here report that up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)-lactate axis promotes PASMC-specific over-lactylation and consequent over-accumulation of DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) in small remodeled PAs from PAH lungs, leading to the up-regulation of Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) signaling, hyper-proliferation, and reduced apoptosis.

Pharmacological inhibition of TOP1 with indotecan suppressed Akt-mTORC1, decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis in human PAH, but not control PASMCs, and reversed PA remodeling, PH, and RV dysfunction in rats. Collectively, these data provide a novel mechanistic link from LDHA-driven lactate over-production through lactylation and overaccumulation of TOP1, to the up-regulation of Akt-mTORC1, hyper-proliferation and apoptosis resistance of PASMCs, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH, and identify TOP1 as a new potentially attractive molecular target for the remodeling-focused therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Human islets from donors with type 2 diabetes displayed concomitantly elevated insulin and somatostatin secretion with tightly correlated dynamics, a pattern reproduced in islets from high-fat diet-fed mice. Chemogenetic delta cell activation and silencing revealed that inhibitory delta cell signals consistently trigger rebound excitation of beta and alpha cells, generating glucose-dependent, synchronized oscillations of insulin and glucagon release that are partially mediated by somatostatin receptors. Physiological delta cell stimuli, including urocortin-3 and ghrelin, elicited comparable rebound responses, linking this mechanism to native signaling pathways.

Mutations in the rplV gene encoding three non-synonymous substitutions, compared to the canonical C. trachomatis reference strain D//TW-3/Cx sequence, were found to be common but largely conserved within lineages causing prevalent urogenital and anorectal infections and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).

The endothelium, as the interface between blood and vasculature, shapes disease onset and progression through its response to environmental cues. However, while the genetic component of these diseases has been captured by genome wide association studies (GWAS), which also highlighted a shared immune component, it remains unclear which of these disease loci exerts their effects through endothelial cells. This study identifies, and quantifies, the genetic determinants of endothelial cells molecular traits and their overlap to the common genetic variation component of these diseases. Methods: We generated genotype, RNA-sequencing, H3K27ac ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and endothelial cells barrier stimuli response measurements for 100 samples of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for gene expression, transcriptional isoform usage, splice junction usage, chromatin activity and barrier response. We applied statistical colocalisation to identify the overlap between data layers, and to explain molecular QTLs contribution to GWAS disease loci. Results: We used molecular QTLs to identify the regulatory features of 8,214 genes, representing 36% of all expressed genes in endothelial cells. We also identified the molecular mechanisms underlying 815 loci across 16 disease GWAS. These represent between 29% and 40% of all loci for each disease, compared to the previous average of 23%. This is due to the choice of a cell type often underrepresented in tissue level data, and the inclusion of isoform, splicing and chromatin activity datasets. Furthermore, we compared the endothelial cells molecular QTLs with similar datasets in monocytes, neutrophils and CD4 T lymphocytes to shed light on the interplay between the endothelial and the immune compartments in these diseases. We identified loci acting through both the endothelial and the immune compartment, mostly with the same directionality of effect, and endothelial specific ones. Conclusions: This work expands the knowledge of the mechanisms and genes underlying the effect of common genetic variation on non-communicable diseases having endothelial dysfunction as a shared feature. It also illustrates the interplay between endothelial cells and immune cell types in these diseases, highlighting shared and unique pathways.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Conventional passive plastics used in food packaging lack adaptive functionality limiting their preservation efficiency. Biopolymer based hydrogels offer promise due to their biodegradability, film forming ability, and intrinsic bioactivity. However, their instability in aqueous environments constrains their application in high moisture foods such as meat. Lignin extracted from sugarcane tops via acid alkali treatment and chitosan known for its film forming and antimicrobial properties were combined to enhance the antioxidant, antimicrobial, UV blocking, and mechanical performance of the hydrogel. The films were cured at 25 C under 80% relative humidity, eliminating the high temperature pre oven drying required in conventional methods. Further, a stable lignin/chitosan hydrogel film was developed using sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) as a crosslinker and glycerol as a plasticizer. The films treated with 1% (w/v) STMP for 15 min showed optimal performance, exhibiting 89.89% radical scavenging activity, complete UV shielding, antimicrobial activity against E. coli, and tensile strength of 2364.79 MPa with 31.49% elongation at break. The film retained its integrity in food simulants namely ethanol (10% v/v), acetic acid (3% v/v), and distilled water. In chicken breast packaging trials, the CL0.8/3Cht film-maintained pH, moisture, and protein stability and significantly reduced microbial load during 5 days of storage.

Current vascularization strategies struggle to achieve perfusable microvessels that penetrate hepatocyte tissue. Furthermore, in vitro recapitulation of hepatic regeneration remains a major challenge. This study presents a paracrine factor local gradient (PFLG)-generating system that constructs vascularized, perfusable hepatocyte tissues and recapitulates the perfusion-mediated proliferative capacity of primary hepatocytes. The PFLG-generating platform integrates fibroblast-loaded cryogels with a microfluidic device to direct angiogenesis prior to hepatocyte seeding, thereby enabling microvessels to penetrate three-dimensional hepatocyte tissue. Within the vascularized constructs, microvessels directly penetrated the hepatocyte parenchyma, recapitulating intimate hepatocyte-microvessel contact in vivo. These constructs enhanced hepatocyte polarity and functional bile canaliculi. Importantly, under perfusion culture, robust hepatocyte proliferation was induced, with Ki67-positive hepatocytes increasing significantly, including mitotic cells while preserving polarity. By contrast, this proliferative response was minimal under static conditions. Time-lapse imaging and functional assays confirmed perfusion through penetrating microvessels. These findings demonstrate that perfusion-mediated cues are essential for inducing hepatocyte proliferation while maintaining functional polarity.

These tympanic membranes receive sound either directly or internally via an acoustic tracheal tube.

In this study, CT reconstructions with AI-assisted segmentation and phylogenetically informed regressions across 18 bush-cricket species were used to investigate how tympanal surface area and mean cross-sectional thickness relate to body size, carrier frequency, and the presence of auditory pinnae. Tympanal surface area scaled positively with body size, whereas thickness was independent of size. Carrier frequency decreased with increasing body size but showed no direct association with tympanal properties. Among 15 species with auditory pinnae, tympanal dimensions showed no correlation with peak cavity resonance frequency, indicating semi-independent evolution of pinna cavity and tympanal traits. Across species, pinna presence did not significantly affect tympanal morphology, although in taxa with unilateral pinnae, pinna-covered tympana were consistently larger in area but thinner than exposed tympana. Overall, these findings indicate that tympanal evolution reflects a balance of scaling constraints and localised effects of auditory pinnae.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

NAADP does not bind these channels directly but requires binding proteins, such as JPT2/HN1L and LSM12. So far, their function has been analyzed in several cell lines; however, their physiological relevance in cell types known to utilize NAADP signaling remains unclear. Here, we generated JPT2/HN1L-deficient (Jpt2/Hn1l-/-) mice to evaluate the contribution of JPT2/HN1L proteins to platelet aggregation and Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes, mast cells, and CD4+ T cells. NAADP is known to contribute to Collagen-related peptide (CRP)-evoked platelet aggregation, but this was not altered by JPT2/HN1L deletion. Functional Ca2+ imaging revealed that JPT2/HN1L plays a strikingly cell-type specific role in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release. In beating ventricular cardiomyocytes, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation is known to evoke arrhythmogenic spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ transients, which were not altered in their frequency in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- myocytes. Antigen-evoked Ca2+ transients in peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) are not changed in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- PMCs. However, CD4+ T-cells displayed a pronounced requirement for JPT2/HN1L. Following T-cell receptor stimulation with anti-CD3, global Ca2+ elevations and early NAADP-driven Ca2+ microdomains, which occur within milliseconds of TCR engagement and serve as initiating signals for downstream immune activation, were significantly decreased in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- CD4+ cells. We conclude that JPT2/HN1L is indispensable for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release in T-cells, but dispensable in cardiomyocytes, platelets, and mast cells, where the presence of LSM12 might compensate for the loss of JPT2/HN1L. Together, JPT2/HN1L is not universally required as an NAADP-binding protein but exhibits distinct cell-type specificity, with an essential function in T-cell Ca2+ signaling.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.; De Weerd, P.", "abstract": "Surface perception relies on interactions between boundary encoding and surface filling-in. In a perceptual filling-in paradigm, a blank figure becomes perceptually replaced by a textured background after prolonged fixation of a point away from the figure. Filling-in begins when neurons representing the figure's boundary adapt, allowing background-related activity to spread into the figure's retinotopic representation. Adaptation proceeds faster the better the boundary is stabilized in a neuron's receptive field (RF). We hypothesized that moving the figure boundary beyond a neuron's RF would reduce adaptation and hinder filling-in, with larger movements permitting progressively less filling-in. As RF size increases with eccentricity, we further hypothesized that greater eccentricities would require larger movements to interfere with filling-in. Our results confirmed both predictions. The reduction in filling-in duration with increasing motion range permitted estimating RF size at each eccentricity. The slope of a linear function relating RF size to eccentricity matched values reported in human fMRI studies of V1/V2, suggesting that boundary adaptation involves early visual areas. We also explored whether microsaccade amplitude affects filling-in, but found no supporting evidence. Thus, external figure motion and microsaccades may disrupt adaptation through different mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into neural adaptation processes preceding perceptual filling-in.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Early hypothalamic microinflammation is emerging as a key contributor to the onset of metabolic dysfunction, but its temporal dynamics, underlying mechanisms, and sex-specific differences remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of short-term high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on hypothalamic microinflammation, glial activation, and insulin signaling in male and female mice. Males rapidly developed hypothalamic microinflammation, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and impaired insulin signaling, whereas females did not show these alterations. Interestingly, we also observed a sex-specific pattern in microglial M2 polarization: females maintained a sustained M2 response throughout the experimental period, while males exhibited only a transient peak that declined in the following days. These sex-specific differences in microglial dynamics and polarization may be linked to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, a classical mediator of inflammatory signaling. To further explore this, we analyzed mice lacking JNK3, the CNS-enriched isoform of JNK. Loss of JNK3 disrupted early microglial polarization, abolished the transient M2 response, and predisposed males to enhanced gliosis and partial hypothalamic insulin resistance, while females retained partial resilience. These findings indicate that JNK3 contributes to the regulation of microglial dynamics and polarization in response to metabolic stress.

Building on previous work linking non-ordinary states of consciousness with autonomic nervous system activity during psychedelic drug administration, we tested the hypothesis that HRV amplitude may reflect STE depth and predict affective and prosocial outcomes during non-drug numadelic VR experiences. Specifically, ninety-six participants engaged in guided meditation within either a numadelic VR setting or a non-VR audio-guided group format. Physiological data (cardiac activity and respiration) were recorded during the meditation, alongside psychological assessments pre- and post-session. Findings confirm that HRV amplitude measured during numadelic VR correlates with subjective STE ratings, compassion traits, and emotional improvement following VR practice. Additional analysis of data from a prior psychedelic drug study further validated the relevance of this measure across consciousness expanding modalities. These results advance the psychophysiological mapping of STEs and highlight HRV amplitude as a potential real-time biomarker which may help to guide participants toward self-transcendent states within adaptive environments.

This study not only refines the understanding of IGK locus diversity but also contributes to the IMGT(R) databases, advancing future research on immunogenetic variability, somatic mutations, and immune response dynamics in canine health and disease.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Immune cells have been suggested as the principal functional effector cell types of these common variants. Here, we identify 76 MS-associated SNPs whose loci present accessible chromatin in homeostatic and diseased oligodendroglia (OLG), including both oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs). By applying high-throughput functional genomics, we found that a subset of these SNPs led to variant- and cell-specific regulatory effects in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendroglia. Phenotypic profiling of these variants indicated that rs483180:PHGDH interfered with human OPC proliferation via long-range chromatin interactions with the S100A6 locus, while variants at rs2248137:CYP24A1 impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation by regulating BCAS1 expression. In addition, variants at rs1415069:DIPK1A enhanced secretion of the cytokine CCL2 by oligodendroglia, suggesting that these variants might be implicated in OLG-driven immune cell recruitment in MS. These findings position oligodendroglia as important drivers of MS pathogenesis through modulation of both their cell-intrinsic oligodendroglial function and intercellular communication by non-coding MS risk variants.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A critical look at directional random walk modeling of sparse fossil data", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.11.687792", "authors": "Ergon, R.", "abstract": "The general random walk model (GRW) of Hunt (2006) is used to infer directional evolution in mean trait values from sparse fossil data. Such evolutions are modeled as the accumulated result of small steps with mean step sizes and step variances. As shown in simulations and real data cases, the mean step sizes are often easy to estimate from data, except for cases where the mean step size is small compared to the step variance. The step variances, on the other hand, can be estimated reasonably well only when the mean trait values have small measurement errors, although also then the step variance estimation may be difficult. For fossil data with realistic measurement errors, the step variances appear to be extremely difficult to find, and they are often found to be negative. They must then be set to zero, such that GRW deteriorates into deterministic walk processes. As a result of poor step variance estimates, the directional evolution may be both under- and overestimated as compared with weighted least squares results, which are the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUP). Here, I study this problem through simulations, as well as in four real data cases. Based on weighted mean square error (WMSE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) comparisons, my conclusion is that WLS in cases with large measurement errors is the best method for inference of directional evolution.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.; Mehta, S.; Brown, Z.; Richardson, A. A.; Rivera, R. A.; Layton, C.; Foxe, J. J.; Knight, E. J.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Many children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty distinguishing speech in crowded scenarios with competing conversations and noise. This can impact learning and community participation. Prior work has implicated audiovisual integration of lip movements with speech sounds as a potential underlying mechanism, but difficulty in accurately deploying spatial attention is an important, often overlooked, factor that may impact the accuracy of speech perception in noisy environments. OBJECTIVE Evaluate patterns of audiovisual integration and allocation of visuospatial attention during speech processing in a multiple-talker scenario among school-age children with ADHD and typically developing children (TD). METHODS We recruited 7-12-year-old children with ADHD to participate in an integrated virtual reality and electrophysiologic (EEG) speech-in-noise perception paradigm. In virtual reality, children were asked to press a button whenever a centrally-located target character spoke a target monosyllabic word, while ignoring any words spoken by two flanking distractor characters. We manipulated 1) audiovisual (AV) content by intermixing trials containing either audio, visual, or multisensory AV representations of the three characters and 2) spatial attention demands by including trials with and without interference from the distracting speakers. We measured AV gain in target detection accuracy. Simultaneously, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were continuously recorded via a 128-channel electrode array as an index of visuospatial attention allocation to each speaker. To elicit SSVEP, the target and distractor speakers were tagged with different visual frequency oscillations (23hz and 15hz, respectively). EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the corresponding first and second harmonics for those frequency bands was measured over the occipital scalp. RESULTS Children with ADHD showed reduced AV gain relative to TD controls. TD controls also demonstrated more robust SSVEP at 23Hz and 46Hz (target speaker) than at 15Hz (distractor speakers). Compared to TD children, children with ADHD had reduced selective activation in response to the target. As a result, children with ADHD showed more equivalent allocation of visuospatial attention between 23Hz target and 15Hz distractor frequencies. CONCLUSIONS Children with ADHD demonstrate a reduction in the typical perceptual benefit afforded by exposure to multisensory compared to unisensory speech stimuli, accompanied by substantial differences in the allocation of visuospatial attention to the relevant speaker. Thus, dysregulation of selective visuospatial attention may impair their ability to effectively perceive language in noisy settings.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Chronic recording in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT) revealed a progression of feature selectivity over the duration of the response, with different images evoking strongest responses in different time bins. Neurons responded briskly and transiently to early best images and gave slower and more sustained responses to later best images. Correlations between IT selectivity and deep neural network (DNN) activations in early layers were faster and more transient than correlations with deeper DNN layers, suggesting a hierarchical representation unfolding. Analysis of best images in different time bins showed that early best images were simpler, or made up of fewer parts, than later best images. This simple-to-complex selectivity dynamic is consistent with, but more universal than, previously reported dynamics of global-to-local or category-to-exemplar selectivity. In parallel with the simple-to-complex selectivity progression, the image selectivity and the population activity became sparser during the response, consistent with the hypothesis of a canonical cortical microcircuit that pools inputs and incorporates neighboring-neuron inhibition. We propose that this temporal cascade in IT recapitulates the multiple antecedent stages in the visual hierarchy, which also show a simple-to-complex progression of feature selectivity.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In mice repeatedly exposed to ketamine, STM impairment coincided with reduced release probability and vesicle refilling at mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) synapses, without detectable changes in layer 2/3 to layer 2/3 synaptic release probability, intrinsic excitability, or synaptic ultrastructure.

Results show that self-compassion buffered against declines in self-esteem among poorly performing individuals, predicted higher overall positive affect throughout the task, and was associated with increased post-task self-esteem. Moreover, performance feedback predicted positive affect, which in turn predicted post-task self-esteem, although these pathways were not moderated by self-compassion.

Although SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory arrest, its underlaying mechanisms are poorly understood. Considering the significant association between stress-related disorders and Epilepsy, we hypothesized that stress exaggerates autonomic reflexes critical in cardiorespiratory function and that these exaggerated reflexes increase susceptibility to SUDEP. Experiments were performed using a novel mouse model of SUDEP where chronic hyperactivity of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Kcc2/Crh) predisposes mice to SUDEP in the weeks following seizure induction based on the ventral intrahippocampal kainate (vIHKA) model of chronic Epilepsy. In our study, the vIHKA model was employed in both wild-type (WT) and Kcc2/Crh mice while they were monitored with EEG and ECG using in vivo telemetry and underwent terminal autonomic reflex testing at time points when mortality peaked and plateaued. A resting tachycardia developed by one week following vIHKA injection but subsided by day 30 in both WT and Kcc2/Crh mice. During spontaneous seizures, Kcc2/Crh mice had more pronounced reflex-like ictal bradycardias compared to WT controls that notably occurred just prior to seizure termination. vIHKA injection promoted time-dependent exaggeration of autonomic reflexes, with Kcc2/Crh mice exhibiting robust autonomic disturbances compared to WT controls, including a pronounced serotonin-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased autonomic disturbance burden parallels time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in mice with hyperactive stress circuits.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a DNA segment known as Region B was acquired horizontally from a distant yeast species. This region (17 Kb) encodes 5 genes and is present in the genomes of yeast strains from different phylogenetic clades, with its contribution to yeast niche-specific adaptation remaining unclear. In this work, the genomic structure of Region B was analyzed in yeast strains from the ScRAP (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Reference Assembly Panel) collection, identifying 10 variants that maintain a circular continuity. To assess the role of Region B in yeast adaptation, we performed a high-throughput phenotyping of the ScRAP collection under different growth conditions, identifying that Region B is potentially associated with higher tolerance to oxidative stress. Then, we selected a single yeast strain from the ScRAP collection for characterization of the transcriptional activity of each gene within Region B using a fluorescent reporter. The results revealed that gene expression depends on the host genetic background and transcription factors encoded within Region B. To identify the genetic determinants involved in Region B expression within different genetic backgrounds, three expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) were mapped and validated. Finally, by performing Region B deletion, we determine the contribution of this region to different fermentative phenotypes, including fermentation rate and amino acid consumption. Altogether, our results suggest a complex regulatory interaction between the horizontally acquired genes and the host genome that contributes to yeast adaptation under fermentation conditions.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Understanding how landscape structure and climate shape pollinator communities is critical, yet studies that jointly assess these factors in human-dominated tropical landscapes remain scarce. Here, we investigate how forest cover, distance to forest patches, flower abundance, and temperature influence pollinator communities in monoculture cashew plantations that are rapidly expanding in the northern Western Ghats, part of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted 210 half-hour observation sessions across 30 cashew orchards in Dodamarg, India. At the community level, flower abundance and forest cover positively influenced pollinator richness, number of pollinators, and number of visits. The number of visits showed a unimodal response to temperature, with peaks occurring within narrow, taxon-specific ranges, lower temperatures for birds and higher for insects, likely reflecting physiological constraints. At the species level, flower abundance and temperature emerged as key predictors of occurrence, while three butterfly species occurred more frequently near forest patches. Contrary to expectations, proximity to forest did not reduce ambient orchard temperatures, suggesting limited forest-mediated thermal buffering in our site. Together, these findings highlight the vulnerability of pollination services to both land-use change and rising temperatures. Ongoing conversion of natural forests to cashew monocultures, coupled with climate warming, may erode pollinator communities and jeopardize crop yields in tropical agroecosystems.

It has been suggested that the root of the Archaea may lie on, or potentially within, any of three major groups - the Euryarchaeota, TACK+Asgard clade, and DPANN, the last of which includes many host-associated and genome-reduced lineages. These root hypotheses make starkly different predictions about the nature of early archaeal evolution: for example, a root on or within DPANN might suggest a small-genome and host-associated ancestor, with methanogenesis, the hallmark metabolism of the Archaea, evolving later. Here, we investigate the position of the archaeal root and the nature of the last archaeal common ancestor using a range of phylogenetic approaches, including the best available site- and branch-heterogeneous substitution models, and new gene tree-species tree reconciliation models that capture changes in rates of gene duplication, loss and transfer across the phylogeny. Our analyses converge on a narrow archaeal root region at/near the base of the Euryarchaeota, supporting hypotheses in which the Last Archaeal Common Ancestor (LACA) was a complex, free-living (hyper-)thermophilic methanogen.

Independent from its activity in the HPT axis, TRH also exerts strong neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Although multiple factors have been linked to its neuroprotective action, the cellular mechanism of TRH neuroprotection is still not clear. Here we show that TRH protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated TRH transduction and TRH peptide given exogenously over 24 hours period of time inhibit glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This effect is not mediated by the decreased intracellular calcium response as TRH treatment (24 hours) has no effect on glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium nor the calpain activity. While TRH treatment (10 minutes) significantly inhibits glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium, no protective effect is observed when TRH is applied 30 minutes before or after glutamate stimulation. Instead, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibits the protective effect of TRH. LY294002 also blocks TRH induced AKT activation. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits the protective effect of TRH. Taken together, these results suggest PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and new protein synthesis are involved in the protective effect of TRH against glutamate toxicity, thereby providing mechanistic support for its action in neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate how the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain area implicated in the control of overt spatial attention, integrates these two control signals in a multi-target search task. Monkeys made sequences of saccades to stimuli presented in a grid while searching for a \"true\" (reward eliciting) target amid color-coded targets and distractors. The efficient performance of this task requires integrating a target guidance signal with a history of previously fixated locations in order to guide search to new potential targets that might offer reward. Theories of systems neuroscience suggest that this multi-factor search behavior might be controlled using either mixed selectivity, dynamic selectivity, or pure selectivity. We find evidence for SC neurons exhibiting each of these patterns and conclude that this brain structure participates in circuits representing target similarity and previously fixated locations, in addition to a circuit responsible for integrating these signals using the mechanisms of dynamic and mixed selectivity. We also introduce a novel time-series partial information decomposition analysis that provides a rich and direct view of how a neuron allocates its representational capacity. These findings support an emerging view of the superior colliculus as much more than a bottom-up priority map, but instead an important site for the flexible cognitive control of visually-guided behavior.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Recent evidence indicates the importance of macrophages in regulating stem regeneration following injury, but how to therapeutically promote specific macrophage subtypes which may tip the balance away from apoptosis and towards regeneration is still unclear. Here we show that targeting complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) reduces radiation-induced intestinal injury by promoting macrophage phenotypes which reduce intestinal stem cell apoptosis. Specifically, C5aR1 signalling attenuates a macrophage maturation response characterised by increased IL10 and CX3CR1 expression. Our data indicate that increased IL10 signalling, and macrophage maturation induced following C5aR1 targeting are important for regulating crypt cell loss via radiotherapy-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, IL10-signalling is also critical for the improved tumour radiation response observed following C5aR1 targeting.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.; Daar, I. O.; Yoon, J.", "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) serve as dynamic scaffolds that support diverse cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and epithelial morphogenesis. In ciliated cells, MTs not only form the axonemal backbone of cilia but also work in tandem with actin to build an apical meshwork that anchors and orients basal bodies. However, the mechanisms regulating apical MT organization during ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the centrosomal protein Kizuna (Kiz) as a critical regulator of apical MT architecture. Kiz interacts with the C-terminus of Dishevelled 2 (Dvl-C), inducing an open conformation and enabling the recruitment of Protein Kinase C delta (PKC{delta}) to stabilize the apical MT meshwork. This Dvl2/Kiz/PKC{delta} signaling axis is essential for ciliogenesis across multiple contexts, including the formation of primary cilia in the eye, multicilia in the mucociliary epidermis (MCE), and mono-motile cilia in the left-right organizer, the gastrocoel roof plate (GRP). These findings reveal a conserved molecular mechanism linking Dvl2 conformational dynamics to MT organization and highlight Kizuna as a key mediator coupling non-canonical Wnt signaling to ciliogenesis, left-right patterning, and the organization of the apical actin microtubule meshwork in ciliated cells of embryos.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

However, existing transcriptomic studies largely focus on responses to acute thermal stress or do not manipulate temperature across multiple timescales. We used RNA-sequencing to measure gene expression of Pieris rapae larvae exposed to a full factorial combination of non-stressful high and low temperatures across a long-term developmental timescale and a short-term acclimation timescale. This study design allowed us to separate genes associated with developmental thermal plasticity versus short-term acclimation responses, respectively. We observed that few genes were differentially expressed in response to both developmental temperature and short-term acclimation temperature, though there were some functional similarities across the two gene sets. This result suggests that the expression of different genes underlies thermal plasticity acting on different timescales, and thus these responses may evolve independently. Genes responsive to developmental temperature include those related to hormone activity and cold acclimation, while short-term acclimation temperature affected the expression of several cuticle protein genes. Both developmental and short-term acclimation temperature treatments affected the expression of genes involved in detoxification and protein folding. Finally, we identified a small subset of genes for which expression levels were dependent on the interaction between developmental and short-term acclimation temperature treatments, providing possible mechanisms by which developmental temperature may affect an organism's capacity for acclimation responses later in life.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We tested whether ecological frameworks and evolutionary genomic data can be used to forecast rapid adaptation in replicated outdoor populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving in response to natural seasonal fluctuations from summer to late fall. Life history theory predicted the observed pattern of adaptive tracking: in summer, reproductive output increased and stress tolerance decreased, while in fall, this direction reversed, with evolution of increased stress tolerance at the expense of reproduction. Stoichiometric phenotypic evolution was also predictable, with phosphorus and magnesium content, both linked to growth rate, and alkali metal, associated with maintaining homeostasis in response to thermal stress, showing rapid and parallel evolution indicative of adaptation. Temporal genomic data revealed a complex genomic architecture of temporal adaptation and the SNPs and genes involved in adaptation were largely unpredictable.

Force generation is mediated by the cytomotive switch, a dynamic property modulated by MT stability. Second-generation microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, bind at the taxane site and chemically stabilize MTs by enhancing lateral and longitudinal tubulin interactions. While effective in blocking MT depolymerization and preserving transport, the fact that these drugs introduce structural alterations that distinguish stabilized MTs from their native counterparts raises concerns for both mechanistic studies and clinical applications in diseases like tauopathies. In this study, we provide a detailed structural atlas of taxane site-mediated modulation of MTs. We show that drug binding induces two distinct lattice conformations in the longitudinal axis-expanded (4.17 nm rise) and compressed (4.06 nm rise)-with rapid transitions and low energy barriers between them. In contrast, lateral interactions allow multiple protofilament (PF) configurations with small energetic differences but high activation barriers, a finding consistent with the observed structural heterogeneity of MTs. Notably, minor chemical modifications, such as acetylation of paclitaxel's C-7 hydroxyl, can shift these conformational equilibria. These structural changes significantly impact biochemical properties, and alter recognition by tau and kinesin proteins, suggesting a role for lattice conformation as a signaling cue.

Studies of phage T4 have demonstrated a multi-protein mechanism that stalls lysis and maintains the LIN state in response to superinfection in a high phage population density. However, the lysis proteins responsible for T4 lysis and LIN are not conserved with phage N4. In this study, we characterize the phage N4 proteins involved in lysis by molecular and genetic means. We define the functions of the minimal gene set required for lysis through heterologous expression and complementation. We also demonstrate that this complete lysis cassette is sufficient to induce LIN under high-density phage infection conditions. Furthermore, by sequence comparison with a selected mutant library that does not induce LIN, we have identified genomic regions both within and outside the lysis cassette involved in N4 LIN. We propose a model where N4 lysis proteins that are responsible for executing rapid N4 lysis can be regulated to induce LIN. Despite the lack of conservation with T4 components, our study suggests that direct modulation of lysis initiation may be common and provides a springboard for identifying other phages that regulate their phage production numbers in this way.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We investigated the thermoregulatory capacities of five forest-dependent bird species from the Taita Hills (Kenya), a montane biodiversity hotspot experiencing severe habitat loss. Using respirometry, we measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) across a range of temperatures to determine thermoneutral zone (TNZ) limits, quantified evaporative water loss (EWL), evaporative heat loss (EHL), and metabolic heat production (MHP) as proxies of cooling capacity, and estimated heat tolerance limits (HTLs). Contrary to expectations of a classical TNZ pattern, RMR-temperature relationships were predominantly V-shaped, suggesting the absence, or marked narrowness, of a TNZ. In contrast, HTL clearly increased with body mass, with larger species tolerating higher temperatures. Evaporative cooling efficiency remained weak across all species (EHL/MHP < 1), indicating limited capacity to dissipate metabolic heat. Compared with global data, the Taita Hills species exhibited low critical temperatures and narrow thermal ranges, consistent with specialisation to the stable microclimates of tropical montane forests. Our findings suggest that small-bodied, forest-dependent tropical birds function within narrow thermal margins, which may make them especially vulnerable to rising temperatures and the microclimatic changes associated with climate change and forest fragmentation.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We observed that TNTs become more abundant and elongated during this process, and preferentially connect transformed donor cells to non-transformed acceptor cells. We show that this long-range, directional communication involves the transfer of the signaling receptor BMPR1b. Within days, this transfer induces gene expression changes in acceptor cells, consistent with early transformation programs. Functional analyses of these acceptor cells revealed metabolic rewiring and phenotypic changes, including anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, the transferred BMPR1b receptor sensitized acceptor cells to BMP2 signals present in the microenvironment, amplifying their transformation potential. Hence, by tracking the earliest molecular responses in acceptor cells, we deciphered the initial steps of a transformation cascade triggered by TNT-mediated transfer.

Here, we examined how microenvironmental complexity shapes uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) responses to antibiotics and bacteriophages using: human urine, a three-dimensional urothelial microtissue model (3D-UHU), and a novel mesofluidic system (P-FLO) that introduces physiologically relevant flow dynamics to the 3D-UHU. P-FLO was engineered from cost-effective 3D-printed components compatible with standard Transwell systems. Among the antibiotics tested, nitrofurantoin exhibited the greatest potency in minimum inhibitory concentration assays, but it failed to fully eradicate infection within the more physiological 3D-UHU model. A bacteriophage cocktail (LCPR1) showed markedly reduced activity in urine compared with nutrient-rich media, highlighting the influence of infection-site conditions. In contrast, in 3D-UHU, LCRP1 modulated host responses without reducing bacterial burden. Combination therapy (nitrofurantoin + LCPR1) eliminated planktonic bacteria under static conditions but offered no added benefit against adherent or intracellular populations relative to antibiotic monotherapy. Incorporating flow revealed additional layers of complexity, where shear stress induced bacterial elongation and attachment and altered drug performance, diminishing the efficacy of nitrofurantoin and combination therapy against planktonic populations despite increased drug exposure.

A goal of the vertebrate host is to modulate the availability of metals to pathogens, in a process known as nutritional immunity, but pathogens have evolved numerous countermeasures to regulate intracellular trace metal levels. The bioavailability of trace metals therefore shapes the outcome of disease. In the human body, epithelial cells lining the intestine are a major site of metal absorption. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are also a target for invading enteric pathogens but the contribution of epithelium-intrinsic factors towards nutritional immunity has been understudied. Using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) harboring metal-responsive fluorescent reporters in a bovine ligated intestinal loop infection model, we mapped the spatiotemporal nature of metal competition during enteric salmonellosis. We show that STm experiences a temporal, cell-specific restriction of iron, manganese, and zinc in the intestinal mucosa during the early stages of infection. We have further studied the contribution of the broad specificity metal cation transporter, SLC11A2, in IECs to nutritional immunity against STm. Knockout of SLC11A2 in IECs leads to enhanced replication of STm, indicating a protective role for this transporter. Using fluorescence-based biosensors and bacterial gene deletion mutants, we pinpoint manganese and iron restriction as the mechanism by which SLC11A2 limits bacterial proliferation.

We engineered full-length human TDP-43 bearing an N-terminal nuclear export signal while preserving the native 3'UTR, thereby maintaining N-terminal domain multimerization and physiological autoregulation. Titration to a low-load regime allowed interrogation of nucleocytoplasmic balance near homeostasis in HEK293T cells, differentiated SH-SY5Y neurons, and human iPSC-derived neurons. A minimal increase in export produced an exogenous pool that was disproportionately cytoplasmic and detergent-insoluble, while total cellular TDP-43 remained near baseline. This subtle cytoplasmic bias initiated a cascade: co-recruitment of endogenous TDP-43, formation of cytoplasmic puncta, progressive impairment of TDP-43-dependent splicing--including STMN2--and C-terminal fragmentation. Targeted reduction of endogenous nuclear TDP-43 relieved 3'UTR-mediated autoregulatory repression. The resulting increase in exogenous transcript and protein further amplified detergent-insoluble and fragmented species, quantitatively delineating a maladaptive positive-feedback loop in which nuclear loss both drives and is reinforced by cytoplasmic accumulation. By imposing a defined, minimal perturbation while preserving physiological control, this export-biased, 3'UTR-preserving platform unifies the three defining axes of TDP-43 proteinopathy--nuclear loss of function, cytoplasmic accumulation of insoluble/fragmented species, and 3'UTR-based autoregulation--within a single, tunable circuit. Conceptually, it identifies a threshold at which modestly increased cytoplasmic residency becomes pathogenic; practically, it provides early, human-relevant readouts for screening interventions that strengthen 3'UTR-dependent autoregulation or normalize nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Current methods for integration, such as X-rays and CRISPR, damage DNA and are low-efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that the viral integrase PhiC31, which mediates a non-mutagenic recombination between short attB and attP sequences, can be used for extremely efficient and targeted integration of arrays. In this method, a transgene, a selectable marker, and attP sites are injected into the gonad of a strain that (1) has an attB site in its genome, and (2) expresses PhiC31 in its germline. F1 extrachromosomal arrays are cloned, grown for multiple generations with selection, and then screened for homozygous array integrations. The procedure is simple, requires less time than screening for extrachromosomal arrays, and arrays can be screened for transgene function after stable integration. Arrays that transmit are integrated by PhiC31 with 50-95% efficiency, allowing for the isolation of many unique integrants from a single injection. Arrays can also be integrated at fluorescent landing pads and arbitrary sites in the genome.

However, these differences and the regulatory mechanisms controlling them are poorly understood. Dysregulation of tRNAs has increasingly been implicated as a critical factor in disease progression; thus, a deeper understanding of the homeostatic variance across somatic tissues is vital. In this study, we applied Ordered Two-Template Relay sequencing (OTTR-seq) to examine small RNAs in 19 tissues from adult mice, quantifying mature tRNAs and tDRs at single-transcript resolution and inferring select base-modification signatures from characteristic reverse-transcriptase-mediated misincorporation. We observed tissue-biased expression of many unique transcripts and identified tDRs with greater tissue specificity than their parent tRNAs. Differences between tRNAs with the same anticodon but containing variations elsewhere in the sequence (isodecoders) suggest diverse regulatory processes across tissues that alter modification, translation functionality, stability, and tDR synthesis. These data provide an isodecoder-resolved reference for tissue-biased tRNA and tDR regulation in mice and form a framework for exploring disease-associated remodeling of the tRNA pool.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanism of protein-MOF interactions remains unsettled due to challenges in developing a general platform to systematically investigate such interactions, hindering improvements in their chemical and physical properties. Here, we develop a surfactant-guided strategy to modulate the assembly of protein@MOF through interfacial design. We discovered that the interfacial environment between proteins and MOFs is the primary factor determining encapsulation efficiency, structural retention, and functional performance. Lipid-based non-ionic surfactants such as glycerol monooleate (GMO) increase the protein solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), suggesting partial remodeling of the protein surface and hydration shell. GMO at the interface of protein@MOF results in a 20% improvement in protein encapsulation and a 30% increase in MOF growth rate. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal domain-specific interactions between GMO and flexible surface residues on protein in a concentration-dependent manner, involving both electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts.

Our results reveal that differences in peptide recognition are not driven by large conformational changes, but by subtle variations in loop dynamics and local secondary structure. Two divergent residues (positions 35 and 36) in the flexible loop connecting helices 2 and 3 shape the conformational ensemble of each paralog by modulating the formation of flanking helices (1 and 2), which in turn control the opening of the peptide-binding cavity.

A.", "abstract": "The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates viral entry by binding its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Spike mutations in different variants have been experimentally shown to influence the rate of conformational transitions and alter viral infectivity. In parallel, both experimental and computational studies have reported the presence of long-range allosteric communication within the spike protein, suggesting that such mutations may also affect allosteric signaling pathways involved in viral function. A detailed understanding of the allosteric residue network is essential for rational antiviral drug design. In this study, we performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the spike proteins from the Delta and Omicron variants in both ACE2-bound and unbound states. By integrating linear mutual information (LMI) calculations and graph theory-based analysis, we delineated the long-range allosteric communication networks embedded within the spike protein. Betweenness centrality metrics enabled the identification of residues that act as key mediators of information flow. Notably, ACE2 binding markedly enhances allosteric coupling throughout the spike. We identified three key linkers, Link1 (NTD-RBD), Link2 (RBD-SD1), and Link3 (SD2-FP), as primary mediators of allosteric communication. Delta exhibits stronger signaling through Link1 and Link2, whereas Omicron redirects communication via Link3. While Delta maintains localized connectivity within the S1 domain but loses long-range contact with the S2 core, Omicron forms a broader yet weaker S1 network and establishes long-range coupling. We propose that the N856K and T547K mutations reshape the conformational landscape, reconfiguring allosteric communication pathways in Omicron. Furthermore, our analysis reveals distinct domain-level allosteric couplings in Delta and Omicron, pointing to variant-specific differences in fusogenicity and immune evasion. By mapping key allosteric sites and mutation-induced conformational shifts, our study may provide a framework for developing robust antiviral strategies resilient to future emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

We find that MTX consistently impacts body mass in a time-of-day specific manner across different housing facilities. Intriguingly, investigation of the gut microbiome acutely after MTX chronotherapy revealed substantial differences in microbial composition between animals housed in different facilities as well as decreased microbial diversity at different times of day. Furthermore, these differences in the gut microbiome after MTX chronotherapy coincide with differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine profiles between facilities and times of day. Chronically, housing facility continued to impact serum cytokine levels after MTX treatment, whereas the effect of time wanes.

In the case of the prevalent and deadly pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, >90% of clinical isolates carry at least one plasmid. While plasmid-encoded mechanisms (e.g. plasmid copy number) can influence conjugation frequency, host factors and environmental stimuli can also affect transmission. In particular, stress responses like the stringent response have been associated with increased movement of mobile genetic elements. We have previously shown that clinical mutations in the stringent response controller, Rel, lead to elevated levels of the alarmones (p)ppGpp and antibiotic tolerance in S. aureus. Here, we report that stringent response activation in these strains promotes the conjugal transfer of diverse staphylococcal resistance plasmids. We observed that clinical Rel mutations promote donation, but not receipt, of plasmids from the three families of staphylococcal plasmid and a mobilisable plasmid. This increased conjugation frequency could also be induced by chemical induction of the stringent response by mupirocin. Intriguingly, detailed experimental analysis revealed that the effect of elevated (p)ppGpp on plasmid donation was not due to CodY derepression, SOS response induction, increased plasmid copy number or increased expression of conjugation machinery genes. Further, transcriptomic analysis failed to identify any other putative plasmid- or host-derived mechanisms to explain this observation. Further investigations are required to explore the mechanistic link between the stringent response and conjugation, given the pervasive transcriptional and post-translational effects of (p)ppGpp. Overall, the association between Rel mutation and increased plasmid donation is alarming, especially as Rel mutations are being increasingly identified among clinical isolates.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the capacity of Azospira suillum PS, a model facultative perchlorate-reducing bacterium, to synthesize PHB. We show that unlike most organisms, PHB production is growth-associated both aerobically, and anaerobically with perchlorate as an electron acceptor under moderate nitrogen deplete conditions.

We showed that geochemically relevant minerals efficiently co-adsorb and colocalize diverse biomolecules, creating crowded interfacial microenvironments that support enzyme cascades with substrate channeling-like behavior.

Here, we describe HHS within a beetle species complex that presents no obvious phenotypical or ecological differences among hybrid and parental species, and where all occur sympatrically. Demographic modelling supports hybrid speciation, where the hybrid lineage originated from historical admixture between parental lineages. Genome-wide estimates of heterozygosity and individual-based simulations of hybrid speciation provide further support for an ancient, rather than recent origin of the hybrid species. We leverage geographic patterns of genomic relatedness between hybrid and parental individuals to identify the likely origin within a hybrid swarm that was geographically isolated from both parental species.

J.; Vanderstraeten, J.; De Coninck, T.; Vlyminck, S.; Briers, Y.", "abstract": "Designer cellulosomes (DCs) are synthetic multi-enzyme complexes composed of a scaffold and docked enzymes, engineered for efficient lignocellulose degradation. However, designing these systems is challenged by an expansive design space, low protein yields, instability, and aggregation. To overcome these significant hurdles, we developed a novel, funnel-type methodological pipeline for the parallel construction, production, and analysis of designer xylanosomes (DXs), a subset of DCs targeting hemicellulose's xylan fraction. This streamlined approach leverages VersaTile, a combinatorial DNA assembly technique, to generate an unprecedented number of modular proteins. We demonstrate the efficient construction of 96 bicatalytic dockerin-enzyme (DE) fusions. Parallel high-throughput assays, including Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and DNA Sequencer-Assisted Fluorophore-Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (DSA-FACE), enabled rapid analysis of DE binding efficiencies and substrate preferences, facilitating selection of optimal components for downstream processing. Subsequently, we assembled 23 unique DXs and systematically evaluated their assembly capacity and hydrolytic efficiency. Our findings reveal that DX hydrolytic efficiencies are highly dependent on composition and architecture, yielding either specific arabinoxylan-oligosaccharide (AXOS) mixtures or more complete degradation to monomers. This diversity allows for tailored outcomes, leading to the identification of three superior DX variants. This innovative pipeline significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of highly efficient multi-enzyme complexes, paving the way for more effective biomass valorization processes.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified and optimised a new class of base-exchange inhibitors (BEXi) targeting SARM1 and explored their molecular interactions and conformational effects using cryo-EM, HDX-MS and SAXS. Although BEXi produced robust inhibition across all biochemical and cellular assay formats, application at sub-inhibitory concentrations consistently led to paradoxical SARM1 activation, and in neuronal assays, accelerated neurite degeneration. Further analysis showed that BEXi only delayed, rather than prevented, neurite degeneration when applied to primary neuronal cells, even at exceedingly high inhibitor concentrations. These results prompted us to discontinue BEXi development in favour of alternative strategies, underscoring the complexity of SARM1 as a therapeutic target and the need for comprehensive, mechanistically informed screening cascades.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

The pyrophilous isolates exhibited genomic novelty through gene fragmentation, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and plasmid-mediated operon expansion, enriching aromatic C degradation and N acquisition genes relative to non-pyrophilous sisters. Plasmid-encoded PyOM metabolism genes showed evidence of HGT across pyrophilous bacterial orders and even cross-kingdom exchange with fungi. Bioassays revealed overflow organic acid production linked to variation in tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, potentially moderating elevated post-fire soil pH and facilitating microbial succession.

P.; Jackson, C. E.; Young, K.; DeSchamphelaere, K.; Colbourne, J. K.; Shaw, J.

However, studies measuring the effect of chemical exposure on mutation rate and spectra have not considered the ecological and evolutionary backgrounds of studied genotypes, which could influence the rates and patterns of germline mutations in altered environments, e.g., chemical pollution. Utilizing a study of natural Daphnia pulex populations, we conducted a comprehensive experiment to test our hypothesis that adaptation to chemical pollution also protects the germline from mutagenesis. We, 1) identified Daphnia pulex populations that have adapted to live in mining-devastated regions by increasing their cadmium tolerance. 2) We completed a mutation-accumulation (MA) experiment with an adapted genotype to measure the germline mutation rate in both control conditions and an environmentally relevant cadmium concentration. 3) We compared these MA experiment results to a previously reported, identically designed MA experiment with a nonadapted genotype. We report that patterns of cadmium-induced mutagenesis in the adapted genotype were reversed compared to our previous observations in the nonadapted genotype. Cadmium exposure altered the single nucleotide mutation (SNM) rate in the same genome regions in adapted and nonadapted genotypes, but the rates were changed in opposite directions. Cadmium also altered specific SNM classes in these genotypes in opposite directions. The reversal of mutational trends in the adapted genotype suggests protection against cadmium genotoxicity. We further demonstrate that adapted populations have elevated gene copy-number and expression levels of metallothionein, the protein that protects against cadmium toxicity by binding to cadmium irreversibly.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.; Arrieta, A. F.; Tepole, A. B.", "abstract": "Accurate in vivo characterization of skin mechanical properties is essential for diagnostics and treatment planning across dermatological and surgical applications. Existing noninvasive techniques are limited in capturing the nonlinear and anisotropic behavior of skin. In this work, we propose a Bayesian inference framework that leverages active membranes to induce desired deformations and infer patient-specific skin properties from a measured strain field. A finite element model of skin-membrane interaction, parameterized using the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden model, is used to generate strain field data under various membrane actuation conditions. To overcome the computational cost of repeated simulations required for Bayesian sampling, we construct a data-driven surrogate using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and Gaussian process regression for rapid evaluation. Our approach enables probabilistic inference of key skin parameters, including shear modulus, fiber stiffness, dispersion, and orientation. An advatange of the proposed method is that inference of skin biomechanics does not require direct force measurements. Rather, the method relies on known properties of active membranes (which can be tested ahead of time). The method does require strain field measurements. Through synthetic studies, we demonstrate that our method accurately recovers most model parameters even under moderate levels of spatially correlated noise, and that multi-frame or multi-membrane observations significantly enhance identifiability. These results establish the potential of active membranes as a viable platform for noninvasive, in vivo skin biomechanics assessment.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "To act adaptively, animals must infer features of the environment that cannot be observed directly, such as which option is currently rewarding, or which context they are in. These internal estimates, known as hidden states, guide behaviour but are inherently uncertain. Theoretical models propose that efficient inference requires tracking both the most likely state and the uncertainty of that estimate. While neural representations of state identity have been described in cortical and hippocampal circuits, the origin of uncertainty signals remains unclear. Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) reflects this uncertainty during hidden state inference. Using fibre photometry in mice performing a probabilistic two-armed bandit task, we found that ACh release in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus tracked recent omission history and predicted whether animals would switch choice on the next trial. Blocking muscarinic receptors with scopolamine selectively impaired loss-driven switching without affecting stable performance. A hidden-state inference model in which ACh modulated how uncertainty from past experience shaped future beliefs reproduced both the physiological and behavioural effects, whereas alternative models did not. These results identify ACh as a neuromodulatory signal reflecting uncertainty during hidden-state inference, linking theoretical models of belief updating to their biological implementation in the mammalian brain.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Recent reports suggest that FGF13 is secreted and regulates neuronal VGSCs through interactions with extracellular domains of integral plasma membrane proteins, yet supportive data are limited. Using rigorous positive and negative controls, we show that transfected FGF13 is not secreted from cultured cells in a heterologous expression system nor is endogenous FGF13 secreted from cultured neurons. Further, employing multiple unbiased screens including proximity protein proteomics, our results suggest FGF13 remains within membranes and is unavailable to interact directly with extracellular protein domains.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the dentate undergoes extensive restructuring, including loss of local inhibition. It is unknown how circuit changes impact dentate network computations in awake behaving animals. Here we perform high-density tetrode recordings from the dentate in male rats treated with systemic kainic acid (KA) to induce TLE. In KA-treated rats, dentate spatial representations were less precise at the single neuron level, however the stability of the spatial code in representing repeated visits to the same location was retained at the population level. Despite spared spatial representation, the network computations for pattern separation were disrupted. The reorganized dentate network in KA-treated rats generated less distinct population activity patterns for different environments, specifically as a result of impaired rate-remapping. Changes in network computations paralleled impairments in a dentate-dependent memory task, potentially providing a link between altered pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These deficits were present in animals with confirmed dentate circuit reorganization that had not yet developed spontaneous seizures - suggesting that the dentate network changes underlying altered rate-remapping and impaired dentate-dependent memory occur early in epileptogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

Yet, human EEG/MEG studies have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because they used correlative approaches that did not consider causal phase-perception relationships. In a multi-day computational EEG study, we developed the neurobehavioral link function (NBLF) as a new approach to model individual sinusoidal relationships between the alpha phase and multisensory perception and to test for causality. Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis. A follow-up psychophysical experiment confirmed individual phase-dependent effects at 5 and 10 Hz, but not 15 Hz. Our results suggest that the individual alpha phase causally modulates perceptual cycles in multisensory integration and advocate for personalized, phase-targeting strategies in neurotechnologies.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "The aim of animal breeding is to select the genetically best animals in the current generation to improve the performance of future generations for a specific breeding goal. With the continuous shift in breeding goals towards more balanced breeding, new traits may become of interest. Knowledge of the (indirect) selection history of these traits would be insightful before a trait is included in the breeding goal. Two models, BayesS and [G], have been developed to assess the selection history of traits. BayesS estimates a parameter (s) that reflects the relationship between estimated additive effects and minor allele frequency, while [G] calculates the expected genetic change of a trait based on allele frequency changes and estimated additive marker effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of estimating s-values (based on BayesS) and [G] in an animal breeding context, focusing on their ability to detect selection for a trait with low heritability. Both [G] and s-value estimation were applied to a simulated dataset of a commercial pig breeding program under phenotypic selection, with varying heritabilities (0.05, 0.1, 0.3) and 30 generations of ongoing selection. Overall, both models were able to detect selection, where higher heritabilities and a larger sample size (for s-value estimation) or a larger selection interval (for [G]) resulted in increased detection of selection. The preferred model to identify selection varied based on the available data of the breeding population.", "date": "2025-11-12", "journal": ""}
