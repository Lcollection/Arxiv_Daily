Recent study of post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene expression led to the suggestion of a regulatory role for pre-mRNA splicing. Here, using a hybrid capture approach to purify incompletely spliced, chromatin-associated pre-mRNAs, we use deep sequencing to study pre-mRNA splicing of the NF-kB transcriptome. By freezing transcription and examining subsequent splicing of complete transcripts, we find many introns splice tens to hundreds of times slower than average. Investigating the basis of these delays, we focused on evolutionarily conserved introns with suboptimal splice donor sequences and found that strengthening these donor sites by as few as two nucleotides in minigene reporter assays markedly increased gene expression for several targets. This suggests that such sites can act as timing elements that both delay mRNA production and limit expression amplitude. To broaden this mechanistic view, we applied deep learning sequence-to-function models with feature attribution to identify additional regulatory sequences--both intronic and exonic--that may contribute to delayed splicing through mechanisms independent of donor site strength. This integrated approach revealed non-canonical motifs enriched in slow-splicing introns, pointing to a broader repertoire of cis-elements that can fine-tune transcript maturation during inflammation. Together, these findings support a model in which the temporal regulation of pre-mRNA splicing serves as a layer of control in inflammatory gene expression, and raise the possibility that similar timing mechanisms operate in other rapid-response transcriptional programs.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Small molecule binding within internal cavities provides a way to control protein function and structure, as exhibited in numerous natural and artificial settings. Unfortunately, most ways to identify suitable cavities require high-resolution structures a priori and may miss potential sites. Here we address this limitation via high-pressure solution NMR spectroscopy, taking advantage of the distinctive nonlinear pressure-induced chemical shift changes observed in proteins containing internal cavities and voids. We developed a method to rapidly characterize such nonlinearity among backbone 1H and 15N amide signals without needing to have sequence-specific chemical shift assignments, taking advantage of routinely available 15N-labeled samples, instrumentation, and 2D 1H/15N HSQC experiments. From such data, we find a strong correlation in the site-to-site variability in such nonlinearity with the total void volume within proteins, providing insights useful for prioritizing domains for ligand binding and indicating mode-of-action among such protein/ligand systems. We suggest that this experimental approach is a rapid and useful probe of otherwise hidden dynamic architectures of proteins, providing novel insights and opportunities into ligand binding and control.\n\nSignificance StatementMany proteins can be regulated by internally binding small molecule ligands, but it is often not clear a priori which proteins are controllable in such a way. Here we describe a rapid method to address this challenge, using solution NMR spectroscopy to monitor the response of proteins to the application of high pressure. While the locations of NMR signals from many proteins respond to high pressure with linear chemical shift changes, proteins containing internal cavities that can bind small molecule ligands respond with easily identified non-linear changes. We demonstrate this approach on several proteins and protein/ligand complexes, suggesting that it has general utility.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Biochemical and biophysical characterization showed that the resulting fusion protein after expression, solubilization and purification was monodisperse and able to bind the known {beta}1AR weak partial agonist cyanopindolol, and the antagonist propranolol. The protein particles comprised sufficient mass and discernable structural features to elucidate its cryo-EM structure in complex with cyanopindolol without any natural (G-proteins, arrestins) or artificial (Nanobodies, DARPins) binding partners, to an overall resolution of 4.2 [A]. The seven-helix architecture and helix eight, as well as both GPCR - AmpC {beta}-lactamase connections are clearly resolved. {beta}1AR is in its inactive conformation. 3D variability analysis revealed significant flexibility between the two protein domains and within the GPCR helices, offering insights into conformational dynamics. The map contains clear density for the cyanopindolol. The fusion protein geometry theoretically fits a wide range of class A GPCRs, presenting a powerful platform for structure elucidation of a diverse array of class A GPCR - ligand complexes by cryo-EM in the inactive receptor state.

This multi-subunit complex comprises two modules that are physically linked by the subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in metazoans). The Core Module, with two DNA-dependent ATPases and several additional subunits, promotes DNA unwinding. The Kinase Module phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNApII subunit Rpb1, initiating a cycle of CTD modifications that coordinate exchange of initiation and elongation factors. Why these two disparate activities are bundled into one factor is not obvious, but the connection may provide temporal coordination during early initiation. When Tfb3 is split into two parts to uncouple the TFIIH modules, the resulting cells are viable but grow very slowly. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the split TFIIH shows that the Core Module, but not the Kinase, is properly recruited to promoters. Instead of the normal promoter-proximal peak, high CTD Serine 5 phosphorylation is seen throughout transcribed regions. Therefore, coupling the TFIIH modules is necessary to localize and limit CTD kinase activity to early stages of transcription. These results are consistent with the idea that the two TFIIH modules began as independent functional entities that later became connected by Tfb3 during early eukaryotic evolution.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

If expression involves decision-making, then the defence may only be expressed when the right environmental cues are available (cryptic plasticity). Even if defences wane, they could be quickly restored once selection resumes as animals can learn by observing others (social memory). Here we tested cryptic plasticity and social memory under relaxed selection in a cuckoo host, the Common Reed Warbler, by manipulating perceived parasitism risk with social information in geographically-distinct areas differing in allopatry (100 to 1000 years). Despite predicting social information of a cuckoo vs. a control would elicit otherwise cryptic behavioural defences, only birds that mobbed model cuckoos prior to manipulation upregulated this defence, and only in the more recently allopatric population. Social information also had no effect on low-to-absent rates of foreign egg rejection, a second line of defence common to cuckoo host species. These results contrast with parasitised locations where similar methods provoke mobbing and increase egg rejection ten-fold. Our study therefore demonstrates that, even when manipulating information to account for reaction norms, behavioural defences may degrade rapidly under relaxed selection, and thus facilitate a geographic mosaic of coevolution.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

To explain our sense of visual stability, it has been suggested that the brain encodes the location of attended visual stimuli in an external, or spatiotopic, reference frame. However, such spatiotopy is seemingly at odds with the fundamental retinotopic organization of visual inputs. Here, we probe the spatial reference frame of vision using ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI and voxel-level receptive field modeling, while manipulating both gaze direction and spatial attention. To manipulate spatial attention, participants performed an equally demanding visual task on either a bar stimulus that traversed the visual field, or a small stimulus at fixation. To dissociate retinal stimulus position from its real-world position the entire stimulus array was placed at one of three distinct horizontal screen positions in each run. We found that population receptive fields in all cortical visual field maps are pinioned to the retina, irrespective of how spatial attention is deployed. This pattern of results is strong evidence for a fully retinotopic reference frame for visual-spatial processing. Reasoning that a spatiotopic reference frame could independently be computed at the population level of entire visual areas rather than in individual voxels, we additionally used Bayesian decoding of stimulus location from the BOLD response patterns in visual areas. We found that decoded stimulus locations also adhere to the retinotopic frame of reference. Again, this result holds for all visual areas and irrespective of the deployment of spatial attention. Our findings reorient the search for visual stability mechanisms toward transient sensorimotor interactions rather than static spatiotopic maps.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

The capacity of streptomycetes to adapt to various environments is reflected in the sheer size of their genomes and the number of encoded regulatory proteins. The nutrient-rich laboratory conditions significantly differ from the natural habitat of streptomycetes and fail to stimulate their full range of adaptive behaviors; as a result, the majority of biosynthetic gene clusters remain silent. Moreover, the use of rich media has led to the assumption that nutrient depletion ultimately promotes sporulation. However, we demonstrate that S. coelicolor colonies can respond to nutrient depletion by undergoing a previously unidentified phenotypic transition termed \"foraging\" due to its submerged and continuous growth on depleted media. The foraging phenotype is distinctly different from conventional phenotypes in terms of colony morphology, genomic stability, and metabolomic profile. This adaptation to nutrient deprivation through foraging is found throughout the Streptomyces phylogeny, indicating that the phenotype is highly conserved. Furthermore, foraging S. coelicolor gains the ability to inhibit molds and enhanced competitive activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria is detected in other species. These findings highlight how morphological adaptations of streptomycetes in nutrient-limited environments alter secondary metabolite production, enabling the screening of novel antimicrobial activities.

In this study, we propose an interpretable and scalable inference framework, DeepTX, that leverages deep learning methods to connect mechanistic models and scRNA-seq data, thereby revealing genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics. This framework enables rapid and accurate solutions to transcription models and the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Applying this framework to several scRNA-seq datasets of DNA-damaging drug treatments, we observed that fluctuations in transcriptional bursting induced by different drugs was associated with distinct fate decisions: IdU treatment was associated with differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells by increasing the burst size of gene expression, while low- and high-dose 5FU treatments in human colon cancer cells were associated with changes in burst frequency that corresponded to apoptosis- and survival-related fate, respectively.

Here, we show that task-irrelevant exposure to natural scene images induces robust VPL, while artificial images that lack complex structure characteristics of natural scene images, known as higher-order statistics, do not. Behavioral and fMRI results suggest that although unsupervised learning underlies VPL, it can be suppressed by top-down attention. Higher-order statistics may evade this suppression, possibly because their slower processing reaches visual areas beyond V1 outside the optimal temporal window for attentional suppression. These findings suggest that unsupervised learning underlies VPL, but its occurrence depends on both higher-order stimulus structure and the brain's attentional gating mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Recent progress has incorporated biochemical properties as discrete per-residue features, but such localized signals cannot represent the continuous hydrophobic and electrostatic environments that span protein surfaces and interior volumes. Here we introduce BC-DESIGN, a biochemistry-aware inverse design framework that integrates geometric structure with smoothly varying hydrophobicity and charge properties. These properties are represented independently of residue coordinates on compact point clouds sampled throughout protein surfaces and interiors. This formulation provides a natural spatial description of physicochemical environments and enriches structural cues without specifying amino-acid identities. On the CATH 4.2 benchmark, BC-DESIGN achieves 90% sequence recovery and generalizes robustly across protein lengths, contact-order regimes, and major fold classes. Masking experiments further demonstrate an interpretable fidelity-diversity control: full biochemical context yields high-fidelity reconstructions, whereas withholding information enables exploratory variant generation. Beyond diagnostic benchmarks, BC-DESIGN demonstrably improves functional design outcomes across diverse settings. It increases enzyme-substrate affinity, enhances peptide-receptor design accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art recovery and structural fidelity in antibody loop (CDRH3) modeling. In these applications, the model not only reconstructs native-like sequences but also proposes plausible functional variants that preserve catalytic or binding geometry, such as generating CDRH3 loops that maintain antigen-contact configurations while offering new sequence solutions.

DomainSeeker partitions AlphaFold2-predicted structures into domains using clique analysis based on predicted aligned errors, then fits these domains into target densities segmented from input cryo-ET maps. Each domain-density fit is evaluated globally and locally to derive prior probabilities, which are subsequently integrated with complementary data, such as cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), through Bayesian inference to compute posterior probabilities.

Neuromusculoskeletal simulations may help to better understand individual aspects of the underlying neural control, but are currently incapable of predicting adaptations to the continuous perturbations imposed by split-belt walking.\n\nMethodsWe extend a spinal reflex model with a biologically inspired model of the cerebellum, which enables error-based motor adaptation by modulating spinal control parameters in response to mismatches between a continuously updated internal prediction and actual motor outcomes. In this work, the cerebellum modulates only a single spinal control parameter, the timing of swing initiation in each leg, which allows examining its isolated contribution to gait adaptation as all other reflex pathways are held constant. We created 80 s predictive simulations of the model walking on a split-belt treadmill with a 2:1 belt-speed ratio, and compared predicted spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics to the reflex-only model and literature.\n\nResultsThe reflex-only model could walk on the split-belt treadmill, but showed no step length adaptations. In contrast, the extended model adapted SLA from an initial asymmetric value toward symmetry or beyond, following an exponential time course similar to that observed in experiments. The model could adapt at varying rates and converge to different asymmetry levels. We found that, in simulation, SLA adaptation during split-belt walking is possible without changes in reflex gains, by adapting the timing of swing initiation. The modulation of timing alone also predicted the experimentally observed exponential adaptation in the temporal domain, but only a linear change in the spatial domain, indicating that additional control mechanisms are likely required to reproduce the full spatial adaptation observed in split-belt walking.\n\nConclusionWe propose a computational model of the cerebellum which, when integrated into a spinal reflex model, autonomously drives feedforward gait adaptations during split-belt walking. This advances the current state of predictive simulations and may eventually help to better understand specific adaptation processes.

Theoretical models consistently show that epidemics are smaller in populations with higher among-individual heterogeneity in susceptibility. Experimental tests of these predictions are rare but critical for understanding how heterogeneity in susceptibility shapes epidemics in natural systems. We directly link data-parameterized models from previous dose response experiments in the house finch and Mycoplasma gallisepticum system to experimental epidemics in replicated aviary mesocosm flocks. We manipulated flock-level heterogeneity in susceptibility by seeding epidemics in flocks composed of either pathogen-naive or previously exposed birds, which prior work showed have higher heterogeneity in susceptibility relative to pathogen-naive populations. We tracked epidemics for over two months, combining empirical data and stochastic compartmental models to address how heterogeneity in susceptibility changes epidemic severity. Consistent with previous work, estimates of heterogeneity in susceptibility based on coefficients of variation were higher for flocks given prior pathogen exposure relative to pathogen-naive flocks. However, in contrast with prior work on individually-housed birds which showed relatively homogeneous susceptibility for pathogen-naive birds, the pathogen-naive flocks in this study were better described by heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, models of susceptibility. This suggests that flock-level epidemics captured sources of heterogeneity absent in controlled experiments, such as transmission heterogeneity. Finally, although prior exposure conferred protection from disease at the individual level, we did not detect predicted effects of prior exposure and its associated flock-level heterogeneity on prevalence. However, our ability to detect effects of prior exposure on flock-level prevalence was obscured by unexpected variation in the competence of the initially pathogen-naive index birds that seeded each epidemic. This variation in infectiousness among index birds significantly predicted flock-level prevalence, with low index bird infectiousness contributing to the absence of detectable epidemics in two of the three naive flocks. Our stochastic simulations generated a wide range of prevalence outcomes for small epidemics over the timescales examined, further underscoring the challenges of measuring transmission dynamics in naturalistic settings, where unexpected variation in host traits such as competence can obscure other factors of interest.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Within a stress and photosynthesis-associated gene co-expression module, we identified SbDUS2, a member of family of enzymes, conserved across eukaryotes, which catalyzes the reduction of uracil to dihydrouridine (DHU) on RNA molecules. DHU-modified transcripts in this module were enriched for photosynthetic functions and showed strong correlation with photosynthetic traits.

Furthermore, when exposed to heat or water-limiting conditions, these mutants showed significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation and survival. Using multiple transcriptome-wide RNA stability assays, we demonstrated that transcripts associated with lower DHU level in a dus2 background generally exhibited increased stability compared to Col-0 controls. Particularly, lack of DUS2 led to the hyperstability of photosynthesis-related transcripts, impeding their turnover and likely preventing proper photosynthetic acclimation during stress.

Key proteins dictating stress granule formation and disassembly, such as TDP43, contain low-complexity (LC) domains that drive fibril formation.

These findings shed light on the complex evolutionary dynamics of OsHV-1 and its interactions with oyster hosts. Understanding how this virus adapts to host genetic diversity is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its impact on the oyster farming industry and provides valuable insights into the broader mechanisms of viral evolution in response to host variation.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Whether genetic risk in specific pathways correlates with corresponding biological dysfunction remains largely unknown. We developed an endolysosomal pathway-specific polygenic risk score (ePRS) using 14 well-established AD risk alleles implicating ELN genes. We investigated the association between ePRS and AD neuropathology, then examined cell-specific endolysosomal morphology and transcriptomic profiles in post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from donors stratified by ePRS burden. We found that the ePRS was significantly associated with AD diagnosis and neuropathological measures, comparable to a pathway-agnostic PRS despite representing far fewer loci. High ePRS correlated with increased neuronal endosome volume, number and perinuclear aggregation independent of AD pathology. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed cell type-specific transcriptomic changes associated with ePRS status, influencing glutamatergic signaling, protein homeostasis, responses to DNA damage and immune function. Neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia each showed varied gene expression patterns associated with ePRS burden. Together, these results provide evidence that AD genetic risk variants harboring ELN genes correlate with endolysosomal dysfunction in human brain tissue. These findings suggest that pathway-specific genetic risk contributes to corresponding cellular pathology in AD and nominates candidate mechanisms by which ELN AD variants contribute to pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Single cell RNA sequencing was performed on side branch and main duct IPMN biospecimens.\n\nResultsWe identified a subpopulation of histologically low-grade IPMN epithelial cells that express malignant transcriptional features including KRT17, S100A10 and CEACAM5, markers that are enriched in PDAC. We validated this high-risk gene signature in both single-cell RNA sequenced samples and an external ST dataset containing a larger number of IPMN samples including non-tumor bearing IPMN (i.e. low-grade IPMN in isolation).

Notably these studies use 'arms' comprising a single duplex whereas more complex nanostructures, DNA origami, can have a multitude of duplexes bundled together to produce different structural properties. Herein I introduce DNAns bundling two duplexes together, commonly known as the double crossover (DX) motif to enable multi scale mechanical design of hydrogels with interchangeable strands, i.e. modular DX-DNAns hydrogels. This is achieved by rational design of the internal structure to coordinate the propagation of forces both within and across the different motifs driving unique organizational aspects which produce specific viscoelastic features, as evidenced by bulk-scale rheological profiles herein. This work begins to bridge the broad range of complexities available with DNA origami based nanostructures to the more application based potentials for macro-scale nanostructured materials with specified functionalizations. Particularly I elucidate the versatility of this method by implementing a DNA based pH response motif, i-motif, which has thus far only enabled switchable mechanical properties from the gel-to-sol states but herein there are graded changes in mechanistic properties while sustaining the gel state, a feat which has only been achieved via strand displacement in DNAns hydrogels thus far.

L.", "abstract": "Synonymous codon usage significantly influences mRNA stability in yeast by guiding mRNA decay during translation. The CCR4-NOT complex is central to this process, interacting with ribosomes when the A and E sites are unoccupied-a state that arises when a non-optimal codon with low tRNA availability is at the A site. This triggers recruitment of decay factors, reducing the stability of transcripts enriched in such codons. In humans, codon-mediated mRNA decay is less well understood. Recent research has identified a related but distinct mechanism called P-site tRNA-mediated decay (PTMD). Unlike yeast, human CCR4-NOT recruitment depends on specific arginine codons (CGG, CGA, or AGG) at the P site and slow decoding at the A site, allowing E-site vacancy and CNOT3-dependent binding. Through analysis of public datasets, we explored the characteristics of human transcripts enriched in PTMD codons. Interestingly, these codons are mostly found in transcripts with longer half-lives. This suggests that, rather than targeting already unstable mRNAs as in yeast, PTMD in humans selectively reduces the stability of otherwise long-lived transcripts, indicating a regulatory role distinct from the decay associated to codon usage.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

While existing methods rely on statistical models, motif enrichment, or prior-based inference, they often depend on deterministic assumptions about regulatory relationships and rely on static regulatory databases. Few approaches effectively integrate prior biological knowledge with data-driven inference to capture novel, dynamic, and context-specific regulatory interactions.\n\nResultsTo address these limitations, we develop scRegulate, a generative deep learning framework leveraging variational inference to estimate TF activities guided by experimental TF-target gene relationships and progressively adapted based on the input scRNA-seq data. By integrating structured biological constraints with a probabilistic latent space model, scRegulate offers a scalable and biologically grounded estimation of TF activity and gene regulatory network (GRN). Comprehensively bench-marking on public experimental and synthetic datasets demonstrates scRegulates superior ability. Further, scRegulate accurately recapitulates experimentally validated TF knockdown effects on a Perturb-seq dataset for key TFs. Applied to experimental human PBMC scRNA-seq data, scRegulate infers cell-type-specific GRNs and identifies differentially active TFs aligned with known regulatory pathways. scRegulates TF activity representations capture transcriptional heterogeneity, enabling accurate clustering of cell types. scRegulate is highly efficient, frequently an order of magnitude faster than common baselines.

To balance rapid sliding with strong specific binding, TFs were proposed to switch between search and recognition conformations. For E. coli lac repressor (LacI), the folding of the hinge helices has been implicated in the conformational switch. Here, we tested how mutations in the hinge region impact the search speed and binding stability. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we selected two LacI mutants favoring either search or recognition conformation. We measured the binding kinetics of the mutants both in vitro on DNA microarrays with 2,479 different Lac operators and in vivo via single-molecule experiments. We conclude that a hinge region mutation causing less helix propensity enhances the specificity but reduces binding strength globally, while a hinge region mutation causing higher helix propensity has opposite effects. However, altered specificity impacts the search time less than expected. Instead, the major effect was impaired dissociation in response to IPTG induction for the strongly binding mutant. Together with earlier reports of affinity-inducibility trade-offs in LacI, our data support the model in which the hinge region governs a trade-off between binding stability and inducibility rather than between speed and binding stability.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Using genomic and electronic health record data from 13,143 individuals in the Biorepository for Integrative Genomics, we applied a hierarchical community detection algorithm to classify individuals by the proportion of the genome shared identical by descent. This approach identified four major communities concordant with continental ancestry and seventeen subcommunities capturing fine-scale demographic structure beyond conventional ancestry classifications. Integrating neighborhood-level geographic data and census-derived environmental metrics revealed unequal exposure to environmental stressors across IBD-defined subcommunities. IBD-based grouping improved statistical modeling of disease risk and identified subpopulations with elevated rates of respiratory and dermatological conditions. We implemented an open-source dashboard that enables real-time clinical decision support and public health surveillance by correlating IBD-defined subcommunities with disease prevalence and environmental exposures-a unique capability that transforms biobank data into actionable insights for participants while maintaining privacy.

Several dynamical and anatomical measures, such as timescales and neurotransmitter receptor expression, have independently been linked to the cortical hierarchy. However, a systematic and quantitative characterisation of the relationship between spontaneous spiking activity and the cortical hierarchy remains elusive. Here, we test the hypothesis that single-neuron spontaneous spiking statistics uniquely characterise each cortical area, and that they quantitatively correlate with the cortical hierarchy. We study the spontaneous activity of neurons in seven macaque cortical areas (V1, V4, DP, 7A, M1, PMd, PFC) in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions recorded in a dim-lit room. First, we uncover that the firing rate, inter-spike interval variation, and cross-correlation form a unique fingerprint of the cortical areas, but only when considering them in combination. Second, we show that the differences between the spiking statistics correlate with multiple anatomical markers of the cortical hierarchy. This effect is much stronger in the eyes-closed condition, suggesting that visual input or the expectation thereof modulates the hierarchical organisation of resting-state activity. We also observe an increase in timescales up the hierarchy, in agreement with previous findings. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spontaneous single-neuron spiking activity reflects the hierarchical organisation of the cerebral cortex: distinct spiking statistics for hierarchically distant areas; similar statistics for nearby areas.

Our comprehension of such regulation in mammals has required recognizing distinct sleep stages. Drosophila melanogaster is an important genetic model system for studying sleep. Since the discovery of sleep-like states in the fly 25 years ago, the field has treated sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting 5 minutes or longer, despite convergent work suggesting the existence of multiple sleep states. Here, we establish that three distinct sleep states in flies can be classified based on simple inactivity duration criteria. We show that the daily initiation of these sleep states is temporally distinct, with long sleep occurring immediately following the largest daily period of wakefulness. We also report that rebound in response to mechanical sleep deprivation is present only in long sleep and comes at the expense of shorter sleep states. Deprivation-induced decreases in shorter sleep states obscure homeostatic sleep rebound, but only when sleep is measured using traditional methods.

R.; Zhang, M.; Liu, Y.; Nussinov, R.", "abstract": "Cancer-prone alleles exhibit single hotspot mutations. However, the combination of a cancer hotspot and a weak or moderate mutation (the 'one-two punch' hypothesis) produces same-allele double variants with a significantly different and potentially graded clinical phenotypic spectrum. Oncogenic PI3K variants, which are also associated with benign tumors and neurodevelopmental disorders, offer statistical support for this model. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we revealed that PI3K variants with single and double mutations exhibit expanded conformational profiles. Double mutations significantly shift the conformational ensembles toward the active form--a more pronounced effect than a single mutation. These double mutants facilitate nSH2 release, iSH2 shift, and A-loop protrusion in solution, promoting PIP2 substrate recruitment at the membrane. We discovered that observable, potentially drug-targetable cryptic pockets are PI3K mutation-specific. Ab initio discovery of these pockets through simulations is essential for AI-aided virtual drug screening. A key challenge is that a single drug is often ineffective against PI3K variants due to their diverse conformational spectra. To address this, we propose a conformational selection strategy involving a combination of allosteric drugs for variants with graded conformational spectra, particularly those with strong double mutations; we identified such potentially targetable cryptic pockets in double mutants conformers.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

In addition to persistent legacy compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), various pollutants are less persistent but are chronically released, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalate diesters (PAEs), pyrethrinoid pesticides, and insect repellent. Heretofore, these pollutants have received insufficient attention in freshwater reptiles, considering their potential to trigger detrimental effects on organisms. During two years (2019 and 2020), we quantified plasma levels of 46 compounds from 7 chemical families in two monitored populations of the protected European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in the Camargue wetland, France. PAHs and PAEs were found predominantly and concomitantly, with similar occurrences and levels in the two populations. We observed similar inter-annual variations in PAHs and PAEs with differences between males and females, highlighting the need for a better assessment of the role of sex in the exposure pathway and the toxicokinetics of contaminants, especially in turtles. The negative relationship between PAH levels and age, as well as the high intra-individual variation in levels of both contaminant families, provides further evidence of limited bioaccumulation of these pollutants in the blood of E. orbicularis. This could be explained by the metabolic biotransformation of parent compounds, highlighting the need to quantify the levels of PAH metabolites and phthalate monoesters. Finally, our work underscores the importance of long-term monitoring to better determine the vulnerability of turtle populations already exposed to a wide range of contaminants.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

In this study we describe a  lab-in-the-field approach to investigate the microbiota of field-grown tomato plants. High-throughput amplicon sequencing revealed a three-microhabitat partition, phyllosphere, rhizosphere and root interior, differentiating host-associated communities from the environmental microbiota. An individual bacterium, classified as Acinetobacter sp., emerged as a dominant member of the microbiota at the plant-soil continuum. To gain insights into the functional significance of this enrichment, we subjected rhizosphere specimens to shotgun metagenomics. Similar to the amplicon sequencing survey, a  microhabitat effect defined by a set of rhizosphere-enriched functions was identified. Mobilisation of mineral nutrients, as well as adaptation to salinity and polymicrobial communities, including antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), emerged as a functional requirement sustaining metagenomic diversification. A metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) representative of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was retrieved and metagenomic reads associated to this species identified a functional specialisation for plant-growth promotion traits (PGPTs), such as phosphate solubilization, siderophores production and reactive oxygen species detoxification, which were similarly represented in across tomato genotype-independent fashion. Our results revealed that the enrichment of a beneficial bacterium capable of alleviating plants abiotic stresses appears decoupled from ARGs facilitating microbiota persistence at the root-soil interface.\n\nIMPORTANCETomatoes are at centre-stage in global food security due to their high nutritional value, widespread cultivation, and versatility. Tomatoes provide essential vitamins and minerals, contribute to diverse diets, and support farmer livelihoods, making them a cornerstone of sustainable food systems. Beyond direct dietary benefits, the intricate relationship between tomatoes, their associated microbiota, and ARG is increasingly recognised. Tomato plants host diverse microbial communities in association with their organs, which influence plant health and productivity. Crop management impacts on composition and function of these communities, contributing to the prevalence of ARG in the soil and on the plants themselves. These genes can potentially transfer to human pathogens, posing a food safety and public health risk. Understanding these complex interactions is critical for developing sustainable agricultural practices capable of mitigating the impact of climatic modifications and the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

This feedback drives the spontaneous formation of local cell accumulations, characterized by sharp cell-density gradients, even in the absence of physical boundaries. By following the dynamics of bacterial condensation in uniform acidic environments, we show that condensation is critically constrained by the spontaneous emergence of correlated bacterial swimming and the associated active turbulence. These collective behaviors generate vortex-like cell motion with a pronounced radial component directed down the cell-density gradient. This, in turn, induces local fluid motion that broadens the condensate and expels non-chemotactic bacteria. When condensates are strongly confined in thin layers, the radial component of fluid motion diminishes and condensation is enhanced. Moreover, in porous environments, correlated bacterial motion is strongly suppressed, allowing spontaneous condensation to progress even further until it reaches the limits imposed by the non-local nature of bacterial chemotaxis. Overall, these findings highlight the fundamental interplay between self-generated bacterial condensation and correlated swimming.\n\nSignificance statementSelf-induced condensation and active turbulence are two prominent forms of collective bacterial behaviors. However, their interplay has not been experimentally studied. Here, we show that collective bacterial condensation gives rise to correlated swimming, which in turn fundamentally limits further condensation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in dilute porous environments--common in natural bacterial habitats--correlated swimming is strongly suppressed, enabling the spontaneous formation of extremely dense cell condensates. These condensates may serve as a basis for the development of more structured bacterial communities.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

To investigate how these processes interact in layer 2/3 of mouse V1 we combined calcium imaging, optogenetics and circuit modelling. We find that locomotion preferentially increases gain in pyramidal cells (PCs) that sensitize during visual stimulation compared to those that depress. A model explains this differential modulation through three mechanisms: (i) variations in the strength of PV and SST connectivity to individual PCs, (ii) broad locomotion-dependent weakening of PC and PV synapses, and (iii) reduced SST inhibition targeting sensitizing PCs. These results demonstrate that behavioural state selectively shifts cortical computation toward distinct adaptive regimes. The apparently paradoxical combination of increased PC gain but decreased synaptic strength is consistent with a state-dependent gating mechanism that boosts signals leaving V1 while simultaneously preventing disruption of the local excitatory-inhibitory balance required for stable computation.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Successful memory formation is typically associated with reduced alpha/beta power (i.e., the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect) and an increased number of eye movements. However, the functional relevance of these two memory correlates has primarily been investigated in isolation, leaving their coupling and combined contribution to memory formation largely unknown. Here, we address this gap through four experiments involving simultaneous eye-tracking and scalp or intracranial electroencephalography recordings while participants viewed scenes either freely or under varying levels of visual constraint. Across experiments and cohorts, we identified the degree of visual exploration, rather than subsequent memory performance, as the consistent and robust modulator of alpha/beta power reductions. Going beyond correlations, manipulating eye movements dissociated alpha/beta power reductions from memory. Combined with the finding that saccade parameters predicted the dynamics of alpha/beta activity, our results directly link alpha/beta activity to the oculomotor system. Moreover, we show that the accumulation of saccades over time accounted for the reduced alpha/beta power, resembling the pattern typically observed after stimulus onset. Our work demonstrates that neglecting eye movements results in an incomplete understanding of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect. Together, the evidence points at alpha/beta activity directly reflecting eye movements, and only indirectly, memory formation. The current study thus bridges two lines of previous research and advocates for new perspectives on the specific interpretation of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect and on the function of alpha/beta activity in general.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

This requires associating internal position estimates with external cues to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. However, how grid cell representations evolve in novel spaces to support map formation is unclear. To address this question, we longitudinally imaged calcium dynamics of grid cells over 10 days as mice learn operant tasks in novel virtual linear tracks. We observe that spatial tuning of grid cells is present immediately in novel tracks but evolves as a significant fraction of spatial fields shift backward on a run-by-run basis, within and across days. Backward shifts are more prevalent and persistent in successful learners. The fields gradually stabilize across days, anchored by landmarks, suggesting slow plasticity. The backward shifts partially reset daily, reflecting a slower consolidation timescale. While individual fields of a cell shift differentially, co-active fields of co-modular grid cells shift together, indicating their coupled dynamics on the same two dimensional torus. Spatial learning leads to systematic changes and stabilization of their population phase trajectory, including lateral shift, rotation, and phase resets at landmarks, forming a landmark-fragmented representation for the environment. Next, we build an entorhinal hippocampal model that provides a mechanistic explanation of the diverse phenomena - grid field shifts, increasing fidelity, and fragmentation of the spatial map - and predicts slow Hebbian plasticity in the hippocampus-to-entorhinal pathway. Supporting this, electrophysiology demonstrates that learning-performance-correlated weakening of local inhibition facilitates potentiation of indirect hippocampal inputs to superficial MEC. Together, our study provides multifaceted evidence of slow hippocampus-to-MEC plasticity, elucidating the formation of stable and fragmented cognitive maps that combine internal and cue-driven positional estimates in rich environments during learning.

This systematic review evaluated and synthesized experimental models of increased maternal stress during pregnancy in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs share key pregnancy characteristics with humans, including relevant placental structure, maternal hormonal recognition of pregnancy and precocial offspring development. We identified 43 studies using various experimental approaches categorized into three main types: behavioral models, drug/substance exposure models, and physiological challenge models. These studies demonstrated significant fetal and offspring effects, particularly sex-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, maternal physiological adaptations were often superficially characterized, focusing primarily on weight gain and occasional stress hormone measurements.

The Extraintestinal Pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) ST131 is a globally distributed multidrug-resistant human pathogen associated with urinary tract and bloodstream infections. Antibiotic-resistant infections often lead to antibiotic treatment failure, underscoring the need of developing alternative treatments. The highly selective antimicrobial potential of CRISPR-Cas9 has been demonstrated in a range of model organisms. However, the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 in combating ST131-associated infections and the consequences of CRISPR-Cas9 treatment, such as the emergence of escapers, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of CRISPR-Cas9 against ST131 and assessed the frequency and genetic basis of escape. We conjugatively delivered CRISPR-Cas9 to ST131 isolates which carried cefotaxime-resistance-encoding target gene blaCTX-M-15 in the chromosome and characterized escape subpopulations. Two main types of escapers emerged: blaCTX-M-15-positive escapers carried dysfunctional CRISPR-Cas9 systems and arose at a ~10-5 frequency. Instead, blaCTX-M-15-negative escapers presented chromosomal deletions involving blaCTX-M-15 loss. The frequency of blaCTX-M-15 loss depended on the blaCTX-M-15 genetic context. Specifically, blaCTX-M-15-negative escapers emerged at low frequency (~10-5) in isolates where blaCTX-M-15 was located downstream of insertion sequence (IS) ISEcp1, while escapers emerged with high frequency (~10-3) in isolates where blaCTX-M-15 was flanked by IS26.

However, it remains unclear whether copper-coordinating residues are more prone to oxidation than non-coordinating ones, and how their susceptibility changes between the apo and copper-bound states. The copper chaperone PcuC, important for cytochrome c oxidase assembly in bacteria, contains a canonical binding site composed of two histidines and two methionines (H51xnM63x22H86xM88), as well as a disordered C-terminal extension enriched in methionine and histidine. To quantify methionine oxidation sensitivity in both apo- and Cu-bound PcuC, we used a methionine-specific oxaziridine probe combined with mass spectrometry and compared labeling patterns to those generated by 18O-labeled hydrogen peroxide. We show that methionine residues display distinct oxidation sensitivities in the apoprotein, and that the oxaziridine reacts similarly to H 18O . Importantly, this probe enables quantification of methionine oxidation independently of hydroxyl radicals generated by copper-driven Fenton chemistry, which lacks residue specificity. In the copper-bound form, Cu binding strongly alters methionine reactivity, with a marked increase in oxidation of the coordinating Met63 and Met88. Structural analysis revealed that two copper ions occupy the canonical site, while the C-terminal extension does not contribute to coordination. Comparison of structural features and oxidation values showed that methionine sensitivity correlates with solvent exposure in the folded domain, but with local positive charge in the disordered region.

Although MPB contributes to net protein balance (NB), a primary contributor of sarcopenia is anabolic resistance, defined as the blunted MPS response to anabolic stimuli such as feeding. While candidate mechanisms of anabolic resistance have been identified, none singularly accounts for the observed reduction in MPS. Instead, multiple mechanisms likely act simultaneously and interactively to suppress MPS. Studying these interactions experimentally is challenging. Mathematical modeling is well suited to analyzing complex biological phenomena such as anabolic resistance.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed a previously developed kinetic model of leucine-mediated signaling and protein metabolism in human skeletal muscle to systematically investigate potential mechanisms contributing to anabolic resistance. Using global sensitivity analysis, we identified key controllers of MPS, MPB, and NB. We then simulated amino acid feeding in older adults, classified the responses as either anabolic sensitive or resistant, and compared the resulting parameter distributions of the two groups. We next performed targeted analysis to evaluate the effects of individual and combined putative mechanisms of anabolic resistance on muscle metabolism. Finally, we simulated therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring muscle metabolism.\n\nResultsThe sensitivity analysis revealed that MPS and MPB are primarily controlled by their proximal signaling processes, while NB is largely driven by MPS dynamics. Exploratory simulations showed that several parameters and signaling protein concentrations, particularly those controlling MPS, differed significantly between anabolic sensitive and resistant groups. The targeted simulations indicated that multiple dysregulated mechanisms were required to account for the experimentally observed reductions in MPS in older adults. Therapy simulations showed that single-target interventions could largely restore MPS when isolated mechanisms were perturbed (e.g., increasing mTORC1 sensitivity, enhancing p70S6K levels), but a multifactorial approach was required to recover muscle metabolism when all anabolic resistance mechanisms were present.\n\nConclusionThis study highlights the multifactorial nature of anabolic resistance and the implications for therapy. Specifically, the results motivate new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms most likely to be impaired and argue for multi-target therapeutic strategies to help restore muscle protein metabolism in aging.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Tools such as Triplexator have predicted vast numbers of lncRNAs and DNA sites with triplex forming potential, yet there remains a pressing need for advanced computational methods that can refine and extend these predictions. In this study, we developed ten (10) deep neural network models that predict the potential of lncRNAs and DNA sites to form triple helices on a genome-wide scale. To prepare our dataset, we first used Triplexator to screen out lncRNAs and DNA sites with low triplex-forming potential. We then trained different deep learning architectures, including two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNN), residual neural networks (ResNN), long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Among these architectures, our lncRNA_CNN and LSTM3-RNN both achieved a mean AUC of 0.99 for lncRNA features at a kernel size of 32 and a learning rate of 1e-3. For DNA site features, our DNA_CNN achieved the best performance with a mean AUC of 0.98 under the same conditions.

Triplexator have also predicted vast amounts of lncRNAs and DNA sites that has the potentials of becoming a triplex structure.

We identified distinct cellular states associated with specific pathological features that show dynamic distributions between acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), organized within unique spatial niches that reveal progression mechanisms from early injury to unresolved disease. Gene regulatory analyses prioritized key transcription factor activities (SOX4, SOX9, NFKB1, REL, KLFs) and their target networks establishing disease states and tissue microenvironments.

Visual perception is heterogeneous around the visual field: it is better along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and better along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA). Recently, we showed that visual adaptation is more pronounced at the horizontal than the vertical meridian, but whether and how this differential adaptation modulates the effects of covert spatial attention remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether and how the effects of endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) covert attention on an orientation discrimination task vary at the cardinal meridians, with and without adaptation. We manipulated endogenous (Experiment 1) or exogenous (Experiment 2) attention via an informative central or uninformative peripheral cue, respectively. Results showed that (1) in the non-adapted condition, the typical HVA and VMA emerged in contrast thresholds; (2) the adaptation effect was stronger at the horizontal than the vertical meridian; and (3) regardless of adaptation, both endogenous and exogenous attention enhanced and impaired performance at the attended and unattended locations, respectively, to a similar degree at both cardinal meridians.

DNA barcoding and metabarcoding have emerged as cost-efficient, standardized methods for characterizing local biodiversity. Based on the sequencing of a small targeted gene fragment, it is theoretically possible to identify a wide diversity of taxa by comparing them with reference sequence databases. However, a key challenge for accurate taxonomic classification is the incompleteness of such databases, leading to most query sequences lacking species-level matches. 2. Where species-level matches are missing, it may be possible to classify query sequences to a higher taxonomic level, such as genus or family, based on the similarity of related reference taxa. The challenge then lies in confidently recognizing whether the sequence belongs to an unobserved (here, \"novel\") taxon on a given taxonomic level. 3. In this study, we evaluated the performance and utility of several methods for taxonomic classification. Methods were assessed based on the classification accuracy of both observed and novel taxa, training time, space requirements, and run time. We did this for two cases: the COI barcode for arthropods, and the ITS barcode for fungi, with the latter representing an instance with substantially greater sequence similarity variation within classes. To test classification of novel taxa, we used well-curated datasets with partially distinct taxonomic distribution between the training and test set. Novel taxa occurred at all evaluated taxonomic levels, such as novel species in observed genera and novel genera in observed families. We further assessed the effect on performance when shifting from full-length barcodes to shorter sequences as generated through metabarcoding in the testing dataset. 4. This study sheds light on the strengths and limitations of different classification algorithms across varied ecological contexts and provides guidance for researchers in selecting suitable algorithms for DNA barcoding and metabarcoding applications. In particular, it demonstrates the supreme performance of phylogenetic placement methods such as EPA-ng for classification of arthropod COI barcodes, and composition-based classifiers such as SINTAX, RDP-NBC, and IDTAXA for fungal ITS.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

In W. chondrophila, the two Ndk proteins encoded by ndk paralogs retain conserved kinase motifs but differ in subcellular localization, suggesting divergent functional roles. According to localization studies performed in heterologous expression systems, WcNdk1 is confined to the inclusion and probably supports nucleotide metabolism, while WcNdk2 localizes to the host nucleus, perinuclear space, and Golgi apparatus, suggesting involvement in host interaction. Azidothymidine (AZT), a known Ndk inhibitor, impaired W. chondrophila growth, potentially through inhibition of WcNdk2.

Additionally, precise transgene control is crucial for optimizing human cell-based gene therapies. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have facilitated major advances in disease modeling and the potential for regenerative medicine. Still, they are significantly limited by the lack of inducible transgenic systems that avoid silencing but maintain robust inducibility after differentiation to defined cell lineages. Here we systematically characterize the leakiness, inducibility, and tunability of multiple existing and novel transgenic systems in hPSCs and differentiated macrophages and microglia. Notably, we report the application of a small molecule-mediated splicing switch (Xon) that allows for tunable transgene expression both before and after differentiation, without the large protein tags required for current state-of-the-art degron-based methods. We use Xon to achieve tight control of reporter genes, overexpression of multiple neurodegeneration-associated genes, and Cas9-mediated genome editing. We also characterize the current limitations of this system and describe approaches that can alleviate some of these limitations. By assessing multiple transgenic systems whose inducibility spans the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels, we highlight and improve upon a major technical challenge that hinders basic, translational, and clinical research in physiological human-based systems.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Here, metagenomics was used to examine the taxonomic and functional features of the rhizosphere microbial communities of hazelnut trees differing in their levels of resistance to A. anomala: highly tolerant Corylus americana, and resistant and susceptible Corylus avellana. No statistically significant differences in microbial alpha diversity or beta diversity were noted between the three rhizosphere groups. Compared to bulk soil, all three rhizosphere groups were enriched for the fungal phylum Basidiomycota and bacterial phylum \"Candidatus Rokubacteriota\". At the genus level, the bacterial genera Actinospica, Occallatibacter, and \"Candidatus Sulfotelmatobacter\" were under-represented, while the genus Rhizobacter was over-represented, in the resistant and susceptible C. avellana rhizosphere samples compared to the bulk soil. A total of 45 dereplicated, high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were generated, corresponding to 41 bacteria and 4 archaea. Many of the MAGs carried multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, including MAGs corresponding to the genera Lysobacter and Actinospica. Overall, the low differentiation of the rhizosphere microbiomes suggest that differences in A. anomala disease expression are likely not associated with differences in the rhizosphere microbiome.

Cell death modalities are a crucial component of the innate immune system and are key to controlling intracellular and extracellular infections. Human caspase-4 and -5 are cysteine proteases activated upon intracellular detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and triggers pyroptosis, a lytic and pro-inflammatory form of cell death. However, the interaction between these caspases and other cell death modalities remains poorly understood. Here, we build on evidence that caspase-4 can engage in crosstalk with the apoptotic executioner caspases-3 and -7. Our work validated caspase-3 and -7 as direct substrates of caspase-4 and -5, and demonstrated that this specificity was regulated by exosite interactions as opposed to the tetrapeptide. Using AlphaFold, we generated an interaction model between caspase-4 and executioner caspases-3 and -7. From this, we experimentally validated the importance of a hydrophobic interface on caspase-3 and -7 that engaged the caspase-4 exosite, enabling their recognition and cleavage. Importantly, this interface is not used by the apoptotic initiator caspase-8, which cleaved caspase-3 in a tetrapeptide-dependent manner. Our work highlights that inflammatory caspases have evolved a novel mechanism to coordinate crosstalk between pyroptotic and apoptotic signalling, and suggests that these pathways may synergise for the efficient amplification of cell death pathways.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Luolishaniids are a highly derived and disparate clade of (typically) armoured lobopodians widely interpreted as having a suspension-feeding ecology based on the presence of five or six anterior pairs of setulose appendages. Luolishaniids are globally widespread and represent the only Cambrian non-biomineralized free living epibenthic bilaterians regarded as having a suspension feeding mode of life, but their proposed ecology only relies on a qualitative interpretation of their functional morphology. Here we test the hypothesis that the setulose appendages of luolishaniids were adapted for a suspension feeding function. Quantitative morphological comparisons reveal a positive and statistically significant relationship between body length and the mesh spacing of the setulose anterior limbs of luolishaniids. This pattern correlates with suspension-feeding scaling in extant aquatic organisms, and suggests that luolishaniids primarily fed on mesoplanktonic seston. We provide quantitative evidence for suspension-feeding in luolishaniids, which represents the first statistically supported example of modern-like predator-prey scaling patterns observed in Cambrian soft-bodied metazoans.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Thus, the selection nature of a mutation (deleterious, neutral, or beneficial) should be interpreted by the means of the population average. For instance, a neutral mutation on average could be slightly deleterious in some individuals, and slightly beneficial in others. It has been recently demonstrated that the effect of FSI is important in molecular evolution especially when the effective population size (Ne) is not small. Intriguingly, a novel pattern of molecular evolution called selection duality, i.e., mutations that are statistically slightly beneficial are subject to a negative selection, emerges under the condition that selective advantage is less than FSI. While FSI sheds some lights on the long-term neutralist-selectionist debate, an immediate question is how to calculate the strength of FSI-genetic drift relative to the Ne-genetic drift. In this article we develop a statistical method the relative FSI strength (F): if F is close to 0, the Ne-genetic drift is dominant; whereas the FSI-genetic drift is dominant if F is close to 1. One may tentatively set F=0.5 as an empirical criterion to weigh between those two genetic drifts. Our case study showed that the relative FSI-strength F is over 0.5 in most species, suggesting that the FSI-genetic drift, rather than the Ne-drift, plays a major role in metazoan genome evolution.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Humanization was achieved through transplantation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HU-CD34+) or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HU-PBMC). Both models successfully reconstituted human T-cells systemically, with stronger engraftment in HU-CD34+ mice. We observed selective infiltration and spatial organization to intracranial GBM tumors, including exhausted, memory-like, and regulatory CD4+ T-cell phenotypes, TIM-3+ immunosuppressive-like myeloid cells and intratumoral B cells. Mouse microglia-derived tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) remained the dominant immunosuppressive immune population. Anti-PD-1 therapy, but not anti-GITR, modestly modulated the infiltration dynamics, demonstrating the susceptibility of the reconstructed adaptive immunity to immunotherapeutic intervention.

Conventional syngeneic and GEMM models fail to recapitulate these features, contributing to the translational disconnect between preclinical success and clinical failure. Humanized mice provide a solution to interrogate human-specific immunity in vivo, but their use in GBM has remained limited. Here, we provide the first comparison of GBM PDOX modeling in two complementary modes of humanization based on CD34+ HSCs and PBMCs. We systematically profile systemic and intratumoral compartments, showing that these models faithfully reconstitute human adaptive immunity and capture the interplay with the murine brain TME. Furthermore, we demonstrate clinically-relevant responses upon treatment with checkpoint antibodies targeting PD-1 and GITR, showing modulation of human immune subsets without altering murine TAM immunosuppression, underscoring the translational value of the system.

These MKs process and present antigen to activate T cells in an MHC II-dependent manner. MK-T cell interactions induced TGF-{beta}1 secretion and promoted induced regulatory T cell differentiation. Immunopeptidomics of MK MHC II receptor confirmed occupancy by exogenous peptides, demonstrating in vivo functionality. Using a model with MK-targeted deletion of MHC II (Pf4-MHC{Delta}/{Delta} mice), we observed altered TLR signaling, reduced bone marrow TGF-{beta}1, and decreased numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. Together, these findings identify MHC II+ MKs as noncanonical antigen-presenting cells that modulate adaptive immunity and maintain the hematopoietic niche.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMHC II-positive megakaryocytes present antigen, express co-stimulatory receptors, and activate CD4+ T cells.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) impose a substantial health care burden with increase antimicrobial resistance and treatment failure rates. Proteus mirabilis is a challenging UTI pathogen due to intrinsic resistances coupled with formation of crystalline biofilms. We combined pangenome analysis, antimicrobial resistance gene (AMR) predication, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to determine whether highly multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of P. mirabilis arise from distinct lineages and explored the clinical utility of multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The pangenome of 1,002 P. mirabilis genomes from human urine revealed an open conformation driven by strain diversity and the accessory genome. A total of 213 sequence types (STs) were identified and only 7% had [&ge;]11 genomes, highlighting strain diversity. 93% of the P. mirabilis genomes harbored resistance genes for [&ge;]2 antibiotic subclasses, and 25% were predicted to be resistant to >6 subclasses, confirming a high MDR burden. By focusing on the 15 most prevalent STs, we observed that AMR subclasses were largely lineage-specific. However, isolates with very high resistance gene counts (>20) were distributed across multiple STs, indicating that extreme resistance gene accumulation is not restricted to ST. Comprehensive AST of 27 P. mirabilis clinical isolates further revealed variable genotype-phenotype concordance, indicating unresolved mechanisms of resistance not captured in current AMR prediction databases. In summary, our study emphasizes the critical need to expand genomic surveillance of P. mirabilis to fully understand the complex landscape of AMR in this species and translate these insights into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\nIMPORTANCEProteus mirabilis is a clinically-challenging cause of urinary tract infections due to multidrug resistance and its ability to form crystalline biofilms that provide further antibiotic protection. In this study, we sought to determine how well sequence typing and antimicrobial resistance gene prediction correlate with laboratory-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. By analyzing more than 1,000 P. mirabilis genomes from human urine samples, we found that some resistance patterns were sequence type-specific. However, the genome structure of this species suggests frequent horizontal gene transfer, and the most highly-resistant strains did not cluster by lineage. Importantly, many isolates that appeared \"susceptible\" based on their genomes were in fact resistant upon laboratory testing, revealing hidden or uncharacterized resistance mechanisms. These findings show that current gene-based prediction tools can miss clinically relevant resistance, underscoring the need for further study to guide effective treatment of P. mirabilis infections.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes a latent infection of neurons, where it persists for life with the capability to reactivate. During latent infection, heterochromatin is deposited onto the viral genome to presumably permit viral gene silencing. Repressive histone modifications associated with the latent genome include the constitutive heterochromatin modifications, H3K9me2/3, and the facultative heterochromatin modification, H3K27me3. The role of these different types during entry into latency and as substrates for reactivation is unknown. H3K27me3 is associated with Polycomb silencing, and a second modification also associated with Polycomb silencing, especially in pluripotent cells and during early development, is H2AK119ub1. Here we found that H2AK119ub1 is enriched on a sub-population of latent HSV genomes. We examined the contribution of both H2AK119ub1 and H3K7me3 deposition to HSV-1 gene silencing during entry into latency. We found that H2AK119ub1 was deposited prior to H3K27me3 and that only inhibition of H2AK119ub1 deposition plays a subtle role in latency establishment. Importantly, we found that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that deposits H2AK119ub1 during latency establishment prevented later reactivation. In contrast, inhibiting the activity of PRC2, which deposits H3K27me3, did not impact reactivation. Together, these data demonstrate the heterogenic nature of the epigenetic structure of latent HSV genomes and provide evidence that those associated with H2AK119ub1 are the template for reactivation.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Although its expression has been extensively characterized in the cortex and basal ganglia, its organization within the adult thalamus remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of FoxP2 protein expression across thalamic nuclei in mice, rats, and macaques, with a focus on nuclei associated with higher-order cognitive functions and language-related circuits in humans. We found that FoxP2 is expressed in most thalamic nuclei across species, with a consistent absence in the reticular nucleus and zona incerta. Expression was highest in midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas the anterior group showed low and variable expression among species. Macaques exhibited broader and, in some nuclei, more intense FoxP2 expression, particularly in associative regions such as the pulvinar, lateral geniculate, and parts of the ventral group, indicating increased specialization of thalamocortical pathways. This distribution suggests a conserved role for FoxP2 in shaping thalamic circuits supporting sensorimotor integration, attention, memory, and linguistic processing. Phylogenetic comparisons further indicate that enhanced FoxP2 expression in associative thalamic territories in primates, likely intensified in humans, may have contributed to the evolution of neural circuits required for speech and language. These findings provide molecular and anatomical insights into how FoxP2 helps organize thalamocortical networks relevant both to language function and to neuropsychiatric disorders involving thalamocortical dysconnectivity.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Yet, the molecular programs governing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a critical cell-autonomous regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair. Reanalysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing from MS lesions revealed WWOX as one of the most significantly dysregulated oligodendroglial genes. Conditional deletion of Wwox in oligodendroglia impaired OPC differentiation, favouring aberrant proliferation and blocking myelin regeneration after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Single-nucleus transcriptomics confirmed profound transcriptional reprogramming in WWOX-deficient oligodendroglia during remyelination, with enrichment of WNT and TGF{beta} signalling and cell cycle programs. Mechanistically, WWOX physically interacts with the master transcription factor SOX10 via its WW1 domain, stabilising SOX10 protein and sustaining its downstream myelin gene network. Loss of WWOX reduced SOX10 stability and activity, providing a direct mechanistic link to defective OPC differentiation. Together, our findings uncover WWOX as an essential orchestrator of remyelination and position the WWOX-SOX10 axis as a promising therapeutic target for enhancing myelin repair in MS and related demyelinating disorders.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

B.; Adams, D. C.; Valenzuela, N.", "abstract": "The genetic architecture underlying diverse vertebrate sex-determining systems remains elusive despite evidence of changes in upstream regulators and downstream mediators. Here we modeled species-specific regulatory networks of gonadal development for turtles with contrasting mechanisms [Apalone spinifera - ZZ/ZW genotypic sex determination (GSD), and Chrysemys picta - temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD)] using matched time-course sampling. We uncovered key steps in the evolutionary transition in sex determination by testing for conservation or divergence of network modular components. Specifically, we tested these alternative hypotheses: first, transcription factor (TF) hubs and their target genes are conserved between species (null H0); second, the same TF hub acquired a new set of target genes in a species, retaining or not ancestral functions (H1 and variants); third, a new TF hub takes over the regulation of the former gene targets of an ancestral TF (H2); and finally, complete overhaul occurs where both ancestral TF hubs and their target genes were replaced in a species (H3). Results implicate primary cilia as integrators of environmental signals underlying TSD, as known thermosensitive TSD components (e.g., calcium-redox, pSTAT3, Wnt/Rspo1/B-catenin, Dhh) are linked to primary cilia. TFs that evolved between species also regulate primary cilia and point to key changes in their sensory machinery that accompanied TSD-GSD transitions (e.g., calcium/ion channels or membrane transport components in Chrysemys versus structural elements and ciliogenesis in Apalone). This novel Primary Cilia Integration hypothesis expands current models of epigenetic regulation of turtle sexual development, the evolution of plasticity versus canalization, and warrants functional validation.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

This behavioral screen revealed that animals follow distinct individual aging trajectories. The behaviors of long-lived animals differed markedly from those of short-lived animals, even relatively early in life, and were linked to organ-specific transcriptomic shifts.

Although numerous approaches have been proposed to identify such genes, we consider an axiomatic approach based on defining properties that a specificity measure should have. This leads us to develop ember (Entropy Metrics for Biological ExploRation), which we show is the only method satisfying four key desired properties for a specificity measure. Applying ember to eight tissues from eight founder mouse strains, we find that gene specificity is often unintuitive: canonical markers can be supplanted, housekeeping genes are context-dependent, and mouse strain can drive unexpected cell type switching. Unsupervised learning on entropy metrics uncovers shared genes specialized to male gonads and kidney, as well as genes specific to non-consecutive developmental stages in the kidney. To facilitate further exploration of gene specificity in mice, we have also developed a comprehensive specificity database, along with a web interface and API. Extending ember to a human PBMC dataset collected from 255 diverse individuals, we find that variation in PBMCs is largely localized to classical monocytes.

This approach combined classical differential analysis, random forest and support vector machine classifications, gene set functional enrichment analysis to construct the most stable and reliable gene signature.\n\nResultsClassical differential analysis did not separate clearly samples into healthy and T1D clusters, but rather spread samples into three clusters. On the contrary, we show that our approach, which combined molecular signatures independently constructed, adds robustness to the analysis without compromising the specificity. This efficiency was demonstrated by the clear separation of the samples according to their diagnosis group. Also, the functional annotation of the gene modules that we obtained was more associated with T1D-related pathways compared to the classical statistical analysis.\n\nImpactsThese results emphasize that single differential analyses are not able to capture immune continuums involved in such a complex pathophysiological process.

Two main accounts have been proposed: the causal hypothesis, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the statistical hypothesis, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using multimodal fMRI in 287 participants from the BIL&GIN cohort, we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition. Task-based activation was measured during line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state functional connectivity metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains.

In one case, serum neutralization developed against a specific phage but not against a subsequent, distinct phage cocktail targeting the same organism, suggesting variability in phage immunogenicity.\n\nConclusionOverall, intravenous phage therapy frequently induces IgM responses, which are more pronounced in immunocompetent patients, while cytokine dynamics depend more on pathogen and immune status than on phage administration itself. These findings underscore the need for standardized immune profiling in clinical phage trials to delineate beneficial versus detrimental immune responses and to inform the design of phage formulations with optimized immunogenic profiles.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

In humans, autosomal dominant mutations in SPECC1L cause a syndrome characterized by craniofrontonasal anomalies including broad nasal bridge, ocular hypertelorism, prominent forehead, and cleft lip/palate. Complete loss of SPECC1L in mice on a homogenous genetic background results in perinatal lethality, accompanied by subtle cranial differences and incompletely penetrant cleft palate. This lethality limits postnatal analysis of craniofacial development. Because cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) contribute extensively to the formation of anterior craniofacial structures, we investigated whether disruption of SPECC1L in CNCCs contributes to the craniofrontonasal phenotypes observed in SPECC1L-related syndrome. We generated a Specc1l-floxed allele and crossed it with the Wnt1-Cre2 deleter strain, which drives Cre recombinase expression in the dorsal neuroectoderm and NCCs. Most homozygous mutant Specc1l{Delta}CNCC mutants survived postnatally and exhibited hallmark features of the human SPECC1L-related syndrome, including shortened skulls, reduced frontal bone area, nasal defects, and midface hypoplasia. The cranial mesenchyme of Specc1l{Delta}CNCC mice displayed shortened primary cilia and increased Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activity at E13.5, as evidenced by enhanced GLI1 immunostaining. These defects were also observed early in E9.5 facial prominences, indicating that they are etiologic in nature. Collectively, Specc1l{Delta}CNCC mice provide a novel model for investigating the roles of CNCCs, primary cilia, and Hh signaling in frontonasal prominence and midfacial development.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), deposits on the apical side of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), signify a distinctive and critical AMD phenotype. Yet, their molecular basis and relationship to the conventional drusen seen in AMD remain unclear.\n\nResultsWe generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells from a clinically phenotyped cohort comprising only individuals with conventional drusen (AMD/RPD-) or drusen coexisting with RPD (AMD/RPD+). From these cells, we generated single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional data to identify differences between the two cohorts. We show that AMD/RPD+ RPE cells exhibit enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, cytoskeletal, and hypoxia-responsive programs, whereas AMD/RPD- RPE cells display a relatively greater representation of mitochondrial and protein homeostasis pathways. Both subtypes engaged pathways classically linked to ageing, including ECM remodelling and mitochondrial function, but differed in the direction and extent of these changes. Expression and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) highlight shared genetic influences on mitochondrial and iron-handling pathways, while disease-interacting eQTLs and transcriptome-wide association study identify regulatory signals that are distinctive of the RPD subtype within AMD, including through regulation of ECM. Functionally, all iPSC-derived RPE formed drusen-like deposits in vitro: AMD/RPD-lines generated more basal deposits, whereas AMD/RPD+ cells exhibited greater structural instability under bisretinoid-induced stress.\n\nConclusionsThese findings indicate that AMD with and without RPD represent mechanistically distinct entities and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity in AMD.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

By anchoring each somatic read to a parental germline lin-eage, LongPhase-S provides a phase-resolved view in which germline and somatic reads are disentangled across the genome. Building on somatic haplotyping, LongPhase-S trains a phase-aware purity estimator that outperformed existing methods.

In this study, we selected different genotypes of cotton varieties, XJ12 and XJ21-11, to investigate the effects of long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions on cotton photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation, flowering time, and related gene expression, utilizing physiological index measurements, transcriptomics, and WGCNA analysis. The results indicated that LD treatment significantly enhanced photosynthetic parameters and dry matter weight in both cotton varieties, with the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) being 154.79% and 111.86% higher under LD compared to SD treatment. Additionally, the flowering time of the two varieties was advanced by 12 and 13 days, respectively, under LD treatment relative to SD treatment. LD conditions promoted gene expression in sucrose and starch metabolism, facilitating cotton growth. Furthermore, LD inhibited the expression of genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby altering the secondary metabolism of cotton, and activated transcription factors through signaling pathways (including phytohormone signaling and MAPK signaling pathways) and biological clock rhythms, which induced earlier flowering in cotton.

Thus, the alcohols interacting nonspecifically with membrane affect various membrane targets and inhibit Hxt2 from the lateral membrane-facing side, thereby supporting the lipid theory. The alcohols exerted similar potencies at a constant membrane concentration (Cm), regardless of the chain length.

Here, we integrate metabolite profiling with thermodynamic analysis to examine this phenomenon in engineered strains of Escherichia coli and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and compare them to Z. mobilis, a native ethanol producer. In the engineered strains, fermentation cessation coincided with marked pyruvate accumulation, due to a lack of ability to convert pyruvate to ethanol. This resulted in a local thermodynamic equilibrium at the pyruvate kinase reaction, as determined by Max-Min Driving Force (MDF) analysis. Relaxing constraints on pyruvate and related metabolites restored positive MDF values, implicating thermodynamic limitations as the underlying constraint.

While existing EMG-based controllers often achieve substantial reduction in muscle effort, they frequently incur increased cognitive and attentional load for the user, thereby compromising the overall efficacy of the assistance. Here we introduce a novel EMG-based assistive controller founded upon neuroscience principles, specifically the observation that humans naturally exploit gravity torque to facilitate movement control. Therefore, deviating from conventional compensation strategies, our approach purposely leaves a fraction of the predicted human gravity torque uncompensated so that users can still take advantage of gravity as they would without assistance. Through a load-carrying arm movement task, we show that enabling gravity exploitation improves traditional EMG-based assistance by achieving a significant reduction in muscle effort, while concurrently yielding superior kinematic performance (i.e., faster, smoother movements) and enhanced subjective user experience. These findings demonstrate that integrating principles from neural motor control into assistive controllers allows to implement a favorable tradeoff between muscle effort reduction and functional usability.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Addressing this, we characterized hippocampal subfield border variability in two ultra-high-resolution postmortem MRI datasets with combined annotated histological sections, including cases with and without dementia. We examined: 1) the order of appearance and disappearance of subfields along the long axis of the hippocampus; 2) the order of appearance and disappearance of subicular subregions; 3) the medial-lateral position of subicular subregional boundaries along the hippocampal body; 4) the location of the CA3 relative to hippocampal head digitations; 5) the subfield borders in the hippocampal body relative to a volume proportion of the dark band; and 6) the association of hippocampal length and subiculum-CA1 border location with diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging.

Here, we introduce LumiFAST, a small tunable luciferase engineered by fusing the bright blue-light emitting NanoLuc with the tunable chemogenetic fluorescent reporter pFAST. pFAST binds and stabilizes the fluorescent state of a variety of synthetic fluorogenic chromophores (also called fluorogens). Its proximity with NanoLuc leads to efficient bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), enabling customizable red-shifted emission. Thanks to the small size of pFAST, LumiFAST maintains a compact structure, while its modular design allows emission color to be tuned from cyan to green, yellow, orange and red simply by changing the fluorogen. Systematic optimization of the fusion topology and linker length yielded an optimal variant with apparent BRET efficiencies reaching up to 90 %. The red-shifted emission of LumiFAST enables dual-color microscopy imaging when used alongside NanoLuc and allows imaging through thick scattering media.

Three predictions of the model are: geometric similarity precedes evolutionary allometry, geometric similarity is a temporary phase, and all allometric traits undergo geometric scaling during initial divergence. All predictions were supported by data for three locomotor traits in pygopodid lizards. An implication of these results is that geometric scaling, driven by natural or sexual selection, may be a mechanism for peak shifts on an adaptive landscape.

Notably, LPL, APOBR, APOM (lipid metabolism), NOTCH2, TREH ({beta}-cell/endocrine regulation), and HLA-A, OAS3 (immune response) converged on three biological axes central to T2D pathophysiology. The directionality of molecular effects was consistent with known disease mechanisms, including insulin resistance (LPL, APOBR), {beta}-cell stress (TREH, NOTCH2), and chronic inflammation (OAS3). Conclusions Our findings indicate that variants falling below conventional GWAS significance thresholds can have demonstrable effects on gene expression and protein levels. This underscores the importance of prioritizing biological relevance alongside statistical significance, rather than relying solely on rigid p-value cutoffs.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

S.; Uversky, V. N.", "abstract": "CpG islands are genomic regions enriched in cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides, typically associated with gene promoters and regulatory elements. While their role in transcriptional regulation is well established, their influence on protein sequence composition remains underexplored. In this study, 3,222 essential proteins from Homo sapiens were analyzed to investigate the impact of CpG island architecture on amino acid usage, sequence complexity, and chromosomal distribution. Codons containing both cytosine and guanine were mapped to five CpG induced amino acids, and their relative abundance was quantified across proteins. CpG induced regions were identified using a sliding window approach, and metrics such as average CpG density, longest CpG induced region length, and sequence coverage were computed. Motif composition within these regions was characterized using polarity and charge-based indices. Clustering revealed consistent bipartite subgroup structures, indicating compositional stratification among essential proteins. Shannon entropy quantified compositional complexity, revealing a significant shift between clusters (p = 5.50 x 10-145). Cluster~1 proteins showed lower entropy and greater heterogeneity, whereas Cluster~2 showed higher entropy and tighter distributions, indicating distinct regimes of variability. Additionally, we examined CpG island overlap within coding exons of essential genes and found that CpG-depleted proteins are predominantly encoded by genes with minimal CGI coverage, whereas CpG-induced proteins span both low- and high-overlap classes. CGI-associated CpGs were consistently enriched toward the 5' end of essential genes, indicating a positional bias in CpG distribution. These findings establish a quantitative framework linking CpG island distribution to proteomic architecture and offer a scalable strategy for motif annotation, epigenetic modeling, and functional stratification. Future applications include predictive modeling of protein function, disease association, and regulatory dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

D.; Plate, L.", "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient thyroid hormone (T3T4) production. Thyroglobulin (Tg) serves as the prohormone for T3 and T4 production, with many variants of uncertain clinical significance due to genetic diversity in the Tg gene. We leveraged the large-scale All of Us biobank to investigate the disease association of prevalent yet undercharacterized Tg variants. We related variant presence to thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and levothyroxine (LT4) usage as proxies for thyroid function. This identified R152H, Q870H, A993T, P1012L, and P1494L variants linked to increased LT4 usage and decreased thyroid function, while the R320C variant was associated with decreased thyroid function. Molecular characterization in Fisher rat thyroid cells revealed decreased secretion efficiency of R152H, Q870H, and R320C variants. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry demonstrated that secretion-deficient variants showed higher engagement with the protein homeostasis network, indicating protein quality control defects as the pathophysiology mechanism. In contrast, secretion-competent A993T and P1494L variants showed elevated interactions with degradation and antigen-presentation pathways, suggesting an alternative pathophysiology possibly linked to Hashimoto disease, an autoimmune condition with overproduction of autoantibodies that target thyroid proteins. In support, participants carrying the A993T or P1494L variants had elevated anti-TPO antibody levels. We estimate ~150,000 US individuals currently taking levothyroxine could benefit from precision medicine targeting these variants, with ~100,000 carrying Q870H. Our findings highlight the power of combining large public biobank data with molecular characterization to understand Tg genotype-to-phenotype relationships.

To address this challenge, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that discovers adaptive treatment strategies using only experimentally accessible, population-level measurements. The RL agent learns to infer the hidden physiological state of the population and leverages this knowledge to maintain control even under conditions not encountered during training. Moreover, when granted control over nutrient availability, an important driver of physiological change often overlooked in antibiotic treatment protocols, the agent consistently drives population extinction, surpassing adaptive protocols based solely on drug dynamics. This computational framework offers a powerful, data-driven approach for designing adaptive treatment strategies to counter the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Behavior of polymers can be understood in terms of generic behavior. Specifically, phase behavior can be understood in terms of solvent quality and chain length. The theory is well established for homopolymers, and specific heteropolymer structures, in particular random and co-block polymers. However, protein sequences are neither of these. Nevertheless, there is a clear link between sequence and properties, which has given rise to the concept of molecular grammar. In this article, we establish a framework to understand the behavior of Sturmian polymers, which provide a reasonable non-random polymer model for disordered proteins. Specifically, we show that molecular grammar arises as a non-linear critical susceptibility near the {theta} transition of single chains. We demonstrate that molecular grammar exists in polymer melts, where is determines a length scale under which chains are compressed, and above which chains are expanded.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

We evaluated environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding coupled with species distribution modeling (SDM) as a tool to study habitat use of cetaceans along the Washington State coast, USA. Seawater was collected at the surface and at a 50 m depth from 43 sites (86 samples) during the 2019 U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem & Acoustic-Trawl Survey. A partial section of the mitochondrial control region was amplified with cetacean-specific primers, sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, and taxonomically assigned with a curated reference database. Nine species were detected; we modelled the three most frequent: Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) (10 detections), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (8 detections), and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) (6 detections). Binomial generalized additive models related presence-absence to bathymetry, distance to shore, longitude, slope, and sea-surface temperature; model performance was assessed with stratified five-fold cross-validation. SDMs explained 17-51% of null deviance and presented high specificity ([&ge;]0.80). The Pacific white-sided dolphin showed the highest eDNA presence probabilities offshore, beyond the shelf break. Humpback whale eDNA presence probabilities showed hotspots along the shelf break with secondary high-probability patches in near-shore waters. Risso's dolphin eDNA presence probabilities were elevated in offshore zones characterized by steep bathymetric gradients, particularly northwest of the sampled transect. These spatial patterns are consistent with historical visual-acoustic records, suggesting that eDNA-informed SDMs can capture cetacean habitat use.

Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising matrix but has extremely low protein concentration. This study applies an amphipol (APol)-based concentration method to enhance detection of potential PM biomarkers in the EBC proteome. Methods: Four replicate EBC samples from a healthy individual were processed using APols or lyophilization. Subsequently, 145 EBC samples from PM patients (n=25), lung cancer patients (n=28), asymptomatic asbestos-exposed individuals (n=60) or healthy controls (n=32) were concentrated with APols and analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Technical variability from batch effects and collection devices was addressed using omicsGMF, for simultaneous imputation and covariates correction. Statistical analysis employed linear models with technical and clinical covariates. Results: APols outperformed lyophilization, yielding 1.7-fold higher proteome coverage and improved reproducibility. Although high data missingness was observed, proteome analysis across 145 samples identified 248 unique proteins. OmicsGMF corrected the substantial variability, while maintaining biological signal. Whereas unsupervised clustering did not reveal distinct disease-specific patterns, supervised statistical analysis detected overall subtle differences between clinical groups (PERMANOVA p-value = 0.008), though no individual proteins reached statistical significance after adjustment for technical and clinical covariates and correction for multiple testing. Conclusion: APols outperforms lyophilization for concentrating proteins in low-abundant EBC samples, enabling enhanced proteome coverage for biomarker discovery studies. However, the inherent high variability of EBC proteomes has a strong effect on detecting possible biomarkers across clinical groups.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Although a protective HIV-1 vaccine has not yet been realized, significant progress has been made in vaccine designs that trigger B cell lineages with potential to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Advancing these strategies by optimizing vaccine boosting regimens requires early detection of maturing antibodies with neutralizing activity against native envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers and streamlined strategies to identify antibodies as they begin to manifest desired levels of breadth and potency. Thus, we designed three types of pseudovirus screening panels based on Envs of contemporary HIV-1 isolates to facilitate detection of bnAb lineages that are on favorable trajectories during a vaccination course. The panels were selected from Tier 2 Transmitted Founder Lineage (TFL) HIV-1 Envs from placebo participants in the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) efficacy trials. Using 15 bnAbs to evaluate the neutralization sensitivity of the viruses, we selected 8-member bnAb class-specific panels most sensitive to bAbs representing their class: V2-apex, V3-glycan, CD4-receptor binding site (CD4bs), Membrane-Proximal External Region (MPER), or fusion peptide (FP). Next, we combined the most sensitive viruses among the class-specific panels to create a 12-virus panel to enable optimal detection of low-titer bnAb activity across epitope specificities. Finally, as HIV-1 continues to evolve greater levels of antigenic diversity and as current global pseudoviruses bnAb panels rely on viruses collected more than twenty years ago, we showed the importance of using contemporary viral panels to assess bnAb breadth and potency and designed a 12-virus panel representative of the spectrum neutralization profiles among AMP placebo viruses. We characterized pseudoviruses bearing each selected Env using standardized human sera to confirm their Tier 2 status and biological relevance. These updated panels enable sensitive screening of neutralization activity in vaccine studies and can also provide a realistic assessment of the expected breadth and potency of maturing responses against contemporary HIV-1 Envs.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Despite its known pathological role, inflammation has not been successfully targeted to treat PTOA. With the hypothesis that blocking the acute influx of systemically-derived immune cells can mitigate injury-induced inflammation and downstream PTOA disease severity, we targeted immune cell recruitment via systemically-administered poly salicylic acid (PolySA) particles. This formulation targets immune cells in circulation, namely neutrophils and monocytes, to inhibit their vascular extravasation into injured tissue. Employing a murine joint injury model, we show that PolySA particles reduced neutrophil and monocyte recruitment to the synovium by >50% when administered acutely after injury. Sex-specific therapeutic effects of PolySA emerged 7d post-ACLR, whereby female knee joints exhibited increased cathepsin activity and alleviation of knee hyperalgesia. Despite also observing reduced immune cell recruitment in male mice treated with PolySA, therapeutic effects were entirely absent in males. RNAseq of female synovium revealed a transcriptomic signature indicative of accelerated immune resolution and matrix remodeling in PolySA-treated female mice. Analyses at a timepoint of established disease showed that PolySA-treated female mice exhibited sustained pain alleviation, reduced osteophyte formation, and decreased histopathological PTOA and synovitis severity scores. Together, these findings indicate that blocking acutely-recruited immune cells to the local joint microenvironment via systemic PolySA particle treatment is a promising therapeutic for PTOA prevention by reprogramming early injury-induced inflammation.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

We investigate the form and function of a weapon system in burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides, to better understand why it differs between the sexes. Both males and females engage in contests with members of their own sex to monopolise a scarce carrion breeding resource. We show that mandibles (weapon during biting) and head width (weapon-supportive trait) are larger in males, and that males exhibit a disproportionately larger increase in bite force with head width than females. However, in staged contests with size-matched rivals of the same sex, the weapon system functioned in the same way for males and females: for each sex, the combined effects of head width and maximum bite force best predicted contest outcome. We suggest that the component parts of the weapon system each serve multiple additional functions, including tasks associated with parental care, which contribute differently to fitness in each sex.

A classic example is the number K of mutations on the genealogy, whose expectation and variance are simple functions of the expectation and variance of L. However, higher moments of L and related quantities have received relatively little attention despite their potential utility. This paper systematically investigates the properties of L, its relationship with the total branch length of a certain number of descendants, and demonstrates their usefulness through several applications under the constant-in-state model, which is an extension of the Wright Fisher model with constant effective population size. Specifically, the recurrence relations for the power moments of L as well as for the expectations of products between powers of L and branch length of specified sizes are derived. A closed-form expression for the power moments of L is also obtained. These results allow examination of the large sample behavior of L through its skewness and kurtosis, revealing that L does not satisfy asymptotic normality under the constant-size Wright Fisher model, although approximate normality emerges in rapidly growing populations. Moreover, the power moments of L provide a more straightforward route to deriving higher moments of K and yield a novel approach for computing the distribution of K. The associated mixed moments similarly lead to a novel method for calculating the probability of having a single mutation of a specified number of descendants.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

We introduce MiRformer, a transformer framework designed to predict not only the binary miRNA-mRNA interaction but also the start and end location of the miRNA binding site in the mRNA sequence. MiRformer employs a dual- transformer encoder architecture to learn interaction patterns directly from raw miRNA-mRNA sequence pairs via the cross-attention between the miRNA-encoder and mRNA-encoder. To scale to long mRNA sequences, we leverage sliding-window attention mechanism. MiRformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse miRNA-mRNA tasks, including binding prediction, target-site localization, and cleavage-site identification from Degradome sequencing data. The learned transformer attention are highly interpretable and reveals highly contrasting signals for the miRNA seed regions in 500-nt long mRNA sequences.

Consequently, CN calling is an important step for disease association and identification, as well as for genome assembly validation. Traditionally, CN calling is done by mapping sequencing reads to a linear reference genome and estimating the CN from the observed read depth. This approach, however, is significantly hampered by sequences and rearrangements not present in a linear reference genome; at the same time simple CN prediction for individual graph nodes does not make use of the graph topology and can lead to inconsistent results. To address these issues, we propose Floco, a method for CN calling with respect to a genome graph using a network flow formulation. Given a graph and alignments against that graph, we calculate raw CN probabilities for every graph node based on the Negative Binomial distribution and the base pair coverage across the node, and then use integer linear programming to compute the CN flow through the whole graph. We tested this approach on 15 aligned datasets, involving three different graphs, as well as HiFi and ONT sequencing reads and linear assemblies split into reads. These results demonstrate that the addition of the network flow formulation increases the accuracy of CN predictions by up to 43% when compared with read depth based estimation alone.

Drosophila suzukii has evolved a distinctive oviposition preference for ripe fruit, unlike most Drosophila species such as D. melanogaster, which prefer overripe fruit. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a metabolic volatile that increases as fruit ripens and decays, may act as a critical ecological cue shaping these preferences. Here, we focus on D. suzukii and its sister species D. subpulchrella, which shows an intermediate preference, to investigate the genetic basis of CO2 responses. We report a previously unrecognized shift in CO2-guided oviposition: D. suzukii and D. subpulchrella readily lay eggs on CO2-enriched substrates, unlike the strong aversion displayed by D. melanogaster. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a species-specific sensory tuning, characterized by an early spike in CO2-evoked neuronal firing in D. suzukii and D. subpulchrella, - a temporal response feature absent in D. melanogaster. To dissect the genetic basis of this shift, we generated transgenic D. melanogaster expressing either the D. suzukii Gr63a coding sequence or the D. subpulchrella Gr63a cis-regulatory element. Remarkably, both manipulations reproduced the early onset firing pattern of CO2 sensitivity, demonstrating that either receptor function or expression can independently drive this sensitivity adaptation. Our findings reveal that evolution can shape ecological adaptation through distinct genetic mechanisms, leading to convergent physiological traits among closely related species.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Inference of cell lineage tree from noisy single-cell DNA data has been studied actively in recent years. Existing methods for cell lineage tree inference can be classified into two categories based on the type of genetic variations they work with: single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy-number aberrations (CNAs). Due to various noises and uncertainties in the data, the existing methods are not fully satisfactory, in part because they only used one type of genetic variant. Single-cell DNA sequencing data with both SNVs and CNAs are becoming available. In principle, joint inference of cell lineage trees from both SNVs and CNAs may lead to more accurate results. However, there is a lack of rigorous models and efficient algorithms for such inference. In this paper, we present a new cell lineage tree inference method, called ScisTreeCNA, that jointly infers cell lineage trees from SNVs and CNAs. A key contribution of ScisTreeCNA is a novel probabilistic model for the joint evolution of SNVs and CNAs in single cell data. Based on this model, ScisTreeCNA implemented several efficient algorithms for accelerating probabilistic inference of cell lineage tree. Experiments on both simulated and real biological data show that ScisTreeCNA consistently outperforms existing methods in the accuracy of the inferred cell lineage trees.

Cells and cell environments are highly dynamic across time and space, fundamentally governed by molecular mechanisms, such as gene expression. Recent sequencing techniques measure single-cell-level gene expression under specific conditions, either temporally or spatially. Using these datasets, emerging works, such as virtual cells, can learn biologically useful representations of individual cells. However, these representations are typically static and overlook the underlying cell environment and its dynamics. To address this, we developed CellTRIP, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method that infers a virtual cell environment to simulate the cell dynamics and interactions underlying given single-cell data. Specifically, cells are modeled as individual agents with dynamic interactions, which can be learned through self-attention mechanisms via reinforcement learning. CellTRIP also applies novel truncated reward bootstrapping and adaptive input rescaling to stabilize training. We can in-silico manipulate any combination of cells and genes in our learned virtual cell environment, predict spatial and/or temporal cell changes, and prioritize corresponding genes at the single-cell level. We applied and benchmarked CellTRIP on various simulated and real gene expression datasets, including recapitulating cellular dynamic processes simulated by gene regulatory networks and stochastic models, imputing spatial organization of mouse cortical cells, predicting developmental gene expression changes after drug treatment in cancer cells, and spatiotemporal reconstruction of Drosophila embryonic development, demonstrating its outperformance and broad applicability.

In particular, the Brazilian highlands exhibit high biodiversity due to complex diversification dynamics and a mixture of contributions from different biomes. In this study, we reconstruct the timing and potential triggers of diversification of Agalinis, hemiparasitic plants that inhabit open grassland habitats, to investigate their biogeographic history and migration patterns across the Americas.\n\nLocationNorth, Central, and South America\n\nTaxonAgalinis.\n\nMethodsWe reconstructed dated phylogenies of Agalinis using a secondary calibration approach, sampling 73% of the known species, including multiple species from the Andes and Brazilian highlands. We inferred ancestral distributions to understand migration patterns between North and South America and within South America. Additionally, we investigated shifts in diversification rates within the genus and reconstructed ancestral pollination syndrome and life history strategy states. All analyses were performed across a distribution of trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty.\n\nResultsAgalinis likely originated in southeastern North America during the early Miocene and rapidly diversified, followed by movement into South America in the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. We propose two possible routes for Agalinis movement into South America: either through the Andes or via the South American lowland grasslands (e.g., Chaco, Pampas, Cerrado, Caatinga, Llanos), using grassland corridors for dispersal within the continent. After its arrival in South American highlands, the clade underwent rapid diversification. State reconstructions indicated that the genus had a bee-pollinated ancestor and that hummingbird pollination evolved only once, with many transitions back to bee pollination. In contrast, the perennial life strategy evolved multiple times within the genus, including at least once in the ancestor of all South American species and twice in the North American species.\n\nMain ConclusionsAgalinis likely originated in North America and later migrated to South America, followed by rapid diversification (i.e.,  dispersification). Thus, Agalinis is a clade that refutes the tropical conservatism hypothesis and the out-of-the-tropics model. Moreover, the dispersal to the Brazilian highlands was from nearby species pools and not from other highland habitats such as the Andes, followed by several in situ speciation events. These high diversification rates were partly associated with Quaternary climatic oscillations, and perennial and hummingbird-pollinated species exhibited higher turnover rates.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

While there are few targeted therapies available for HGSOC, there are no effective immunotherapies available to treat this disease. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) maintains cellular protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) elevated expression of proteasome subunit PSMB4 correlates with epithelial ovarian cancer growth and poor prognosis. A proteasome inhibitor has yet to be approved for EOC treatment despite evidence of activity in phase-1/2 clinical trials. Limitations of past generation proteosome inhibitors include sub-optimal solid tumor/tissue penetration due to boronic acid functionality, and poor solubility. Here, we show that a novel proteasome inhibitor, UR238, suppresses viability of several EOC cell lines and reduces tumor burden in both murine xenograft and rat syngeneic models. In a rat EOC model, UR238 treatment reduced tumor burden, shifted the predominantly suppressive immune microenvironment to an inflammatory phenotype with reduced suppressive macrophages, and decreased PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Additionally, in a mouse model, UR238 also induced robust immune changes in HGSOC bearing mice without a corresponding reduction in tumor burden. Our data highlights the promise of UR238 for the treatment of ovarian cancers as a single-agent or in combination with immunotherapies, where modulating the immune composition of these tumors will be important in improving outcomes for ovarian cancer patients.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

This makes a prediction of platelet-immune cell interaction outcomes in neonates a challenge, as they are likely dependent on the cell type and tissue environment at the time of injury or infection. Our past studies revealed that the transfusion of adult but not neonatal platelets into thrombocytopenic neonatal mice led to an acute increase in monocyte trafficking. We have now found that neonatal, but not adult platelets, induce monocytes to a Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell (MDSC) phenotype, typified by increased PD-L1, that limits T-cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Monocytes prior incubated with neonatal, but not adult platelets, or platelet releasates, limited T-cell activation in vitro. Using an in vivo asthma-like model we also found that the treatment of mice with monocytes prior incubated with neonatal platelet releasates limited T-cell activation in a asthma-like model. Platelet-driven effects were dependent on neonatal platelets producing more PGE2 that signaled through monocyte EP4. These studies indicate that neonatal platelets have immune limiting roles in the post-natal period by indirectly limiting T-cell responses, perhaps contributing to the adverse outcomes of platelet transfusions to neonates.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind the collective behavior of biological swarms informs the dynamics of decentralized systems, including engineered aerial swarms. This study provides a systematic graph network extraction formulation applicable to physical domains trajectories including the practical effects of data dropouts, multiple agents, and multiple degrees of freedom. The analysis uses graph network modeling (in which nodes represent agents and edges denote interactions) to uncover the connectivity patterns governing swarm dynamics and quantify their differences. Three network identification methods, including sparse regression, Granger-causality, and cross-correlation, are applied to determine the underlying graph from measured animal trajectories. An additional geometric anisotropy analysis used in bird flocks is also applied. The methods are applied to experimental recordings of honey bees involving scattered and focused ``return-to-hive'' behaviors, to midges in reproductive-related aggregations, and to flocking passerine birds. Across these studies, the number of agents a focal agent receives information from was quantified by analyzing the connectivity of identified interaction graphs. The results reveal honey bees show significant differences in connectivity and slight differences in anisotropy between experiments involving scattered and focused ``return-to-hive'' behaviors. In particular, scattered honey bees showed causal relationships up to 10 neighbors (consistent with flocking jackdaw data), while focused honey bees showed connections with up to 2-3 agents, and midges showed slightly lower connectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis indicated honey bees exhibit distance-sensitivity in close proximity, while flocking birds exhibit a distance-dependent correlation decline. Together, these results provide evidence for task-dependent in-degree modulation in honey bees, and provide a systematic analysis formulation that highlights the variety of approaches to coordinated motion, including those with and without geometric anisotropy.

Across culture conditions, hollow-fiber bioreactors produced markedly higher EV concentrations while requiring significantly less culture medium, demonstrating major advantages in scalability and resource efficiency. EV production was assessed with nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting, and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, proteomic analysis revealed that bioreactor-derived EVs maintained canonical phenotypes and translational feasibility in the context of post-isolation EV engineering. Engineering feasibility was assessed with the first known reported instance of cargo-loading through EV-micelle hybridization, surface-modification through post-insertion of molecules carried by micelles (MCs), and exploitation of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) detection limits.

Remarkably, the mutation spectrum deviation in this population is greater than that observed between some Saccharomyces species. Furthermore, computational analysis suggests the introgression of mild mutator allele(s) from the African beer population into a subset of the French dairy population, motivating experimental characterization of de novo mutations in these strains. We observed a consistent but weak enrichment of A>C and A>G mutations among de novo mutations in the African beer population, likely reflecting their low overall frequency. Other mutation types showed greater variability, with one outlier strain (AFL from African beer) exhibiting an excess of C>A mutations. Comparisons across strains that have been empirically assayed for mutation spectra revealed that de novo mutations display the greatest variability, followed by rare polymorphisms.

A.; Deutschbauer, A.", "abstract": "Communities of bacteria undergo population bottlenecks which are crucial to their population, ecological, and evolutionary dynamics. However, conventional amplicon sequencing cannot distinguish such demographic shifts between very closely related lineages. Here we describe BarTn7, an optimized method for bacterial lineage tracking through chromosomal integration of phenotypically neutral DNA barcodes with transposon Tn7. By combining conventional conjugative plasmids into a single vector and leveraging a parts-based strategy to optimize delivery to different recipients, BarTn7 increases barcoding efficiency and enables the systematic application of this tool to diverse bacteria. We tested BarTn7 in multiple bacterial species and confirmed a lack of lineage-specific growth effects. We then used BarTn7 to measure the colonization of Panicum virgatum roots under differing phosphate concentrations. Lineage tracking enabled discrimination between unique colonization events and the proliferation of existing bacteria during root colonization, the ratio of which differed between three plant-associated bacterial species. The strategy further allowed the measurement of phosphate-dependent ingress rates of the root endosphere by Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. We then demonstrated the effectiveness of BarTn7 to detect adaptive mutation(s) and facilitate identification of mutant lineages. Additionally, we demonstrated that BarTn7 is more accurate than conventional 16S rRNA gene sequencing at measuring community composition of a 5-member synthetic bacterial community (SynCom) and compares favorably to shotgun metagenomics. Our results illustrate the utility of BarTn7 as a simple, cost-efficient, and broadly applicable method of measuring bacterial population dynamics at sub-species resolution.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Recently, we identified that the hypervariable region (HVR) of SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 binds to FXR1 and disrupts stress granule formation during the early stages of infection. Despite variation across the rest of the HVR, a 20-amino acid region, highly conserved in the Sarbecovirus family, is required for NSP3-FXR1 binding, but the critical residues remained unresolved. In this study, we explore the individual residues in NSP3 driving FXR1 binding and determine their impact on viral replication, pathogenesis, and stress granule formation. Our results indicate that the tyrosine at position 138 (Y138) and a phenylalanine at position 145 (F145) are required for FXR1 binding and affinity. Using reverse genetics, we showed mutating NSP3 Y138A/F145A (YF mutant) reduced viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we demonstrate that attenuation is not due to differential type I interferon responses, but rather loss of stress granule control by the NSP3 mutant as compared to WT. Together, our findings demonstrate the importance of Y138 and F145 within the NSP3-HVR in regulating stress granule formation at the early times post infection.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Intracellular transport is essential for cellular organization and function. This process is driven by molecular motors that ferry cargo along microtubules, but is characterized by intermittent motility, where cargoes switch between directed runs and prolonged pauses. The fundamental nature of these pauses has remained a mystery, specifically whether they are periods of motor detachment and passive drifting or states of active motor engagement. By combining single-particle tracking with large-scale motion analysis, we discovered that pauses are not passive. Instead, they are active, motor-driven states. We uncovered a unifying quantitative law: the diffusivity of a vesicle during a pause scales with the square of its velocity during a run. This parabolic relationship holds true for both kinesin and dynein motors, different cargo types, and a variety of cellular perturbations. We show that this coupling arises because the number of engaged motors governs motility in both states. When we reduce motor engagement, either by severing the motor-cargo link or by chemically modifying the microtubule track, vesicles move slower and become trapped in longer, less mobile pauses, failing to reach their destination. Our work redefines transport pauses as an essential, motor-driven part of the delivery process, revealing a fundamental principle that ensures robust cargo transport through the crowded cellular environment.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

To counter this, the bacterium developed robust antioxidative defense mechanism. Glutathione peroxidases (Gpx) are well characterized antioxidative enzymes in eukaryotes; however, their bacterial counterparts remain poorly explored. S. aureus possesses two putative Gpx genes but lacks GSH biosynthetic machinery and glutathione reductase required for canonical Gpx function, suggesting alternate electron donor system(s) may be involved. This study aimed to elucidate structure-based biochemical characterization of one of the S. aureus glutathione peroxidases orthologues (SaGpx, Uniprot Id: Q2FYZ0) and identify its plausible electron donor system. Herein, we cloned, purified and determined the ultra-high-resolution crystal structure of SaGpx (1.5 Angstrom resolution) using X-ray diffraction crystallography. In vitro biochemical characterization of the highly conserved active site amino acid point mutants, as well as their structural disposition suggests their precise roles in the enzyme's catalysis. The crystal structure of SaGpx revealed that the enzyme adopts a canonical glutathione peroxidase fold with conserved catalytic tetrad composed of C36, Q70, W124 and N125. Also, SaGpx shows similarity with mammalian Gpx4, which previously shown to exert phospholipid hydroperoxide peroxidase activity. Furthermore, biochemical assays suggest that SaGpx utilizes Staphylococcal thioredoxin 1 as its cognate electron donor. The catalytic mechanism follows an atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin-like pathway involving the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate, followed by an intramolecular disulfide bond subsequently resolved by thioredoxin. This work provides the first structure-based biochemical characterization of a bacterial glutathione peroxidase orthologue, establishing the novel structural insights of SaGpx as a noncanonical thioredoxin dependent glutathione peroxidase.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Despite targeting the same epitope, the two receptors engaged the peptide-MHC complex with distinct CDR-loop orientations and contact footprints: TCRpub engages the peptide through a peptide-centric AGDL CDR3beta; motif and focuses interactions on the MHC alpha2-helix, whereas TCRpriv distributes contacts across both MHC alpha-helices via a canonical CDR3beta configuration. These findings illustrate how near-identical beta chains can yield divergent recognition strategies to recognise the same pMHC ligand through alternative alpha-chain pairing.

While the role of 'helper' bacteria in mitigating oxidative stress is established, the mechanisms enabling its long-term survival under nitrogen (N) limitation remain poorly characterized. Here, we employ a multi-omics approach - integrating transcriptomics and proteomics - to investigate the physiological processes that facilitate the prolonged survival of Prochlorococcus in co-culture with the marine heterotroph Alteromonas during conditions of extreme N-deprivation. Our results demonstrate that, unlike axenic cultures which rapidly perish, Prochlorococcus in co-culture maintains viability for months following the depletion of initial N-sources. Molecular analysis identifies a shift in both organisms that underpins this persistence: Prochlorococcus strongly upregulates high-affinity N-scavenging pathways, while Alteromonas exhibits transcriptional and translational changes consistent with increased organic matter degradation and reduced motility. This suggests that Alteromonas functions as a key nitrogen recycler, providing a continuous, albeit low-level, supply of bioavailable NH4+ to its photoautotrophic partner through the remineralization of organic matter. These findings support and extend the Black Queen Hypothesis, illustrating that the benefits conferred by heterotrophs to genome-streamlined primary producers encompass not only the detoxification of reactive oxygen species but also the continuous provisioning of essential macro-nutrients under starvation conditions.

However, current analytical approaches treat microbiomes at taxon-level and miss community-level functions in the so-called ecological guilds. Therefore, to understand community-level impact on the host, it is essential to reconstruct co-occurring ecological partners and understand their joint metabolic function. Methods In this study, we first decomposed the fecal microbiota of tuberculosis patients and healthy controls into five key bacterial enterosignatures (ESs) using the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach. This approach allowed us to group individual microbiome members into ecological units that better capture community-level function and correlate with host biomarkers and disease. Results and Discussion We show that ecological guilds, the so-called enterosignatures, reproducibly describe gut microbiome and provide solid basis for comparison across studies. Namely, our healthy participants had the same mixture of ecological guilds observed among worldwide collections of human donors. Compared to this healthy ecological profile, tuberculosis patients demonstrated unusual enrichment of two bacterial enterosignatures, designated ES-Bifi and ES-Esch that often appear in donors with disturbed or transient gut communities. We inferred metabolic pathways enriched in these two enterosignatures and delineated metabolic processes dominating TB patients' gut communities. Specifically, we found that ES-Bifi and ES-Esch members use rapid growth strategies based on anaerobic glycolysis that lead to excessive fermentation into acetate and lactate. Higher number of bacteria using anaerobic glycolysis hinted at higher glucose availability. We hypothesize that higher fermentation into lactate may cause acidification and suppressed normal flora evident in patients.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

This study examined transcriptomic responses of human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells and PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages to infection with ocular Ct strains A/2497 or B/Tunis864 (live or heat-inactivated) at 4 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi).

HCjE cells exhibited progressive transcriptional activation, with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increasing from 4 to 24 hpi (144 to 259; P = 0.0458), whilst THP-1 macrophages showed temporal attenuation (391 to 154; P < 0.0001).

The protective HSR of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that produces the vast majority of malaria clinical cases and deaths, is regulated by the transcription factor AP2-HS. Here, we systematically investigated the conditions that trigger the AP2-HS-dependent HSR and found that even mild HS conditions that do not compromise parasite viability can activate this response. Similar to other organisms, activation of the HSR in P. falciparum is rapid, as it was observed after an only 10 min HS. Artemisinin (ART), a drug that produces proteome damage, also triggered the HSR, indicating that activation of the malarial HSR is not restricted to thermal stress. The AP2-HS-dependent HSR can be activated in all asexual blood stages, with the exception of very young rings, but not in intermediate or mature gametocyte stages. Accordingly, these gametocyte stages are highly sensitive to HS.

The pathogen invades colonic epithelial cells using a type III secretion system (T3SS) that delivers effector proteins to remodel host actin cytoskeleton. Following invasion, S. flexneri acquires actin-based motility and spreads cell to cell, driving epithelial destruction and bloody diarrhea. These intracellular infection processes have been investigated primarily using exponentially growing planktonic bacteria. However, recent animal studies revealed that S. flexneri also forms multicellular aggregates in the colonic lumen, yet the function of this extracellular phase remains unclear. Here, we show that lithocholic acid (LCA), an abundant secondary bile acid in the colon, acts as a potent signal that induces S. flexneri aggregation at physiological concentrations ([&ge;] 50 M). LCA-induced aggregation depends on the T3SS and its tip protein IpaD, which increases aggregate size.

O.", "abstract": "Background: Anopheles funestus, a major vector of malaria in Africa, has proven difficult to colonize in laboratory settings, impeding research on its biology and control. After several attempts, our team recently succeeded in colonizing a strain of An. funestus from Tanzania (FUTAZ). The objective of this study was to analyse the key fitness and genotypic characteristics of these mosquitoes during multiple filial generations of laboratory adaptation and compare them to wild An. funestus from Tanzania and a pre-existing colony of An. funestus from Mozambique (FUMOZ). Methods: Measures of mating success (percentage of female mosquitoes inseminated), body size (wing length), fecundity (number of eggs laid per female), and insecticide susceptibility (percentage of 24-hour mortality after exposure to insecticides) were compared between the newly established colonies of Tanzanian An. funestus (FUTAZ colonies), the long-established FUMOZ colonies, and a colony of Anopheles arabiensis maintained in the same laboratory. The maternal lineages of the An. funestus mosquitoes were investigated through a hydrolysis probe analysis of their mitochondrial DNA to identify distinct clades, I and II. Additionally, other intragenomic variations were examined through a PCR analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) on the third domain of 28S ribosomal DNA. These molecular markers were used to compare the FUTAZ colonies, FUMOZ colonies in Tanzania and South Africa, and the wild-collected An. funestus from Tanzania. Result: The mating success and body size of FUTAZ females declined significantly from filial generations F1 to F6 relative to the founder population (F0), but then increased from F7 onwards eventually matching FUMOZ by F9. Fecundity was similar across all colonies tested. However, it took significantly longer for 50% of the females in the FUTAZ and FUMOZ colonies (over 10 days) to mate compared to females in the An. arabiensis colony (approximately 5 days). Insecticide resistance appeared to be lost during colonization, but this varied with insecticide classes. Majority of mosquitoes in the FUTAZ colony, as well as the wild-caught Tanzanian An. funestus belonged to Clade I (80.4-89.4%) and RFLP type \"Y\" (90.5-91.4%), while the FUMOZ colonies were mostly Clade II (65.5-88.5%) and RFLP type \"MW\" (90.5-91.5%). Conclusion: This study suggests that the mating success and body size of An. funestus decreases significantly during the early stages of colonization, then increase as the mosquitoes adapt to laboratory conditions. It is therefore crucial to have a large enough founder population to persist through these early generations in order to achieve stable colonization of An. funestus. The Clade and RFLP genotyping demonstrated the genetic similarities between the FUTAZ mosquitoes and wild-caught Tanzanian An. funestus, but also showed that the new colony can be distinguished from the FUMOZ colony.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Moreover, we identified patterns of global codon usage, especially in lineage-specific genes, incongruous with translational efficiency hypotheses. Through generation of tRNA sequencing in D. melanogaster we observed that recently duplicated, taxonomically restricted tRNA copies had sexually dimorphic patterns of expression, fragmentation, and nucleoside modification.

The stability of mRNA secondary structure at the ribosomal entry site within the frameshifting stimulating elements (FSEs) determines the frameshifting efficiency. Here, we report the development of a programmable mRNA-based platform that detects specific mature microRNA (miRNA or miR) by converting their presence into a quantifiable protein output through miRNA-triggered -1 PRF. We designed a triplex-forming mRNA (TF-mRNA) platform to selectively trap target miRNAs through the formation of major-groove mRNA-miRNA-mRNA (miR-mRNA2) triplexes. Bio-layer interferometry and fluorescence binding studies confirmed that TF-mRNA forms stable complexes with cognate miRNAs with low nanomolar affinity and prolonged dissociation rate. Critically, the formation of miR-mRNA2 triplex robustly stimulated ribosomal frameshifting in a cell-free dual-luciferase translation system, acting as a miRNA-dependent molecular switch. The generality of this TF-mRNA platform has been verified for several disease-associated purine-rich miRNAs, and it is suitable for targeting a wide range of other purine-enriched miRNAs. This programmable TF-mRNA platform establishes a foundation for developing novel diagnostic tools and synthetic biology circuits that convert the presence of miRNA into a quantifiable protein output.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

The mass mortality of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum has caused widespread ecological changes across Caribbean reefs, with recent studies identifying the etiological agent as pathogenic ciliate designated as a D. antillarum Scuticociliatosis Philaster-clade (DaScPc). The origin and ecological trajectory of DaScPc remain unresolved, raising critical questions about whether it represents a novel introduction or a resident commensal symbiont that transitioned into pathogenicity. Methods. To address this, we tested 50 individual preserved museum specimens of D. antillarum collected between 1960 and 2020, with targeted PCR amplification of ciliate 18S, 28S, and 5.8S/ITS rRNA genes for spine, body wall, and coelomic fluid samples (n=100). Following up on recent work that identified bacterial biomarkers of DaSc, we also characterized the microbial communities associated with these museum specimens using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Results. Our results reveal the presence of identical DaScPc 18S rRNA sequences in 21% of tested samples, 28S rRNA PCR yielded sequences at 96-98 % nt identity in only 2% of the tested samples, and we got no amplification from the 5.8S/ITS region. While these findings suggest possible long-term persistence or repeated emergence of this ciliate, the lack of 28S rRNA matches and lack of detection of ITS2 demonstrates that DaScPc 18S rRNA gene detections may be false positives for the ciliate over a highly conserved rRNA region. The microbial composition of the samples didn't yield any of the previously identified disease-associated bacterial biomarkers and showed large shifts in the overall microbial community based on collection period and the facility where the samples are housed. This study demonstrates that museum-preserved echinoderm tissues retain ecologically informative microbial DNA and establishes a molecular framework for disentangling pathogen provenance and its caveats.

L.", "abstract": "Natural competence describes the ability of several bacterial species to take up DNA from the environment for integration into the host chromosome, allowing the acquisition of novel genetic information. Uptake in many species operates via a dynamic pilus structure that pulls DNA through the cell wall into the periplasm by pilus retraction, followed by transport of one of the two DNA strands into the cytosol by an active membrane transporter. How double stranded DNA with a bending contour of hundreds of base pairs can fit through a narrow pore accommodating a pilus has been a puzzling question. We show that purified major and minor pilins from two Bacillus species, B. subtilis and Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, show efficient binding to double as well as to single stranded DNA with similar affinities. Consistent with uptake, ssDNA accumulates and moves within the periplasm before transport through the cell membrane, with similar dynamics as dsDNA. Thus, Bacillus competence pili are dsDNA as well as ssDNA uptake machines. The binding of pili to ssDNA regions within environmental DNA likely increases the efficiency of competent bacteria to pull extended DNA strands through the cell wall. Uptake of environmental ssDNA may also provide a beneficial source of nutrition for bacteria during stationary.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

HRV causes mild cold and severe respiratory disease, such as asthma, COPD, and pneumonia. To date, no Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral or anti-inflammatory drugs are available for HRV. TA25 is a phenolic amide derivative extracted from the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum. To investigate the potential candidate for antiviral therapeutics against zoonotic viruses, we evaluated the antiviral potency of TA25 for HRV and multiple zoonotic viruses. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of TA25 were evaluated using RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. Strand-specific RT-qPCR was performed to measure genomic and anti-genomic RNA expression after TA25 treatment. In addition, an AI-based docking test was conducted to investigate the binding affinity of TA25 with viral target proteins. TA25 induced a significant reduction in viral replication and suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Inhibition of viral replication by TA25 treatment was confirmed by strand-specific RT-qPCR. TA25 showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses, including HRV-1A, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Vaccinia virus, and Influenza B virus Victoria. Using an AI-driven structure-based docking analysis, TA25 showed the strongest binding affinity with the HRV 2B protein.

D.; Baskevitch, A.", "abstract": "Many archaea encode both histones and Nucleoid-Associated Proteins (NAPs), which we refer to collectively as archaeal DNA Binding Proteins (DBPs). Whether these DBPs jointly work to compact the genome or have distinct functions remains unknown. Here, we have developed the methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans, as a platform to study the function of archaeal DBPs in vivo. M. acetivorans encodes one archaeal histone, hmaA, and two copies of the archaea-specific NAP, mc1 (mc1a & mc1b). We found that each DBP is individually dispensable, but at least one copy of mc1 appears to be required for growth. The growth of the single and double DBP deletion mutants was, by and large, like the parent strain under optimal growth conditions. However, after exposure to stresses or extended periods of incubation in stationary phase, the DBP deletion strains often recovered growth much faster than the parent strain. Conversely, over-expression of DBPs led to a delay in growth recovery that could be abrogated by introducing point mutations in DNA-binding residues. Together, our data suggest that histone and archaea-specific NAPs have partially overlapping roles in M. acetivorans and likely protect the genome after exposure to stress or during prolonged periods of growth stasis. Our findings emphasize that there is no unified function for histones across the tree of life and instead imply that archaeal histones join the ranks of other archaeal NAPs in having strain-specific functions.\n\nImportanceThough it is known that many archaea encode histones in tandem with archaea-specific Nucleoid-Associated Proteins (NAPs), the interplay between these two classes of DNA-Binding Proteins (DBPs) in vivo is not known. Most studies on archaeal DBPs have focused either on archaea known to form histone-based chromatin, or on strains which lack histones and compact their genomes exclusively with archaea-specific NAPs. Our study, therefore, fills an important gap in the literature by characterizing DBPs in a model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans, which encodes both histones and archaea-specific NAPs. While no DBP is essential, at least one copy of MC1 appears to be needed, likely for genome compaction. In addition, mutants lacking DBPs had a growth advantage after being subject to stresses or long periods of growth stasis, indicating that DBPs likely function in genome maintenance when growth has stalled or stopped.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a phage transposon sequencing (TnSeq) platform that uses the mariner transposase to insert an anti-CRISPR selectable marker into phage genomes.

We also isolate hundreds of individual phages with insertions in non-essential genes and reveal conditionally essential genes that are specifically required in clinical isolates, at environmental temperature, or in the presence of a defensive nuclease.

Permeable (sandy) sediments, which cover half of the continental shelf worldwide, are potential sources of N2O due to increasing nutrient inputs from urbanization and agriculture. Yet, the microbial processes determining N2O emissions in these dynamic and unique ecosystems remain understudied. Here, we combined environmental measurements, bacterial cultivation, and genomic analyses to understand the microbes and processes controlling N2O cycling in permeable sediments from Port Phillip Bay (Australia). We established a genomic resource comprising 249 metagenome-assembled genomes and 95 new isolate genomes. Genome-based metabolic reconstructions and culture-based gas measurements revealed diverse bacteria in these sediments produce N2O through incomplete denitrification pathways. However, these bacteria co-occurred with highly abundant clade II N2O-reducing bacteria from the Flavobacteriaceae family. Kinetic profiling revealed both clade II nosZ flavobacterial isolates and whole sand communities exhibit a low affinity for N2O, contrary to previous reports that clade II N2O reducers generally have a high substrate affinity. This indicates adaptation to the high residence times of N2O within production and consumption zones in the sands. Collectively, these N2O reducers remove most N2O produced in permeable sediments, supporting lower-than-expected coastal emissions predicted by biogeochemical models. We conclude that permeable sediments host specialised microbial communities that mitigate N2O emissions and buffer marine nitrogen cycling amid rising nutrient pollution.", "date": "2025-11-24", "journal": ""}
