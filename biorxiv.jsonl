To identify new modulators of KRAS activity in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we performed regulatory network analysis on a large collection of expression profiles from laser capture microdissected samples of PDAC and benign controls. We discovered that BMAL2, a member of the PAS family of transcription factors, promotes tumor initiation, progression, and post-resection survival, and is highly correlated with KRAS activity. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes suggested a role in regulating the hypoxia response, a hallmark of PDAC. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines reduced cancer cell viability, invasion, and glycolysis, leading to broad dysregulation of cellular metabolism, particularly under hypoxic conditions. We find that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes and is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A under low oxygen conditions, while simultaneously destabilizing HIF2A. Notably, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated that BMAL2 loss significantly impairs tumor growth and reduces tumor volume, underscoring its functional importance in tumor progression. We conclude that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC that works downstream of KRAS signaling, possibly serving as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Dimensionality reduction, visualization and clustering are standard when exploring data at these scales; while efficient and tractable methods exist for the first two, clustering remains challenging because of uncertainty about sources of population structure. In practice, clustering is commonly performed by drawing shapes around dimensionally reduced data or assuming populations have a \"type\" genome. We propose a method of clustering data with topological analysis that is fast, easy to implement, and integrates with existing pipelines. The approach is robust to the presence of sub-populations of varying sizes and wide ranges of population structure patterns. We use UMAP and HDBSCAN, respectively methods of dimensionality reduction and density clustering, on data from three biobanks. We illustrate how topological genetic strata can help us understand structure within biobanks, evaluate distributions of genotypic and phenotypic data, examine polygenic score transferability, identify potential influential alleles, and perform quality control.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs have enabled the accurate inference of large-scale genealogies. Through modelling the impact of recombination on the correlation structure between genealogical local trees, we evaluate how this structure is reconstructed by leading approaches. Despite identifying pervasive biases, we show that applying a simple correction recovers the desired distributions for one algorithm, Relate. We develop a statistical test to identify clades spanning unexpectedly long genomic regions, likely reflecting regional suppression of recombination in some individuals. Our approach allows a systematic scan for inter-individual recombination rate variation at an intermediate scale, between genome-wide differences and individual hotspots. Using genealogies reconstructed with Relate for 2504 human genomes, we identify 50 regions possessing clades with unexpectedly long genomic spans (p < 1 {middle dot} 10-12). The strongest signal corresponds to a known inversion on chromosome 17. The second strongest uncovers a novel 760kb inversion on chromosome 10, common (21%) in S. Asians and correlated with GWAS hits for a range of phenotypes. Other regions indicate additional genomic rearrangements: inversions (8), copy number changes (2), or other variants (12). The remaining regions appear to reflect recombination suppression by previously unevidenced mechanisms. They are enriched for precisely spanning single genes (p=5 {middle dot} 10-10), specifically those expressed in male gametogenesis, and for eQTLs (p=2 {middle dot} 10-3). This suggests an extension of previously hypothesised crossover suppression within meiotic genes, towards a model of suppression varying across individuals with different expression levels. Our methods can be readily applied to other species, showing that genealogies offer previously untapped potential to study structural variation and other phenomena impacting evolution.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

The endo-lysosomal system is essential for cholesterol uptake and intracellular distribution, yet the mechanisms governing these processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the impact of hepatic VPS35, a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex retromer, on hepatocellular and whole-body cholesterol homeostasis. Methods: We generated a liver-specific Vps35 knockout mouse model (Vps35HepKO) and applied biochemical analyses, proteomics, and stable-isotope-labeled tracers to quantify critical processes of cholesterol metabolism. Human iPSC-derived liver organoids and CRISPR technology were used to translate our findings to humans. Mechanistic studies were performed in precision-cut liver slices from WT and Vps35HepKO mice. Results: Hepatic VPS35 deficiency led to an increase in endo-lysosomal degradative compartments and a marked reduction in specific lysosomal proteins, including lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 2 (SCARB2), and Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1). Using pathway-specific inhibitors, we showed that VPS35 loss impairs the translation of SCABR2 and NPC1. Consistently, human iPSC-derived liver organoids lacking VPS35 also exhibited reduced expression of NPC1 and SCARB2 proteins. The decrease in these lysosomal proteins correlated with increased cholesterol levels in the plasma and liver of Vps35HepKO mice. This was likely explained by the disrupted cholesterol trafficking through the endo-lysosomal system, delayed plasma cholesterol turnover, and upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis. Conclusion: These findings uncover a previously unknown role for the hepatic retromer complex in maintaining systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Beyond its established function in endosomal cargo transport, we now demonstrate that retromer is also essential for lysosomal cholesterol handling. This role is mediated by regulating key lysosomal proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, including LAL, NPC1, and SCARB2.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

A fundamental unresolved issue is whether these trajectories are planned or whether they are a consequence of trajectory-free online control. We address this question using Spearmans rank correlation, zero-crossing rate, and z-scores, and analyze within-trial variability to investigate differences in the time evolution of trajectories during the presence or absence of a goal in finger and whole-arm reaching movements, along with analyzing rapid goal-directed saccadic eye movements. We found that the central nervous system (CNS) implements control to follow an average trajectory, where goal-directed movements show an enhanced degree of trajectory control. Further, we found behavioral signatures of rapid control that might operate on these planned trajectories as early as ~60 ms in finger movements and ~70 ms in whole-arm reaching movements. Such early signatures of control suggest that the system could exploit internal feedback along with fast feedback processes to implement meaningful corrections during simple voluntary unperturbed movements. The analysis also revealed that the controller gains varied along the movement and peaked distinctly at early (20 %) and late (90 %) phases of finger and arm movements, implying that trajectory control may be accomplished through implicit way-point objectives during the execution of the movement. These later corrections were missing during the late phase of eye movements, pointing to a predominant role of delayed sensory feedback mediating corrections in the context of finger and arm movements during this period.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate phylogenetic relatedness with species diversity patterns in four major clades of living tetrapods (amphibians, squamates, birds, and mammals) to approach this challenge. Location: Global. Time period: 300 million years ago - Present. Major taxa studied: Tetrapods. Methods: We studied geographic patterns of richness-corrected phylogenetic diversity (residual PD), identifying regions where species are phylogenetically more closely or distantly related than expected by richness. We explored the effect of different factors in residual PD: recent speciation rates, temporal trends of lineage accumulation, and environmental variables. Specifically, we searched for evolutionary and ecological differences between regions of high and low residual PD. Results: Our results show heterogeneous spatial patterns of diversity dynamics across tetrapods. They reveal an overall negative relationship between recent speciation rates and residual PD, underscoring the role of recent speciation events in structuring current biogeographic patterns. Furthermore, we found differences between endothermic and ectothermic tetrapods in response to temperature and precipitation, highlighting the pivotal role of thermal physiology in shaping diversity dynamics. Main conclusions: Geographic patterns of diversity dynamics are heterogeneous across tetrapod clades and help us disentangle the evolutionary and ecological processes underlying them. By illuminating the multifaceted factors underpinning global diversity patterns, our study represents a significant advancement towards better understanding of how the present-day diversity of tetrapods was formed and how speciation rates influenced their species and phylogenetic diversity across clades and regions.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Through single cell RNA sequencing and murine genetics, we demonstrate that wildtype animals infested with EV-deficient Ixodes scapularis display a unique epidermal sub-population with a mesenchymal-like transcriptional program and an overrepresentation of pathways connected to wound healing. Furthermore, tick EVs inhibit proliferation and diminish the capacity of wound closure in keratinocytes. This occurrence was linked to phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, keratinocyte growth factor 1 (KGF-1) and transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) levels. Collectively, we uncovered a strategy employed by a blood-feeding arthropod that disrupts the circuitry in cutaneous wound healing, contributing to ectoparasite fitness.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Antibiotic resistance phenotypic (IC90 against 8 clinically used antibiotics) and genetic changes of the evolved populations were systematically investigated, revealing a universal increase in antibiotic resistance (up to 349-fold), and mutations in 2,432 genes.

We developed machine-learning models to predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes from antibiotic structures and genomic mutations, enabling the resistance predictions for another 569 antibiotics. Importantly, 14.6% of the 481 key mutations were observed in clinical and environmental E. coli isolates retrieved from the NCBI database, and several were over-represented in clinical isolates.

We benchmarked Decipher against existing tools and found it could recover known, experimentally determined cytokine signalling pathways, whilst maintaining the flexibility to detect novel pathways and context-specific effects. Notably, Decipher produces global cell-to-cell signalling maps that are interpretable. We utilised Decipher to unveil the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving a novel population of inflammatory monocytes enriched with interferon stimulated genes that is markedly increased in frequency following secondary immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Finally, we employed Decipher to interrogate regulon profiles from covid-19 patients with mild versus severe disease, and we found that progression to severe disease was associated with a loss of interferon signalling transcription factors (Irf7, Irf9, STAT1, STAT2) and a gain of factors that drive inflammation and cellular stress responses (NFkB, HIF-1a, ATF3, ATF4). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Decipher can decode signalling pathways and report on ligand-receptor mediated transcription factor-target gene networks that underlie processes in homeostasis, disease, and cellular responses to therapies.

To address this, we employed tumor spheroids and mice bearing tumors immunogenic to human immune cells derived from the same donor. We found that senescent fibroblasts exert a dual effect by enhancing the recruitment of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment while simultaneously promoting the apoptosis of T and NK cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that this apoptosis is primarily due to increased Fas ligand (FasL) expression on the surface of senescent fibroblasts. Deletion of FasL on fibroblasts was sufficient to prevent immune cell death and increase tumor cell killing.

Around a quarter of people living with MDD demonstrate low-grade inflammation and substantial evidence links peripheral inflammation to anhedonia via disrupted cortico-thalamo-striatal circuitry. We examined clinical human neuroimaging in individuals with systemic inflammation (psoriatic disease), and employed a preclinical model of neuroinflammation, to study relationships between the neuroinflammatory response, neural circuitry and depression-like behaviours. Our preclinical model used a topical treatment of Aldara, which contains imiquimod (a TLR7/8 agonist) that also induces a psoriasis-like phenotype. Changes in functional connectivity between thalamus and ventral striatum correlated with depression in humans with psoriatic disease, and with anhedonia-like behaviours in Aldara-treated mice. Mice treated with Aldara exhibited reduced sucrose preference and impairments in intrinsic motivational behaviours relative to untreated controls. Within 4 to 6 hours of Aldara treatment, neurons in midline thalamus were activated substantially more than in control animals. Optogenetic activation of midline thalamic projections onto ventral striatum medium spiny neurons revealed that repeated Aldara treatment substantially reduced the magnitude of the evoked thalamic AMPA receptor-mediated post-synaptic currents. In the preclinical model, contributions from both resident and infiltrating immune cells drove neuroinflammation. Further dissection of these pathways revealed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation, infiltrating monocytes and infiltrating T cells all contributed to the neuroinflammatory effects of Aldara.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM reduced Treg differentiation and suppressive function while reciprocally inducing markers of a pro-inflammatory, T helper 17 (Th17)-like state. The regulatory role of PGAM was dependent on the contribution of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), the PGAM substrate, to de novo serine synthesis. Blocking de novo serine synthesis from 3PG reversed the effect of PGAM inhibition on Treg polarization, while exogenous serine directly inhibited Treg polarization. Additional-ly, altering serine levels in vivo with a serine/glycine-free diet increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated autoimmuni-ty in a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we found that serine limits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and methylation of Treg-associated genes. Inhibiting one-carbon metabolism increased Treg polarization and suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of autoimmune colitis.

Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, monomers and short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a feedstock molecule to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the formation of erroneous products can be suppressed if each ligation involves at least one monomer, while ligations between two long oligomers are effectively prevented. This kinetic discrimination (favoring monomer incorporation over oligomer-oligomer ligation) may be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry, or can be externally imposed by selectively activating only monomers in the pool. Surprisingly, under these conditions, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges of in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Addressing this challenge requires alternative therapeutic strategies. Candidate drugs should fulfill key requirements to qualify for clinical use, including negligible host toxicity, high in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity, in vivo stability, and modes of action that reduce the potential for the emergence of resistant strains. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) stand out as a promising class of compounds to combat antimicrobial resistance. Leveraging the unique properties of AMPs, we previously developed a novel approach to synthesize random peptide mixtures (RPMs) with robust bactericidal activity against drug-resistant bacteria. Here, we evaluate the antifungal potential of RPMs. Our findings demonstrate high potency of FK20 (L-Phenylalanine-L-Lysine, 20-mer) RPM against Candida auris, a newly emerged multidrug-resistant human pathogen. In vitro studies demonstrated effective eradication of C. auris, with scanning electron microscopy revealing outer membrane damage and confocal microscopy confirming cellular penetration. FK20 also demonstrates activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, broadening therapeutic scope. Importantly, experimental evolution assays confirm FK20 RPM hinders resistance development in C. auris. A synergistic activity was observed when FK20 treatment was combined with caspofungin to inhibit C. auris biofilm formation. Lastly, we demonstrate the significant therapeutic potential of FK20 RPM in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Our findings underscore the promise of RPMs as novel, efficacious, and safe treatment for drug-resistant fungal infections.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

The fusion of satellite cell-derived mononucleated muscle cells (SCMs) is indispensable for the generation of multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncovered an essential role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors, N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrated that branched actin polymerization is required for the SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We showed that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Furthermore, we revealed that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Taken together, our study has identified new components of the myoblast fusion machinery in skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in this process.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

N and RNA phase separate to form condensates that may be important for these functions. Both functions occur at membrane surfaces, but how N toggles between these two membrane-associated functional states is unclear. Here, we reveal that phosphorylation switches how N condensates interact with membranes, partly by modulating condensate material properties. Phosphorylated N forms liquid condensates that wet membranes, reminiscent of N's role in RNA replication. In contrast, unmodified N forms viscoelastic condensates that can be engulfed by membranes, evoking viral genome packaging. These results suggest that phosphorylation serves as a regulatory switch within the viral replication cycle by modulating N's association with membranes. We gained mechanistic insight through structural analysis and molecular simulations, which suggest phosphorylation induces a conformational change that softens condensate material properties. Our studies also show that phosphorylation alters N's interaction with viral membrane proteins. Together, our findings uncover a novel aspect of SARS-CoV-2 biology by identifying membrane association as a key feature of N condensates and providing mechanistic insights into the regulatory role of phosphorylation.

However, the brain is fundamentally a rhythmic and dynamical system, and how disrupted neural synchronization underlies USN remains unknown. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs; 3 - 30 Hz flicker) in stroke patients with USN, without USN, and healthy controls. Only the USN group exhibited significant hemispheric asymmetry at 9 Hz, driven by exaggerated responses in the intact hemisphere rather than suppression in the lesioned hemisphere. This effect appeared only during stimulation, not at rest, indicating its specificity to sensory processing. The enhanced 9 Hz entrainment in the intact hemisphere was accompanied by increased phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha phase and gamma amplitude, reflecting systematic coordination of high-frequency activity. Transfer entropy analysis further revealed increased feedforward information flow from the right visual to the left frontal cortex, highlighting large-scale asymmetry. To explore the mechanism underlying this frequency-specific bias, we implemented a coupled-oscillator model. The model showed that the hemispheric asymmetry arises from resonance between intrinsic alpha rhythms and external input, amplified by asymmetric right-to-left interhemispheric coupling. These findings suggest that USN arises from a selective impairment of alpha-band synchrony capacity. This study offers a novel framework conceptualizing USN as a disorder of disrupted oscillatory dynamics underlying spatial attention, and points toward frequency-specific neuromodulatory intervention as a potential therapeutic approach.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

It hosts many neurons tuned to interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD tuning, however, is already observed and generated one synapse upstream in the superior olivary complex and the physiological mechanisms as well as the functional purpose of the IC projection remain partially unresolved. Here, we argue that combining ITD sensitive inputs from medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO) requires a temporally well adjusted delay of cross-hemispheric fibers from LSO to IC, given the fast synaptic kinetics of IC neurons. We present a normative model of the midbrain auditory circuitry that finds an optimal cross-hemispheric delay of 0.3 cycles and optimal synaptic strengths by maximizing the firing rate of IC neurons for a stimulus at a given ITD. The model suggests that, by varying the relative synaptic weight of MSO and LSO input, individual neurons are optimized to transmit information of all sound sources in a complex auditory scene. ITD tuning of IC neurons would then results as a side effect. The model focuses on the low-frequency range, is consistent with the distribution of best ITDs observed in experimental recordings and performs close to optimal in sound source reconstruction.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

This study identifies a novel mechanism by which animals detect unfavorable food sources through neurons and initiate a systemic response to shut down digestion, thus safeguarding against potential harm. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSY-1, expressed in AWC neurons, detects Staphylococcus saprophyticus (SS) as an unfavorable food source, prompting the animal to avoid and halt digestion of SS. Upon detection, the animals activate the AWCOFF neural circuit, leading to a systemic digestive shutdown, which is mediated by NSY-1-dependent STR-130. Additionally, NSY-1 mutation triggers the production of insulin peptides, including INS-23, which interact with the DAF-2 receptor to modulate SS digestion and affects the expression of intestinal BCF-1. These findings uncover a crucial survival strategy through neuron-digestive crosstalk, where the NSY-1 pathway in AWC neurons orchestrates food evaluation and initiates digestive shutdown to adapt effectively to harmful food sources.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a-priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths including their auditory signals did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint to the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

I.; Waxman, D.", "abstract": "Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population, since selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are clinically significant loci, such as those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to biallelic loci, and up to now there is no flexible expression for the force of selection which applies for arbitrary numbers of alleles (and thus any number of heterozygotes), and which accommodates diverse fitness regimes. Here, we derive an expression, for the force of selection, which explicitly separates the effects of genetic diversity from the effects of fitness of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and analysis of selection, and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and can involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage. We show how our results can be used to estimate fitness effects from allele frequency trajectories and employ such an approach on existing data in the literature on experimental yeast evolution.

We measured the abundance of millions of de novo Mu insertions across four tissue types. Within a tissue, the distribution of de novo Mu allele frequencies was highly reproducible between plants, showing that, despite the stochastic nature of mutation, repeated statistical patterns of mutation abundance emerge. In contrast, there were significant differences in the allele frequency distribution between tissues. At the extremes, root was dominated by a small number of highly abundant de novo insertions, while endosperm was characterized by thousands of insertions at low allele frequencies.

This switch is flipped by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, complementary sex determination (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but most diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in the harder task. This performance difference was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as lower response bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices.

Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dis-preferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation. However, policy interventions can have unintended consequences, accelerating cockatoos' skill acquisition and shifting conflict to neighboring areas.

Dormancy, which allows seeds to remain inactive in an environment that would otherwise enable germination, helps optimize the timing of germination. Primary dormancy, developed during seed maturation on the parent plant, prevents immediate germination post-dispersal, regardless of external conditions. Secondary dormancy, however, is triggered post-dispersal when seeds face unfavorable conditions, enabling them to re-enter dormancy even if initially non-dormant. This mechanism allows seeds to fine-tune germination according to environmental conditions. In this study, we examined the role of heat-induced secondary dormancy in local adaptation by analyzing natural variations within 361 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from across Europe. We discovered that secondary dormancy acquisition varies with primary dormancy levels and after-ripening. Both primary and heat-induced secondary dormancy exhibited adaptive clines along temperature and precipitation gradients, with secondary dormancy showing a steeper cline, indicating its significant role in local adaptation. Using species distribution models, we predicted that genotypes with high secondary dormancy would show greater resilience to future climate changes. Additionally, we identified specific genomic regions controlling secondary dormancy levels, including a novel candidate gene for secondary dormancy variation.

Recently, however, a growing trend explores the prediction of evolutionary trajectories toward the future promoted by its wide variety of applications. In this context, we introduce a forecasting protein evolution method that integrates birth-death population models with substitution models that consider selection on protein folding stability. In contrast to traditional population genetics methods that usually make the unrealistic assumption of simulating molecular evolution separately from the evolutionary history, the present method combines both processes to simultaneously model forward-in-time birth-death evolutionary trajectories and protein evolution under structurally constrained substitution models that outperformed traditional empirical substitution models. We implemented the method into a freely available computer framework. We evaluated the accuracy of the predictions with several monitored viral proteins of broad interest. Overall, the method showed acceptable errors in predicting the folding stability of the forecasted protein variants but, expectedly, the errors were larger in the prediction of the corresponding sequences. We conclude that forecasting protein evolution is feasible in certain evolutionary scenarios and provide suggestions to enhance its accuracy by improving the underlying models of evolution.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

M.; Niama, F. R.; Nguilili, F.; TOBI, N.-; Bourgarel, M.; Bas, Y.; Roemer, C.", "abstract": "Context: Bats are the only mammals who have conquered the skies (Gunnell & Simmons, 2005; Thewissen & Babcock, 1992) and the leading mammals in terms of total biomass (Greenspoon et al., 2023) with the exception of domestic mammals. However, the ecology of bats is still a mystery, especially in poorly sampled regions such as Central Africa. Aims: We present a new method for studying the nocturnal and annual phenologies of cave bat communities in data deficient regions. Methods: In two caves (Mont Belo and Boundou) in the Republic of Congo, which are home to several species of insectivorous bats throughout the year, we set up an acoustic monitoring protocol (PAM) over a period of 19 months. In both caves, we collected a total of 2,375,956 acoustic files. We detected the presence of five distinct bat groups or species. Key results: Our results showed bimodal activity throughout the year, except during the long rainy season, when tri- or quadri-modal activity was detected. Activity distributed throughout the night is related to the period of juvenile rearing (gestation, parturition and lactation). For all acoustic groups, we also observed high activity from October to March (long rainy season, short dry season and short rainy season) and low activity during the long dry season (June, July, August). This high activity is linked to the lactation period, the independence of young bats and potentially the mating period. Finally, the reproductive activity of insectivorous bat species is synchronized with the period of high resource availability. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the great variability of activity in five acoustic groups of cave-dwelling insectivorous bats, while at the same time gathering valuable information on bat species in the Congo. These variations are strongly linked to the season and/or the biological cycle of these species. This information is relevant to understanding the mechanisms by which colonies of cave bats can merge and fission. Implications: The use of this technique can provide essential information to estimate insectivorous bat populations in habitats that have been poorly sampled using this passive acoustic monitoring protocol.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Compounds that block Ran activity would be valuable for cancer treatment. Here, by learning lessons from the discovery of KRAS G12C inhibitors, we generated a structural model of the switch II pocket of GDP-bound Ran to identify potential inhibitors of Ran by virtual screening. After in vitro verification and hit optimization, we identified chemical compound M36 as an efficient inhibitor of Ran with a therapeutic value. Binding of M36 to Ran was confirmed by cellular thermal shift assay. The specificity of M36 towards Ran was demonstrated by the evaluation of the active GTP-bound forms of a range of GTPases including Ran, RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1; and by the expression of a dominant active mutant of Ran. Remarkably, similar to depletion of Ran by siRNA, M36 exhibits a specific toxicity in aneuploid ovarian cancer cells and represses DNA repair systems. In accordance with this, we established a synergistic relationship between M36 and the FDA approved PARP inhibitor olaparib. In vivo, M36 presents acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and, more importantly, inhibits the tumor growth of an aggressive ovarian xenograft model. Clinically relevant, M36 was able to induce cell death in ex vivo EOC patient derived micro-dissected tumors. Overall, our study is the first to provide a small-molecule compound inhibitor of Ran with a therapeutic potential.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

The present study draws upon experimental data to explore how these processes are modulated, by investigating regulatory feedbacks among neural populations through the lens of nonlinear differential equations models. Our observations indicate that the time-evolution of the neural lineage is predominantly regulated by neural stem cells, with more differentiated neural populations exerting a comparatively weaker influence.

Sex influences the proteome in many diseases, ranging from neurological to cardiovascular. In cancer, sex is associated with incidence, progression and therapeutic response, as well as characteristics of the tumour genome and transcriptome. The extent to which sex differences impact the cancer proteome remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we quantified sex differences across 1,590 proteomes from eight cancer types, identifying 901 genes with sex-differential proteins abundance in adenocarcinomas of the lung, and 20 genes across five other tumour types: squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, hepatocellular carcinomas, clear cell cancers of the kidney, adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and glioblastoma. A subset of these protein differences could be rationalized by sex-differential copy number aberrations. Pathway analysis showed that male-biased proteins in lung adenocarcinoma were enriched in MYC and E2F target pathways. These findings highlight the modest impact of sex on the cancer proteome, but the very limited power of existing proteomics cohorts for these analyses.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Genotypes with higher fitness at novel elevations showed lower variance in fitness, lower plasticity across elevations, but higher plasticity within elevations compared to those with higher fitness in the native range.

However, how these processes are coordinated across space and time is not fully understood. This study introduces a computational tool to examine how growth interacts with positional cues and self-organizing patterning mechanisms to shape skeletal structures in both mice and axolotl limbs. We developed the Growth-Processing-Propagation (GPP) framework, a reaction-diffusion system within a growing domain, in which the relative contribution of growth, processing (reaction) and propagation (diffusion) is modulated through two non-dimensional parameters, informed by experimental morphogen maps. This formulation normalizes the reaction-diffusion equation relative to growth, enabling investigation of how different spatiotemporal regimes of growth, processing and propagation interact to produce whole limb patterning. The GPP framework captures the progressive formation of limb segments and digit patterns by varying the relative contributions of reaction, diffusion, and growth to the pattern. Our models indicate that in the proximal region (humerus, radius/ulna) the contributions of growth, reaction and diffusion are equally important to patterning, but in the distal elements (hands) the reaction and diffusion contributions are much greater than the contribution of growth to formation of the digits. A single framework predicts whole-limb skeletal patterns in both mice and axolotls, despite their morphological differences, highlighting its potential to explore conserved and divergent features of limb development from an evolutionary perspective through a unified mechanism across species.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Moreover, phase coherence information, but not activation strength, allowed the classification of sight-recovery from control individuals. Finally, exchanging phase information between sight-recovery and control individuals indicated oscillatory timing impairments as the source of group differences in higher-order visual cortical processing.

We find that large adipocytes are transcriptionally distinct from small adipocytes and upregulate genes related to adipose tissue dysfunction, including altered lipid processing. In coculture, large adipocytes promote lipid accumulation in cancer cells, increasing their migration and proliferation via enhanced fatty acid oxidation. These changes align with greater extracellular vesicle release by large adipocytes, which transfer lipid to recipient tumor cells.

Modern vaccine design approaches typically focus on currently prevalent strains and thus are shortsighted and often rendered ineffective by emerging viral mutations. An ideal strategy for proactive vaccine design requires not only immediate effectiveness, but also control over future viral mutation trajectories and evolutionary fitness landscapes. Here, we introduce fitness landscape design with antibodies (FLD-A) to create optimal antibody repertoires to restrict viral fitness trajectories. By deriving a biophysical fitness model from microscopic chemical reactions, we show that while standard approaches to vaccination do not necessarily restrict evolution of viral escape, our systematic protocol can be used to design effective, proactive antibody repertoires to suppress the replication of future escape variants. Stochastic optimization is performed to discover an antibody ensemble which forces a viral surface protein to evolve according to user-defined fitness penalties against each strain, imposing a reshaped fitness landscape that disfavors viral proliferation. After validating the antibody-imposed fitness landscapes with in silico serial dilution experiments, we apply FLD-A to reshape the relative fitness effects of mutations within two SARS-CoV-2 genotype networks while maintaining overall fitness suppression. Finally, we introduce an iterative FLD-A protocol which consistently discovers vaccination target sequences that generate antibodies which simultaneously restrict wildtype and escape variant fitness trajectories. Biophysical FLD-A thus opens the door to evolutionary control and proactive vaccine, antibody, and peptide design, thinking several steps ahead of pathogen evolution.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

There has been growing interest in inferring E/I ratio from efficient and noninvasive measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), and several algorithms have been proposed to estimate E/I ratio from EEG. Despite promising results, there has been a lack of validation studies testing the underlying neurochemical changes leading to increased or decreased EEG-based E/I ratio. Here, using concurrent EEG and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for over an hour, we assessed which algorithm of EEG-based E/I ratio best matched with MRS-based E/I ratio in humans of both sexes. The MRS-based E/I ratio was obtained by the ratio of glutamate concentration to GABA concentration. We applied 10 candidate indices of EEG-based E/I ratio using four approaches in several spontaneous frequency bands. Uniquely, we quantified the associations between the EEG-based E/I ratio and MRS-based E/I ratio separately for between-subjects and within-subjects variations. We found that each EEG-based E/I algorithm showed reliable and positive associations with MRS-based E/I, and especially EEG-based E/I ratio in alpha band with a criticality theory based approach showed the best association to the MRS-based E/I ratio. While these associations were evident for between-subjects comparisons, they were quite weak for within-subjects comparisons.

Here we studied 106 participants aged 8-25 who learned a hidden two-dimensional (2D) associative structure and then underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a map-based inference task and post-task rest to detect spontaneous replay. We found that during post-task rest, younger individuals relied primarily on replay alone to represent the 2D relationships, whereas older individuals showed increasingly precise timing alignment between replay events and activity in the default mode network (DMN), particularly when replay occurred at the trough of a DMN theta oscillation. Such replay-DMN coupling predicted the strength of a grid-cell-like code in the entorhinal cortex identified in this cohort with fMRI. Furthermore, resting-state fMRI revealed that DMN functional connectivity strengthened with age, in parallel with reduced reliance on replay and more efficient inference performance. These results reveal a developmental progression in which replay shifts from an isolated process in youth to a coordinated DMN mechanism by adulthood.

Recent work has suggested that the mode of release also differs between classical and modulatory transmitters. Although many components of neurotransmitter release machinery have been identified, we still understand little about the mechanisms responsible for differences in release. In this study, we address the differences between release of dopamine and glutamate by comparing the composition of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that contain the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) versus vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2). Previous work has shown that these SV populations differ in frequency dependence, recycling kinetics and biogenesis. Taking advantage of a CRISPR-generated knock-in mouse with a cytoplasmic hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of VMAT2 to immunoisolate monoamine SVs, we find differences in the abundance and isoform expression of many SV protein families. Validation in primary neurons and in brain tissue confirms these differences in SV protein abundance between dopamine and glutamate release sites. Functional analysis reveals that the loss of differentially expressed SCAMP5 selectively impairs the recycling of VGLUT2 SVs, sparing VMAT2 vesicles in the same neuronal population. These findings provide new insights into the molecular diversity of SVs and the mechanisms that regulate the release of dopamine and glutamate, with implications for the physiological role of these transmitters and behavior.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Creating the YUMM1.7 line addressed these limitations by providing an additional contextually consistent model with a more clinically relevant genetic background. The combined use of both models can generate stronger studies in melanoma immunology and immunotherapy. However, to date, there have been no direct functional comparisons of the characteristics of these two models to inform the design of such studies. To address this, we conducted a series of functional experiments to characterize the kinetics of tumor growth, chemotherapeutic sensitivity, and immunogenicity of these models. We found that the B16F0 model had faster intrinsic tumor growth rates, was more susceptible to lysis by tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, and secreted higher levels of the angiogenic factors VEGF and Ang2. Meanwhile, the YUMM1.7 model was more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment, secreted higher levels of chemokines CCL2, CXCL1, and CX3CL1, and showed higher infiltration of lymphocyte and myeloid subsets at the same tumor size. Overall, YUMM1.7 model may be better suited for in vivo studies of mechanisms that require a wider observation window and intervention than the B16F0 model, such as immune response.

We confirmed this result in a large (1000 participant) dataset with multiple converging lines of evidence comparing both model fits and model generative performance. Value-comparison models were restricted to a reduced area of the potential space of single-trial outcome-dependent behavior, demonstrating an intrinsic limitation in the ability to reproduce strategy diversity.

Objective: To investigate cerebellar and basal ganglia beta-band responses during a somatosensory timing task, with a focus on prediction- and evaluation-related activity in individuals with PD compared to controls. Methods: Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we presented participants with tactile stimuli in regular (non-jittered) and irregular (jittered) sequences. In each trial, the final expected stimulus was omitted to probe prediction-related activity before the omission and evaluation-related activity after it. We analyzed beta-band responses and functional connectivity across the cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex. Results: We found prediction-related differences between PD and controls in the cerebellum and basal ganglia before the omissions, but no differences between PD and controls in the cerebellar evaluation responses after the omissions. In PD participants, basal ganglia activity favored jittered sequences over non-jittered, whereas the reverse was seen in the controls. Moreover, alterations in cerebellar beta-band responses correlated with symptom severity in PD participants. Finally, we found an interaction in functional connectivity within a sensory-integration network between the two participant groups and the regularity of the stimuli. Conclusion: We interpret these findings as indicating that the cerebellum may play a compensatory role in predictive timing in PD and that in challenging conditions, the jittered condition, the wider sensory-integration network is harder to work in PD in trying to predict upcoming stimuli.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

While the incidences of both afflictions increase dramatically in the elderly population, it is unknown whether AD exacerbates the health of the IVD. Utilizing one-year-old male and female 5xFAD mice that constitutively express human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with five AD-linked mutations, we measured the lumbar IVD's extracellular matrix composition, the three-dimensional structure, histopathological degeneration, and mechanical behavior. The collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and advanced glycation end-products content of the IVD were not appreciably different between the 5xFAD animals and their wild-type littermates. Likewise, the 5xFAD IVDs were not histopathologically degenerated. However, the IVD volume, measured by contrast-enhanced microCT, was larger in the 5xFAD animals. Furthermore, dynamic microcompression revealed that 5xFAD IVDs exhibited higher loss tangent, indicating altered tissue damping and fluid-flow dynamics within the disc. These results suggest that although the IVDs of mice with AD are not more degenerated, they may be more susceptible to damage accumulation due to the elevated absorption of energy. Elderly individuals with AD may thus be more prone to IVD injuries that lead to eventual degeneration and spinal pain. Future work will focus on defining the molecular mechanisms and the consequences of these mechanical and structural changes in the IVD and their consequences to low back pain in individuals with AD.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Sec is inserted by co-translational recoding of the UGA codon, normally a stop. As consequence, selenoproteins are often misannotated in public databases and require specialized bioinformatic methods and resources. Here, we present a refined characterization of the composition and evolution of the vertebrate selenoproteome. Based on analyses of 19 gene families across hundreds of genomes, we show that extant selenoproteomes were shaped by extensive gene duplications (53), losses (41), and Sec-to-cysteine (Cys) conversions (19). Tetrapods including mammals encode 24-25 selenoproteins, with variations in 6 families. Notably, the same genes underwent convergent evolutionary events in multiple tetrapods, namely Sec-to-Cys substitutions (SELENOU1, GPX6) and gene losses (SELENOV). In contrast, ray-finned fish exhibit larger and more dynamic selenoproteomes, reinforcing the hypothesis that the selective advantage of Sec is stronger in aquatic environments. We detected selenoprotein duplications spread across the actinopterygian clade involving 13 families, mainly involved in antioxidant defense. The richest selenoproteomes were found in Salmoninae and Cyprinoidei fish with 55 and 45 selenoproteins, respectively, owing to whole genome duplications. Among our findings, the SELENOP family stands out in lampreys, carrying up to an unprecedented 162 UGAs putatively recoded to Sec. Our study presents the most comprehensive evolutionary map of vertebrate selenoproteins to date and delineates the specific selenoproteome of each lineage, establishing a foundational framework for selenium biology research in the era of biodiversity genomics.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

A model for RPS2 activation by RIN4 destruction is consistent with the ectopic activity of RPS2 in plants lacking RIN4 but does not explain the link between AvrRpt2s virulence activity and RPS2 activation. We found that non-membrane-tethered RIN4 derivatives are potent cytosolic activators of RPS2. Activation of RPS2 by these RIN4 derivatives, like AvrRpt2-induced activation, and unlike ectopic activation in the absence of RIN4, requires the defense signaling protein NDR1.

Previously, trade-offs have been observed in wheat and barley between the size of individual compound inflorescences (spikes) and the total number of spikes produced by each plant. We aimed to test the hypothesis that these trade-offs represent an uncharacterized form of correlative inhibition in grass reproductive architecture. We show that  high spikelet lines with spikes containing enhanced numbers of spikelets have reduced tillering and retarded development of later-initiated spikes. Moreover, we show that this effect is driven by the presence of developing, but not mature, spikelets in early-initiated spikes, thus representing a form of correlative inhibition. We show that cytokinin treatment delays the development of spike meristems and formation of spikelets, and as such, can promote the development of additional spikes in high spikelet lines, by providing a longer window for tillering to occur. Our results thus identify cytokinin as a potential target for breeding crops with enhanced yield.

The 1.28 Gb genome exhibits unusually consistent chromatin architecture with putative holocentric chromosome organization across highly divergent haplotypes.

However, characterizing TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) at the group level typically relies on grand averaging across stimulus repetitions (trials) and subjects - an approach that assumes a level of spatial and temporal consistency that is often lacking in TEPs. Here, we introduce an adaptation of Group Task-Related Component Analysis (gTRCA), a novel multivariate signal decomposition method, to automatically extract TEP components that are maximally reproducible across both trials and subjects. Following the validation of a new permutation-based statistical test for gTRCA using simulated data, the method was applied to two independent TMS-EEG datasets, in which stimulation was targeted to the primary motor cortex (M1) in cohorts of 16 and 22 healthy participants. We found that gTRCA reliably identified TEP components that were reproducible at the group level. Notably, the main gTRCA component captured the key spatial, temporal, and spectral features of motor TEPs, remained robust despite reduced number of stimuli and participants, and was consistent across different recordings. These findings demonstrate that gTRCA affords a more reliable characterization of TEPs at the group level, thereby facilitating the translation of TMS-EEG research into clinical practice.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Post-mortem human brain studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between genetics, cell biology of neurological and psychiatric disorders and their clinical diagnosis. Given the central role of the synapse in these disorders, we evaluated the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect synaptic proteins in whole-tissue lysates versus synaptosome preparations. First, we optimized sample preparation protocols for frozen human gray matter (GM), refining the suspension TRAPping (S-TRAP) digestion method to improve protein solubilization using thin tissue sections and to accomplish low technical variation by minimizing sample handling. Together, we achieved a highly reproducible sample preparation workflow by rigorously applying standardization and randomization across dissection, processing, and LC-MS/MS runs. Comparative LC-MS/MS analysis showed that whole-tissue lysates are practical for large-scale studies and broadly detecting synaptic proteins. However, enrichment by synaptosome isolation offered improved resolution of synapse-specific proteins. Because synapse-proteomics enables insight into spatial regulation -i.e., alterations at the synapse that are not reflected in the soma- we recommend a tiered approach: initial whole-tissue analysis for broad disease-associated changes, followed by targeted synaptosome proteomics to deepen insight into synaptic alterations. This strategy optimally balances throughput, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and enhances the study of brain disorders through proteomics. Moreover, analyzing synaptic proteins first at the tissue level improves insight into overall regulation of synaptic proteins induced by synapse loss or gain.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

With the emergence of sub-millimeter diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduced SCS across all methods in a spatially varying way. Moreover, tractography methods exhibited significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography, and probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improved robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigated resolution-induced degradation and improved SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provides practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs that will improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

While RVA infects infants and young animals, non-RVA species infect adult humans, various mammals, and birds. However, the lack of appropriate research tools has limited our understanding of non-RVA life cycles. RVA replication and assembly occur in cytosolic inclusions termed viroplasms. We recently identified viroplasm-like structures (VLS) composed of NSP5 and NSP2, designated as VLS(NSP2)i, in non-RVA. In this context, globular VLS(NSP2)i formed in RVA, RVB, RVD, RVF, RVG, and RVI, but not in RVC, RVH, and RVJ. Additionally, in RVA, VLS can also be formed through co-expression of NSP5 with VP2, referred to as VLS(VP2)i. Here, we report VLS(VP2)i formation in all non-RVA species except RVB, with notable VLS formation in RVH and RVJ. Moreover, NSP2 RVH or RVJ are recruited into VLS(VP2)i. The NSP5 C-terminal region in non-RVA is required for association with VP2 and forming VLS(VP2)i. Mutation of conserved VP2-L141 in RVA to alanine disrupts viroplasm formation, impairing RV replication. Equivalent residues within the same predicted VP2 region disrupt VLS formation across non-RVA. We also observed interspecies VLS formation, particularly between closely related RVA and RVC, RVH and RVJ, and RVD and RVF. Interestingly, substituting the N-terminal region of VP2 RVB with that of the closely related VP2 RVG restores its ability to form VLS with NSP5 RVB.

Comprehensive multi-omics integration revealed transcriptional target genes of FRA1, with AXL, CDK6, and FSCN1 exhibiting increased expression in melanoma metastasis and a significant correlation with poor patient outcomes. Silencing AXL, CDK6, or FSCN1 abrogated FRA1-mediated invasion in vitro and reduced metastatic colonization.

In addition to this developmental program switch, implantation suggests that an anabolic boost is required for this process, as the embryo-uterine connection begins supplying the requisite nutrients. In this study, we show that the DNA-binding protein Pcbp1 plays a key role in intensifying amino acid metabolism during the priming of pluripotent stem cells. Knockout of the Pcbp1 gene leads to embryo growth arrest a few days after implantation. By modeling the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition in vitro, we observe reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cells deficient for Pcbp1. Using multi-omics approaches, we uncover a crucial role for Pcbp1 in driving a transcriptional burst of numerous genes involved in the import and the de novo synthesis of essential and conditionally essential amino acids. Pcbp1 deficiency is consequently associated with a slowdown in protein biosynthesis, explaining the early lethal phenotype of knockout embryos. Our findings thus uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying anabolic changes during the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition and highlight the essential role of Pcbp1 in this process, also pointing to its functions in highly proliferative cells.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Our simulations reveal that DNA chain length and flexibility critically influence condensate morphology, leading to the emergence of multiphasic and core-shell organizations under strong heterotypic interactions. We find that DNA recruitment into the condensate significantly alters protein mobility, giving rise to differential dynamics of proteins within the condensate. By analyzing the distribution profiles of protein displacements, we identify up to five distinct diffusion modes, including proteins bound to DNA, confined within the dense phase, or freely diffusing. These results provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting spatially heterogeneous protein dynamics observed in chromatin condensates and emphasize the direct role of DNA in tuning condensate properties.

By combining AlphaFold-based modeling, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations (72s in total), receptor mutagenesis, and signaling assays, we here investigate the spontaneous and G-protein binding-associated activation mechanism of SUCNR1. Our molecular simulations predict that, in the absence of G protein or ligand, human SUCNR1 (hSUCNR1), in contrast to murine SUCNR1 (mSUCNR1), adopts canonical active-like conformations in its intracellular domains and undergoes critical conformational changes in its extracellular domain. This finding is consistent with our signaling-assay results showing that hSUCNR1, unlike mSUCNR1, displays a high degree of constitutive signaling. When complexed with either Gi or Gq, both h- and mSUCNR1 adopt highly energetically favorable conformations in the extracellular domain, characterized by the unlocking of extracellular loop 2b (ECL2b) and an expanded ligand entry pathway. Interestingly, the simulations reveal that helix 5 of Gq binds less firmly to the TM3/6 cleft of mSUCNR1, resulting in an unstable extracellular domain of the Gq-mSUCNR1 complex, which however can be stabilized by agonist binding. This result is supported by our BRET assays, which show that, in contrast to hSUCNR1, mSUCNR1 fails to recruit mini-Gq to the cell surface in the absence of an agonist. Furthermore, the signaling effects of key receptor residues at G-protein binding site and within ECL2b, as predicted by our simulations, were confirmed by mutagenesis assays. Overall, our integrative approach demonstrates that hSUCNR1 can spontaneously adopt all key conformations associated with receptor activation, and that G protein binding further primes the extracellular receptor domain for agonist binding, which in turn stabilizes the active complex.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

The physiology of both mosses and cyanobacteria is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and moisture, which directly affect N2 fixation rates. These associations may be threatened by climate change, since it leads to warmer and drier conditions in polar regions. In this study, we investigated the N2-fixing microbial communities associated with two common feather mosses across a precipitation gradient in the subarctic tundra, followed by a temperature and moisture experiment. Using acetylene reduction assays, nifH gene sequencing and qPCR, we evaluated how shifts in temperature and moisture influence nitrogenase activity and N2-fixing community structure. Our results showed that N2 fixation was highest in sites with greater precipitation and increased with both temperature and moisture. Cyanobacteria dominated N2-fixing communities, but currently unclassified bacteria also seemed to play a significant role, particularly at high temperatures. The number of cyanobacterial nifH copies tended to decrease with temperature, while the relative abundance of unclassified bacteria increased. These findings suggest that the N2-fixing activity, abundance and diversity of cyanobacteria associated with feather mosses in the subarctic will decline under warmer and drier conditions, potentially leading to a shift in the composition of feather moss-associated microbial communities in a warmer Arctic, with potential consequences for N input into the ecosystem.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Despite prior structural work on KCNQ1 and KCNQ1+KCNE3, the structural basis of KCNQ1+KCNE1 remains unresolved. Using cryo-EM and electrophysiology, we determined high-resolution (2.5-3.4 [A]) structures of human KCNQ1+KCNE1 in both closed and open states. KCNE1 occupies a pivotal position at the interface of three KCNQ1 subunits, inducing seven \"helix-to-loop\" transitions in KCNQ1 transmembrane segments. These structural rearrangements: 1) stabilize the closed pore and the conformation of the intermediate voltage-sensing domain, thereby determining channel gating, ion permeation, and single channel conductance; 2) enable a dual-PIP2 modulation mechanism, where one PIP2 occupies the canonical site, while the second PIP2 bridges the S4-S5 linker, KCNE1, and the adjacent S6', stabilizing channel opening; 3) create a fenestration capable of binding compounds specific for KCNQ1+KCNE1 (e.g., AC-1).

Here, we posit that the mechanism of pathogenesis is tied to how binding of BARD1 activates BRCA1 for E3 ligase activity. We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling to uncover how BARD1 selects for active conformational states of BRCA1. We show that the helix bundle, where BARD1 binds, is allosterically coupled to the E2 interface. Furthermore, we show that BARD1 selects for conformational states that are pre-organized for E3 activity. Lastly, we show that pathogenic mutations allosterically destabilize active states, whereas hyperactive mutations constitutively increase their likelihood.

Recent studies have shown that small-molecule cosolutes can not only modulate phase separation but also influence condensate morphology. However, the mechanistic understanding of how small molecules regulate condensate structure remains limited. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how the morphology of two-component condensates can be modulated through the introduction of additional small- molecule cosolutes. By systematically varying the interaction strengths between the small molecules and the macromolecular components, we observe morphological transitions between, e.g., core-shell and dewetted structures. To rationalize these transitions, we calculate second virial coefficients in the presence of the small molecules, providing a molecular-level framework to capture shifts in effective homotypic and heterotypic interactions. We further investigate the role of stoichiometry between the small molecules and macromolecules, demonstrating that stoichiometry and interaction strength jointly determine the condensate morphology by altering the relative interaction strengths among components. Additionally, we show that fully miscible two-component condensates can undergo transitions to microphase-separated morphologies, such as core-shell or dewetted, upon small molecule introduction. Together, these findings reveal that condensate morphology can be rationally tuned through interaction- and stoichiometry-dependent mechanisms, offering molecular-scale insights into how small-molecule cosolutes modulate condensate structure.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that large regions of the genome are moderately modified by H3K27me3 and transcriptionally repressed through PRC2. In contrast to genes in silenced chromatin, moderately modified genes remain inducible by physiological stimuli and the repressive function of PRC2 is balanced by activating inputs from the Trithorax system.

In this paper we examined contributions from and potential regulators of polyglutamylation during mitosis, focusing on the microtubule remodeling that occurs in telophase once the mitotic spindle has completed chromosome separation. We demonstrate that the anaphase-to-telophase transition is accompanied by an increase in short-chain polyglutamylation of central spindle microtubules. We also show that TTLL1 and TPGS1, subunits of the tubulin polyglutamylation complex, are targeted to the intracellular bridge and midbody during cell progression through telophase.

Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerases use tubulin-binding TOG domains to catalyze microtubule growth, but how polymerase activity results from the number and tubulin-binding properties of TOGs is not understood. We tested whether an enzyme-like biochemical model for the unrelated actin polymerase Ena/VASP could be applied to quantitatively relate Stu2 microtubule polymerase activity to the number of its TOGs and the rate constants governing their interactions with tubulin. Stu2 activity displayed enzyme-like characteristics consistent with the biochemical model: Stu2 stimulated microtubule growth rates with hyperbolic dependence on tubulin concentration, and the amount of Stu2 on the microtubule end did not vary with tubulin concentration (microtubule growth rate). Complementary measurements of TOG:tubulin binding revealed high affinity (10 nM) and slow dissociation (0.03 s-1). The polymerase and binding measurements can be unified within the biochemical model: Stu2 operates with high efficiency, acting as a tubulin-shuttling antenna on the microtubule end that is primarily limited by the rate of tubulin:TOG association. Our work thus provides a quantitative biochemical mechanism for TOG-based polymerases.

Extensive nuclear deformation during migration can cause nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage in cancer cells, which may contribute to the malignant transformation during tumor progression. However, the significance of DNA damage in physiological migration is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the migration of neurons in developing cerebral and cerebellar cortices is accompanied by massive DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) due to mechanostress during passage through narrow interstitial spaces. Confined migration enhances the binding and cleavage of the genome by topoisomerase IIbeta expressed in neuronal nucleus, independently of the nuclear envelope rupture. Genome sequencing revealed that DSBs tend to occur outside of protein-coding regions and transcription regulatory regions. During normal development, DSBs are rapidly repaired by the non-homologous end joining pathway. The deletion of ligase IV at the onset of neuronal migration leads to persistent DSB accumulation in cerebellar neurons with moderate transcriptional changes in genes related to synaptic function, neuronal development, and stress and immune responses.

This study utilized deep learning technologies to develop a pipeline, called SpikePheno, for the acquisition of precise wheat spike phenotypes. Our pipeline demonstrated high accuracy in spike segmentation, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.948. Additionally, our method accurately identified spikelet counts, achieving an R2 of 0.9923. Using experimental data of 221 wheat cultivars from various regions of China grown in Zhao County, Hebei Province, our pipeline extracted 45 different phenotypes and studied their correlations with thousand grain weight (TGW) and spike yield. Our findings indicate that precise measurement of spike area, spikelet area, and other phenotypic traits enables a clearer understanding of the correlation between spike morphology and wheat yield. Through hierarchical clustering based on spike morphology, we categorized wheat spikes into six classes and identified phenotypic differences between these classes and their impact on TGW and yield. Furthermore, this study revealed phenotypic differences between wheat cultivars from different geographical regions and over different decades, with an increase in large-spike cultivars over time, especially in southern China. This research may help breeders understand the relationship between wheat spike morphology and yield, providing an important basis for future wheat breeding efforts.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Within cell-type neuronal electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic heterogeneity is the norm in the brain. Although generally considered a fixed property within cell-types, this heterogeneity is malleable and declines in regions of the human brain that generate seizures. Building off this foundational work we hypothesize that such plasticity of cell-type heterogeneity, specifically its decline, arises from the shared history of neuronal activity that drive intrinsic plasticity mechanisms in a concerted fashion. To explore this hypothesis we study neuronal activity in two model systems: human cortical slice cultures from patients with epilepsy as well as slices from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and subiculum of rodent kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Biophysical properties and spiking dynamics were characterized using whole-cell patch clamp recordings of layer 2 and layer 3 (L2&3) pyramidal neurons in human slice culture as well as deep layer subicular neurons and layer 5 (L5) mPFC of KA mice. We found a significant decline in biophysical heterogeneity and a reduction in information coding in both the KA and slice culture models. In both these models we found a consistent increase in hyperpolarization activated cation current (HCN) dependent electrophysiological properties, the blockade of which restored electrophysiological heterogeneity and information coding. Our findings demonstrate that within cell-type heterogeneity is malleable, and despite being a complex distributed network property, can be tuned by a single ionic current. These findings emphasize the plasticity of within cell-type heterogeneity, suggesting the potential for targeted interventions to restore neuronal heterogeneity changes that accompany epilepsy and potentially other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

While we are beginning to understand the behavioral consequences of this exposure, the neural correlates of spatial cognition deficits are underexplored. Thus, we recorded a mixture of neurons from the AT and surrounding brain regions in mice with TTAE while they freely moved within a controlled environment. To model acute binge-like TTAE, C57BL/6J mice received 2 injections of 2.5 g/kg alcohol (or saline) on post-natal day (PND) 7. Subjects were then left undisturbed until the day of surgery as adults (>PND 60), when they were implanted with silicon or multi-wire arrays. Mice were placed in a circular 40 cm diameter arena under dim red light with 2 LED cues on the walls that rotated on a pseudo-random basis while electrophysiological data was recorded. Following data preprocessing, spike and waveform features were extracted from each putative single spiking unit. These features were reduced utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Following dimensionality reduction, we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to find populations of neurons with similar features. Following this, we compared each feature based on treatment and found the features most important to disambiguate TTAEs impact on neural activity. TTAE was associated with decreases in mean firing rate, peak firing rate, rebound index, and tail decay constant, increases in alpha, peak to trough time, and repolarization time, and bidirectional differences as a function of neuronal subtype in burst index and rebound index. This suggests that TTAE produces long-lasting and fundamental differences in spiking features that can be observed in vivo and are amenable to intervention. Together, this dataset provides further clarifying criteria that can be utilized to diagnose and treat FASD.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate these effects using a porcine model. Experimental Approach: Naive and anti-PEG antibody-sensitized pigs were intravenously injected with Comirnaty. Acute anaphylactic responses were assessed through hemodynamic monitoring, hematological changes, and plasma inflammatory markers. Multiorgan inflammatory effects were evaluated by qPCR detection of spike protein (SP) mRNA uptake and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in seven organs over 6 hours. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed. Key Results: Severe cardiopulmonary distress developed within minutes of repeated i.v. injections of Comirnaty. qPCR revealed predominant SP mRNA accumulation in liver and PBMCs, with spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, and brain also affected in 40-90% of animals. Repetitive PBMC transfection showed reversible mRNA peaks at 15 minutes, followed by rapid decay. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, CXCL10, TNF-alpha, CCL2) paralleled mRNA uptake, suggesting a causal relationship. Cytokine profiles varied by organ (e.g. IL-1RA in kidney, CCL2 in PBMCs). Histologic abnormalities and SP immunopositivity were noted in the kidney, heart, and brain. Booster injections replicated PBMC transfection kinetics observed at the first dose. Conclusions and Implications: This porcine model reveals systemic anaphylactic reactivity and multiorgan SP mRNA transfection following i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs, resulting in organ-specific inflammatory responses. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the rare vaccine-related AEs and may support future efforts to improve the safety of the mRNA-LNP platform technology.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

For example, during spermatogenesis, mitochondria undergo distinct morphological changes as the cells transition from stem cells to mature sperms. However, how distinct processes regulating mitochondrial dynamics are developmentally coordinated to sculpt organelle morphology remains unclear. Using expansion microscopy to study Drosophila spermatogenesis, we first document a transition of tubular mitochondria into multilayered sheets organized in a sphere known as nebenkern, which then divides and remodels into two very long mitochondrial derivatives. We then show that the transition to organized multilayered structures is marked by membrane tubulation in the middle forming a division plane, the assembly of OPA1 and DRP1 rings along the division plane and a temporally synchronized downregulation of the fusion protein Mitofusin/Marf. We further show that Marf downregulation is mediated by the PINK1-PARK pathway, revealing an active suppression of fusion of mitochondrial derivatives during their segregation. Our study elucidates a developmentally programmed mechanism coupling membrane tubulation, fission, fusion, and membrane remodeling to drive mitochondrial morphogenesis during differentiation.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Establishing links with electrophysiological activities remains the benchmark for understanding the neuronal basis of rs-fMRI signals. Existing research, while informative, suffers from inconsistencies and a limited scope of rs-fMRI metrics (e.g., seed-based functional connectivity). Phenotypic variables like sex and age are suspected to obscure reliable fMRI-EEG associations. A major contributing factor to these inconsistencies may be the neglect of macrovascular correction in rs-fMRI metrics. Given that macrovascular contributions can inflate rs-fMRI connectivity and power, they may lead to misleading fMRI-EEG associations that do not reflect genuine neuronal underpinnings. In this study, we addressed this by applying macrovascular correction and performing a systematic, inter-participant analysis of multiple rs-fMRI and EEG metrics. Our key findings demonstrate that: 1) Macrovascular correction enhances the relationship between EEG and rs-fMRI metrics and improves model fit in many instances; 2) sex significantly modulates EEG-fMRI associations; 3) EEG complexity is significantly associated with resting-state functional activity (RSFA). This research provides crucial insights into the interplay between rs-fMRI and EEG, ultimately improving the interpretability of rs-fMRI measurements and building upon our prior work linking fMRI and metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "During natural vision, people make saccades to efficiently sample visual information from complex scenes. However, a substantial body of evidence has shown impaired visual information processing around the time of a saccade. It remains unclear how saccades affect the processing of high-level visual attributes - such as semantic category information - which are essential for navigating dynamic environments and supporting complex behavioral goals. Here, we investigated whether/how the processing of semantic category information in naturalistic scenes is altered immediately after a saccade. Through both human behavioral and neuroimaging studies, we compared semantic category judgments (Experiments 1A and 1B) and neural representations (Experiment 2) for scene images presented at different time points following saccadic eye movements. In the behavioral experiments, we found a robust reduction in scene categorization accuracy when the scene image was presented within 50 ms after saccade completion. In the neuroimaging experiment, we examined neural correlates of semantic category information in the visual system using fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We found that scene category representations embedded in the neural activity patterns of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were degraded for images presented with a short (0-100 ms) compared to a long post-saccadic delay (400-600 ms), despite no corresponding reduction in overall activation levels. Together, these findings reveal that post-saccadic disruption extends beyond basic visual features to high-level visual attributes of naturalistic scenes, highlighting a limitation of visual information processing in the short post-saccadic period before executing the next saccade.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

However, the exact transcription factors involved in the differential differentiation of the AVP and OXT lineages are yet unknown. We used a publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of the developing mouse hypothalamus to identify gene regulatory networks linked to AVP and OXT neuronal differentiation. We identified RORA, EBF3, FOXP1, FOXP2, and BCL11B as transcription factors with possible relevance for Avp and Oxt MCN divergence. We then modeled developmental gene expression dynamics using computational cell fate mapping. This revealed enrichment of EBF3 and BCL11B in the Avp lineage, while FOXP1 and FOXP2 are enriched in the Oxt lineage. Next, in silico analysis of Avp and Oxt promoters found predicted binding sites for FOXP1 and FOXP2 in the Oxt promoter, suggesting a role in Oxt MCN differentiation. Finally, we validated the role of one candidate (FOXP1) with a heterozygous knockout mouse line.

BFCN terminals are also abundant in L6, though the mechanisms and functional consequences of cholinergic modulation in deeper cortical layers has received less attention. Here, we performed multi-plex in situ labeling across cortical layers and cell types and found that L6 pyramidal neurons (L6-PNs) were highly enriched in diverse nAChR subunit and muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) transcripts. In vivo optogenetic activation of BFCN axons revealed persistent modulation of regular spiking (RS) units in L2-6 but a rapid phasic activation only in L6. In acute slices, optogenetic activation of BFCN axons elicited fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials via nAChRs in L6-PNs, comparable to responses in L1-INs, and slower inhibitory responses mediated by mAChRs. These findings identify L1 inhibitory neurons and L6 excitatory neurons as two hubs that mediate BFCN modulation of cortical circuits.

In the present study, we aimed to isolate neural components specifically associated with automatic LSS integration in literate adults. To this end, we developed an artificial script training paradigm in which adult native Finnish speakers were trained to associate novel foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we directly compared the audiovisual processing of newly learned and overlearned LSS associations within the same task, one day after training. Event-related fields (ERFs) and multivariate decoding revealed largely shared neural circuits of audiovisual integration for both types of LSS associations, as evidenced by multisensory interaction and congruency effects. Interestingly, the processing of congruent overlearned audiovisual associations uniquely recruited brain activity in the left parietal cortex during the 235-475 ms time window. Furthermore, temporal generalization analysis of the congruency effects revealed that while both newly learned and overlearned audiovisual associations engaged common neural mechanisms, the newly learned associations were processed systematically more slowly by a few hundred milliseconds.

In contrast to their bacterial counterparts, eukaryotic CREs typically bind transcription factors with short recognition motifs across multiple functional yet often weak binding sites. The evolutionary origin of this genetic architecture remains unclear. Here we study adaptive evolution of entire CREs under selection for controllable gene expression. In a biophysical toy model that recapitulates the essential nonlinearities of eukaryotic regulation, a regulatory phenotype requires a gene to be active when its CRE binds cognate TFs, yet inactive in the presence of noncognate TFs that can cause deleterious crosstalk. We explore CRE evolutionary outcomes utilizing \"optimize-to-adapt\" approach suggested by the theory presented in a companion paper. In this approach, CRE evolution is simulated explicitly at the sequence level, while the parameters of the biophysical model itself -- i.e., the properties of the replicated genotype-phenotype map -- are numerically optimized for CRE evolvability. In the optimal regime, selection navigates the tradeoff between slowly evolving strong and long binding sites (which guarantee low crosstalk), and rapidly evolving multiple short and weak binding sites (which necessitate diffuse selection against excessive noncognate binding across the entire CRE). When we further explore various scenarios for cooperative regulation, we find that the optimal regime predicts a diversity of strong and weak, yet always short, binding sites and favors \"synergistic activation\" of transcription, as reported empirically for eukaryotes.

Using population genetics theory, we derive an optimality principle, implying that the evolved GP maps will associate fit phenotypes with larger numbers of possible genotypes. Mathematically, this builds on analogies between population genetics and statistical physics, as well as optimal coding in information theory. The results are particularly interesting in the context of transcriptional regulation, where optimal values of certain parameters that determine the gene regulatory architecture can be derived even without a complete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved. We illustrate the theory using a simplified model of transcription factor (TF) binding to cis-regulatory elements (CREs): the fraction of possible CREs across the entire genotype space that bind a given TF evolves to match the fraction of CREs under selection to bind that TF. Similar ``frequency matching'' results are expected to emerge generically, because selection implicitly optimizes the entire regulatory architecture that determines the ``replicated GP map'' for all CREs, while it simultaneously adapts towards individually fit CREs on that GP map. We discuss the subtleties and limitations of the theory related to biophysical constraints and the need for mutational robustness.

However, both current screening methods (e.g., ultrasound and AFP) and emerging molecular diagnostics have struggled to achieve the sensitivity and specificity required for reliable early-stage detection. In this study, we present a generalizable machine learning framework for HCC detection using cfDNA methylation profiles derived from bisulfite sequencing data. We trained separate XGBoost models on three cfDNA datasets from previously published studies, each based on a different bisulfite sequencing methodology: MCTA Seq, targeted bisulfite sequencing (using methylation-correlated blocks), and low-pass whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). For each model, we selected features based on biologically relevant methylation markers reported in the original study, ensuring that feature selection was grounded in experimentally validated signals. A meta-classifier was trained on shared CpG site features to route incoming samples to the most appropriate model, eliminating the need for forced feature harmonization. To evaluate generalizability, we used an independent moderate-depth WGBS liver tissue dataset for blind validation. The dataset was filtered separately to match the feature set of each training model. Models trained on MCTA Seq and WGBS generalized well (blind validation accuracy up to 92%), while the padlock probe based MCB model failed to transfer, underscoring the importance of platform aware modeling. Across datasets, methylation patterns separating cancerous from non-cancerous samples remained stable, even when absolute values shifted, as in tissue vs. blood. Threshold adjustment compensated for this shift without compromising classification. Intra dataset k-fold accuracy remained consistently high, confirming the robustness of methylation based classification across patient cohorts and disease stages. Overall, we demonstrate a generalizable machine learning framework capable of predicting HCC with over 90% accuracy using cfDNA methylation data from any of three distinct bisulfite sequencing assays, including off-the-shelf whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at moderate depth. By aligning assay specific models with a meta classifier for sample routing, we provide a modular strategy that avoids harmonization pitfalls while preserving accuracy. The next logical step is clinical validation using biobank-derived plasma samples sequenced with WGBS and passed through this framework to confirm real world performance.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Despite the available conventional therapy, the mortality rate due to gastric ulcers across the globe is 11% with a range of 3-23%. Capsicum frutescens (C. frutescens) fruit which is consumed in most communities as a spice has a number of pharmacological benefits which include being an anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and anticancer activity, among other uses. This study was therefore carried out to determine the effect of the ethanol fruit extract of Capsicum frutescens on the gastric acid production determinants in ibuprofen induced gastric ulcers in Wistar rats. Fifteen male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups of three rats each. Group one (control) received normal saline, Other groups received ibuprofen for five days followed by normal saline, or misoprostolR, or Capsicum frutescens (107.5mg/kg body weight) for fourteen days. Ulcer index, H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity, gastrin secretion and parietal cell histology were determined. Oral administration of Ibuprofen induced gastric ulcers. Capsicum frutescens reduced the ulcer index. The H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) as well as concentration of gastrin (p < 0.01) and significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the mean number of parietal cells. It is concluded that Capsicum frutescens has a therapeutic property for ulcer healing and does this through reduction of; H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity, gastrin release and number of parietal cells in the stomach.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

These socio-economic plants provide among others, foods, medicines, materials and a source of income for the people of Guinea. One example is the bansouman or gingerbread plum, Neocarya macrophylla (Chrysobalanaceae) which is locally valued for its large, delicious seeds ('nuts'), edible fruit flesh, and medicinal bark (among other medicinal parts). Through a field survey of 17 local communities adjacent to Neocarya populations and the Neocarya populations themselves (780 mature individuals measured), in seven of the ten Guinean prefectures from which the species is recorded, this study documents (1) the local names, harvesting methods, uses and seed sale prices at different points in the value chain, partitions the species by habitat, records perceived threats to trees, key elements of the population structure and relative frequency of Neocarya macrophylla in Guinea, (2) map and re assesses its global conservation status as Near Threatened using the 2012 IUCN Red List categories and criteria, and (3) construct a species conservation action plan. Analysis of our survey data suggests that the largest number of mature trees (75% of the total) is in the three northern prefectures (Gaoual, Koundara, Pita) at the western foot of the Fouta massif whence seeds are exported internationally. Trees mainly occurred in shrub savannah (45% of mature individuals), with lower numbers in three other habitats. Human set bush fires appear to be the most ubiquitous threat (55%) in Guinea, but sand quarrying (18%), agricultural conversion and debarking are also key threats. Natural regeneration levels seem low compared with data from Niger with juveniles (<1 m tall) less than 10 % of the number of mature, fruiting trees (> 11 cm circumference) recorded. This is the first study focused on Neocarya macrophylla in the Republic of Guinea. In contrast the species has been the subject of numerous other papers elsewhere in its range, and we document 14 studies from Niger alone in the last 15 years. While the species is well known as an important Indigenous Fruit Tree with multiple uses in some countries, it is currently not among the top 10 such species listed for Guinea. Compared with Nigeria where numerous other uses including industrial are derived from the species, Neocarya macrophylla appears under utilised in Guinea. We suggest that studies of the chemistry and nutritional value of the seeds of Guinean Neocarya are made, since there are indications that these differ between Guinea and e.g. Niger. Follow up studies to map tree distribution in Guinea in more detail, quantify tree density, fruit yield per tree and per Ha, and duration between germination and fruiting are advised. Field trials to select elite individuals are recommended. Development of a machine to extract seeds from the endocarp (decortication) is a priority as this is the major factor limiting wild harvesting and availability of seed for human consumption.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Current biological research platforms still rely on expensive and cumbersome quality control methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. To address this gap, we develop OligoSeq, an innovative approach that integrates two complementary techniques: AmpliSeq (based on PCR) and RevSeq (based on reverse complementation of either sequence-specific or random primers) to facilitate sequencing of single-stranded oligonucleotides. OligoSeq uses nanopore technology and can be used as a reference for other sequencing platforms requiring double-stranded adapters, offering a practical and scalable alternative for standard quality control in single-stranded oligonucleotide synthesis.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

This model exhibits strong generalization to novel scenes and objects, produces human-like scanpaths, and replicates previously known behavioral biases in humans. By analyzing the internal representations of the model, we found that it naturally develops a retinocentric cue-similarity map and prospective fixation signals, features that closely resemble neural activity in the primate fronto-parietal network. Beyond reproducing known behavior and neural signatures, the model makes testable predictions about the geometry and dynamics of internal representations underpinning cue-driven prioritization, fixation preferences, their perspective memories, and prospective plans.

Libet seminal framework introduced in 1983. Libet's paradigm significantly influenced discussions on intentionality, motor control, and free will. However, methodological critiques continue to challenge its interpretations, specifically the accuracy and validity of the 'urge to move' phenomenon. One understudied factor in this debate is the potential influence of interoceptive signals--particularly cardiac activity--in shaping the experience of motor intention and movement initiation. In our study, we addressed this gap by examining whether cardiac signals modulate participants' experience of the 'urge to move', using behavioural and electrophysiological measures in 34 healthy human participants performing Libet's task. Crucially, when participants were asked to report the perceived 'urge to move', their button press timings were predominantly aligned with the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, indicating cardiac modulation of motor intention perception. However, analysing heart evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes as a measure of cardiac input perception, we observed no differences in HEP amplitudes associated with changes in introspective demands during the task in both source and sensor spaces. Our results suggest that implicit perception of cardiac signals biases subjective experience of voluntary action initiation, independent from cortical interoceptive markers. These findings have implications for models of motor preparation, intentionality and the bodily basis of voluntary action, challenging conventional interpretations of motor intention and informing debates on volition and interoception.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have reported that alpha-synuclein undergoes phase separation to form biomolecular condensates both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Alpha-synuclein condensates are thought to contribute to disease through progressive aggregation. Here we show that specific PD-associated alpha-synuclein variants fail to form biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that only two alpha-synuclein variants associated with familial disease, E46K and E83Q, enhance condensate formation in vitro and in cells. However, variants including A30G, G51D, and A53E fail to form or have reduced levels of condensate formation in cells. The same phenotypes are reflected in the budding yeast model showing differential inclusion formation. In iPSC-derived neurons, the propensity of alpha-synuclein variants to undergo VAMP2-mediated phase separation reflects the level of synaptic enrichment. We show that the intrinsic propensity of alpha-synuclein to form condensates and the ability to bind lipid membranes are important to mediate condensate formation in cells. Our results emphasize that alpha-synuclein pathology follows divergent pathways, with both increased and decreased condensate formation contributing to disease. This study establishes biomolecular condensates as a key intermediate in alpha-synuclein dysfunction, providing a novel foundation for translational research.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

A. Y.; Brocard, F.; Rybak, I.", "abstract": "Spinal motoneurons are the final output of spinal circuits that engage skeletal muscles to generate motor behaviors. Many motoneurons exhibit bistable behavior, alternating between a quiescent resting state and a self-sustained firing mode. This bistability is traditionally attributed to plateau potentials, which are driven by persistent inward currents. This intrinsic property is important for normal movement control, but can become dysregulated, causing motor control deficits, like spasticity. Here, we use a conductance-based single-compartment model to investigate the ionic conductances underlying the bistable behaviour of motoneurons. Our simulations demonstrate that the motoneuron bistability and how its emergence is regulated mainly depends on the interplay between several intrinsic ionic mechanisms. In particular, the calcium-activated nonspecific cation current (ICAN), which is amplified by ICaL and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), primarily drives the plateau potential to sustain bistability. Additional modulation is provided by the persistent sodium current (INaP) and the calcium- dependent potassium current (IKCa). This study provides a mechanistic model of motoneuron bistability, offering insights into its disruption in pathological conditions and setting the stage for future research and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Gene expression is known to vary within a species pangenome, but the extent to which these changes could be explained by genetic variants in cis non-coding regions has so far been poorly investigated. Statistical genetics offers a hypothesis-free approach to this problem, as opposed to mechanistic models, which can be used only for reference isolates that are not representative of the whole species. In this study, we assembled two genomic and transcriptomic datasets for Escherichia coli (N=117) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=413) and identified associations between genetic variants in cis non-coding regions and recorded gene expression variation. We identified at least one associated variant in up to 39% of the tested genes in both species. We partly validated the associations in-silico and in-vitro for E. coli, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying a single mechanism generating gene expression diversity. We then investigated the relevance of non-coding variants in explaining the variability in antimicrobial resistance in both species using two additional publicly available datasets, identifying a large number of these variants across antimicrobial compounds.

Here, we show that {Delta}sanA has a synthetic genetic interaction with {Delta}wecA, a mutation increasing the availability of the isoprenoid carrier for PG biosynthesis. Specifically, the {Delta}sanA {Delta}wecA strain demonstrated heightened SDS EDTA sensitivity, Rcs stress response activation, and increased cell length. Further investigation tied the SDS EDTA sensitivity to increased Lipid II available for PG synthesis. Spontaneous suppressor mutants of this phenotype harbored point mutations in prc which encodes tail specific protease or ftsI which encodes the cell division DD-transpeptidase, a target of Prc. Given Prc's role in FtsI maturation, we focused on the ftsI mutations and determined these mutations caused a partial loss of function in FtsI, with at least one of these mutations also increasing FtsW activity. Moreover, we found that other mutations which reduce septal PG synthesis, but not divisome assembly, also suppressed the SDS EDTA sensitivity.

The first step in UQ biosynthesis is the condensation of 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB) and an isoprenic chain by the enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (4-HPT; COQ2 gene). Atovaquone (AV), an antimalarial drug, competes with ubiquinol (UQH2) for binding to the mitochondrial bc1 complex, preventing the redox recycling of UQ. In clinical practice, AV is combined with proguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, in a single formulation. However, parasitic resistance to this combination has been demonstrated, indicating the need for new pharmacological combinations to potentiate AV. Previously, 4-nitrobenzoate (4-NB) demonstrated the ability to inhibit UQ biosynthesis in P. falciparum parasites as well as potentiate AV efficacy in vitro. However, both its pharmacodynamics and whether this potentiation could be useful in vivo remained obscure.

Phylogenetic analyses resolved the WOR-3 lineage into four subgroups (subgroup 1-4). Metabolic reconstruction revealed significant divergence of the carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and hydrogen metabolism pathways among the different subgroups. Subgroup 1 was characterized by fermentative metabolism involving formate and ethanol, and uniquely exhibited potential for carbon fixation via Calvin cycle, as indicated by the presence of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene.

Interestingly, we observed a significant positive correlation between the number of plasmids and number of defense systems. In contrast, a significant negative correlation was identified between the number of prophages and number of defense systems. Plasmids were the primary vectors of ARGs. Co-localization of multiple ARGs, such as msr(E) and mph(E); blaOXA-58, tetY, mphB, and sul2 within a single plasmid was observed, suggesting potential for co-resistance and multidrug resistance. ARGs were enriched in pdif modules, with up to 10 distinct ARGs observed within a single module. Moreover, IS elements were more densely concentrated in conjugative elements. The study further highlights the role of nested MGEs in enabling hierarchical ARG transfer processes both within and between bacterial cells. Additionally, putative novel genomic resistance islands (GRIs) were identified in non-baumannii Acinetobacter species, representing the first documentation of GRIs outside the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb) complex. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ARG dissemination in Acinetobacter, particularly the role of MGEs in facilitating hierarchical gene transfer processes.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

The transmembrane protein SpoIIE repositions the cell division machinery and controls cytokinesis during sporulation, but the molecular basis for the precise placement of the asymmetrical division site to the quarter cell point is unknown. Here, we applied live-cell fluorescence microscopy techniques to reveal that SpoIIE localizes with the treadmilling components of the cell division machinery. We found that SpoIIE opposes the inhibitory activity of the MinCD complex, which prevents assembly of Z-rings near the cell poles. Cells expressing a variant of SpoIIE with its transmembrane region replaced by an unrelated transmembrane anchor assembled condensed Z-rings that were unable to initiate constriction. This reveals a new function of SpoIIE and a possible checkpoint licensing cytokinesis downstream of Z-ring condensation. Potentially explaining the role of SpoIIE in cytokinesis, we demonstrated that SpoIIE's transmembrane region interacts with DivIB, an enigmatic structural component of the cell wall synthesis complex required for cytokinesis during sporulation. Finally, we found that FtsZ filaments are unusually short during sporulation, which requires the transmembrane domain of SpoIIE. Together, these results demonstrate that SpoIIE sequentially influences polar divisome assembly at distinct steps to drive asymmetric cell division.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Glucose serves as a critical carbon source supporting Salmonella's intracellular replication. However, the molecular mechanisms driving glucose enhancement and the pathways by which cytosolic glucose becomes accessible to intravacuolar Salmonella remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate a sophisticated three-pronged strategy through which almonella hijacks GLUT1 to co-opt host glucose metabolism for pathogenic advantage. Firstly, Salmonella infection upregulates the glucose transporter GLUT1 by activating the MAPK signaling cascade, enhancing host glucose uptake, and accelerating glycolytic flux. Secondly, Salmonella redirects GLUT1 to the bacterial vacuolar membrane to establish a glucose-import conduit that facilitates bacterial acquisition of cytosolic glucose. Thirdly, K29-linked ubiquitination modifications on bacterial vacuolar membranes are a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism that potentiates GLUT1 transporter activity. Inhibition of GLUT1 potentiates Salmonella-triggered innate immune responses and attenuates bacterial virulence in vitro (RAW264.7 macrophages) and in vivo (murine infection model). Collectively, these findings delineate a novel paradigm of metabolic hijacking, wherein Salmonella systematically rewires host glucose metabolic networks to support intracellular proliferation, providing new insights into host-directed antimicrobial interventions.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

However, since 2015, several challenges, including the development of resistance to these insecticides and treatments and changes in mosquito behaviour, have hindered the progress in fighting the disease. As a result, there is a pressing need for new tools to control malaria, including the potential use of genetically modified mosquitoes (GMMs) in the field. Various genetic strategies for vector control are currently being explored, ranging from self-sustaining GMMs with unrestricted geographic and temporal spread to self-limiting alternatives. Here, we propose a self-limiting gene drive strategy called Male Drive Female Sterile (MDFS) targeting Anopheles gambiae, a major malaria vector. The MDFS genetic construct causes dominant sterility in females, while transgenic males remain fertile, allowing them to transmit the female sterility trait at super-Mendelian rates. Laboratory studies have shown that repeated releases of MDFS can lead to the elimination of caged mosquito populations. Based on these findings, modelling suggests that MDFS could be a highly effective and self-limiting strategy for suppressing wild malaria mosquito populations.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

X-ray crystallography revealed two key arginine residues within the Siglec-10 binding site that interact with the carboxyl group of sialic acid, a canonical R119 and a non-canonical R127, suggesting potential dual contributions to ligand engagement. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)-NMR confirmed that R119 is essential for binding to sialoglycans, while R127 appears dispensable in interactions with glycans in solution. However, cell-based binding assays using primary human T cells and engineered monocytic lines demonstrated that both arginines (R119 and R127) are critical for cellular recognition, highlighting a more complex mechanism of interaction with the glycocalyx. We further ruled out CD24 as a principal ligand for Siglec-10 on T cells or breast cancer cells, despite high CD24 expression, suggesting the involvement of alternative sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids.

We tested these hypotheses using anthropological and biomedical data for the Orang Asli, the Indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia, who are undergoing a rapid but heterogenous transition from non-industrial, subsistence-based livelihoods to more industrialized, market-integrated conditions. Using questionnaire data, we show that this shift creates natural variation in the degree of similarity between early life and adult environments. Using anthropometric and health data, we find that, more rural, subsistence-based early life environments are associated with shorter stature but better adult cardiometabolic health.

To address this, we have developed a purification method which couples tRNA overexpression to DNA hybridization-based purification. Using this approach, we produced native tRNAs from E. coli in high yield and purity while retaining their complement of native post-transcriptional modifications and translational activity.

We clustered our multidimensional time-lapse phenotypes to reveal exceptional correlations across co-functional genes, allowing us to systematically discover roles for essential genes of unknown function, as well as implicate RNase E as required for replication initiation. Further, we assayed dose-dependent correlations between growth and cell size for single genes, demonstrating shared regulation of size with ribosome synthesis, while also identifying limitations in existing growth control models. We reconcile these models with our data by positing SpoT as a sensor of translation elongation, which we validate through several lines of genetic and biochemical evidence. Finally, we show that a simple proteome-allocation model - where (p)ppGpp-control only passively limits division protein synthesis - explains all our size-growth scaling behaviors while also quantitatively linking cell size to ribosome abundance. Looking forward, we anticipate that MARLIN will be an essential tool for high-throughput genotype to phenotype mapping in microbes.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

R.; Aktas, A. N. Z.; Ekstrom, A. D.; Rugg, M. D.", "abstract": "Prior functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies examining the neural correlates of retrieval success and precision have reported inconsistent results. Here, we examined the neural correlates of success and precision in a test of memory for spatial location. The present study extended prior findings by employing an experimental design that minimized temporal overlap between mnemonic and visuomotor processing. At study, participants viewed a series of object images, each placed at a randomly selected location on an imaginary circle. At test, studied images were intermixed with new images and presented to the participants. The requirement was to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image and to attempt to recall its studied location, guessing if necessary. A cue signaling the requirement to make a location memory judgment was presented 4 seconds after image onset. Memory precision was quantified as the angular difference between the studied location and the location selected by the participant. In an analysis that combined the data from the present study and a closely similar prior study, we replicated prior reports that fMRI BOLD activity in the left angular gyrus (AG) and the hippocampus tracks memory precision on a trial-wise basis. Linear mixed effects modeling indicated that the activity in the two regions explained independent sources of variability in these judgments. In addition, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis revealed robust evidence for an item-level reinstatement effect (as indexed by encoding-retrieval overlap) in the left AG that was restricted to items associated with high precision judgments. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and the left AG play non-redundant roles in the retrieval and behavioral expression of high precision episodic memories.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

C.; Boender, A.; Seelke, A.; Gaard, L.; Mederos, S.; Rogers, S.; Gutierrez, X.; Bales, K.; Young, L.; Trainor, B. C.", "abstract": "Oxytocin receptors (OTR) within the extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens have been implicated in modulating social behaviors, particularly following stress. The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that the interplay between dendritic calcium-mediated action potentials (dCaAPs) with synaptic plasticity and rewiring can enable single neurons to successfully perform this complex task. Compared to other types of dendritic spikes, dCaAPs exhibit a high triggering threshold, large, but graded spike amplitude, with lower amplitudes for stronger synaptic inputs. We show that these properties enable neurons to successfully learn to represent discrete items from a continuous input stream by facilitating the clustering of synapses with temporally correlated presynaptic activities onto the same dendritic branch. In comparison to NMDA spikes, dendrites generating dCaAPs can form representations of individual items more efficiently, independent of the temporal order of their presentation during learning - whether randomly, sequentially, as part of a random stream of simultaneously shown input items, or even as items with shared properties. Thus, our results provide further evidence about the critical role of dCaAPs for the computational capabilities of single neurons.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

MCC differentiation involves a unique, tightly regulated program characterized by massive centriole amplification, independently of DNA replication. Although much is known about the transcriptional control of MCC development, insights into proteome dynamics have been limited due to the lack of suitable models. In this study, we report the generation of a stable inducible MCC line, derived from Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells. Upon induction of the MCC master regulator Multicilin (MCI), most A6-MCI cells synchronously differentiate into mature MCCs in 48 hours. Using this novel resource, custom antibodies and super-resolution imaging, we characterized Xenopus deuterosomes, the platforms that allow massive centriole synthesis in vertebrate MCCs. We performed a detailed proteomic profiling throughout MCC differentiation, and uncovered previously uncharacterized regulators. Notably, we highlight a critical role for CDK7 in MCC differentiation in both Xenopus and human systems. Our work provides a valuable resource for mechanistic studies of MCC biology and opens avenues to identify novel therapeutic targets for motile ciliopathies.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

We employed gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) obtained from human primary fibroblasts to investigate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in cohorts ascertained for bipolar disorder of European (n=150) and Latin American (n=96) ancestries. Leveraging data from three countries of origin (The Netherlands, Colombia, Costa Rica) within our cohort, we characterized differences among individuals at the SNP, gene, and accessible-chromatin levels to compute ancestry-specific expression (e)QTLs and chromatin-accessibility (ca)QTLs. Across ancestries, we observed R2 >= 0.93 for eQTL effect sizes and R2 >= 0.95 for caQTLs, indicating a high degree of concordance. Integrating chromatin data with expression and genotype information enabled precise fine-mapping of eQTLs, yielding 203 high-confidence (posterior probability > 90 %) regulatory pathways. In downstream analyses, transcriptome-wide (TWAS) and chromatin-wide (CWAS) association studies with brain- and skin-related GWAS identified 36 TWAS-significant genes and 77 CWAS-significant open chromatin regions. These findings underscore the shared genetic regulatory mechanisms across European and Latin American ancestries, while demonstrating that ancestry-specific reference panels enhance the accuracy of TWAS and CWAS in diverse populations.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}

I.; Tilgner, H. U.", "abstract": "Genome-wide single-cell and spatial long-read approaches have gained traction, but mostly lack single-cell resolution - and yield limited read lengths. Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq), which reveals exons and polyadenylation sites from long reads with near-single-cell resolution. Spl-ISO-Seq selects long cDNAs and doubles to triples read lengths compared to standard preparations. Adding a highly specific software tool (Spl-ISOquant) and comparing human post-mortem pre-puberty samples of the visual cortex (8-11 years) to post-puberty samples (16-19 years), we find that cortical layers harbor stronger splicing and poly(A)-site regulation than the adjacent white matter, with enrichment of multiple protein-domain types. For oligodendrocytes however, developmental splicing changes are stronger in white matter. Among cortical layers, layer 4 has the most developmental changes in alternative-exon inclusion in excitatory neurons and in poly(A) sites. We also find many repeat elements, especially ERV1 long terminal repeats downstream of developmentally-regulated layer 4 exons. Overall, alternative splicing changes are linked to synapses -- specifically at the post-synapse. Age-linked splicing changes in layers 1-3 and 4 are associated with autism spectrum disorder but not with schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. These results root developmental splicing changes during puberty and the resulting protein changes in specific layers and cell types. More generally, our new technologies enable new observations for any complex tissue.", "date": "2025-06-10", "journal": ""}
