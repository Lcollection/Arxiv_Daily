We simultaneously recorded the foveal and peripheral activities in V4, IT and LPFC, while monkeys performed a category-based visual search task. Feature attention enhanced responses of Face-selective, House-selective, and Non-selective foveal cells in visual cortex. While foveal attention effects appeared no matter the peripheral attention effects, paying attention to the foveal stimulus dissipated the peripheral feature attentional effects, and delayed the peripheral spatial attentional effects. When target features appeared both in the foveal and the peripheral, feature attention effects seemed to occur predominately in the foveal, which might not distribute across the visual field according to common view of distributed feature attention effects. As a result, the parallel attentive process seemed to occur during distractor fixations, while the serial process predominated during target fixations in visual search.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Asthma is largely controlled by corticosteroids and beta 2 adregenic receptor agonists that target and relax airway smooth muscle (ASM). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype secreted by naive B cells is important for class switching but may have other undefined functions. We investigated the role of IgM in a house dust mite (HDM)-induced Th2 allergic asthma model. We sensitised wild-type (WT) and IgM-deficient (IgM KO) mice with HDM and measured AHR, and Th2 responses. We performed RNA sequencing on the whole lung of WT and IgM KO mice sensitised to saline or HDM. We validated our AHR data on human ASM by deleting genes using CRISPR and measuring contraction by single-cell force cytometry. We found IgM to be essential in AHR but not Th2 airway inflammation or eosinophilia. RNA sequencing of lung tissue suggested that IgM regulated AHR through modulating brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 1 (Baiap2l1) and other genes. Deletion of BAIAP2L1 led to a differential reduction in human ASM contraction when stimulated with TNF-alpha and acetylcholine, but not IL-13. These findings have implications for future treatment of asthma beyond current therapies.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Although both striatal D1- and D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) receive excitatory inputs from the cerebral cortex, whether or not they share inputs from the same cortical neurons, and how pathway-specific corticostriatal projections control behavior remain largely unknown. Here using a G-deleted rabies system in mice, we found that more than two-thirds of excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs also target D1-SPNs, while only one-third do so vice versa. Optogenetic stimulation of striatal D1- vs. D2-SPN-projecting cortical neurons differently regulate locomotion, reinforcement learning and sequence behavior, implying the functional dichotomy of pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits. These results reveal the partially segregated yet asymmetrically overlapping cortical projections on striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs, and that the pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits distinctly control behavior.

Here, we show that POU5F1B fosters cell invasiveness by inducing plasma membrane remodeling. This ability exquisitely depends on a series of post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination of two lysine residues found exclusively in human POU5F1B results in its cytoplasmic retention, contrasting with the nuclear POU5F1. ZDHHC17-mediated S-acylation then triggers POU5F1B association with membrane nanodomains enriched in cell adhesion and signaling molecules. This is accompanied by the cell surface clustering and accelerated turnover of focal adhesion proteins, with enhanced cell invasiveness.

We tested this hypothesis using BmrA, a bacterial ABC exporter that exhibits large conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis, switching between open and closed states with opposite V-shapes. After reconstitution in liposomes of different curvatures, and at two different temperatures, we showed that BmrA ATPase activity decreases by 2.9-fold when their diameter decreases from 125 to 29 nm. Moreover, using single molecule FRET, we observed that the fraction of closed conformations is reduced in highly curved vesicles when adding ATP or non-hydrolysable AMP-PNP.

Here, we unveil a novel engineering strategy one-signal-activated TIL (OSAT), which integrates CD3{zeta} with secondary signaling domains, to bypass the classical dual-signal requirement for T cell activation. We demonstrate that OSAT molecules 2 (CD3{zeta}-CD28, M2) and 7 (CD3{zeta}-CD137-CD28, M7) mediate efficient mono-signal activation, and recapitulate both the activation signatures and functional markers of mock T cells stimulated with dual signals. Notably, OSAT exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor activity across syngeneic tumor models, especially when combined with PD-1 blockade therapy. Mechanistically, OSAT enhances the antitumor efficacy of TILs by overcoming the inherent insufficient co-stimulatory signals in solid tumors.

There are disease-causing variants of the tau-encoding gene, MAPT, and the presence of tau aggregates is highly correlated with disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms linking pathological tau to neuronal dysfunction are not well understood. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the normal functions of tau in development and aging, and how the associated molecular and cellular processes change in the context of causal disease variants of tau. To address these questions in an unbiased manner, we conducted multi-omic characterization of iPSC-derived neurons harboring the MAPT V337M mutation or MAPT knockdown. RNA-seq and phosphoproteomics revealed that both V337M mutation and tau knockdown perturbed levels of transcripts and phosphorylation of proteins related to axonogenesis or axon morphology. Surprisingly, we found that neurons with V337M tau had much lower tau phosphorylation than neurons with WT tau. Functional genomics screens uncovered regulators of tau phosphorylation in neurons and found that factors involved in axonogenesis modified tau phosphorylation in both MAPT WT and MAPT V337M neurons. Intriguingly, the p38 MAPK pathway specifically modified tau phosphorylation in MAPT V337M neurons. We propose that V337M tau perturbs tau phosphorylation and axon morphology pathways that are relevant to the normal function of tau, which could contribute to previously reported cognitive changes in preclinical MAPT variant carriers.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

L.; Rocabert, C.; Beeravolu Reddy, C.; Guillaume, F.", "abstract": "Changes in gene expression play a fundamental role in the process of adaptation and can provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptation. We utilized transcriptome-wide variation in gene expression as a means to uncover genes under selection for expression changes during adaptation to heat and drought stress, and to understand the nature of selection on gene expression traits of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We showed that estimates of genetic selection on transcript abundance were predictive of evolutionary changes in gene expression after 20 generations of adaptation in seven independent experimental lines. Having measured the genetic covariance between gene expression and relative fitness and among expression traits, we showed that evolutionary changes were driven more by indirect selection acting on genetically correlated partners rather than by direct selection acting on isolated genes. Consequently, genes with central positions in gene co-expression networks experienced stronger selection and exhibited larger evolutionary changes in expression. Our genomic analysis revealed that selection on expression levels is associated with parallel allele frequency changes (AFCs) in the respective genes. More pleiotropic genes and those carrying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) showed a higher degree of parallel evolution. More generally, the stronger the parallelism of AFCs in a gene, the stronger its genetic selection. Contrary to previous evidence of constrained evolution at more connected genes, adaptation was driven by selection acting disproportionately on genes central to co-expression gene networks. We demonstrated that measures of selection at the transcriptome level can provide accurate evolutionary predictions and critical information on the molecular basis of rapid adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

This is despite the disproportionate potential benefits such models could have to livestock research, from improving breeding values to prioritising functional variants at trait-associated loci. A key open question is what datasets and modelling approaches are most important to close this performance gap between species. In this work we have developed a new framework for predicting regulatory variants, that includes deriving key conservation metrics in cattle for the first time, variant annotation and model training. When trained on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data for human and cattle we show that this framework has a high performance at predicting regulatory variants, with a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.86 in human and 0.81 in cattle. We explore various approaches to further close this performance gap, including integrating advanced DNA sequence models and generating extra chromatin data, but illustrate that the best approach would be generating improved gold-standard sets of known cattle regulatory variants. Importantly we demonstrate both the human and cattle models substantially enrich for variants linked to important traits, with up to 18-fold enrichments for functional variants observed. Consequently, with our framework developed to be applicable across species these results not only demonstrate its potential utility for fine-mapping functional variants and improving breeding values in cattle, but also its potential for wider use across animal species.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Monocytes support latent infection but become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation into macrophages. The molecular basis for these differentiation-driven differences has been largely attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA during the early stages of infection, we observed markedly lower viral transcription in monocytes compared to macrophages. Unbiased comparison of the two cell types revealed that this difference is partly due to reduced viral entry in monocytes: fewer viruses enter, and correspondingly fewer genomes reach the nucleus. Indeed, ectopic expression of known HCMV entry receptors in monocytes enhanced viral entry and consequently facilitated productive infection, demonstrating that these cells can support full replication if entry is efficient. We further identified integrin {beta}3 as a surface protein upregulated upon differentiation that plays an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially accounting for the observed differences in entry efficiency. Finally, we show that cells receiving fewer viral genomes are the ones that establish latent infection and have the capacity to reactivate.

CUT&RUN analysis revealed that many of the upregulated retinal genes were bound by the Foxn3 and Rfx3 proteins.

We focus on a metric called commute time: the average number of steps for a random walker to go from region A to B and then back to A. Commute times based on white matter tracts from diffusion MRI exhibit an average {+/-} standard deviation Spearman correlation of -0.26 {+/-} 0.08 with functional MRI connectivity data across 434 UK Biobank individuals and -0.24 {+/-} 0.06 across 400 HCP Young Adult brain scans.

Vocal exchanges have been proposed as an alternative way to sustain social ties without requiring physical proximity. To explore the link between vocal exchanges and social relationships, we examined the effect of dominance and dyadic bond strength of the interacting partners on the intensity of vocal interaction in meerkats (Suricata suricatta). Focusing on sunning calls, socially facilitated vocalisations produced when meerkats warm themselves in the sun, we conducted experiments where we played sunning calls to individuals and recorded their responses. Overall, subordinate individuals showed an increased call rate when responding to calls from dominants. Tie strength showed a weak trend that differed across dyad types. These results support the notion of meerkat sunning calls having a social regulatory function, possibly as a bonding or appeasing signal, mainly directed to dominant individuals. Our results reflect the dichotomy between the subordinate and dominant individuals and underscore the strategic nature of social relationships within a despotic society. Engaging in continuous reciprocal interactions can signify commitment, promoting tolerance and cooperation. Investing in such interaction with influential dominants could lower the chances of aggression and would fit the vocal grooming functionality of such call exchanges. Further work establishing causal links between vocal interaction patterns and long-term relationship outcomes will be crucial for understanding the scope of vocal grooming as a complement or alternative to physical affiliation across species.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

We examined variation in dental traits in four sympatric morphs of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) which differ in feeding specialisations, head and jaw bone morphology. We studied tooth numbers in six bones (dentary, maxilla, premaxilla, palatine, vomer and glossohyal) and tooth angles in one bone (maxilla). We found fluctuating asymmetry in tooth numbers and angles and that the allometry of tooth numbers varied by bone but not morphs. Tooth numbers differed by morphs in four bones (dentary, palatine, vomer and glossohyal). In general, the morphs defined as pelagic had more teeth, and this relates partially to changes in bone shape. There was a difference in maxilla tooth angle, with benthic morphs having teeth which were angled more inwards. Dentary and maxilla tooth number correlated moderately with bone shape, maxilla tooth angle and premaxilla tooth number did not. While it is currently unknown what tooth characteristics are ancestral vs derived in these populations, the marked differences in specific bones presents an opportunity to explore rapid evolution in dentition.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

C.; Pelz, K.; Worley, B.; Mendez, H.; Pham, P.; McCarthy, G.; Chitsazan, A.; Brody, J. R.; Grossberg, A.", "abstract": "Background: Cachexia is defined by chronic loss of fat and muscle, is a frequent complication of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and negatively impacts patient outcomes. Nutritional supplementation cannot fully reverse tissue wasting, and the mechanisms underlying this phenotype are unclear. This work aims to define the relative contributions of catabolism and anabolism to adipose wasting in PDAC-bearing mice. Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding protein recently shown to suppress adipogenesis. We hypothesize that fat wasting results from a loss of adipose anabolism driven by increased HuR activity in adipocytes of PDAC-bearing mice. Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice received orthotopic PDAC cell (KrasG12D; p53R172H/+; Pdx1-cre) (PDAC) or PBS (sham) injections. Mice exhibiting moderate cachexia (9 days after injection) were fasted for 24h, or fasted 24h and refed 24h before euthanasia. A separate cohort of PDAC mice were treated with an established HuR inhibitor (KH-3, 100 mg/kg) and subjected to the fast/refeed paradigm. We analyzed body mass, gross fat pad mass, and adipose tissue mRNA expression. We quantified lipolytic rate as the normalized quantity of glycerol released from 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro, and gonadal fat pads (gWAT) ex vivo. Results: 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PDAC cell conditioned media (CM) liberated less triglyceride into the culture media than control-treated adipocytes (-28.1%) and had lower expression of lipolysis and lipogenesis genes than control cells. PDAC gWAT cultured ex vivo displayed decreased lipolysis compared to sham gWAT (-54.7%). PDAC and sham mice lost equivalent fat mass after a 24h fast, however, PDAC mice could not restore inguinal fat pads (iWAT) (-40.5%) or gWAT (-31.8%) mass after refeeding. RNAseq revealed 572 differentially expressed genes in gWAT from PDAC compared to sham mice. Downregulated genes (n=126) were associated with adipogenesis (adj p=0.05), and expression of adipogenesis master regulators Pparg and Cebpa were reduced in gWAT from PDAC mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased HuR staining in gWAT (+74.9%) and iWAT (+41.2%) from PDAC mice. Inhibiting HuR binding restored lipogenesis in refed animals with a concomitant increase in iWAT mass (+131.7%) and genes regulating adipogenesis (Ppar{gamma}, Cebpa, Retn, Adipoq, Fasn). Conclusions: Our work highlights deficient adipose anabolism as a driver of lipid-droplet loss in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PDAC conditioned media and PDAC mice. The small molecule KH-3, which disrupts HuR binding, restored adipose anabolism in PDAC mice. This highlights HuR as a potentially targetable regulatory node for adipose anabolism in cancer cachexia.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

In this context, whole-brain network modeling--also known as virtual brain modeling--combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node) with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales associated with neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VB). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations, taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms, enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings. Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data.

Performing fMRI in awake mice could facilitate complex tasks in the magnet and improve translational validity by avoiding anesthesia-related neural and neurovascular changes. Existing surgical approaches provide excellent motion control but are not desirable for all experiments aiming to scan awake mice. These include studies with transgenic mouse lines that are vulnerable to anesthesia or mice in longitudinal studies involving cognition. To address these needs, we propose a non-invasive restraint to scan mice in the awake state. The restraint was designed to be compatible with brain stimulation and recording approaches often combined with fMRI. It was evaluated on the basis of motion, fMRI data quality, and animal stress levels, and compared to a conventional headpost restraint. We found the proposed approach was effective at restraining mice across a broad range of weights without the need for any anesthesia for setup. The non-invasive restraint led to higher data attrition after censoring high motion volumes, but by acquiring roughly 25% more data we could obtain comparable network spatial specificity to the headpost approach. Our results demonstrate a simple open-source head restraint that can be used for awake mouse fMRI for certain cohorts, and we establish suitable acclimation and scanning protocols for use with this restraint.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Sea urchins are emblematic of this paradox: they can overgraze kelp forests to form barren habitats, but can then survive for decades in these nutritionally depauperate seascapes. Understanding the mechanisms enabling persistence under starvation, and rapid recovery when food returns, provides insight into how consumer resilience shapes ecosystem dynamics. We quantified how food abundance, quality, deprivation, and reintroduction influence bioenergetic performance in the red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus), integrating field observations of kelp forest and barren populations with a controlled feeding experiment. We measured respiration, feeding rates, gonadal growth, and fatty acid biomarkers to test how habitat history and diet jointly govern metabolic plasticity and nutrient assimilation. Resting metabolic rates (RMR) were nearly twofold higher in kelp forest urchins than barrens conspecifics, yet feeding rates were equivalent across habitats, indicating that metabolic depression does not constrain food intake. Reciprocal shifts emerged in the experiment: starvation reduced RMR and lipid reserves in kelp forest urchins, while feeding elevated both traits in barrens urchins to levels comparable with kelp forest conspecifics. These results demonstrate rapid physiological compensation in response to both food deprivation and reintroduction. Diet quality strongly modulated performance. Urchins fed nutritionally poor monospecific diets consumed more biomass and calories than those on diverse, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich diets, but did so with markedly lower efficiency of conversion to gonadal tissue. Fatty acid assimilation revealed that starvation elevated bacterial and biofilm biomarkers in tissues, whereas algal diets enriched essential PUFA profiles, particularly when diets were diverse. These results highlight that both quantity and quality of food influence consumer recovery trajectories, with nutritional geometry shaping efficiency of energy and nutrient use. Together, our findings show that M. franciscanus exhibits pronounced metabolic resilience, allowing persistence in barren habitats and rapid reactivation of grazing and reproduction when food becomes available. This work links nutritional ecology to ecosystem feedbacks by showing how compensatory feeding and metabolic flexibility enable consumers to maintain pressure on primary producers, thereby influencing the stability, hysteresis, and recovery of degraded ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Our framework unifies non-spatial and (sessile) spatial formulations of the logistic model as limiting cases. Between these regimes, the long-term population size depends nonlinearly on home-range size and spatial distribution. Neglecting range residency can hence lead to under- or overestimating population carrying capacity. To better understand these results, we also introduce a novel crowding index that depends on movement parameters and can be estimated from tracking data. This index captures the influence of spatial structure on population size, and serves as a robust predictor of abundance. The range-resident logistic model is thus a unifying framework bridging movement and population ecology.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

In this current study, we have assessed the anticancer activity of Aegle marmelos extract on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells on Swiss Albino mice. Three extracts were prepared: a methanolic (APME), chloroform (APCE), and n-hexane (APHE) extract. These extracts were administered intraperitoneally in doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg per dose on 6 consecutive days to mice. The anticancer activity was assessed from viable tumor cell count, with percentage (%) inhibition of cell growth, and changes in body weight of the mice that had been treated with extracts. Of all the extracts, APHE exhibited the most tumor growth inhibition (62.2% at 100 mg/kg), followed by APME (59.25%) and APCE (54.86%), compared to the standard chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (81.6% inhibition at 0.8 mg/kg/day). Mice treated with the extracts experienced less weight loss than the control group, with an approximate effect of 0.50 +/- 0.06 g/day. A Brine Shrimp Lethality Bioassay demonstrated a cytotoxic dose-dependent impact, with LC50 values of 18.38, 36.79, and 46.45 micrograms per milliliter for n-hexane, methanolic, and chloroform extracts, respectively. The tumor suppression and cytotoxicity effects of Aegle marmelos extracts are probably attributable to the bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and essential oils that have known apoptotic and antiproliferative activities.

To date, PAS effects have been mainly investigated at the corticospinal level. In the present Registered Report, we leveraged TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) co-registration to track the cortical dynamics related to M1-PAS, aiming to characterize the neurophysiological substrates better, grounding the effectiveness of such protocol. In two within-subject sessions, 30 healthy participants underwent the standard M1-PAS protocols inducing LTP (PASLTP) and LTD (PASLTD) while measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) from M1 stimulation before, immediately after, and 30 minutes from the end of the PAS, applied both at supra- (i.e., 110%) and sub- (i.e., 90%) resting motor threshold intensities. Besides replicating MEPs enhancement and inhibition after PASLTP and PASLTD, our results showed that the P30 and N100 M1-TEPs components were significantly modulated immediately following PASLTP and PASLTD administration. These effects were detectable only in suprathreshold conditions, suggesting that M1 subthreshold stimulation could not be optimal for tracking cortical effects of PAS. Furthermore, exploratory analyses showed that P60 amplitude at baseline successfully predicted the magnitude of P30 modulations after PASLTP administration. Our findings provide compelling evidence about the specificity of early TEP components in reflecting changes in M1 reactivity underpinning PAS effects and associative plasticity induction within the motor system.

Heart rhythm disturbances, i.e. cardiac arrhythmias, are important examples as they are often triggered by specific patterns of preceding stimuli. In this study, we investigated how ectopic arrhythmias can be induced by external stimuli in cardiac tissue containing a localised area of depolarisation. Using optogenetic in vitro experiments and in silico modelling, we systematically explored the dynamics of these arrhythmias, which are characterized by local oscillatory activity, by gradually altering the degree of depolarization in a predefined region. Our findings reveal a bi-stable system, in which transitions between oscillatory ectopic activity and a quiescent state can be precisely controlled, i.e. by adjusting the number and frequency of propagating waves through the depolarized area oscillations could be turned on or off. These frequency-dependent responses arise from collective mechanisms involving stable, non-self-oscillatory cells, contrasting with the typical role of self-oscillations in individual units within biophysical systems. To further generalize these findings, we demonstrated similar frequency selectivity and bi-stability in a simplified reaction-diffusion model.

The koala population then split into five genetic populations 6--30 kya, which are now spread across >3500 km on the east coast of Australia. We also use the koala mutation rate to infer recombination maps for each population, confirming lower recombination rates in marsupials than in eutherian mammals. These findings provide critical insights into the evolutionary history of koalas, while highlighting the impact of using species-specific evolutionary rates in the inference of demographic histories and recombination landscapes. Our estimates of the genome-wide mutation rate and population-specific recombination maps for koalas provide valuable resources for future evolutionary and conservation analyses of marsupials.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

EVs show promise as neurological disease biomarkers due to their molecular makeup reflecting their parent-cell composition signature and due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. To-date, the vast majority of research in this field has explored the protein profiles of EVs; however, lipids play an important role not only in the formation of EVs, but also in mediating cellular function and the pathological progression of many neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we take a critical first step in determining the potential utility of EV lipids as biomarkers in neurological disease. In vitro we exposed BV-2 microglia to either control media or media containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a known pro-inflammatory stimulus, for 24 hours then isolated both the cells and their EVs and performed LC-MS/MS. For the first time, we reveal distinct lipidomic changes can differentiate resting vs. pro-inflammatory microglia and their EVs, while distinct lipids are preserved between EVs and their parent cell. Moreover, we add to current literature by demonstrating acute pro-inflammatory activation of microglia results in the activation and suppression of distinct lipidomic pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that analysis of lipid-based relationships between parent cells and their EVs may be a useful tool to infer cellular function. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that lipidomic analysis can not only differentiate the functional state of cells in vitro but can also differentiate their EVs. We lay the first brick in a foundation to support future research into EV lipids as novel and exciting biomarker candidates in neurological disease.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Previous studies linked TCR signal strength and T cell fate choices to the transcriptional regulator HEB (encoded by Tcf12) and its antagonist, Id3, but how these factors regulate different stages of {gamma}{delta} T cell development has not been determined. We found that immature fetal {gamma}{delta}TCR+ cells from conditional Tcf12 knockout (HEB cKO) mice were defective in activating the {gamma}{delta}T17 program at an early stage, whereas Id3 deficient (Id3-KO) mice displayed a partial block in {gamma}{delta}T17 maturation and an inability to produce IL-17. We also found that HEB cKO mice failed to upregulate Id3 during {gamma}{delta}T17 development, whereas HEB overexpression elevated the levels of Id3 in collaboration with TCR signaling. Moreover, Egr2 and HEB were bound to several of the same regulatory sites on the Id3 gene locus in the context of early T cell development.

Although prior studies discuss the regulation of ALAS2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm, its modulation as a mature mitochondrial matrix enzyme remains poorly understood. We report that heme binds mature human ALAS2 with high affinity, acting as a reversible mixed inhibitor that reduces enzymatic activity. Structure-based modeling reveals two flexible regions of ALAS2 interact with heme, locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation and occluding the active site.

Advances in the field have been constrained by the lack of reliable biomarkers for SE detection, incomplete mapping of cerebellar metabolic alterations in SE, and limited insight into the therapeutic mechanisms of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicle (sEV) therapy. To overcome these challenges, we used a murine sepsis model and conducted integrated metabolomic analyses of cerebellar tissue and plasma, with and without MSC-sEV administration. Cross-compartment analyses identified six plasma metabolites with strong diagnostic potential in mice, three of which (n-acetylputrescine, aspartic acid, and cystathionine) were also observed in the plasma of human septic patients, supporting their promise as translatable biomarker candidates. Sepsis triggered profound cerebellar metabolic dysfunction, suppression of oxidative energy metabolism, and redox imbalance.

O.", "abstract": "Meter, the organization of beats into regular groupings, is a core element of music perception. Switches in meters frequently occur in music, reflecting the interplay between top-down attentional processes and the bottom-up processing of acoustic features. To disentangle this interplay in meter perception, we had previously invented a sound stimulus that simultaneously contained two meters. This dual-meter stimulus consisted of band-limited noise bursts that varied in center frequency and duration, with one feature following a triple-meter pattern and the other following a quadruple-meter pattern. Thus, the perceived meter switches between the two by changing attention from one acoustic feature to another, even when listening to identical stimuli. Using these stimuli, we here demonstrated the neural processes involved in meter perception by recording electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, while dissociating the influence of acoustic differences. We first found that the perceived meter structure was reflected in the entrained neural oscillations by comparing the spectral profiles of EEG signals when the participants focused on triple-meter versus quadruple-meter features. Second, an event-related potential component for anticipation (P300) was observed when the expected meter structure was disrupted by altering the frequency or duration of one sound at the end of the stimulus. Finally, individuals with stronger neural entrainment exhibited larger P300 responses to these disruptions. Our findings suggest that top-down attention modulates anticipation of the meter structure, and this anticipation induces neural entrainment that is involved in meter perception.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

C.; Ragoussis, J.; Prat, A.; Thebault, S.; Zandee, S.; Stratton, J. A.", "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in which autoreactive immune cells migrate through a damaged blood brain barrier, resulting in focal demyelinating lesions of both the white and grey matter. Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS. Methods: We first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption. Results: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour. Conclusion: These data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects of non-motor MS symptomatology.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

This highlights the need for new in vitro models to investigate the interplay of mechanical loading and cell-substrate interactions. Therefore, this study introduces a tunable stretching chamber platform to simultaneously study both factors in AF degeneration. Methods: Tunable PDMS substrates were fabricated by adjusting ratios of Sylgard 184 and Sylgard 527, enabling molding into stretching chambers or well plates. Substrates underwent mechanical, optical and chemical characterization. Bovine AF cells were seeded onto the substrates and cultured under static conditions or subjected to cyclic strain (8% strain at 1 Hz). Substrate biocompatibility and cell morphology were assessed over 72 h in static cultures. Dynamic responses were assessed by cell viability and alignment. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was employed to assess surface strain in custom-designed and commercial (STREX) stretching chambers at strains between 8 to 20%. Results: PDMS formulations resulted in a stiffness (E modulus) range of 8.72 to 238.00 kPa, demonstrating distinct viscoelastic profiles. All substrate formulations supported AF cell adhesion and viability. DIC analysis revealed non-uniform axial and transverse strain distributions on membrane surfaces. Cyclic stretching showed that cells maintained viability up to 14 h. Additionally, cells responded to the applied strain by perpendicular alignment to the stretch axis at 6 h. Conclusions: The PDMS based stretching platform offers a biocompatible and tunable mechanical environment that mimics physiological and pathophysiological elastic properties. It enables systematic investigations on how elastic properties and mechanical strain modulate AF cell behavior in IVD disease progression. Finally, this study raises the awareness of non-uniform and transverse strain components within the stretching chambers and highlights the discrepancy of effective strain transfer to the cell interaction surface.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

It is unclear if we expanded across Africa, however, this manuscript highlights methodological issues in previous research on the topic. Moreover, we are known to lack clarity on where the expansion would have begun. The present study explored the expansion by examining types of diversity in sub-Saharan Africans: cranial shape (13 populations), autosomal (20 populations), X-chromosomal (17 populations), and, adjusting for minimum temperature, mitochondrial (20 populations). For each diversity, i) it was examined if there is a geographical pattern within Africa and ii) the best choices for the origin of the expansion were estimated. A ranking procedure indicated, across diversities, where the expansion originated. Each diversity declined with increasing distance from somewhere inside of Africa. Findings with autosomal diversity appeared to be driven by the datapoint for Somalis. A southern origin was specified by cranial and X-chromosomal diversities. No singular region was identified by autosomal or mitochondrial diversities. Simultaneous examination of diversities indicated an expansion from southern Africa. Admixture is a known obstacle for using diversity to study expansion. It is explained why results might not have arisen from a broad effect of admixture given that i) linkage disequilibrium previously pointed to the south and ii) supplementary analysis with additional measures (which should not broadly be affected by admixture) tentatively indicated a southern origin.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Literature on visual performance across visual fields during saccades is limited, but existing studies show that perceptual performance during saccades is indistinguishable between the upper and the lower visual fields, or altogether better in the upper visual field compared to lower. In the current exploratory study, we asked participants to detect the direction of target displacement across visual fields, while performing a saccade as well as at fixation.

We also considered an alternate hypothesis: cationic electrostatic interactions between histones and negatively charged phospholipids, deforming endothelial cell membranes and thereby allowing extracellular Ca2+ entry. A role for SOCE in histone responses was ruled out by genetic ablation of the ORAI1/2/3 channel trio; histone effects were blocked by application of the multivalent cation gadolinium Gd3+. Using live cell video microscopy of endothelial cell labeled with membrane dye FM1-43, we recorded fast plasma membrane movements including vesiculation, blebbing, and ruffling of lamellipodia over 60 minutes following histone exposure. These cell membrane theatrics were markedly different from the uniform pattern of rapid exocytosis and subsequent blebbing produced by calcium overload with ionomycin. The membrane permeabilization produced by histones, and not ionomycin, was transient and a subset of cells recovered membrane integrity within 1 hour. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented histone-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload while surprisingly exacerbating plasma membrane deformation. Conversely, decreasing the density of the negative charge surface by adding calcium or or increasing extracellular Ca2+ levels effectively screened common membrane phospholipids from interactions with labeled histones and prevented endothelial damage in cells exposed to histones. Collectively these results indicate that low extracellular Ca2+ levels enhance interactions between histones and endothelial cell membrane phospholipids to increase cytotoxicity. Importantly, this supports the concept of aggressive Ca2+ repletion during resuscitation to prevent hypocalcemia, stabilize endothelial cell membranes and improve cardiovascular recovery from shock.\n\nSignificanceIn acute critical illness, the rapid collapse of vascular endothelial functions drives aberrant blood clotting and organ failure through mechanisms that are not understood. Emerging evidence that early administration of donor plasma improves survival of trauma patients has transformed the massive transfusion protocols used in surgical settings, but the sodium citrate included in transfused blood products to prevent coagulation often produces significant and severe hypocalcemia. Here, we demonstrate that cytotoxic trauma factors that are elevated in the blood during resuscitation interact electrostatically with endothelial cell phospholipids, and that low Ca2+ exacerbates toxicity by increasing this interaction. Using high speed video imaging, we demonstrate fast endothelial cell membrane movements in response to injury, including protrusion and ruffling of lamellipodia, release and reuptake of extracellular vesicles, and blebbing. These findings provide important insights into the nature of shock-induced endotheliopathy and highlight the potential cardiovascular risk associated with chelation-induced hypocalcemia during resuscitation.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncover a shared mechanotransduction pathway through which both BRAF inhibition and matrix stiffness converge in nuclear remodeling to drive CAF activation. Mechanistically, BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis) accelerate RAS-dependent RAF homo and heterodimerization and ERK signaling, leading to GSK-3{beta} inactivation and Rho kinase (ROCK) activation. In parallel, stiff substrates engage integrin receptors to directly activate ROCK signaling. Activation of ROCK induces actin stress fiber assembly, generating mechanical forces that deform the nucleus. In both contexts, nuclear reshaping promotes {beta}-catenin translocation and actin polymerization through a feedback loop that continuously enforces CAF activation and promotes melanoma progression. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of ROCK activity blocks both BRAFi- and stiffness-induced nuclear remodeling and {beta}-catenin accumulation, identifying the ROCK-cytoskeleton-nucleus axis as a critical regulator of CAF adaptation and functionality. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanically tuned nuclear signaling hub that integrates chemical and physical cues to promote stromal adaptation and suggest ROCK inhibition as a strategy to counteract therapy-induced fibroblast reprogramming and improve therapy response.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

This requires associating internal position estimates with external cues to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. However, how grid cell representations evolve in novel spaces to support map formation is unclear. To address this question, we longitudinally record grid cells with two-photon calcium imaging over 10 days as mice learn operant tasks in novel virtual linear tracks. We observe that spatial tuning of grid cells is present immediately in novel tracks but evolves as a significant fraction of spatial fields shift backward on a run-by-run basis, within and across days. Backward shifts are more prevalent and persistent in successful learners. The fields gradually stabilize across days, anchored by landmarks, suggesting a slow plasticity mechanism that results in an increasingly fragmented and stable map. The backward shifts partially reset daily, reflecting a slower consolidation timescale. We show that though individual fields of a cell shift differentially, co-active fields of co-modular grid cells shift together, indicating their coupled dynamics keep them on the same two-dimensional torus during this plastic period. Next, we build an entorhinal-hippocampal model that provides a mechanistic explanation of the diverse phenomena - grid field shifts, fragmentation, and increasing fidelity of the spatial map - and predicts slow Hebbian plasticity in the return hippocampus-to-entorhinal pathway. Finally, using ex vivo slice electrophysiology, we show that plasticity in an indirect hippocampus-to-MEC pathway correlates with spatial learning performance and could account for the hypothesized slow plasticity of the model. Together, our study provides multifaceted evidence of slow plasticity in synapses from the hippocampus to the MEC, elucidating the formation of stable and fragmented maps that combine internal and cue-driven positional estimates in rich environments, elucidating cognitive map formation during spatial learning.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Still, under physiological conditions, they show no apparent signs of cellular injury. We hypothesized that the study of transcription factors (TFs) enriched in MCD cells might identify pathways of stress resilience. Methods: We generated single-cell expression data from mouse kidneys and predicted in silico candidate TFs with MCD-enriched expression and activity. To investigate the transcriptomic effects of perturbing these candidate TFs, we devised a single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. Results: We found that perturbation of interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (Ilf2), Krueppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), and JunB proto-oncogene (Junb) significantly impacted IMCD3 cells' gene expression programs, including genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and stress-related intracellular signaling, highlighting these TFs as potential regulators of cell-specific resilience. We then focused on Ilf2, validated its impact on gene expression signatures by RNA sequencing, and identified a further role of Ilf2 in the splicing of genes involved in epithelial cellular dynamics and stress responses. Loss of Ilf2 function in IMCD3 cells resulted in nuclear atypia, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased cell death in response to osmotic stress. Ilf2 was upregulated in mouse kidneys during the repair phase following ischemia-reperfusion injury, as were Ilf2-regulated transcripts and splicing events, suggesting that Ilf2 might serve as a post-ischemic signal to facilitate epithelial stress resilience. Conclusions: Our approach nominates novel pathways of cellular resilience in kidney tubular cells and highlights Ilf2 as a potential target for kidney protection.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Development of therapeutics to this target has previously relied on native purifications of Pf20S, which is challenging and has limited the scope of previous efforts. Here, we report an effective recombinant Pf20S platform to facilitate drug discovery. Proteasome assembly was carried out in insect cells by co-expressing all fourteen subunits along with the essential chaperone homolog, Ump1. Unexpectedly, the isolated proteins consisted of both a mature and an immature complex. Cryo-EM analysis of the immature complexes revealed structural insights detailing how Ump1 and the propeptides of the {beta}2 and {beta}5 subunits coordinate {beta}-ring assembly, which differ from human and yeast homologs. Biochemical validation confirmed that {beta}1, {beta}2, and {beta}5 subunits of the mature proteasome were catalytically active. Clinical proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, carfilzomib and marizomib were potent but lacked Pf20S selectivity. However, the tripeptide-epoxyketone J-80 inhibited Pf20S {beta}5 with an IC50 of 22.4 nM and 90-fold selectivity over human {beta}5.

In ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and primary visual cortex (V1), neural patterns for novel stimuli (composites) could be predicted as a linear combination of signals for familiar stimuli (elements).

R.; Suvorov, A.", "abstract": "A growing body of empirical research shows that interspecific gene flow is a widespread biological force that shapes evolutionary histories across the Tree of Life. Computational approaches designed to detect introgression either employ full likelihood, including Bayesian frameworks, to directly estimate phylogenetic networks or utilize summary statistics derived directly from locus sequence alignments or estimated gene trees to map gene flow events onto the species tree. Many current methods currently have major shortcomings. The computationally scalable summary statistics and pseudo-likelihood-based techniques may provide erroneous results in the presence of so-called ghost introgression and rate variation between lineages. On the other hand, full likelihood methods are more accurate, but are not computationally tractable for large phylogenomic datasets. Here, we develop a novel summary statistic, based on tree heights of different gene tree topologies to reliably distinguish between sampled and ghost introgression events. We implemented this approach in the publicly accessible bioinformatic pipeline GhostParser. We demonstrate that GhostParser can accurately distinguish between scenarios of sampled and ghost introgression, even in the presence of rate variation between lineages. Our methodology concurs in accuracy with the full likelihood software Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) on empirical datasets, and outperforms BPP in our simulation conditions, both in a small fraction of the computational time. We show that GhostParser is a scalable tool for the identification of different introgression patterns in phylogenomic datasets.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

In mouse sperm, SPINK3 blocks capacitation-induced CATSPER1 cleavage, preserving a subpopulation with intact CatSper channels and lacking pTyr development in the flagellum. SPINK3 localizes to the outer surface of the sperm principal piece membrane in a CatSper-dependent but non-quadrilateral pattern, stabilizes membrane organization, and delays cholesterol efflux.

Widefield imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes was used to track sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Multiphoton microscopy allowed assessments of amyloid plaque load and basal neuronal calcium levels. Behavioral assays were used to measure memory and cognitive function. RESULTS: Zolpidem restored NREM sleep and rescued sleep-dependent brain rhythm, slow oscillation. Zolpidem administration reduced cortical amyloid plaque burden, mitigated neuronal calcium overload, and enhanced sleep-dependent memory consolidation without adverse effects on locomotion.

We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a generalisable route for preparing tissue for high-resolution X-ray imaging.

We first validated our approach in the written word domain, where the technique identified significant correlations for word frequency in the left mid-fusiform cortex (at the location of the Visual Word Form Area) with a left occipital region tracking bigram frequency, compatible with prior reports. During listening, low-frequency spoken words elicited greater responses in a left mid-superior temporal region consistent with the recently-described Auditory Word Form Area (AWFA), while a more posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus was sensitive to syllable frequency.

Here, we combined large-scale genetic screening and high-resolution lifespan phenotyping with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to provide a systems view of metformin's impact on the chronological lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, we uncovered pronounced gene-drug interactions between metformin and chromatin-modifying factors. Specifically, deletions of Set3C histone deacetylation complex subunits phenocopied the longevity effect of metformin, with no additive benefit when combined, suggesting convergence on shared pathways. Transcriptome profiling further revealed that metformin reprogrammed stationary-phase gene expression, with Ty1-copia retrotransposons emerging as a consistently induced signature, thereby suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed interactions with Set3C regulation. Paradoxically, TYA Gag-like protein levels and retrotransposition frequency were modestly reduced, indicating an uncoupling between transcriptional activation and retromobility. Proteome analysis revealed increased abundance of mitochondrial and stress-response proteins as primary outcomes of metformin exposure, both known modulators of Ty1 dynamics in yeast.

They receive inhibitory control from Lugaro cells, other GoCs, and cerebellar nuclear inhibitory neurons via GABAergic and glycinergic inputs. Although fetal alcohol exposure is known to impair cerebellar function, its impact on developing GoC physiology remains unclear. We investigated the acute effects of ethanol on GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission in GoCs during the mouse equivalent of the human third trimester, a critical window for inhibitory circuit formation. To identify GoCs, we used VGAT-Venus transgenic mice, in which the vesicular GABA transporter promoter drives expression of the Venus fluorescent protein. Whole-cell patch-clamp and loose-patch recordings from postnatal day (P) 6-10 mice revealed that ethanol exposure dose-dependently increased the frequency of action potential-dependent GABA-A receptor-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in GoCs. While ethanol produced variable effects on GoC firing rates, it more consistently enhanced GABA-A-sPSC frequency in granule cells. We also examined expression of the K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a chloride exporter whose developmental upregulation drives the shift in GABAA receptor signaling from excitatory to inhibitory. Immunohistochemical analysis at P6 showed that GoCs express low levels of KCC2, suggesting that GABA-A receptor-mediated currents may remain depolarizing in a subset of GoCs. This property could contribute to ethanol-induced disruption of cerebellar circuit maturation. Together, these findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which ethanol perturbs inhibitory circuit development in the cerebellum.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

The corticolimbic system including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in fear learning. Using the limited bedding paradigm (LB), we examined the functional consequences of ELS on excitatory and inhibitory tone in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC after fear conditioning in rats. In adults, LB exposure enhanced in vivo glutamate release in the PL mPFC during fear conditioning in male, but not female offspring. In contrast, the glutamate response to fear conditioning was diminished in LB-exposed pre-adolescent males, but not females. We investigated whether reduced glutamatergic inputs and/or elevated inhibitory tone might contribute to the diminished glutamate response in the mPFC following LB in pre-adolescent male rats. Indeed, we found that LB exposure specifically increased the activation of PV, but not SST interneurons in layer V, but not layer II/III of the PL mPFC in fear-exposed pre-adolescent males. Presynaptic glutamate release probability was reduced by LB exposure in layer V, but increased in layer II/III of the PL mPFC. These functional changes might be related to the LB-induced alterations in the bilaminar distribution of BLA and vHIP projections to the PL mPFC we observed in pre-adolescent males. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS modifies glutamate release and PL mPFC function during fear conditioning in a sex- and age- dependent fashion, likely through layer-specific shifts in excitation/inhibition balance.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

It is of immense cultural and spiritual importance to Inuit peoples and is hunted across the Arctic. Declines in sea ice have caused habitat fragmentation and loss, disrupting movement and prey access, potentially altering genetic structure and influencing polar bear's potential to persist. Using samples collected from 1997 to 2020 by Inuit across much of the Canadian Arctic, 322 genome-wide autosomal DNA markers specifically designed to quantify polar bear genetic structure and a very stringent spatial-temporal method, we compare polar bear spatial genetic structure and landscape features between two periods across a consistent distribution: 1997-2008 and 2009-2020. We observe marked changes in spatial genetic structure across the Arctic Archipelago over just two decades, shifting the boundaries between polar bear genetic clusters by ~250 km. Landscape resistance models reveal the importance of sea ice and land cover type for each period, with spatial lag models showing that genetic change is best predicted by sea ice shifts between periods.

Implicit motor adaptation - adaptation that occurs without conscious awareness - is thought to be primarily driven by sensory prediction errors. Here, we investigated how rapidly these unconscious changes in reaching behavior emerge as a function of error magnitude and the availability of task error signals. To this end, we employed a single-trial learning (STL) paradigm within a classical visuomotor rotation task. Participants made center-out reaching movements to either small (dot) or large (arc) targets while experiencing single perturbation trials with cursor rotations ranging from 1 to 90 deg, each followed by an aligned washout trial. By manipulating target size, we systematically modulated the presence of task error while holding sensory prediction error constant. We further compared these early implicit changes with those observed during standard prolonged adaptation to a fixed 20-deg rotation across >100 trials. Our results show that implicit adaptation emerges rapidly, even after a single exposure to small perturbations, and follows a saturating, fixed-rate response profile. Importantly, the magnitude of single-trial adaptation was greater when task error was present (small targets) compared with conditions in which only sensory prediction error was available (large targets). Moreover, STL-derived parameters moderately predicted the initial phase of adaptation during prolonged learning, suggesting that STL captures core dynamics of early implicit processes. These findings provide new insight into the mechanistic principles governing implicit motor adaptation. By identifying the parameters that drive early-stage error-based learning, this work refines current models of sensorimotor learning and highlights potential strategies for designing targeted training or rehabilitation protocols that leverage rapid adaptation processes to enhance motor performance and recovery.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Organisms are particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of stress during critical periods, when neuroplasticity is heightened, and initial representations of the sensory environment are mapped to cortex. When ELS is induced during the auditory cortical (ACx) critical period, it impairs both neural and behavioral responses to a variety of auditory stimuli that rely on temporal processing. Mechanisms by which ELS may alter critical period plasticity are of particular interest in understanding ELS-related pathology, including the 5-HT3R interneuron system, which has been implicated in regulating neural activity during critical periods. Here we examined two principal subpopulations of interneurons in primary ACx: VIP and NDNF cells, which account for a majority of cortical neurons expressing 5-HT3R. The expression of the Htr3a gene during normal development and under ELS conditions was quantified using multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. We show that densities of cells expressing NDNF and VIP decrease following ear opening and across the ACx critical period, and that ELS results in the maintenance of elevated cell densities compared to age-matched controls. Further, Htr3a in VIP neurons is developmentally upregulated, and its expression is further increased by ELS beyond normal physiologic levels. Stress-induced shifts in these serotonergic interneurons may contribute to deficits that arise in auditory cortical and perceptual responses via effects on local cortical circuitry.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Neurological disorders have been associated with mutations within the domain tethering Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS1) to the multisynthetase complex, which offers an interesting bridge between protein synthesis and neurodevelopment. To interrogate this connection, we developed a mouse model, where RARS1 is excluded from the multisynthetase complex in the forebrain. We observed profound disruptions in neural development as attested by drastically reduced forebrain size and behavioral deficits. At the molecular level, neurodevelopmental and ribosomal genes were dysregulated. Finally, the subcellular localization of RARS1 and its colocalization with other translational machinery components were perturbed. Altogether, our results reveal the necessity of RARS1 integration in the multisynthetase complex for proper neurodevelopment.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

The full suite of visual analysis entails activity across several visual areas and feedback from later areas to earlier ones. This raises the question of whether the early sensory representation indexed by the C1 is readout for perceptual decisions or whether it is passed over in favour of more advanced representations. To address this question, we asked whether the C1 would predict time-pressured stimulus contrast comparisons independently of physical stimulus conditions, a phenomenon known as choice probability. We found that the C1 did this for a narrow range of response times, indicative of decision readout since the C1 is a transient signal. This effect could not be accounted for by stimulus differences, choice history, or any other choice-predictive signal that we could identify in either the time or frequency domain, either before or after target onset. It also preceded the onset of evidence-dependent decision formation estimated from the centroparietal positivity by tens of milliseconds, together providing an approximate timeline of early evidence readout and its delayed impact on the decision.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Phase slip rates are discontinuities in instantaneous phase that represent cortical phase transitions, indicating a significant change in the overall brain state. We employed 128-channel EEG data from eight NMC and eight NVP subjects, collected during a gamified protocol, to investigate object identification within a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was continuously acquired during the first 50 trials for each subject. We retained 44 artifact-free trials per subject (the minimum common across all subjects) and computed within-subject averages. The EEGs were then averaged over NMC and NVP subjects. The EEG was filtered in the alpha band, and the phase was extracted using the Hilbert transform, unwrapped, and the phase slip rates were computed. A montage layout of electrodes was used to make the spatiotemporal plots of biomarkers. Our findings revealed that the spatiotemporal profiles of all four biomarkers differed significantly between the two groups of subjects. Furthermore, the NVP subjects demonstrated faster object recognition.

Most physical interaction tasks require force generation, and that can compromise stability. To ensure stability, muscles are required to produce a certain mechanical impedance (especially stiffness and damping). In this work we investigate the human limits of force generation and test whether and how those limits are constrained by our ability to stabilize the task. Moreover, we also study how strongly limb configuration - known to play a key role in transmitting muscle tension to hand force - matters in the generation of force. We devised an experiment in which healthy individuals performed a maximum voluntary pushing task using a custom-designed gimbal apparatus which allowed us to conditionally change the ability to transmit torque at the wrist, thus enabling or disabling stabilization via wrist pronation-supination, ulnar-radial deviation, and flexion-extension. The experiment was repeated in two different arm configurations (preferred and undesired) to assess the effect of limb configuration. The results showed: (i) a statistically significant and substantial decrease in maximum output force with less wrist ability to generate stabilizing torque, and (ii) a significant but minimal difference in maximum pushing force between the two arm configurations. Interestingly, subjects unexpectedly improved their maximum pushing performance between pre- and post-experiment, suggesting a negligible effect of fatigue and a possible effect of learning. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that force production appears to be limited by stiffness production. Muscles do not primarily generate force, but generate mechanical impedance.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing to define the cellular diversity and molecular programs following intratracheal bleomycin injury in mice, we observed that Rtel1 was most highly expressed in the lung epithelium, and its expression was reduced in PF epithelial cells compared to nonfibrotic controls. While global deletion of Rtel1 leads to embryonic lethality, constitutive deletion of Rtel1 in the lung epithelium (Rtel{Delta}epi) led to normal lung structure and architecture. Rtel1{Delta}epi mice exhibited accelerated telomere attrition and impaired AEC progenitor potential ex-vivo. Despite decreased AEC progenitor function, no differences in lung fibrosis were observed in Rtel{Delta}epi mice compared to controls following single-dose or repetitive intratracheal bleomycin.

However, adaptation of the ANS physiological arousal response during repeat exposure to walking challenges remains unknown. This study examines the physiological arousal response (electrodermal activation, EDA) and motor control strategy of gait during a single session of repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking. Twenty young adults completed three repeated blocks (3.5 min each) of split-belt walking (2:1 speed ratio) alternating with three blocks of tied-belt walking. Step length symmetry (SLS), EDA, bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle activation and ground reaction forces (GRFs) were measured. For each walking block, the first (early) and last (late) 15 strides were analyzed. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) tested the effect of repeated blocks and phases (early/late) on SLS. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) examined patterns of within-block changes in EDA, muscle activation, and GRFs. The greatest within-block adaptation of SLS occurred during first exposure to split-belt walking (S1; p<.001). Similarly, the largest magnitude of within-block adaptation in muscle activation, GRFs, and EDA occurred during S1 (p<.05). Attenuated EDA responses together with lower magnitude of motor adaptation in subsequent split blocks 2 and 3 were observed, indicating savings across the ANS and CNS. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ANS-mediated physiological arousal response modulates alongside the CNS-driven locomotor adaptation to repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Within classical Signal Detection Theory (SDT), confidence is conceptualized as the absolute distance between a decision variable and a decision criterion. The decision criterion is traditionally modelled as being stable over an experimental session. However, recent work challenges the notion of a static decision criterion, suggesting instead that the criterion undergoes trial-by-trial fluctuations. Combining SDT theory and model simulations, we predict that fluctuations in the decision criterion shape confidence. In 15 human decision-making datasets, trial-by-trial estimates of decision criterion were obtained with the Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion (hMFC). Across all datasets, we confirmed our pre-registered hypothesis that confidence is shaped by single-trial criterion state. This effect was found in 14 out of 15 individual datasets, indicating a robust pattern across a variety of task paradigms and confidence reporting scales. Going beyond self-report, the shaping of confidence by criterion fluctuations was replicated in an implicit measure of confidence, RTs, and in two key neurophysiological markers, pupil-linked arousal and a neural signature of confidence. Our results demonstrate that variability in confidence, which has traditionally been treated as noise, actually reflects genuine sensitivity to the current state of the (fluctuating) decision criterion.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

To delineate the aspects of data quality that impact predictive performance, we conducted in silico ablation experiments, which showed that increased sparsity and noise in molecular data degraded predictive performance, while in silico rescue experiments via imputation provided only limited improvements that failed to generalize beyond the test set. Likewise, reduced image resolution can degrade predictive performance and further impacts model interpretability.

Once these chemicals enter into cells (human or other organisms), they can be also transformed into products that differ in terms of toxicity and health effects. Recent developments in machine learning methods and chemical data science resources have enabled the in-silico prediction of transformation reactions. Here, we report an integrated workflow of these existing resources (RXNMmapper, Rxn-INSIGHT and RDChiral) to predict the transformation product for any chemical in the exposome. We have generated a large library of reaction templates from > 90,000 reactions sourced from the PubChem database. Utility of the reaction screening and transformation prediction workflow has been demonstrated for insecticides structures (n=181), yielding 21,284 unique transformation products. Many of these products have PubChem entries but have not yet been linked with the parent compounds.

D.; Blagg, B. S.

Here, we developed an integrative computational framework that leverages PRISM drug sensitivity profiles from DepMap, multi-omic datasets, and perturbagen libraries to systematically characterize and identify strategies to reverse broad resistance in cancer cell lines. We found that resistant lines exhibit transcriptional programs enriched for extracellular matrix remodeling, stress adaptation, and survival signaling, with NFE2L2 emerging as a central regulatory hub linked to upstream mutations and downstream oxidative stress pathways. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics highlighted metabolic reprogramming as a hallmark of resistance, while mutation analyses revealed convergence on growth factor and ECM-related pathways. These features were also reflected in patient cohorts, where resistance-associated mutations correlated with reduced progression-free survival across diverse cancer types. Computational perturbagen screening identified candidate compounds predicted to reverse resistance-associated gene expression profiles, converging on actionable targets including NFE2L2, ABCB1, and CYP3A4, with compounds such as brefeldin A and nocodazole predicted to have strong activity in resistant lines.

We previously found that leukemia cells leverage intronic APA (IPA) to generate shorter RNA isoforms, which perturbs the expression and function of tumor suppressor genes. Besides protein-coding RNA, we observed that leukemia cells express numerous long non-coding RNAs through IPA, with most of them undocumented and uncharacterized. Here, we report a non-coding IPA isoform in the TP53 gene. With a custom-made antibody, we found that this isoform produces a non-canonical peptide, IDP1 (IPA-Derived Protein 1), using a cryptic open reading frame. The expression was observed in leukemia patients and blood cancer cell lines. Although IDP1 is nested in the TP53 gene, a well-known tumor suppressor, we revealed the oncogenic role of IDP1 in enhancing cell survival during drug treatments, as well as promoting tumor formation in vivo. With proteomic approaches and functional studies, our data suggested that IDP1 increases cell viability by regulating apoptotic signaling, cell cycle, and DNA damage responses. Mechanistically, IDP1 does not abrogate the accumulation and oligomerization of p53 under drug treatments, nor did it interact with p53, indicating that IDP1's impact on survival pathways may not be through influencing p53 protein directly. Collectively, our work highlights that alternative isoforms can be functionally independent of the corresponding genes. In addition to truncating the host genes, IPA can lead to gain of gene products and functions.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

T.; Alali, H. M.; Wallach, J. V.; Canal, C. E.", "abstract": "Radioligands are well-established tools for measuring ligand binding affinities at receptors. Determining affinities of test ligands at many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including serotonin (5-HT) GPCRs, often involves incubating a radioligand, test ligands, and receptors expressed in cell membranes in Tris buffers, and commonly in a standard binding buffer (SBB) containing Tris HCl, MgCl2, and EDTA until ligand-receptor equilibrium binding is established. However, the composition of extracellular fluid (ECF), where ligands first encounter GPCRs in vivo, differs from that of SBB, which we hypothesized impacts ligand affinity. We conducted radioligand binding assays to compare the affinities of the agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and two antagonists/inverse agonists, lurasidone and SB-269970, at [3H]5-CT-labeled 5-HT7 GPCRs stably expressed in HEK293 cells using SBB or artificial brain ECF (abECF) as the medium at room or physiological temperatures (RT or 37 C). The rank order of ligand potencies, as well as 5-CT's affinity, was unaffected by the different experimental environments. [3H]5-CT 5-HT7R Bmax values increased in abECF and modestly at 37 C, without affecting Kd, suggesting an increase in active state conformations. In contrast to 5-CT, antagonist/inverse agonist affinities depended on both media and temperature. The affinities of lurasidone and SB-269970 at 5-HT7 receptors were substantially higher at 37 C than at RT. Also, incubation of lurasidone and SB-269970 in abECF resulted in significantly higher affinities compared to incubation in SBB (e.g., ~10-fold higher for lurasidone), indicating that temperature and the buffer and ionic composition of abECF influence 5- HT7 antagonist/inverse agonist ligand binding. As a high concentration of NaCl in abECF is a remarkable difference from the composition of SBB, we probed the impact of removing NaCl from abECF; removal of NaCl had a minor affinity-enhancing effect on the antagonists, inferring that other ions, glucose, or sodium phosphates in abECF underlie significant changes in ligand-receptor binding interactions. Overall, the observations indicate that measuring 5-HT7 antagonist affinities at [3H]5-CT-labeled 5-HT7Rs with abECF at physiological temperature, modeling the in vivo brain environment where ligands and GPCRs interact, yields distinct affinity values that may be more physiologically accurate than values obtained from SBB. Moreover, several historical reports demonstrate that temperature, ions, and buffers have no consistent effect on the affinities of distinct ligands at various other GPCRs, and there is no consensus binding buffer used in the literature for any GPCR, which may contribute to the variability in ligand-GPCR affinities reported. These findings show that buffer and temperature impacted 5-HT7R ligand binding affinities and highlight the importance of considering such conditions when performing experiments.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Delivering RT at ultra-high dose rates (FLASH-RT) represents a transformative strategy, as it appears to maintain tumor control, while sparing normal tissue. Melanoma is among the most radioresistant tumors, and skin and muscle are invariably exposed during RT, also in case of deep seated tumors. Here, we compared electron FLASH-RT and conventional RT (CONV-RT) in melanoma-bearing and naive mice assessing tumor control, tissue integrity, and systemic homeostasis over the medium to long term. Both modalities achieved comparable tumor suppression. However, CONV-RT induced persistent skin damage, dermal fibrosis, muscle dysfunction and systemic inflammatory-metabolic alterations, while FLASH-RT largely spared normal tissue and systemic balance. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed striking differences: FLASH induced minimal transcriptional disruption in skin and muscle, whereas CONV-RT triggered thousands of differentially expressed genes, including massive activation of fibrosis, inflammation, cell death-related pathways in skin, and broad dysregulation of genes linked to muscle function, remodeling and the unfolded protein response. Histological and ultrastructural analyses corroborated the findings, showing reduced immune infiltration in the skin and preserved tissue architecture both in skin and muscle following FLASH. In conclusion our study not only confirms the protective nature of FLASH but also provides novel mechanistic insights into the cascade linking local injury to systemic dysfunction under CONV-RT, reinforcing the translational potential of FLASH to expand the therapeutic window of radiotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

The analytical framework utilized a sophisticated combination of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), and advanced machine learning algorithms. NMF clustering uncovered distinctive protein expression patterns associated with integrin-mediated signaling pathways and immune response mechanisms. Complementarily, MOFA identified latent factors correlating with lung function metrics, highlighting critical molecular pathways involved in integrin cell surface interactions and lipid metabolism regulation. Machine learning-based analysis facilitated the development of a multi-marker panel, comprising IGHV2-70, LysoPC (16:0), and hexadecyl ferulate, which achieved 81.46% accuracy in identifying pulmonary dysfunction cohort.

Four genotype groups were generated, including those harboring mutation related to liver disease progression (rt269/s184) and basal core promoter/precore mutations (A1762T/G1896A). Comparative analyses of 406 high-abundance plasma proteins revealed distinct proteomic signatures, particularly in the ##AG group lacking mutation related to liver disease progression motifs.

W.", "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is a prominent but poorly understood component of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strongest genetic risk factor for AD, APOE4, is associated with multiple cerebrovascular pathologies, including vascular amyloid accumulation and fibrosis. APOE4 also renders the cerebrovasculature fragile to the point where the only disease-modifying AD therapeutic, anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, are warned against use in APOE4 carriers due to a high risk of hemorrhage and edema. To determine how APOE4 impacts cerebrovascular cells and pathogenesis, we generated a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics atlas of human cerebrovasculature from APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. In APOE4 individuals, we found that the number of microvascular pericytes was significantly reduced. Notably, loss of pericytes in APOE4 carriers was accompanied by the emergence of a unique population of mural cells characterized by high expression of contraction and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, hallmarks of myofibroblasts. Immunostaining revealed the presence of myofibroblasts surrounding the microvasculature in APOE4 human hippocampi that were absent in age-matched APOE3/3 controls, even in cases of AD. Myofibroblast presence coincided with a significant increase in fibronectin and amyloid surrounding the vasculature. Myofibroblasts were also present around the microvasculature of aged APOE4/4 but not APOE3/3 mice, suggesting myofibroblast appearance is a direct effect of the APOE4 genotype and not a technical artifact of processing human tissue. To determine the mechanisms and functional implications of APOE4-mediated myofibroblast, we leveraged a vascularized human brain tissue (miBrain) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Similar to the post-mortem human brain, APOE4/4 miBrains showed significantly reduced microvascular pericyte coverage, coinciding with the emergence of myofibroblasts co-expressing ECM and contractile genes. Lineage tracing and genetic mixing experiments confirmed that the myofibroblasts emerge from APOE4 pericytes and secrete fibronectin-rich ECM. Knocking down fibronectin in APOE4 mural cells significantly reduced vascular amyloid accumulation. To determine how myofibroblast-like cells arise in the APOE4 brain, we performed computational analysis (NicheNet) on our post-mortem human single-cell transcriptomics cerebrovascular atlas. This predicted that TGF-{beta} is the top causal driver of the pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition. Consistent with this prediction, we found that TGF-{beta} ligands in astrocytes and receptors in mural cells are significantly upregulated compared to APOE3 controls. Chemical and genetic inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling in APOE4 miBrains significantly reduced myofibroblast presence, while concurrently increasing pericyte microvascular coverage and ultimately lowering vascular fibrosis and amyloid accumulation to APOE3 levels. Using a comprehensive three-pronged approach incorporating analysis of human post-mortem brain, APOE humanized mice, and human iPSC-derived vascularized brain tissue, we demonstrate that APOE4 in mouse and human brain tissue causes increased TGF-{beta} signaling, promoting a pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition that leads to vascular fibrosis and amyloid deposition. This provides critical insight into the mechanisms underlying APOE4 cerebrovascular dysfunction, highlighting new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a major AD risk population.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

We develop a delayed Van der Pol in which the delay ratio r acts as a control parameter for Hopf bifurcation and internal resonance and we pair it with an auditable, short-window signal-processing pipeline tailored to early beta activity. The pipeline combines Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) ridge tracking, kernel-density estimates (KDE) of the dominant frequency, and algorithmic beta-burst detection under fixed, shared parameters. Transient burden is quantified by a metric triplet with a software-implementable attenuation rule and complemented by an early-detection index-the Transient Persistence Time. Across methods, we observe a monotonic attenuation of short-lived beta transients as r approaches a critical band. A reliable observation window of 0-0.35 s captures compact early packets at low r, progressive ridge stabilization in CWT, KDE narrowing over time, and near-elimination of bursts for near critical r, consistent with a transition to sustained narrowband rhythm. Clinically, these measures enable stage inference, a bedside Move-Stop protocol for rapid readout, and actionable policies for adaptive DBS and medication titration that minimize transient burden without inducing rigid locking. The fixed parameterization and audit-ready outputs support reproducibility and multi-center deployment.

The deposition of amyloid-beta into senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are the main clinical parameters of AD. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and AD share a comparable pathophysiology. In detail, AMI survivors have a higher risk of vascular dementia and AD patients with AMI face a poor prognosis with a high rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. High blood levels of amyloid-beta 40 are identified in patients with high risk for cardiovascular death. However, the underlying mechanisms and the consequences of AMI in AD patients are unclear to date. Methods: AD transgenic APP23 mice were analysed in an experimental AMI using the closed-chest model. Results: APP23 mice displayed significantly decreased left ventricular function as detected by FS/MPI (fractional shortening/myocardial performance index) after 24 h and 3 weeks after ligation of the LAD compared to WT controls. No differences have been observed in infarct and scar size. However, the analysis of cardiac remodeling after 3 weeks showed an altered composition of the collagen tissue of the scar with elevated tight but reduced fine collagen in APP23 mice. Altered scar formation was accompanied by elevated degranulation of platelets following activation of the collagen receptor GPVI. Conclusion: The here presented results suggest that AD patients are at higher risk for cardiac damage after AMI that might increase the risk for cardiovascular death.

There is no approved drug treatment but selective activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors may be a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate ataxia symptoms. Methods: NLX-112, a highly selective 5-HT1A full agonist, was tested in the CMVMJD135 transgenic mouse model of SCA3. NLX-112 (1.25 and 5 mg/kg/day) was administered BID intraperitoneally for 14 weeks starting when the mice were 12 weeks of age, i.e., after ataxia signs had become established. The motor swimming test (MST), where mice are required to swim to a raised platform, was used to evaluate the motor behavior of SCA3 mice and their performance was compared with that of wild-type (WT) mice. Results: Both doses of NLX-112 were well tolerated by the SCA3 mice, as assessed by welfare parameters. In the MST, the latency of SCA3 mice to reach the platform was significantly longer than that of WT mice. However, when SCA3 mice were treated with either 1.25 or 5 mg/kg/day of NLX-112, they showed robust improvement of motor performance, with swimming latencies which were similar to those of WT mice. This effect of NLX-112 was maintained throughout the period of the study. Conclusions: The improved motor function of SCA3 mice when treated with NLX-112 supports its investigation as a drug candidate for the treatment of ataxia and related movement disorders.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Analyses of exon 4a structure reveal unique properties of Big tau", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.04.674244", "authors": "Fischer, I.; Baas, P. W.", "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that modulates the dynamic properties of microtubules and is involved in neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Tau is expressed as multiple low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms in most neurons of the central nervous system but only as a high molecular weight isoform in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and in a few types of central neurons. Big tau is defined by the inclusion of the alternatively spliced exon 4a, which adds about 250 amino acids to the domain of tau that projects away from the microtubule. Despite low sequence conservation of exon 4a, its length remains remarkably consistent across vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the charge distribution, hydrophobicity, and aggregation propensity of the human sequences of LMW tau, Big tau and the stretch of amino acids encoded by exon 4a. The exon 4a amino acids display a pronounced net negative charge (acidic/basic ratio = 1.30), a consistently hydrophilic composition (average Kyte-Doolittle score = -0.9259) and low {beta}-sheet content of 4.78%. This contrasts with LMW tau, which is more hydrophobic (-0.8930) and contains extended aggregation-prone motifs within the microtubule-binding domain including high {beta}-sheet content of 17.33%. The inclusion of exon 4a in Big tau shifts the global hydrophobicity to intermediate values (-0.9036) and reduces predicted {beta}-sheet content to 13.14%, suggesting decreased aggregation potential. Evolutionary analyses across mammals, birds, and amphibians (human, rat, zebra finch, frog) confirms the minimal sequence identity (16-24% identity in non-mammals) and conserved exon size but show preservation of net negative charge (acidic/basic ratio 1.3-2.3), indicating convergent retention of charge-based properties. Hydrophilicity was also broadly conserved, though less invariant across species. These results demonstrate that exon 4a introduces a highly acidic, hydrophilic module that counterbalances the aggregation-prone domains of LMW tau. The conservation of size and structural properties of the exon-4a-encoded stretch of amino acids, despite sequence divergence, implies strong evolutionary pressure to maintain biophysical properties that counteract pathogenic misfolding.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Using whole-organ clearing and 3D imaging, we mapped pancreatic sympathetic innervation, revealing specialized anatomical integration between sympathetic nerves and islets. Transplanted islets intrinsically attracted sympathetic nerves independent of their native environment. Chronic islet injury disrupted sympathetic innervation and impaired nerve regeneration after denervation. Sympathetic denervation markedly elevated islet-derived Reg2 and Reg3{beta}; administration of these proteins accelerated sympathetic regeneration and improved islet graft function.

In this study, we provide a comprehensive comparison of two widely used HIS models: the Hu-CD34+ model, which engrafts Hu-hematopoietic cells derived from Hu-CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and the Hu-PBMC model, which utilizes Hu-peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

To fully understand the effect of plastic contamination on soil ecosystems, it is necessary to advance techniques that can monitor nanoplastic microbe interactions under realistic conditions. In this work, we investigated the effects of nanoplastic contamination on a community of soil protists monitored through microfluidic soil chips, and analysed changes in their behavior via microscopy videos and a deep learning approach. The presented method employs a deep learning-based detection model combined with a transformer-based matching model for video frame interpolation, enabling accurate reconstruction of protist movement trajectories and velocities within soil chips. The results revealed reduced movement velocities for the groups of flagellates and ciliates under high nanoplastic conditions, a 24 to 30% reduction at a marginal significance level, while amoebae were unaffected. Our trajectory data provides novel insights into how protists navigate soil-like structures. By facilitating comprehensive assessments of protist environment interactions, it opens new avenues for understanding their ecological roles and the broader implications of hazardous contaminants in both soil and aquatic ecosystems at microbial community level without need for culture extraction.

Beyond well-characterized TADs and compartments, the diversity of heterochromatin domains remains poorly defined at the sequence level.

TADLs arise early in development, preceding elCIDs, and both become progressively compacted through H3K9 methylation, which promotes intra- and inter-domain proximity. Condensin mutations disrupt TADLs, yet single molecules can still form domain-like structures, as recapitulated by free polymer simulations.

While fat content and feeding rate remained stable across conditions, other life history traits demonstrated varying degrees of plasticity in response to environmental context. We observed that scaffold-grown worms exhibited reduced body size, altered reproductive strategies, and mild enhancements in stress resistance, burrowing ability, swimming kinematics and exploratory behavior. RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional profiles between scaffold-grown and agar-grown worms, with most changes arising within one generation.

Each plant carries in-canopy microclimate sensors (temperature, relative humidity, illuminance) paired with nearby ambient references, yielding real-time canopy-ambient differentials. The system is easy to install: at planting or sowing, sensors are fixed at positions that will lie within the developing canopy, and a separate ambient reference area is designated and kept free of vegetation. As plants grow, they envelop the sensors, thereby capturing growth dynamics over time. The sensors accuracy was validated against a commercial weather station and portable system that measures gas exchange, temperature and light (LI-COR 6800/6400), and the system's ability to resolve plant physiological activity was confirmed using the PlantArray functional phenotyping platform with independent whole-plant transpiration and biomass references. Under controlled growth-room conditions and across two contrasting Cannabis cultivars, daily transpiration strongly predicted biomass gain (R2 > 0.9). Microclimate signals mirrored physiology: midday canopy air was cooler by 4-7{degrees}C, more humid by 18-25 %RH, and increasingly shaded as biomass accumulated, with temperature, RH, and light attenuation showing saturating logarithmic relationships with growth. The network operated for months unattended with low packet loss and predictable power use. It provides 4D (x-y-z-time) coverage, where x and y denote horizontal location, z the vertical position within the canopy, and time the dynamics, enabling resolution of where changes occur and how they evolve, and supplying high-frequency labeled data. This system complements, rather than replaces, precision instruments and high-end phenotyping platforms, providing a scalable layer for continuous tracking across wide areas.

We introduce Cartesian Projections of Asymmetric Distances (CAPASYDIS), a novel approach designed to map and visualize the 'terra cognita' - the already explored regions - of a given sequence space. CAPASYDIS uniquely calculates asymmetric sequence distances, which account for the directional nature of sequence information, and then associates each distinct sequence to a unique location in a low-dimensional projection space, called a \"seqverse\". The approach is by design computationally scalable, and allows a standardized exploration of the seqverses of massive datasets, comprising hundreds to millions of potentially very long sequences. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the seqverses of rRNA sequences from the three domains of life. We show that the seqverses of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota are not only spatially distinct, but also differ in shapes, sizes and patterns of variation around their centroids. asymdist values retain most of the taxonomic signal present in the sequences, when analyzed at different taxonomic levels from the domain to the single base difference levels.

SwissADME was used for ADMET profiling in order to assess drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Both receptors' QSAR models showed strong predictive power (CNR1: r2 = 0.854; CNR2: r2 = 0.798). {gamma}-Eudesmol and Bisabolol were the top hits for CNR1 and CNR2, respectively, according to pharmacophore screening.

Here we established a dataset encompassing over 300 absolute quantitative proteomes, the largest to date, across two yeast species under diverse experimental conditions. Leveraging big data analysis, formula fitting, and machine learning models, quantitative correlations among protein abundance, organelle-level resource distribution, and cellular phenotypes were elucidated at a system level. We found that protein resources always exhibit robust and precise distribution at the organelle level across distinct conditions. Specifically, at high specific growth rates, the protein mass fraction from some main organelles, i.e., peroxisome and nucleus, is consistently reduced to offset the increasing protein resource demand from the ribosome. Meanwhile, we found that the nutrition limitation could induce resource recycling by upregulating protein resources within the vacuole and lipid droplets to sustain stress adaptation. Importantly, our integrative analysis demonstrates that protein mass fraction from less than 4 organelles (e.g., nucleus and ribosomes) can accurately predict diverse yeast physiological parameters (e.g., specific growth rate, oxygen uptake rate), and a core set of 37 proteins could predict resource allocation among 24 main organelles and sub-organelles with high accuracy (average R^2 > 0.9). Finally, we found organelle resource allocation reflects the divergence of yeast species. For example, anaerobic conditions and respiratory suppression have less influence on Crabtree-positive yeast, i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with respect to organelle resource allocation but have a larger effect on the Crabtree-negative yeast Issatchenkia orientalis, thus suggesting that cellular resources have facilitated adaptive evolution. In summary, the high-quality, genome-scale quantitative proteomic dataset for yeast species offers an unprecedented opportunity for understanding the basic principles underlying resource allocation at the organelle level, laying theoretical foundations for precision engineering of cell factories in synthetic biology.

Beyond its role in perception, MSI may also reflect changes in brain state as task difficulty evolves. In this pilot study, we aimed to explore whether behavioral metrics, particularly reaction time (RT), can capture these brain state changes during a Simultaneity Judgment (SJ) task. Understanding this relationship is critical for developing adaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that rely on real-time cognitive and perceptual feedback. Approach: To assess how temporal alignment influences both perception and underlying brain state, we employed a Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) SJ task using audiovisual stimuli. After estimating individual simultaneity thresholds, we implemented an adaptive task that gradually increased difficulty by manipulating the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) closer to the TBW. We hypothesized that as perceptual uncertainty increased, RTs would reflect evolving cognitive states, serving as an observable indicator of underlying neural activity shifts. Materials and Methods: Two participants were tested with consistent auditory (500 Hz tone) and visual (faded white circle) stimuli. The TE phase used a staircase procedure to determine personalized TBWs. In the subsequent adaptive test phase, SOAs were progressively modulated around these thresholds to induce varying levels of perceptual ambiguity. Behavioral responses were analyzed using psychometric curve fitting, confusion matrices, and detailed RT evolution across trials. Results and Discussion: Participant 1 showed clear RT modulation near the TBW, suggesting heightened cognitive load and decision uncertainty - a potential signature of brain state transitions. In contrast, Participant 2 exhibited less sensitivity, possibly due to suboptimal thresholding. These preliminary findings suggest that RT holds promise as a behavioral correlate of perceptual state; however, further refinement and standardization of the task are needed before it can be reliably scaled to larger and more controlled studies of MSI-linked brain dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

We have unravelled a molecular pathway that links a mechanical cue through Src and FAK kinases to promote the trafficking of secretory proteins out of the Golgi apparatus and prevent their post-Golgi lysosomal degradation. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed the Golgi-specific Brefeldin A resistance factor 1 (GBF1) as a key downstream mechano-responsive regulator, whose phosphorylation state orchestrates post-Golgi cargo sorting, directing proteins either toward secretion or to lysosomes.

Although TNF has pro-inflammatory effects, depletion of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) paradoxically exacerbates chronic colitis. Because colitis induces remodeling of mesenchymal cell populations, which provide a niche for epithelial stem cells involved in mucosal healing, we hypothesized that TNFR1 promotes colonic mesenchymal cell diversity and stem cell niche function. METHODS: Mesenchymal TNFR1 function was studied using TNFR1-/-, platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR)-Cre;TNFR1fl/fl mice, and mixed-genotype mesenchymal-epithelial co-cultures. Mesenchymal cell diversity and gene function were assessed using single-cell RNA-Seq of primary colonic myofibroblasts (CMFs) and via anti-integrin A6 (ITGA6) antibody treatment and exogenous R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) supplementation. RESULTS: TNFR1-/- mesenchyme exhibits reduced cell diversity, with specific depletion of specialized TNF- and interferon-signaling pericryptal cell-type. Deletion of TNFR1 in the pericryptal mesenchyme diminished the (PDGFR)+ CMF population and reduced RSPO3 expression, but increased ITGA6 expression relative to controls (TNFR1+/-). Moreover, inhibition of ITGA6 reversed the proliferative and migratory phenotype of TNFR1-/- CMFs and restored expression of PDGFR and RSPO3. Co-cultures of colonoids with TNFR1-/- CMFs resulted in downregulation of stem cell marker expression; this was rescued by supplementation with RSPO3. Supporting the role for mesenchymal TNFR1 in regulating colonic epithelial stem cells, mice deficient for TNFR1 in PDGFR+ cells showed a 40% loss of Lgr5+ stem cells, consistent with the global TNFR1-deficient mouse. CONCLUSION: TNFR1-mediated signaling regulates specification and function of colonic mesenchyme, performing an integral role in the maintenance of the crypt stem cell population.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

While bone has an innate self-healing capacity, this process can be disrupted in cases of large or complex defects, where regeneration fails, and clinical intervention is required. This study aimed at the development of a tissue engineering approach using human periosteum-derived cell (hPDC) spheroids encapsulated or bioprinted at high density within hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) hydrogels to support hypertrophic cartilage formation as a template for endochondral bone regeneration. We first compared different encapsulation time points (days 1, 7, and 14), finding that early encapsulation (day 1) enhanced spheroid fusion, increased DNA content, and promoted hypertrophic cartilage formation, as indicated by greater glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen deposition along with lacunae formation. Next, HAMA-encapsulated spheroids were compared to spheroids formed using a standardized microwell platform, demonstrating that encapsulation promoted a more mature cartilage-like matrix with thicker collagen fibers and enhanced hypertrophic differentiation. Gene expression and immunostaining confirmed progression toward hypertrophic and osteogenic phenotypes. Finally, extrusion-based bioprinting of HAMA bioinks comprising a high-density of hPDC spheroids demonstrated scalability, improved spheroid alignment, and maintained robust cell viability and hypertrophic differentiation.

G.", "abstract": "Proper neuronal development and function rely on the polarized sorting of transmembrane proteins (TMPs) to their distinct somatodendritic or axonal domains. Most TMPs follow a conventional secretory pathway confined to the cell soma, where they are translated at the rough ER, exit through ER exit sites (ERES) to reach the Golgi apparatus (GA), prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). Intriguingly, we recently found that many mRNAs encoding TMPs are associated with the axonally-enriched ER-protein P180, which facilitates axonal ER-ribosome interaction and regulates local translation. Given the absence of the GA in the axon, it remains unknown how locally synthesized TMPs leave the ER and reach the axonal PM. Here, we visualized the translation of different axonal TMPs within the axon and followed their trafficking from the ER. We found that a fraction of neosynthesized cargos follow an unconventional route, exiting the axonal ER and reaching the PM independent of the GA. Notably, we identified axonal ERES components tightly associated with the axonal ER. Removal of these components prevents TMP exit from the axonal ER, while addition of external cues increases the number of axonal ERES and Golgi-bypassing cargos. Moreover, we identified the ER-translation regulator HDLBP and the NRZ-SEC22B vesicular tether complex associated with axonal ERES and involved in unconventional secretion. Local removal of axonal ERES components or depletion of these identified players causes defects in axon growth and bouton assembly. We propose a novel mechanism coupling local TMP translation and secretion to the PM at the axonal ER, which is essential for neuronal development.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that cilia are required for KV development and may exist in distinct structural subtypes. Using a newly engineered transgenic line (sox17:Cry2-GFP), we optogenetically disrupted the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 in KV progenitors via blue light-induced clustering of CIB1-RFP-IFT88. This perturbation impaired ciliogenesis and disrupted lumen formation, supporting a critical role for cilia in KV morphogenesis. To assess ciliary architecture, we used volume electron microscopy (vEM) to generate a high-resolution 3D ultrastructural map of mature KVs. Only 70.1% of cilia retained both mother and daughter centrioles, suggesting centriole elimination may occur in this tissue. Among centrioles present, 33.9% had distal appendages, 91.8% had subdistal appendages, and only 5.08% exhibited rootlet fibers. Cilia were also associated with membrane-bound vesicles, including spatially biased ciliary-associated vesicles (CaVs) and dense vesicles (CaDVs).

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

VDisk achieved up to 84.3% EV recovery, surpassing SEC (60.0%), with excellent reproducibility (CV<5%) and consistent performance under both fasting and postprandial sampling conditions. VDisk offers application-specific flexibility: For applications requiring high EV concentrations, processing up to 1 mL of plasma yields a two to three times higher EV concentration compared to SEC.

Normally, the innate immune system mounts a robust response to infectious stimuli. However, unintentional activation by host-derived factors, such as aggregated proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders or by cytoplasmic genomic or mitochondrial DNA, can elicit aberrant immune responses. One such immune response is represented by the cytosolic GMP-AMP synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. Using redox chemical biology and mass spectrometry approaches, we identified S-nitrosylation of STING cysteine 148 as a novel posttranslational redox modification underlying aberrant type 1 interferon signaling in Alzheimers disease (AD). Critically, we observed S-nitrosylated STING (SNOSTING) in postmortem human AD brains, in hiPSC-derived microglia (hiMG) exposed to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})/-synuclein (Syn) aggregates, and in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Mechanistically, our findings reveal that STING S-nitrosylation is critical in initiating signaling cascades by promoting the formation of disulfide-bonded STING oligomers. This leads to neuroinflammation early in the course of disease in vivo in 5xFAD mice with consequent synaptic loss. Collectively, our research supports the role of SNO-STING in neuroinflammation associated with AD, and points to a novel druggable cysteine residue in STING to prevent this S nitrosylation reaction with its inherent inflammatory response.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

In cells, vitamin K functions as a co-factor for the {gamma}-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of glutamic acid residues (Glu) into {gamma}-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in secreted proteins. We aim here at determining the role of {gamma}-carboxylation in bone remodeling and at identifying the Gla protein(s) involved. We show that mice lacking {gamma}-carboxylation specifically in osteoblasts (Ggcxflox/floxd;OCN-Cre) have increased bone mass at 6 months of age due to a reduced number of multinucleated bone resorbing osteoclasts. In co-culture experiments, Ggcx-deficient osteoblasts were less effective than control osteoblasts at supporting the generation of osteoclasts. Among all known Gla proteins, we identify GAS6 as an osteoblast-secreted {gamma}-carboxylated factor which signals to differentiating osteoclasts. The GAS6 receptors MerTK and AXL are expressed in pre-osteoclasts and pharmacological inhibitors of AXL and MerTK block osteoclast generation in co-culture. Conversely, recombinant {gamma}-carboxylated GAS6 dose-dependently increases the size of osteoclasts and the number of nuclei per osteoclast in culture. GAS6 marginally affected the induction of osteoclast-specific genes during osteoclast differentiation but significantly increased pre-osteoclast fusion. Finally, increasing bone marrow GAS6 level in transgenic mice was sufficient to increase the number and size of osteoclasts and to decrease bone mass.

In cancer, it functions as a double-edged sword, either as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor promoter. Elevated GFP-LC3 puncta and increased levels of autophagy-related proteins, commonly interpreted as markers of high autophagic activity, are often associated with poor prognosis in tumors. However, current assessments of autophagy largely rely on isolated cellular and protein-level observations. While transcriptomic approaches offer broader insights, they often utilize large gene signatures without adequately accounting for the dynamic nature of autophagic flux. In this study, we propose a functional gene set signature for autophagy based on the rational mapping of flux stages, enabling the inference of distinct autophagy states. Using a supervised machine learning approach, we developed two indices - AutoIndex and LysoIndex - that effectively distinguish between cells treated with autophagy inducers and inhibitors. Applying this framework, we analyzed autophagy states across four cancer types, comparing tumor samples to matched normal tissues and evaluating their association with patient survival. Among these, glioblastoma (GBM) exhibited the strongest correlation between inferred autophagy states and clinical outcomes. GBM samples characterized by high LysoIndex and low AutoIndex - corresponding to a transcriptomic induction state - were linked to significantly poorer survival. Compared to lower-grade gliomas, GBM showed elevated lysosomal activity, which may contribute to its more aggressive behavior. Additionally, GBM cell lines treated with temozolomide displayed signatures consistent with autophagy induction, supporting our model's predictive relevance. These results reinforce the understanding and monitoring of autophagy, and suggest that, in the case of GBM, its negative influence may represent a potential target for novel therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

While high-throughput technologies have greatly enhanced our ability to study perturbation effects at the molecular level, accurately modeling these responses remains challenging due to the complex underlying molecular interactions, the vast dimensionality of cellular response, the limited amount of data, and technical limitations in data collection. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these challenges. However, the observation in recent benchmarks that complex models do not consistently outperform simpler ones highlights the need for robust and efficient baselines for evaluating new methods. We present ScAPE (Single Cell Analysis of Perturbational Effects), an ML method for predicting drug-induced gene expression changes. ScAPE leverages only aggregated gene-level statistics across cell types and perturbations as input features, yet achieves good performance despite this simplicity. Its effectiveness was demonstrated in the Single-cell Perturbation Prediction NeurIPS 2023 challenge, where it ranked among the top-performing methods. We describe the core model and introduce extensions that enhance its utility as a baseline, including a multitask learning extension for simultaneous prediction of multiple transcriptional response metrics. A software API is provided to support adoption and integration into research pipelines. Benchmarking against other leading challenge entries and general-purpose ML approaches, using the original challenge metric, supports ScAPE as a simple, lightweight baseline for evaluating methods that predict perturbation effects at the gene-expression level.

The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worsens the situation as evidenced by the finding that the neurons of the AD brain have elevated levels of DNA damage. AD is also associated with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) known for its proteolytic peptide fragment, A{beta}. In the current work we find that these three elements - age, DNA damage, and APP - are associated with each other and present evidence in the mouse brain supporting the hypothesis that DNA damage is the likely cause of the increased APP levels. Using the TUNEL reaction to track DNA damage, we show that the TUNEL staining increases significantly with age (6 months to 24 months). Next, we used immunostaining of intracellular APP to show that it too increases over this same time period. To separate correlation from causality we repeated these analyses using tissue from mice genetically deficient in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, an enzyme associated with part of the DNA damage repair mechanism. TUNEL signal in neurons of 6-month Atm-/- animals was equivalent to that seen in 24-month wild type. Significantly, the APP signal in the Atm-/- cells increased in consort and the relationship between DNA damage and APP was found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity associated with aging is a cellular stressor that increases the levels of APP and thus increases vulnerability to the pathogenesis of AD.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

MiR-34a KO improved long-term memory in Tg-SwDI mice, which was associated with decreases in the ratio of insoluble A{beta}42 to A{beta}40 and with increases in soluble and insoluble A{beta}40 in the cerebral cortex.

Differentially spliced genes were significantly more enriched for those causally-implicated in both PD and ALS than genes that were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between these splicing alterations and dysfunction of the RNA-binding protein (RBP), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Strikingly, genes and exon junctions affected by TDP-43 knockdown overlapped significantly with those dysregulated across brain regions in PD. In brains from individuals with the LRRK2 c.6055G>A (p.G2019S) mutation, the most common genetic cause of PD, we also observed significant enrichment of TDP-43-dependent splicing changes. This finding was corroborated in human pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a LRRK2 p.G2019S knock-in mouse model, where reduced nuclear TDP-43 levels evidenced the well-recognised loss-of-function mechanism contributing to splicing dysregulation. By leveraging our RNA-based analyses we predicted TDP-43-dependent novel peptide sequences and validated their existence within human LRRK2 mutation mDNs, while also demonstrating an overall loss of protein and mRNA expression in mis-spliced genes.

DDIAS directly interacts with TOPBP1 and the disruption of this interaction or inactivation of its single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding ability impairs genome integrity and causes synthetic lethality with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency. DDIAS does not promote the putative end-tethering function of CIP2A-TOPBP1 but rather acts to suppress ssDNA during mitosis. This role is emphasized by a pronounced genetic interaction between the genes coding for DDIAS and DNA polymerase zeta;.

While lysosomes are known to possess RNase activity, the role of lysosomal RNA degradation in post-transcriptional gene regulation is not well understood. Here, we define RNASET2, PLD3, and both endogenous and exogenous RNase A family members as lysosomal RNases. Cells lacking these RNases accumulated large amounts of lysosomal RNA. Although all types of RNA can be found within lysosomes, SRP RNAs, Y RNAs, 5' TOP mRNAs, long-lived mRNAs, and mRNAs encoding membrane and secreted proteins were specifically enriched. All types of RNA depend on autophagy for lysosomal targeting, but the lysosomally-enriched RNAs are more sensitive to loss of autophagy, implying that selective mechanisms mediate their lysosomal entry. RNA stability measurements revealed that lysosomally-degraded transcripts also had autophagy-dependent changes in stability. In exploring how specific RNAs are targeted for lysosomal degradation, we found that the Alu domain of SRP RNAs is sufficient for targeting these RNAs to lysosomes in fashion that depends on its interactions with the SRP9 and SRP14 proteins. For mRNAs, 5' TOP motifs are sufficient to increase their targeting to lysosomes for degradation in a LARP1-dependent manner.

Both the nature of interactions, spanning antagonistic to cooperative, and the strength of interactions vary between and across microbial species and strains. These local interactions can influence the emergence and maintenance of microbial diversity. However, it remains challenging to link features of local interactions with spatially mediated coexistence dynamics given the significant variation in the microscopic mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell feedback. Here, we explore how microbial interactions over a broad range of ecological contexts spanning antagonism to cooperation can enable coexistence as spatially explicit domains emerge. To do so, we introduce and analyze a family of stochastic coordination games, where individuals do better when playing (i.e., interacting) with individuals of the same type than when playing with individuals of a different type. Using this game-theoretic framework, we show that the population dynamics for coordination games is governed by a double-well shaped interaction potential. We find that in a spatial setting this double-well potential induces phase separation, facilitating coexistence. Moreover, we show that for microbes engaged in symmetric coordination games, phase separation takes on a universal scaling that follows `Model A' coarsening, consistent with prior experimental observations for Vibrio cholerae mutual killers. Finally, we derive a PDE equivalent of the spatial stochastic game, confirming both the double-well nature of spatial coordination games and the universality of phase separation.

While non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, including CBZ, have been shown to stimulate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) under laboratory conditions, their effects in complex microbial communities remain poorly understood. Here, we applied an experimental evolution framework to wastewater microbiomes exposed to a gradient of environmentally relevant CBZ concentrations (0-50 g/mL) for three days. CBZ reduced growth of the community in a concentration-dependent manner. Still, community composition was largely unaffected by CBZ exposure. However, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG)- and mobile genetic element (MGE)-specific responses emerged. Among the tested 26 ARGs, four clinically relevant ones (blaCMY, blaOXA-48, blaCTX-M, dfrA1) increased in relative abundance in a dose-dependent manner, correlating with proliferation of IncP and IncW plasmids and the transposon IS26, pointing to enhanced HGT as the underlying mechanism. In contrast, only ermF abundance rose independently of MGEs, suggesting direct selection. Other ARGs and MGEs, including integron integrase intI1 and IncQ plasmids, showed no consistent CBZ response. Effects were strongest at subinhibitory concentrations (0.05-5 g/mL), matching upper levels detected in surface waters. These findings demonstrate that CBZ can selectively promote AMR dissemination through both HGT and direct selection, but in a targeted rather than community-wide manner.

All these reported anti-HIV mechanisms involve SERINC5 incorporation into progeny virions, while there is very little information regarding a potential antiviral activity of SERINC5 in target cells. Here, we show that SERINC5 expressed in target cells efficiently inhibits fusion with cells expressing sensitive but not resistant HIV-1 strains. We show that this activity does not result from downregulation of CD4 or coreceptors on target cells or interference with the formation of ternary Env/CD4/coreceptor complexes. We further demonstrate that SERINC5 destabilizes small fusion pores causing their collapse and that this block can be rescued by incorporation of phosphatidylserine to either effector (Env-expressing) or target cells. Interestingly, we did not detect a significant reduction of HIV-1 pseudovirus fusion with SERINC5 expressing target cells, while virus-mediated cell-cell fusion (fusion-from-without) was inhibited, suggesting a potential role of virus entry pathway in SERINC5 restriction.

Genes encoding secretion system components often co-occur together as gene clusters in bacterial (meta)genomes. However, existing tools for secretion system annotation are unable to utilize genomic context to make predictions and are unable to detect secretion systems of novel architecture. Here, we present Sismis (secretion system discovery tool; https://github.com/lmc297/Sismis), a scalable, interpretable, machine learning-based tool, which detects and classifies single-locus secretion systems in bacterial (meta)genomes with high accuracy (test set area-under-the-curve [AUC] values of 0.71 and 0.92 for precision-recall [PR] and receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves, respectively). When applied to {approx}700k prokaryotic (meta)genomes, Sismis identifies 747,439 total secretion systems comprising 15,612 major secretion system families, >80% of which contain no previously known/annotated secretion systems. To facilitate further exploration of these data, we present the Sismis Atlas (https://sismis.microbe.dev/), an interactive secretion system database, which we use to identify a largely uncharacterized cluster of secretion systems with tight adherence (Tad) pili-like characteristics. Altogether, Sismis and its companion atlas enable accurate and interpretable secretion system annotation, exploration, and discovery at an unprecedented scale.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we developed an innovative biofabrication platform that systematically integrates patient-derived three-dimensional (3D) cultures with comprehensive growth factor profiling across 128 combinations. Through systematic screening of 23 ovarian cancer patient samples and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two estradiol-responsive cellular populations that coordinate immunosuppression: a malignant cell fraction (MAL.PDCD5) and a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) fraction (FB.TNFSF10). MAL.PDCD5 cells suppress immune infiltration by downregulating antigen presentation, while FB.TNFSF10 cells promote immunosuppression through enhanced TGF-{beta} signaling. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed striking mutual exclusivity between FB.TNFSF10 cells and T/NK cells, providing evidence of active immune cell exclusion. Most significantly, FB.TNFSF10 abundance emerged as a robust predictor of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy resistance across multiple cancer cohorts, independent of conventional biomarkers.

People who experienced childhood poverty are at greater risk for developing hypertension during adulthood, with sex differences. To determine the possible mechanisms of these sex differences, we investigated the alterations in blood pressure (BP), autonomic activity, and inflammation in the brain and kidneys of rats exposed to an impoverished environment during the early postnatal period, by using the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model. Methods: The LBN model mimics childhood poverty by creating a low resource environment on postnatal days 2-9. After weaning, offspring were separated by sex and LBN exposure and were evaluated at 16-18 weeks of age (Adulthood). Results: LBN males displayed an increase in BP compared to the control (CON), whereas LBN females showed no changes. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) was increased in LBN males and females compared to the CON, while only parasympathetic nerve activity (PNA) was increased in LBN vs. CON females. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and TNF-, were decreased in the brains of LBN vs. CON males, with no alterations in females. Conclusion: Adult LBN males have elevated BP, due to increased SNA, while LBN females may be protected from increased BP due to a simultaneous increase in SNA and PNA. The reduction in IL-17 and TNF- in LBN males may serve as a compensatory mechanism to lower BP. This study provides insights into sex differences in BP for adults who experienced childhood poverty.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation is an early manifestation of cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the impact of HFD(high-fat diet)-induced obesity on endothelium-dependent relaxation function and explored the potential role of MLCK(myosin light chain kinase) signaling. Approach and Results: Forty-five New Zealand White rabbits were randomized into three groups: a control group (normal diet), HFD(high-fat diet) group, and an ML-7 group (HFD plus the MLCK inhibitor ML-7). After 8 weeks of feeding, vascular endothelial function was assessed in vivo by measuring FMD(flow-mediated dilation). Serum lipids and blood glucose levels were determined. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was evaluated ex vivo using aortic ring assays. The protein expression levels of MLCK and eNOS(endothelial nitric oxide synthase), as well as the phosphorylation level of MLC(myosin light chain), in rabbit arteries were analyzed by Western blot. HFD-fed rabbits developed obesity, dyslipidemia (elevated TC[total cholesterol], LDL-C[low-density lipoprotein cholesterol], and ox-LDL[oxidized low-density lipoprotein]), perirenal adipose tissue deposition, and significant endothelial dysfunction, evidenced by impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation function and morphological endothelial damage. Western blot analysis revealed upregulated MLCK and eNOS expression, along with increased phosphorylation of MLC in the arterial walls of obese rabbits, despite no significant change in NO(nitric oxide) levels compared to controls. Treatment with ML-7 ameliorated endothelium-dependent relaxation function impairment. Furthermore, the inherent limitations of FMD as a non-invasive technique in terms of accuracy and sensitivity for evaluating endothelium-dependent dilation. Conclusion: Obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction arise from visceral fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and MLCK overexpression.

To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modelling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of regular spiking neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

To address this issue, we developed a new six-degree-of-freedom platform that can rapidly and precisely impart ground motion to head-fixed mice. Using the Diesel2p large field-of-view two-photon mesoscope, we performed calcium imaging to simultaneously capture activity dynamics across broad cortical areas from the frontal to the parietal cortex while driving the platform through various motion patterns. We found a core area for the ground-tilt information at the parietal cortex, although the tilt-direction neurons were found across the dorsal cortex. Neuronal populations preserved tilt-direction information within a common low-dimensional manifold across three distinct motion conditions, indicating a condition-invariant tilt-code. Furthermore, to investigate shared dynamics across multiple cortical areas, we introduced broadcast-subspace analysis as an extension of communication subspace analysis. This extended framework revealed that tilt information occupied the second principal shared axis, following movement information. These results reveal the core cortical area for processing tilt information, its universal format, and its sharing across the dorsal cortex, thereby providing a framework for cortical information processing that integrates movement, posture, and the environment.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

At baseline (ages 9-10), Black, Hispanic, and Asian youth were significantly more likely than White youth to be excluded due to excessive head motion; these disparities were not observed at the two-year follow-up (ages 11-13). In contrast, disparities in retention persisted; Black participants were less likely to return for follow-up, even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and motion.

Natural compounds with pleiotropic actions have emerged as potential adjunctive interventions. This study evaluated G1899, a standardized American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) extract, for its effects on neuroinflammation, A{beta} clearance, and cognitive function. Methods: Neuronal cultures were exposed to glutamate or A{beta} oligomers (A{beta}o) and pre-treated with G1899 to assess cell viability and excitotoxicity. Primary murine microglia were analyzed for validating expression levels of TMEM119, CD68, NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1{beta}, Caspase-1, and STAT3 phosphorylation. Behavioral testing was performed in scopolamine-injected mice with short term G1899 treatment and in 5xFAD transgenic mice following long-term G1899 administration at multiple doses. Amyloid burden, microglial recruitment, and plaque morphology were quantified by immunohistochemistry and high-resolution imaging. Human induced microglia (iMG) were examined for neuroinflammatory responses following A{beta}o exposure with or without G1899 treatment. Results: G1899 significantly improved neuronal viability and reduced glutamate- and A{beta}o-induced toxicity. In microglia, G1899 upregulated TMEM119 and CD68, while suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome formation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and STAT3 phosphorylation. G1899 rescued scopolamine-induced memory deficits and, in 5xFAD mice, reduced hippocampal and cortical A{beta} burden, alleviated neuroinflammatory markers, and improved both spatial/fear learning and memory, with the most consistent efficacy observed at 300 mg/kg. Imaging revealed enhanced microglial recruitment to plaques and facilitated fragmentation of A{beta} deposits. In iMG, G1899 elevated homeostatic and phagocytic markers while attenuating A{beta}o-induced NLRP3/STAT3-mediated neuroinflammatory signaling pathway. Conclusions: G1899 confers multimodal neuroprotection by preserving neuronal survival, modulating microglial activity, and facilitating A{beta} clearance.

For BA, we compared the performance of three PAH-degrading consortia with increasing diversity: SC AMBk, SC1, SC4. For BA-SEB, we coupled inoculation with these consortia with the addition of Triton X-100 surfactant, at sub-critical micelle concentration dose. In the BA microcosms, inoculation did not result in significant degradation of the determined PAH after 58 days of incubation. Among the BA-SEB microcosms, SC4 inoculated ones and the non-inoculated control showed significant degradation of fluoranthene, chrysene, and pyrene during the incubation period. Notably, BA-SEB microcosms inoculated with SC4 achieved superior pyrene degradation compared to the others. Both inoculation and the addition of surfactant impacted the community assembly, with the surfactant exerting the major effects. The surfactant addition stimulated several genera related to the degradation of PAH (Novosphingobium, Blastomonas). In addition, co-occurrence network analysis revealed that in SC4 inoculated microcosms most of these genera were positively correlated with the inoculated genera, particularly with Paraburkholdeira genus.

The arenaviral nucleoprotein (NP) contains an exoribonuclease (exoN) domain that suppresses type I interferon (IFN-I) production by degrading pathogen-associated molecular-pattern (PAMP) RNAs. The biological roles of NP exoN during viral infection have not been well characterized for highly pathogenic arenaviruses, largely due to biosafety constraints and challenges in generating viable NP exoN mutants. We previously developed a recombinant tri-segmented viral vector (rP18tri) based on non-pathogenic Pichinde virus (PICV), which allows functional studies of transgenes during arenavirus infection in a BSL-2 setting. In this study, we introduced point mutations at individual catalytic residues to abolish PICV NP exoN activity and generated exoN-deficient rP18tri(NPm) reporter viruses. These mutants failed to replicate in IFN-competent A549 cells, accompanied by strong IFN-I induction. Expression of wild-type (WT) JUNV NP, but not its exoN-deficient mutant, in the rP18tri(NPm)-G backbone restored single-cycle infectivity and suppressed IFN-I induction. Furthermore, exoN-deficient viruses produced disproportionately high levels of defective virion particles relative to virion RNA from infected A549 cells, a defect that was rescued by expression of WT JUNV NP but not the exoN-deficient NP as a transgene. Together, these data demonstrate an essential role of NP exoN in IFN-I suppression and identify a novel biological function of NP exoN in promoting the production of infectious virion particles in IFN-competent cells.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

This study analysed biocrusts from three different altitudes in Svalbard (High Arctic) in 2022-2024. Methods and Results: Monitoring of microclimatic parameters, including irradiance, humidity, air, and soil temperature revealed unexpected extremes at the lowest elevation site. Molecular methods were used to determine the diversity of microalgae, revealing the presence of Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae as the dominant eukaryotic algal groups. Among the cyanobacteria, the dominant taxonomical groups were Nostocales, Pseudanabaenales, and Oscillatoriales. Measured photosynthetic activity was largely driven by irradiance across the different seasons and locations. Higher maximum quantum yield (FV/FM) values (approximately 0.6) were measured at lower irradiance levels (<100 mol m-2 s-1). Photosynthetic activity was observed in early October 2022, and diurnal changes were even noticeable at subzero temperatures in late October 2023, with the low irradiance curve being mirrored by the development of FV/FM. Furthermore, thawed biocrusts in winter exhibited the ability to rapidly restore photosynthetic activity, which was also supported by the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that the differential gene expression observed for the D1, RbcS, Ohp1, and ELIP proteins suggests that light stress induced photoinhibition plays a major role in biocrusts, particularly in winter.

While non-Bifidobacterial community composition significantly correlated with Bifidobacterial detection in 74% of analyzed cohorts, the associations for the individual species showed distinct age-/lifestyle-/disease-specific patterns (greater similarity within similar cohorts).

Our study reveals that decreased abundance of Lactobacillus species correlates with ulcerative colitis severity in patients. Among tested strains, L. plantarum A736, isolated from traditional fermented foods, demonstrated remarkable efficacy in ameliorating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. Strikingly, multi-omics analysis revealed that L. plantarum A736 uniquely enhances choline acetyltransferase-expressing (ChAT+) neurons in the enteric nervous system and elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Further analysis identified that L. plantarum A736 metabolizes tryptophan to produce indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), and supplementation with ILA significantly mimics anti-inflammatory effects of this strain by activating ChAT+ neurons. Crucially, selective ablation of colonic ChAT+ neurons completely abolished the therapeutic benefits of both L. plantarum A736 and ILA, establishing their essential role in mediating these effects. These findings demonstrate for the first time that microbial metabolites can directly modulate enteric neuronal circuits to regulate gut immunity. The identified ILA-ChAT+ neuron axis represents a novel neuro-immune pathway that could be targeted for IBD treatment.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

A.; Grover, S.; Connallon, T.; Uesugi, A.", "abstract": "Natural selection can cause evolution to be predictable despite the randomness of processes that generate genetic variation. However, the predictability of evolution can be difficult to evaluate, owing to the complexity of environmental conditions that determine selection in each species, and our inability to rewind and replay the tape of life to directly assess evolution's repeatability. Invasive species are valuable systems for evaluating evolutionary predictability, as populations in native and introduced ranges evolve separately, yet often encounter similar environmental challenges, providing potential for parallel patterns of local adaptation between ranges. However, it remains unclear how pervasive such parallelism is, or how rapidly it evolves following species' introductions. To address these questions, we carried out a meta-analysis of clinal divergence in native and introduced populations of the same plant species and evaluated the tempo of evolutionary parallelism of clines between ranges. We show that clinal divergence in introduced ranges was shallower than clinal divergence in native ranges for size, morpho-physiology, and phenology traits, but similar for reproductive and defense traits. Evolutionary parallelism of clinal divergence increased with the age of the species' introduction, with greater parallelism in relatively old introductions caused by increased alignment of the direction of clinal divergence between the ranges rather than changes in the relative magnitudes of divergence in each range. These results suggest a high predictability of local adaptation in mature species' introductions, with drift, genetic constraints and founder effects likely contributing to evolutionary lags in local adaptation within young introductions.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

K.; Landry, C. R.", "abstract": "Mutations within promoters and coding sequences are both involved in adaptation, but their relative contributions remain to be compared directly. Using the fungal enzyme cytosine deaminase, we examine if adaptation to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), which requires reduced cytosine deamination, can be reached by single promoter mutations. We generated all single-nucleotide substitutions and indels in the yeast FCY1 promoter and assayed the resulting mutants in presence of 5-FC. This revealed that no promoter mutation is sufficient for adaptation to occur. In contrast, 29% of single-nucleotide substitutions in the FCY1 gene have previously been reported as conferring adaptation to 5-FC. We hypothesized that this discrepancy could arise if FCY1 expression was robust to promoter mutations or if fitness was insensitive to expression level changes. Combining large-scale expression measurements with the experimental characterization of the corresponding expression-fitness function, we found that, while 24% of promoter mutations significantly affect expression, the shape of this function prevents them from being adaptive. Because this relationship is step-like, the curve is flat around wild-type level and adaptation can only emerge from a severe reduction of expression. These results highlight how adaptive phenotypes may be more mutationally accessible in coding sequences than promoters, especially when large effects are beneficial.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Hemoglobin switching is controlled by transcription factors, miRNAs, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that enforce gene regulatory changes through development. Here we examine the role of the heterochronically silenced N-6 methyladenosine (m6A) RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 that was previously described to regulate HBG1/2 indirectly by suppressing BCL11A expression through an unknown mechanism. We find that IGF2BP1 binds and activates HIC2, itself a BCL11A repressor. Furthermore, we identify that IGF2BP1 plays a BCL11A-independent role by direct binding to HBG1/2 to promote its translation. Stop codon-proximal m6A-modified coding sequences within HBG2 transcripts are necessary and sufficient for direct positive regulation mediated by IGF2BP1. This work deepens the mechanistic understanding of hemoglobin switching and suggests a physical relationship between heterochronic RBPs and globin transcripts.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

Bdellovibrio has a wealth of genes that encode unique proteins to enable this lifestyle. Using a series of x-ray structures, we show that the operonal pairing of bd2538 and bd2539, encode a double TULIP (tubular lipid binding protein) invasion protein A (TipA) and a small beta sandwich (TipB), respectively. TipA has a specialised N-terminal TULIP domain with a beta hairpin and helix that mediate homodimerisation through hairpin interdigitation. This dimerisation creates a large, continuous, enclosed lumen that we demonstrate to contain multiple lipid molecules. In addition, we show that TipB functions as a small adapter protein that binds to TipA using specialised loops that bury into the TipA hydrophobic core. This binding forms a clamp on the edge of the N-terminal beta sheet and induces a large 20 [A] conformational change, opening the TULIP fold to create an accessible interior. This study presents the first structural characterisation of lipid binding proteins in Bdellovibrio, and the first example of conformational change in TULIPs mediated by an adaptor protein.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

We show GlpG is essential for the assembly of type 1 pili, a virulence factor required for the colonization of eukaryotic cells. Since pili are critical for biofilm formation and bacterial persistence, the absence of GlpG proteolytic activity reduces the production of biofilm. Working towards new potential antimicrobial targets for treating infections, we show that biofilm formation is hampered by GlpG inhibition.

The bone marrow serves not only as the primary site for blood cell production but also as a niche for various disorders, including blood cancers. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the cellular biology and molecular dynamics within this complex microenvironment. The choice between these two approaches, however, is often shaped or constrained by the study design, such as research objectives, sample type, and preservation conditions. Consequently, methodological differences in library preparation and transcript capture efficiency can introduce systematic biases that complicate downstream analyses and interpretation, underscoring the need to identify and account for method-specific features. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of matched snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets from 11 pairs of healthy donor bone marrow mononuclear cell samples, generated using the popular 10x Genomics platform. We evaluated method-specific biases using multiple quality metrics and compared cell type proportions and transcriptomic signatures captured by each approach. Integrative analysis of these datasets is feasible but not advisable due to systematic gene length biases that were observed between these approaches. Our results showed that despite inherent differences in library complexity, both protocols reliably captured all major cell types. This comparative analysis highlights intrinsic differences between snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq data, providing valuable insights into their respective advantages, limitations, and trade-offs. These findings can assist researchers in selecting the optimal method tailored to specific biological questions and sample characteristics, and also enable more method-aware data analysis and interpretation.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

However, existing sgRNA design prediction models based on in vitro data are difficult to generalize to in vivo contexts.

In this study, we developed the first mammalian in vivo-trained prediction model to evaluate the efficiency of a dual-sgRNA-based exon deletion strategy. Using 230 editing outcomes of postnatal viable individuals, eight prediction models were constructed and evaluated based on generalized linear models and random forests. The final selected model, a Combined GLM, integrated the DeepSpCas9 score with k-mer sequence features, achieving an AUC of 0.759 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.697-0.821). Motif analysis revealed that CC sequences were associated with high efficiency and TT sequences were associated with low editing efficiency. This study demonstrates that integrating sequence-based features with existing design scores can improve sgRNA efficiency prediction in vivo.

A.; Kastrati, I.", "abstract": "Thioredoxin reductases (cytosolic TXNRD1 and mitochondrial TXNRD2) are antioxidant enzymes often overexpressed in tumors, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), making them promising targets for cancer therapy. Inhibiting these enzymes may worsen the already elevated oxidative stress in cancer cells, ultimately leading to cell death through a pro-oxidant mechanism. However, selectively targeting TXNRDs has been challenging due to the traditional reliance on covalent inhibition strategies. Recent studies have identified a druggable allosteric pocket in this enzyme family, paving the way for the development of novel non-covalent inhibitors, referred to as TXNRD(i)s. These inhibitors have been tested in TNBC models and have demonstrated a range of anti-cancer effects. To understand the molecular and cellular consequences of TXNRD(i)s, we conducted unbiased transcriptomic analyses and found that the gene expression changes induced by TXNRD(i) treatment closely mirror those resulting from TXNRD1 silencing, reinforcing TXNRD1 as the primary therapeutic target. While TXNRD(i) treatment increases redox stress in TNBC cells, this is not the main driver of the anti-cancer effect. Instead, TXNRD(i)s potently inhibit cell proliferation and induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Notably, supplementing cells with exogenous deoxynucleotides restores cell viability, cell cycle progression and partially reverses cell death. These findings indicate that TXNRD(i)s deplete endogenous deoxynucleotide pools and impair ribonucleotide reductase activity as the main mechanism of anti-cancer effects. We further demonstrate that TXNRD(i)s inhibit both TXNRD1 and TXNRD2, and that dual inhibition is more effective in suppressing TNBC cell growth. In vivo, TXNRD(i) treatment significantly impairs TNBC xenograft tumor growth and reduces proliferation-related genes. Collectively, these findings challenge the prevailing paradigm that all TXNRD inhibitors function through prooxidant mechanism, instead highlighting that non-covalent TXNRD(i)s exert their effects by blocking proliferation offering a compelling therapeutic strategy for TNBC and potentially other cancers with elevated TXNRD expression.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}

While maternal exercise during lactation has been associated with favorable shifts in milk metabolites in humans, the mechanisms by which exercise remodels the mammary gland and milk lipid profile to influence offspring metabolism remain unclear. We developed a mouse model incorporating daily moderate treadmill exercise during lactation, indirect calorimetry, stable isotope tracer respirometry, and mammary epithelial cell (MEC) proteomics in lean (LN) and diet-induced obese (OB) dams. Maternal obesity broadly remodeled the MEC proteome, reducing enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis and altering lipid transport and oxidative pathways. These molecular adaptations corresponded to higher milk triglyceride content and shifts in fatty acid composition, including an elevated omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio. The exercise (EX) intervention during lactation reset MEC protein networks, enhancing translational and vesicle transport pathways while reducing fatty acid desaturation, relative to the sedentary (SED) group. In OB dams, exercise increased milk medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) levels and partially corrected the n6/n3 FA ratio. Offspring nursed by OB-EX dams exhibited higher whole-body energy expenditure, increased fatty acid oxidation, and improved metabolic flexibility compared to litters consuming OB-SED milk. Together, maternal exercise during lactation remodels mammary metabolism and milk fatty acid composition in obese dams, enhancing neonatal lipid oxidation and energy expenditure.

A comprehensive analysis of mosaicism requires deep and unbiased sequencing of the target loci, with accurate single molecule reads. Here we performed amplification-free PureTarget PacBio sequencing to investigate CRISPR-Cas9 outcomes at on-target and off-target sites in germline edited zebrafish and their offspring. Results: Thirty samples from pooled larvae and individual zebrafish were successfully sequenced, resulting in >1100x average target coverage. The PacBio reads reached an exceptional accuracy (QV39) over the target regions, with every read originating from a unique DNA molecule. The two haplotypes of the target loci displayed a balanced depth of coverage, while long-range PCR of the same samples resulted in skewed data. Further analysis of the PureTarget data revealed widespread genetic mosaicism in individual founder (F0) fish, with up to 18 distinct on-target events and 11 off-target events present in a single adult founder. Several CRISPR-Cas9 editing outcomes, including large structural variants and off-target mutations, were inherited to the F1 generation. Notably, as many as seven unique editing events were found among F1 juvenile offspring from a single founder pair, thereby confirming the presence of genetic mosaicism in germ cells of founder zebrafish. This implies that some consequences of CRISPR-Cas9 editing may emerge only in the second generation. We also analyzed DNA methylation but did not observe altered 5mC CpG signals in genome edited samples. Conclusions: PureTarget enables efficient, accurate and unbiased analysis of the full spectrum of genetic mosaicism in a sample. The potential risks of introducing germ cell mosaicism in founder individuals should be carefully evaluated when designing germline genome editing experiments.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": ""}
