Integument anti-wetting or hydrophobicity, evolved in relation to complex and various structures, is a crucial property as it serves multiple functions like self-cleaning, locomotion, or defence against pathogens and may interfere with other functions like thermoregulation or communication. Elucidating the structure-property relationships and unravelling potential trade-offs is crucial to understand the evolution of the integument. In opaque Lepidoptera, wing scales actively contribute to anti-wetting. In clearwing Lepidoptera, wing scales are often reduced, raising the question of whether they can maintain similar hydrophobicity levels to those of opaque species and if not, whether wing microstructure (scale density, shape, insertion, and coloration) may mitigate the costs of a lower hydrophobicity. To answer these questions, we measure static contact angle (CA) of water droplets at different stages of evaporation in opaque and transparent patches of 23 Lepidoptera species that show a high diversity in wing microstructure. More specifically, we find that transparency is costly for hydrophobicity, and that such cost depends on wing microstructure. In general, transparent patches lose more hydrophobicity with water evaporation than opaque patches. Yet, this loss of hydrophobicity is attenuated for higher scale densities, erect scales compared to flat scales, coloured scales (for erect scales), multiple scale layers (for flat scales), or when combining two types of scales (piliform and lamellar) than having only one type of scale (piliform or lamellar). Nude membranes show the lowest hydrophobicity values. We find that wing hydrophobicity negatively relates to optical transparency, showing a trade-off between optics and hydrophobicity. Moreover, we find that tropical species have higher hydrophobicity in their transparent patches than temperate ones, suggesting transparent patches are under stronger selection for hydrophobicity in tropical than in temperate species. These novel findings, which are consistent with the physics of hydrophobicity, suggest that insect wings are evolutionary multifunctional compromises.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Unexpectedly, we identified Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which has been almost exlusively studied in neurodevelopment/neurosignaling, as a key molecule. Reduced DISC1 levels increase infarct size in mouse hearts, increases cTnT release following surgery in coronary artery bypass grafting patients and decrease the survival of human AC16 cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemic conditions by disrupting cardioprotective pathways. Mechanistically, the loss of DISC1 interaction with Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta (GSK3{beta}) heightens GSK3{beta} activity, promoting cell death. Conversely, increasing DISC1 levels enhances cardioprotective signaling by maintaining the DISC1-GSK3{beta} interaction. Although DISC1 is known to interact with many proteins as an intracellular hub, we have identified that its specific interaction with GSK3{beta} is crucial for cardioprotection.

Primordial follicle activation is the first step towards oocyte maturation and, ultimately, ovulation. As the number of quiescent primordial follicles is finite, their rate of activation is a critical parameter of the duration of the female reproductive lifespan. Activation status is established by the presence of cuboidal and proliferative granulosa cells in primary follicles, rather than squamous and quiescent pregranulosa cells in primordial follicles. Here, using a continuous Entropy Sort Feature Weighting approach on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identify a distinct transcriptomic signature of activating pregranulosa cells in neonatal wildtype mice. This signature contains several genes previously linked with mature granulosa cells as well several novel candidates: Slc18a2, Tnni3, Fam13a and Myo1e. We confirm expression of Slc18a2 and TNNI3 in the granulosa cells of activating follicles in embryonic, neonatal and adult mouse ovaries. Perturbation of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 in Cdkn1b-/- mice results in complete activation of all primordial follicles during this neonatal period. Contrary to previous reports on this established mouse model, we find substantial transcriptomic changes in embryonic Cdkn1b-/- ovaries. Upon loss of cell-cycle inhibition, we find increased expression of our signature of pregranulosa cell activation, particularly that of cardiac troponin I (Tnni3). We conclude that pregranulosa cells engage a distinct transcriptional programme prior to cell-cycle dependent primordial follicle activation.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

M.; Castrillon, G.; Yuan, B.; Andrews-Hanna, J.; Preibisch, C.; Riedl, V.", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) detects changes in brain activity by measuring fluctuations in blood oxygenation. The interpretation of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal relies on the mechanism of neurovascular coupling, which closely links changes in neuronal activity to changes in cerebral blood flow ({triangleup}CBF). Whether uniform neurovascular coupling applies to the entire human cortex is yet to be proven. We used BOLD fMRI along with quantitative fMRI to assess the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) associated with both positive and negative BOLD signal changes ({triangleup}BOLD) using various task and baseline conditions. Contrary to conventional BOLD signal interpretations, we found decreases in CMRO2 in 12-40% of voxels with significant positive {triangleup}BOLD and increases in CMRO2 in 40-66% of voxels with significant negative {triangleup}BOLD, such as in the default mode network. This indicates a substantial number of discordant voxels where the sign of BOLD signal changes is contrary to the underlying metabolic activity. We identified differences in neurovascular coupling in these discordant voxels during both baseline and task states. During baseline, these voxels showed a lower oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and CMRO2 compared to concordant voxels. In task states, oxygen demand in discordant voxels was primarily regulated via {triangleup}OEF (58%), whereas in concordant voxels, {triangleup}CBF (87%) was the primary regulatory mechanism. Thus, we propose {triangleup}OEF as a complementary mechanism to {triangleup}CBF in regulating oxygen demand across the human cortex. In summary, the canonical interpretation of positive and negative BOLD signal changes in terms of increased or decreased neural activity might be misleading, and we recommend quantitative fMRI or additional CBF measurements for a more valid interpretation of regional BOLD signal changes in relation to neuronal activity.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

However, there are currently no complete species-level phylogenies of this group. Most prior work has been based on either morphological data or a small number of molecular markers, each of which has limited capability for reconstructing the tinamou phylogeny. Therefore, the interrelationships of most tinamou species are uncertain. We analyzed 80 whole-genomes from a mix of historical study skins and frozen tissues, including all 46 recognized species of tinamous to (1) reconstruct their interrelationships, (2) estimate the timeframe of tinamou evolution, and (3) examine for the effects of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and ancestral introgression on genome evolution. We compared results for coding (BUSCO) and ultraconserved element (UCE) loci, as well as sex-linked and autosomal markers, and used fossil-calibrated tip-dating to estimate divergence times. Tinamous diverged from their sister-group, the extinct Moas, 50-60 mya, and their crown divergence occurred roughly 30-40 mya, followed by constant diversification rates until the present. Phylogenetic reconstructions were largely robust across methods and datasets. Only one clade in the genus Crypturellus displayed substantial species-tree discordance across the different data sets. To investigate the impacts of introgression on this discordance, we quantified introgression for 100kb non-overlapping windows across the genome, and identified pervasive genome-wide introgression. The distribution of this introgression across the genome was dependent on the assumed phylogeny applied to the f-branch model. When assuming one of these topologies in the f-branch model, patterns of introgression matched theoretical predictions about genome architecture. Overall, we present the most complete phylogeny for tinamous to date, identify an unrecognized species, and provide a case study for species-level phylogenomic analysis using whole-genomes.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that prolonged exposure to the wounding hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) enhances TGG1 and TGG2 expression independent of the canonical jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves. We found that airborne MeJA treatment for up to 5 d enhanced both TGG1 and TGG2 gene expression and their protein levels in Arabidopsis leaves. Notably, TGG1 and TGG2 gene expressions significantly upregulated in two JA signaling pathway mutants, namely coi1-16 and myc2,3,4, following 5 d of MeJA treatment. TGG1 and TGG2 proteins accumulate in specialized myrosin cells of rosette leaves. Myrosin cell area expands in response to MeJA treatment in a leaf-age-dependent manner. Consistent with this, the expression of FAMA, a transcription factor known to regulate TGG1 and TGG2 gene expression, also increased in a leaf-age-dependent manner after 5 d of MeJA treatment.

Several investigations, supported by carefully crafted models, have examined the origin of such cells. The most recent models hypothesize that temporal sequences underlie the observed spatial properties. We aim at investigating whether a random recurrent structure is sufficient to allow such latent sequence to appear. To do so, we simulated an agent with egocentric sensory inputs that must navigate and alternate choices at intersections. We were subsequently able to identify several splitter cells inside the model. Remarkably, when we systematically lesioned the identified splitter cells, the model's behavioral performance remained intact, and new splitter cells consistently emerged through network reorganization. Furthermore, we successfully decoded position, orientation, and decision representations from the reservoir activity, even after repeated lesioning of the splitter cells. These findings suggest that the splitter cells activity is primarily task-driven and does not derive from a specific architecture nor learning. Any sufficiently recurrent network will exhibit such activity.

Temporal adaptation in the form of reduced responses to repeated external stimuli is ubiquitously observed in the brain, yet it remains unclear how repetition suppression aids recognition of novel inputs. To clarify this, we collected behavioural and electrocorticography (EEG) measurements while human participants categorized objects embedded in visual noise patterns after first viewing these patterns in isolation, inducing adaptation to the noise stimulus. We furthermore manipulated the availability of object information in the visual input by varying the contrast of the noise-embedded objects. Our results provide convergent behavioral, neural and computational evidence of a benefit of temporal adaptation on sensory representations. Adapting to a noise pattern resulted in overall faster object recognition and better recognition of objects as object contrast increased. These adaptation-induced behavioral improvements were accompanied by more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of object-evoked EEG responses, and better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To identify potential neural computations mediating the benefits of temporal adaptation on object recognition, we equipped task-optimized deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with different candidate mechanisms to adjust network activations over time. DCNNs with intrinsic adaptation mechanisms, such as additive suppression, best matched contrast-dependent human performance benefits due to adaptation, whilst also showing improved object decoding as a result of adaptation. Networks that use temporal divisive normalization, a biologically-plausible canonical neural computation, additionally showed robustness to shifting objects, suggesting that temporal adaptation via divisive normalization aids stable representations of time-varying visual inputs.

Here, we analyze this landscape to address two questions: (1) How does the nature of epistasis between two mutations change with genetic background? and (2) How predictable is epistasis within a gene? We find that epistasis is 'fluid': higher-order interactions cause the relationship between two mutations to shift strongly across genetic backgrounds. Mutations fall into two distinct categories: a small subset exhibit strong global epistasis, while the majority do not. Nonetheless, we find that the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of a genotype is highly predictable from its fitness.

However, how the uplift influences animal migration strategies remains largely unclear. We compare the current flyways of 50 avian species migrating across the plateau with those reconstructed before the uplift as a counterfactual. We find that the major effect of the plateau uplift is changing avian migratory directions from the latitudinal to the longitudinal. The monsoon system generated by the uplift rather than the high elevation per se shapes those changes. These findings unveil how an important global geological event has influenced biogeographic patterns of migratory birds, yielding testable hypotheses for how observed avian distributions emerge.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

I.; Waxman, D.", "abstract": "Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population, since selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are clinically significant loci, such as those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to biallelic loci, and up to now there is no flexible expression for the force of selection which applies for arbitrary numbers of alleles (and thus any number of heterozygotes), and which accommodates diverse fitness regimes. Here, we derive an expression, for the force of selection, which explicitly separates the effects of genetic diversity from the effects of fitness of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and analysis of selection, and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and can involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage. We show how our results can be used to estimate fitness effects from allele frequency trajectories and employ such an approach on existing data in the literature on experimental yeast evolution. We uncover evidence of wide-spread heterozygote advantage across the yeast genome.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Campbell, C. J.; Loiselle, B.; Guralnick, R.", "abstract": "Avian elevational migration is a common but often overlooked form of short-distance migration. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior, yet few studies have tested those comprehensively. We examine the climatic constraint hypothesis - a key hypothesis explaining elevational migration - to evaluate its predictions for avian elevational migration in the monsoon-dominated Western Ghats of India. We used citizen science data from eBird to quantify elevational migration patterns of resident birds of the region. Using robust data curation protocols and new bias correction methods, we modeled migration patterns of 164 species across summer, monsoon and winter seasons. To formally test the climatic constraint hypothesis, we modeled the likelihood and distance of migration against body size and environmental niche breadths, using phylogenetically informed logistic regression and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models. Our results show that 43% of resident birds exhibited elevational migration in at least one season. Most species migrated between winter and summer (57), followed by migrations between summer and monsoon (39) and then monsoon and winter (38). Species predominantly moved upslope in summer (82%) and downslope in monsoon (87%), with no discernible pattern of direction in winter. Species with broader temperature tolerances were more likely to migrate across all seasons. Additionally, species with broader precipitation niches and larger body sizes moved further downslope during the monsoon and winter, respectively. We found that species with broader tolerances to environmental conditions were more likely to be migratory and moved further along the elevational gradient, contradictory to the expectations of the climatic constraint hypothesis. Our analyses suggest that elevational migrants of the Western Ghats are not climatically limited but likely possess flexibility to track ecological resources that vary with season and elevation.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate how selection affects phylodynamic migration rate estimates. To this end, we developed a novel agent-based simulation tool, virolution, to simulate the evolution of virus within two anatomical compartments of a host.Using this tool, we generated viral sequences and genealogies assuming both, neutral evolution and purifying selection that is concordant in both compartments. We found that, under the selection regime, migration rates are significantly overestimated with a stochastic mixture model and a structured coalescent model in the Bayesian inference framework BEAST2. Our results reveal that commonly used phylogeographic methods, which assume neutral evolution, can significantly bias migration rate estimates in selective regimes.

Considerable effort has been placed into understanding how the molecular mechanisms in specific neuron types are modified in memory, but these studies are often undertaken hours or days after training, when memory is already consolidated. Studies have shown that protein synthesis is elevated during the early stages of consolidation, but there is limited information as to how it impacts neuronal function. We hypothesize that mRNAs being translated during the early stages of consolidation could provide clues as to how diverse neurons involved in memory formation restructure their molecular architecture to support memory formation. Here, we generate a landscape of the translatome of three neuron types in the dorsal hippocampus during the first hour of contextual memory consolidation. Our results show that these neurons share a common backbone of readily translated mRNAs. However, excitatory neurons undergo deep reconfiguration of proteostatic control, whereas interneurons modify their synaptic transmission. We demonstrate that the translational control in these neurons requires GADD34, which promotes translation initiation. Finally, we show that the differential expression of mRNAs by neurons during early consolidation can be explained by features hard coded in the mRNA, suggesting ubiquitous mechanisms controlling activity-dependent neuronal translation. Altogether, our work uncovers previously unknown checkpoints controlling activity-dependent translation in neurons and provides a large, readily available resource for further investigations of memory formation in health and disease.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

The same phenotypic pattern has conflicting interpretations at different evolutionary scales. Macroevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect greater evolutionary potential in later-forming segments, but microevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect less evolutionary potential and greater phenotypic plasticity. We address this conflict by recalculating evolutionary potential (evolvability) from a systematic review of published mammalian molar sizes, then directly measure phenotypic plasticity from a controlled feeding experiment. Effects on lengths and widths are discordant in a way that suggests general growth pathways have a role in phenotypically plastic dental responses to nutrition. Effects on successive trait means do not necessarily increase downstream, contrary to long-standing hypotheses. We confirm prior findings of increasing non-inherited variance downstream, showing decoupling between effects on trait mean and variance. These patterns can be explained by a cascading model of tooth development compounding the effect of developmental instability as an influence separate from general environmental effects on the developing embryo. When evaluated in terms of evolvability, later-developing molars are equally or more evolvable than earlier-developing molars, aligning their microevolutionary potential with macroevolutionary patterns in other serially segmented structures.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

The heterogeneous responses of single neurons in sensorimotor cortex to somatosensation have led to disparate views of the computational role of this brain area in somatosensory processing. Here, we use population-level analyses of neural activity recorded during active and passive limb movements to assess the structure and summarize the properties of neural encoding in sensorimotor cortex. We used 2-photon imaging to record the activity of thousands of neurons in these brain areas from eight anesthetized mice during passive deflections of each limb. We additionally analyzed neural responses to passive limb movements in eight awake mice, sourced from an open dataset (Alonso et al., 2023), and neural responses to spontaneous limb movements in eight mice, collected during a previous study. To conduct the population-level analyses, we found the principal components of the time-varying neural population activity matrix in each set of experiments. Across all three datasets and behavioral conditions, a small fraction of principal components explained a large fraction of variance in the neural responses. These low-dimensional representations of single and multi-limb movements were well conserved across animals, including orthogonal representations of ipsilateral and contralateral limbs. This organization of somatosensory information mirrors the well-known structure of neural encoding of motor commands. Furthermore, while the activity of individual neurons and small populations best encoded intrinsic variables, larger populations of neurons additionally encode extrinsic variables --- a representational structure that is commonly associated with higher-level brain areas. Together, these analyses demonstrate that population-level encoding of somatosensory information in mouse sensorimotor cortex is structured to facilitate sensorimotor integration across the brain.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for glucose homeostasis and pancreatic {beta}-cell function under basal conditions, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and increases in mitophagy following metabolic stress in both mouse and human islets. Indeed, TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of machinery within both the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin dependent) and receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy pathways upon metabolic stress. Intriguingly, the effect of TRAF6 deficiency on glucose homeostasis and mitophagy was fully reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency.

V.; Ragsdale, A.", "abstract": "In many taxa, levels of genetic diversity are observed to vary along their genome. The framework of background selection models this variation in terms of linkage to constrained sites, and recent applications have been able to explain a large portion of the variation in human genomes. However, these studies have also yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, existing models are inaccurate in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes~-1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest. And second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics, which allows for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to non-equilibrium demography, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire range of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under population size changes and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, biases due to the incorrect assumption of equilibrium carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

The reasons underlying these changes in parasite virulence are manifold. Here, we investigated the importance of order and timing of infection. We used a model of rodent coinfection between two parasites that do not compete for common resources, an intestinal nematode (Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Hp) and an apicomplexan protozoan (Plasmodium yoelii, Py). During single infections, Hp induced only mild disease symptoms. Plasmodium produced a substantial reduction in the number of red blood cells but all mice recovered from the infection. A different picture emerged in coinfected hosts. Hp maintained a profile of mostly asymptomatic infection when infecting hosts that had been previously infected with Py. On the contrary, Py incurred substantially higher costs in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We then investigated the possible reasons underlying the increase of Py virulence in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We found that coinfected hosts were less able to control Py multiplication and to recover from infection-induced anemia. Coinfected hosts had similar levels of erythropoietin and similar renewal of lost red blood cells compared to single Py infected hosts, resulting in decreased tolerance to Py infection. Experimental administration of erythropoietin in coinfected (Hp infecting first) hosts, partially decreased the severity of disease symptoms and improved tolerance. The detoxification of free heme released during the lysis of red blood cells, and the expression of Th1 and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were also similar between coinfected and single infected hosts. However, coinfected mice had higher proportions of regulatory T cells expressing the CTLA-4 immune checkpoint, suggesting an enhanced immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Py infection also induced the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, as coinfected mice had higher proportions of both PD-1+ and LAG-3+ CD8+ T cells, and an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Overall, these results stress the importance of the order of infection as a major determinant of malaria severity in hosts harboring a gastrointestinal nematode infection.

Most estimation methods rely either on the number of times animals pass through the detection zones, like random encounter models (REM) or on the number of capture occasions in a time-lapse program when animals were seen on the pictures, like the instantaneous sampling approach (IS). Yet, the ability of these two popular method classes to both reliably detect population trends and estimate population size has rarely been evaluated. We filled this gap by simulating a setup of either 100 or 25 camera traps randomly distributed on a 2600-ha area (respectively {approx} 4 and 1 trap/km2), along with the movements of a fictional population of 300 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Simulations were informed by field data on habitat, habitat selection and activity patterns of GPS-monitored roe deer. Assuming perfect knowledge of key parameters (e.g., day range), constant sensor sensitivity and full correction for imperfect visibility within the detection zone, both IS and REM provided unbiased estimates of population size, but uncertainty remained substantial (CV: 15% at high trap density, up to 30% at low trap density). Moreover, despite idealized conditions and large sampling efforts, a simulated 20% population decline over 5 years went undetected by both approaches in 65-75% of simulations at high trap density and 80% at low trap density. Testing other sampling strategies to improve sensitivity either led to an unchanged population size estimation precision (stratified sampling) or to biased estimated trends (sampling only in high-quality habitats). Simulating animals with a 10 times larger home-range, like red deer (Cervus elaphus), led to miss the decline less frequently (5% -- 40% at high trap density, 33% -- 67% at low trap density). These results suggest that the key metric for camera trap use is the average number of different traps visited per animal, which in turn depends on trap density, home-range size and space use heterogeneity.

Here, we show that inter-tissue stress communication can also function in reverse, i.e. from the peripheral tissue to the nervous system. osm-8 mutants, which activate the physiological osmotic stress response in the C. elegans skin, also exhibit defective osmotic avoidance (Osm) behavior, via a direct and specific effect on ASH osmosensory neuron excitability. Both osm-8 and the Patched-related gene ptr-23, mutations in which suppress all osm-8 phenotypes, function in the hypodermal lysosomes to regulate both physiology and behavior. Unbiased lipidomics shows that osm-8 leads to a ptr-23-dependent elevation of the lysosome specific lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) and expansion of the pool of hypodermal lysosomes. Just as genetic activation of the osmotic stress response by loss of osm-8 in the hypodermis causes an Osm phenotype, acute physiological exposure to osmotic stress also confers a reversible Osm phenotype. Behavioral and genetic plasticity requires biosynthesis of the compatible solute glycerol, a key physiological output of the organismal osmotic stress response. However, ptr-23 is only required for osm-8 induced behavioral plasticity and not physiological plasticity. Instead, both genetic and physiologically induced Osm phenotypes require the unusual non-neuronal lysosomal V-ATPase subunit vha-5, which is also critical for organismal osmotic stress survival. Together, these data reveal that genetic or physiological activation of stress signaling from the skin elicits lysosome-associated signals that modulate organismal neurophysiology to attenuate a sensory neuron circuit.

However, previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted fMRI (dfMRI), from which ADC-fMRI derives, is influenced by BOLD effects, leading to a concern that the dfMRI contrast is still rooted in neurovascular rather than neuromorphological coupling. Mitigation strategies have been proposed to remove vascular contributions while retaining neuromorphological coupling, by: i) analysing ADC timecourses calculated from two interleaved diffusion-weightings, known as ADC-fMRI; ii) using b-values of at least 200 s mm-2; and iii) using a sequence compensated for cross-terms with fluctuating background field gradients associated with blood oxygenation. Respiration-induced haemodynamic fluctuations, which are dissociated from neural activity, are an excellent test-bed for the robustness of ADC-fMRI to vascular contributions. In this study, we investigate the association between end-tidal CO2 and ADC-fMRI, in comparison with dfMRI and BOLD, in both breath-hold and resting-state paradigms in the human brain. We confirm a strong dependence of the BOLD signal on respiration, and a pattern of delayed haemodynamic response in white matter. While dfMRI mitigates much of the vascular contribution, it retains some association with respiration, as expected. Conversely, ADC-fMRI is mostly unaffected by vascular contribution, exhibiting minimal correlation between expired CO2 and ADC timeseries, as well as low inter- and intra-subject reproducibility in correlation maps.

J.; Kerr, B.; Feder, A. F.", "abstract": "Antiviral resistance evolution poses a major obstacle for controlling viral infections. A promising strategy is to target shared viral proteins that allow drug susceptible viruses to sensitize resistant ones during cellular coinfection, muting selection for resistance. Pocapavir, a poliovirus capsid inhibitor, employs this sociovirological strategy. While susceptible viruses significantly suppressed resistance in the presence of pocapavir in cell culture, a pocapavir clinical trial observed widespread resistance evolution and limited improvements to clearance times. To reconcile these findings, we present an intra-host eco-evolutionary model of poliovirus in the presence of pocapavir, which reproduces both the potent interference observed in vitro and the resistance emergence seen in patients. In the short term, our model predicts that a high density of susceptible viruses sensitizes resistant ones to pocapavir, mirroring cell culture results. However, over multiple replication cycles, pocapavir's high potency collapses viral density, which reduces coinfection and allows resistance to evolve as observed in the clinical trial. Since coinfection is essential to suppress resistance, enabling greater survival of susceptible viruses could offer therapeutic advantages. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by lessening antiviral potency, which can limit resistance evolution while also maintaining a low viral load. These findings suggest that antivirals that rely on viral social interaction must balance immediate neutralization with the preservation of future coinfection, yielding more sustained inhibition. Explicitly considering the eco-evolutionary feedback encompassing viral density, social phenotypes and absolute fitness not only provides new insights into designing effective therapies but also illuminates viral evolutionary dynamics more broadly.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

However, relatively little is known about how the activity of methanotrophs impacts the structure of the broader microbial community in this globally important agricultural environment. To address this question, we passaged 51 aerobic microbial enrichment cultures from rice rhizosphere, root, and stem samples in a chemically-defined medium with methane as the primary carbon source and electron donor. We profiled the cultures over time by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and sequenced the genomes of 40 isolates from the enrichments to gain functional insights. Taxa whose relative abundance increased during community growth on methane represented more than a dozen families, many of which are not known to utilize methane or other one-carbon substrates. Despite the selective pressure imposed by the culture condition, the final community structures were taxonomically varied rather than converging to a common composition. Genomic analysis of the sequenced isolates revealed considerable variation in likely carbon source utilization repertoires, as well as the capacity for nitrogen fixation or denitrification. Taken together, these findings support the view that methanotrophy represents a key link in the microbial food web of rice fields, with the potential for downstream effects on the abundance and activity of a wide range of community members.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "During natural vision, people make saccades to efficiently sample visual information from complex scenes. However, a substantial body of evidence has shown impaired visual information processing around the time of a saccade. It remains unclear how saccades affect the processing of high-level visual attributes - such as semantic category information - which are essential for navigating dynamic environments and supporting complex behavioral goals. Here, we investigated whether/how the processing of semantic category information in naturalistic scenes is altered immediately after a saccade. Through both human behavioral and neuroimaging studies, we compared semantic category judgments (Experiments 1A and 1B) and neural representations (Experiment 2) for scene images presented at different time points following saccadic eye movements. In the behavioral experiments, we found a robust reduction in scene categorization accuracy when the scene image was presented within 50 ms after saccade completion. In the neuroimaging experiment, we examined neural correlates of semantic category information in the visual system using fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We found that scene category representations embedded in the neural activity patterns of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were degraded for images presented with a short (0-100 ms) compared to a long post-saccadic delay (400-600 ms), despite no corresponding reduction in overall activation levels. Together, these findings reveal that post-saccadic disruption extends beyond basic visual features to high-level visual attributes of naturalistic scenes, highlighting a limitation of visual information processing in the short post-saccadic period before executing the next saccade.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

As a result, study of disease in such multi-species systems is typically reactive to outbreaks, limiting our ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns of spread. Here, we integrated a fine-scale social network of wild bird co-occurrence with phylogenetic data from High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses (HPAIVs) to show that a zoonotic disease system can be tracked through a multi-species network, using social links as proxies for transmission probability 9. Links in the network predicted genetic similarity between viral genomes, consistent with HPAIV transmission among species that co-occur in the wild. Species connection strength, independent of abundance, also predicted viral genetic similarity.

Earlier work from our lab showed that dysregulation of inhibitory V1 interneurons precedes the degeneration of excitatory V2a interneurons and motoneurons and that stabilizing V1-motoneuron connections improved motor function and saved motoneurons in the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model. However, the optimal timing for this intervention remains unclear. To address this, we developed a spiking neural network model of spinal locomotor circuits to simulate healthy and ALS-like conditions. By modeling changes in network connectivity and synaptic dynamics, we predict that V1 dysregulation induces hyperexcitation in motoneurons which is preferentially observed in flexor motoneurons leading to the disruption of flexor-extensor coordination, and potentially contributing to selective vulnerability of flexor motoneurons. Stabilizing V1 synapses preserved motor output even after motoneuron loss, suggesting that therapeutic benefit is possible into symptomatic stages. However, model predictions also highlighted that after sustained synaptic loss and the development of slower synaptic dynamics within the network, synaptic stabilization leads to maladaptive extensor-biased activity, suggesting that excitatory/inhibitory balance impacts treatment effectiveness. Finally, the model indicated that V1 stabilization could lead to rescue of the V2a excitatory interneurons, a finding that we were able to confirm experimentally in the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model. By exploring different scenarios of synaptic loss and cell dysregulation during synaptic stabilization, our models provide a framework for predicting candidate time windows for spinal circuit interventions, which may guide future preclinical investigations.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

This latter process is facilitated by the unique trilaminate structure of the OHC lateral wall, which consists of the plasma membrane that is densely occupied by the transmembrane motor protein Prestin, the submembrane actin- and spectrin-based cytoskeleton, and the endomembranous subsurface cisternae. This complex system provides mechanical resilience while allowing for cell expansion and contraction during electromotility. Whereas the ultrastructure of the lateral wall is well described, its molecular architecture remains largely elusive. Here, we identified Paralemmin-3 (Palm3) as a novel protein specifically localized to the lateral walls of auditory HCs to play a crucial role in connecting the plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton and subsurface cisternae. Palm3-KO mice display early-onset and progressive hearing impairment that results from diminished cochlear amplification. Subsequent multiscale morphological analyses revealed structural collapse of OHCs that led to progressive and extensive OHC loss along the tonotopic axis. Palm3-KO OHCs exhibited disrupted expression and distribution of several membrane-associated proteins - including spectrin isoforms and Prestin - suggesting an essential role of Palm3 in plasma membrane scaffolding. Electron tomography of OHC lateral walls revealed significantly fewer and structurally perturbed subsurface cisternae. Finally, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated rescue of Palm3 during early postnatal development partly restored hearing function, enhanced OHC survival, and restored OHC cell shape as well as membrane protein expression levels. In summary, Palm3 is a key component of the submembrane cytoskeleton in cochlear hair cells, playing a fundamental role in hair cell biology and hearing, and emerges as an attractive candidate for the long-elusive ''pillar'' component of the hair cell lateral wall ultrastructure.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Analysis of contributing factors to the underlying heterogeneity in patient responsiveness is needed for successful clinical translation. Methods: We provide a novel algorithm that correlates responder status to: i) baseline immunomodulatory attributes of bone marrow-derived MSC (MSC(M)) batches, and to ii) KOA baseline clinical features, local and systemic biomarkers. Using previous clinical trial with twelve batches of autologous MSC(M) as a test dataset, we demonstrate correlations with new longitudinal medium-and long-term clinical data. Results: MSC(M) in KOA clinical responders have reduced expression of angiogenic genes, THBS1, CXCL8, and ANGPT1 and higher expression of growth factor CCN2 that correlates with 12, 24-month and 8-10-year improvements in patient outcomes. Responder MSC(M) have distinct microRNA signatures and significantly higher in vitro ability to modulate monocyte phenotypes. Clinical responders had greater OA baseline severity; reduced physical activity; lower local baseline levels of CCL2, VEGFA, HGF; higher local baseline of resistin. Leave-out-one sensitivity analysis confirmed findings, mitigating sample size concerns. Importantly, responder status at 12 and 24-months was maintained out to 8-10 years in 5/7 responders and 3/3 non-responders, confirming the utility of our approach. Conclusions: We provide a systematic, quantitative method for analyzing heterogeneity in KOA patient responsiveness to MSC treatments, dually incorporating batch/donor and patient factors. Our combinatorial analytical method provides a powerful framework for parsing heterogeneity in KOA patient responsiveness and defining critical quality attributes to reliably identify potent MSC batches.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

In this context, microalgae have emerged as a promising biofactory, producing bioactive compounds for skin health, widely recognized for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging activities. To leverage these properties, besides the conventional use of microalgal mass or extracts, the isolation and application of their secretome including in particular the extracellular vesicles named nanoalgosomes emerged as a novel, increasingly studied approach. EVs are membranous nanoparticles released by all cells and naturally efficient in the transport of both endogenous and exogenous bioactive molecules. Their unique biological properties make them ideal candidates for therapeutic and cosmetic applications. Here, we propose nanoalgosomes, as a sustainable and effective solution for innovative dermocosmetic treatments. In this study we exemplify the use of the microalgae Tetraselmis chuii, an edible, green and renewable EV bio-source. We demonstrated the nanoalgosomes skin-health promoting potential, by employing the human skin cells as a model to evidence the nanoalgosome ability to protect the cells from ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation-related damages. Treatment with nanoalgosomes reduced the oxidative stress, enhancing cell viability in a dose dependent manner. Nanoalgosomes also led to a marked decrease in senescence-associated (SA)-beta-galactosidase activity, indicating a reduction in senescence-associated phenotype in UVB-exposed skin cells. Furthermore, we observed that nanoalgosomes effectively modulate melanogenesis in UVB-stimulated melanocytes by downregulating tyrosinase expression, resulting in a significant decrease in melanin content. These findings validate nanoalgosomes not only as photoprotective agents but also as potential modulators of pigmentation processes. Altogether, our results provide a solid foundation for the development of nanoalgosome-based formulations in dermocosmetic applications aimed at UV protection, anti-aging, and depigmentation, supporting the transition toward natural and sustainable skincare solutions.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

In vivo signaling of G protein coupled receptors like the KOR is generally thought to change in magnitude but not sign in such behavior states. Here we investigated KOR modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons following an acute, behaviorally aversive manipulation. We found this switches KOR signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in a subset of VTA dopamine neurons. Brief corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) exposure ex vivo rapidly induces a similar switch in KOR signaling, specifically in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) projecting neurons, but not nucleus accumbens or basolateral amygdala projecting neurons. These KOR mediated excitations depend on G protein activation, but where somatodendritic VTA KORs activate a K+ conductance to hyperpolarize dopamine neurons in control conditions, depolarizations require HCN channel function. One behavioral impact of this change is a loss of the aversiveness of intra-VTA KOR activation, providing direct evidence that rapid changes in GPCR signaling pathways can be triggered by activity at other GPCRs and significantly alter behavioral responses driven by neuromodulators.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Background: Machine learning models trained on paratope-similarity networks have shown superior accuracy compared with clonotype-based models in binary disease classification. However, the computational demands of paratope networks hinder their use on large datasets and multi-disease classification. Methods: We reanalyzed publicly available T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data from 1,421 donors across 15 disease groups and a large control group, encompassing approximately 81 million TCR sequences. To address computational bottlenecks, we replaced the paratope-similarity network approach (Paratope Cluster Occupancy or PCO) with a new Fast Approximate Clustering Techniques (FACTS) pipeline, which is comprised of four main steps: (1) high-dimensional vector encoding of sequences; (2) efficient clustering of the resulting vectors; (3) donor-level feature construction from cluster distributions; and (4) gradient-boosted decision tree classification for multi-class disease prediction. Findings: FACTS processed 10 sequences in under 120 CPU hours. Using only TCR data, and evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation, it achieved a mean ROC AUC of 0.99 across 16 disease classes. Compared with the recently reported Mal-ID model, FACTS achieved higher donor-level classification accuracy for BCR (0.840 vs. 0.740), TCR (0.882 vs. 0.751), and combined BCR+TCR datasets (0.904 vs. 0.853) on the six-class Mal-ID benchmark. FACTS also preserved biologically meaningful signals, as shown by unsupervised t-SNE projections revealing distinct disease-associated and age-associated clusters. Interpretation: Paratope-based encoding with FACTS-derived features provides a scalable and biologically grounded approach for adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoire classification. The resulting classifier achieves superior multi-disease diagnostic performance while maintaining interpretability, supporting its potential for clinical and population-scale health profiling.

Members of the NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE transcriptional co-regulator family suppress root identity in legume nodules, including Pisum sativum coch that display root-nodule hybrids. However, how COCH/NOOT interacts with hormones to control nodule organogenesis is unclear. We show that PsCOCH (COCHLEATA) is required for spatial tight regulation of auxin and cytokinin during nodule organogenesis and identify key hormone and signalling genes regulated by COCH. COCH suppresses cytokinin levels and response during nodule formation, as cytokinin levels are elevated in Pscoch abnormal nodules and this is mirrored by ectopic cytokinin-responsive TCSn::GUS expression in Pscoch nodule apices, nodule vasculature and in root-like tissue. In contrast, PsCOCH promotes auxin accumulation and precise auxin response patterning in nodules, as Pscoch mutants show significantly reduced auxin levels and severely altered auxin-responsive DR5::GUS expression patterns. RNAseq analysis revealed that Pscoch developing nodules have gene expression profiles more similar to root primordia, with increased expression of defence and auxin response genes (IAA and ARF) and reduced expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes (IPT3, CYP735A and LOG2) compared to wild type. We found gibberellin is unlikely to act downstream of PsCOCH, as Pscoch and gibberellin-deficient double mutants still form root-nodule hybrids. Ectopic constitutive expression of PsCOCH also produces root-nodule hybrids and we found intriguing links between autoregulation of nodulation pathway and COCH, suggesting that a complex feedback mechanism acts in COCH control of nodule identity.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Yet, therapeutic strategies to restore BBB integrity remain limited. Approach and Results: Using an unbiased anti-miR library screen, we identify miR-23b as a negative regulator of BBB integrity in brain endothelial cells (BECs). Targeted inhibition of miR-23b with anti-miR -23b in BECs enhances junction protein expression, suppresses transcellular transport, and improves barrier function via Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In a 3D microfluidic model, anti-miR-23b accelerates vessel maturation, enhances resilience to ischemic injury, and facilitates BBB repair.

In this study, molecular evidence was provided for the occurrence of p53 at the subset of E2F1-driven promoters and their suppression, despite the co-occurrence of p53 with p300. P53 repressed promoters were characterized by relatively high nucleosome density and demethylation of H3K4, followed by low H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation of H3K4. Induction of the ATM/ATR-Chek1/2-p53 pathway by sub-lethal doses of cisplatin caused the release of p53 from gene promoters, chromatin relaxation and the gain of transcription permissive histone marks. Mechanistically, p53 maintained the KDM5B that is associated with gene promoters, thereby conditioning the demethylation of H3K4me3. P53 formed an immunoprecipitable complex with KDM5B, E2F1, p300 and H3K4me2 in intact cells, which decomposed with cisplatin and substantially increased the level of H3K4me3 in the p300 interactome. The extrusion of KDM5B from the chromatin was triggered by cisplatin, transient p53 silencing or KDM5B inhibition, also enabled p300 enrichment and increased gene transcription.

We recently characterized a phenomenon, which we termed n-Phosphate collaborations (nP-collabs), where bulk cations form stable bridges between several phosphoresidues in all-atom molecular dynamic simulations. nP-collabs were found to be sensitive to the combination of forcefields and cation types. Here, we attempt to assess the physical relevance of these nP-collabs by evaluating the strength of the cation/phosphate interaction through osmotic coefficient ({phi}) calculations on the model [Formula] and [Formula] salts, using different classical forcefields for phosphorylations. All forcefields were found to overestimate the strength of the interaction to various degrees. We thus designed new parameters for CHARMM36m and AmberFF99SB-ILDN using the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC) approach, which provide remarkable agreement for{phi} values for both cation types and over a range of concentrations. We provide a preliminary test of these ECC parameters for phosphorylations by simulating the sevenfold-phosphorylated rhodopsin peptide 7PP and comparing secondary chemical shifts to experimental data. Conformational ensembles resulting from the ECC-derived phosphorylated forcefields display both qualitative and quantitative improvements with regards to full-charge forcefields. We thus conclude that long-lasting nP-collabs are artifacts for classical forcefields born from the lack of explicit polarization, and propose a possible computational strategy for the extensive parameterization of phosphorylations. The presence of long-lived nP-collabs in simulations produced using classical forcefields is therefore a serious concern for the accurate modelling of multiphosphorylated peptides and IDPs, which are at the center of research questions regarding neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/672842v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fec62org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@178315eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f14450org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bbed7e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Analyses spanning >2,200 multi-omic features and 11,000 microbial function predictions demonstrate coordinated clinical benefits, including improvements in body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness, and reveal coordinated molecular responses across tissues. Iron metabolism emerged as a central axis: transferrin increased while ferritin, haemoglobin, and erythrocytes decreased, changes that opposed ageing trajectories yet remained within physiological limits. Epithelial DNA methylation biomarkers (cervical, buccal) of cancer risk reduced, while blood clocks were largely unresponsive, underscoring tissue-specificity of the epigenome. Immune profiling uncovered dynamic, partially reversible shifts. Notably, we derived a new immunophenotyping-based ImmuneAge score that increased during fasting and tracked with inflammatory function, while the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A declined selectively in postmenopausal women. Oral microbiota showed rapid restructuring, whereas gut microbiota shifted more subtly toward enhanced metabolic capacity. Together, these data provide unprecedented insight into the systemic and tissue-specific responses to IF in humans and identify iron homeostasis and immune remodelling as candidate mechanisms.

Loss-of-function mutations in GDF2 are found in heritable PAH, suggesting its function as an endothelial quiescence factor, while agonizing or antagonizing BMP9 signaling are both reported to ameliorate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study sought to resolve the contribution of BMP9 to pulmonary vascular disease and its status as a potential therapeutic target. The function of BMP9 in experimental PH was interrogated using recombinant BMP9, BMP9/BMP10 ligand trap ALK1-Fc, two anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies, and the activin/GDF/BMP ligand trap ACTRIIA-Fc (a.k.a., sotatercept). Disulfide-linked, prodomain complexed BMP9 was not protective in SUGEN-hypoxia or monocrotaline-induced PH models, in contrast to previous studies using incompletely disulfide-linked BMP9. In contrast, selective and non-selective BMP9 antagonism exerted prophylactic and therapeutic effects across PH models. Anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc had comparable impact on hemodynamics, RV hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling, while single nucleus RNA-Seq revealed similar inhibition of SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3 transcriptional activity, and highly overlapping DEGs, particularly in the endothelial compartment (r=0.83, p=2.54e-43, Spearman), suggesting overlap of mechanism in targeting BMP9. A multi-omic approach using lung tissues from human PAH, experimental models of pulmonary hypertension, and transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from PAH patients revealed that BMP9 is critical for regulating several endothelial gene products that are overexpressed in human and experimental disease and implicated in disease pathogenesis including CXCL12, PDGF-BB, EDN1, COL18A1, and IGFBP4, and are inhibited by administering anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies or ligand traps. Co-culture studies revealed paracrine effects of BMP9-stimulated PMVEC on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) phenotypic plasticity, which could be attributed in large part to endothelial-derived CXCL12. In summary, endothelial BMP9 signaling is a key coordinator of vasoactive endothelial gene products that modulate PASMC phenotype and appears to be a shared target of anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc. Selective targeting of endothelial BMP9 angiogenic signaling represents a potential therapeutic strategy for human PAH.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Dps binds DNA and oxidises iron, facilitating survival in harsh environments. Dps-DNA complexes can form crystalline structures, leading to the proposed model that Dps reorganises the starved E. coli nucleoid into a compact liquid crystal, slowing chromosome dynamics and limiting access of other proteins to DNA. In this work, we directly tested this model using live-cell super-resolution microscopy and Hi-C analysis. We found that after 96 h of starvation, Dps compacts the nucleoid and increases short-range DNA-DNA interactions, but does not affect chromosome accessibility to large protein nanocages or small restriction enzymes. We also report that chromosome dynamics and organisation are primarily impacted by the bacterial growth phase; the effect of Dps is relatively minor. Our work clarifies the role of Dps in modulating nucleoid properties, and we propose an updated model for Dps-DNA interactions in which Dps binds, protects and compacts DNA largely without influencing chromosome access, dynamics and organisation. Additionally, this work provides a general framework for assessing the impact of nucleoid-associated proteins on key aspects of chromosome function in live cells.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Quantitative secretome revealed decreased export of SecA1- and TatA-dependent substrates, with enrichment of cytosolic proteins in culture filtrates, indicating increased membrane permeability. Membrane proteomics showed depletion dependent increased metabolic/lipid-degrading proteins and decreased cell-wall/cell-process proteins, consistent with loss of membrane stability.

Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) now enable the 3D mapping of entire landscapes. However, we lack the large, harmonized and geographically representative ALS collections needed to build a global picture of woody ecosystem structure. To address this challenge, we developed the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA): 3,458 standardized and analysis-ready maps of canopy height and elevation at 1 m2 resolution derived from high-resolution ALS acquisitions. The GCA covers 56,554 km2 across all major biomes. Of its acquisitions 19% of have been scanned multiple times and 87% are publicly available, covering 95% of the total area. To showcase its wide range of applications, we applied the GCA in three case studies. First, we validated three global satellite-derived canopy height maps, finding poor performance at native resolution (1-30 m, R2 < 0.38) and moderate performance at 250 m resolution (R2 < 0.65). Second, analyzing global patterns in canopy gap size frequency we discovered an unexpectedly large variation of power law exponents from branch to stand level ( = 1.52 to 2.38), pointing to fundamental scale-dependencies of forest structure. Third, we developed a framework to standardize forest turnover quantification from multi-temporal ALS. Applied to repeat acquisitions in a temperate forest in North America, it revealed that 21% of canopy gaps closed within 12 years of opening and would thus be missed by infrequent monitoring. As demonstrated by these case studies, the GCA provides a novel data source for ecologists, foresters, remote sensing scientists and the ecosystem modelling community that substantially advances our ability to understand the structure and dynamics of woody ecosystems at global scales.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

By intersecting sex-biased molecular signatures and genes with de novo mutations in male and female autistic probands, we reveal two points of vulnerability contributing to the sex-biased penetrance in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). First, we show that NDD risk genes are biased towards higher expression in females, identifying the NDD gene MEF2C as a critical transcription factor for female-biased expression. Second, we identify a significant contribution of X chromosome genes to NDD pathobiology. We construct a gene regulatory map of X-linked risk genes to enable functional studies of genetic variants that likely disrupt gene expression in the developing brains of autistic males. Together, these results point towards an outsized contribution of the X-chromosome to both the origin of sex differences in the developing human cortex and NDD vulnerability.

It is well documented that behavior influences the general properties of neural activity, such as response gain. However, it is not known whether it could affect the sensory tuning of individual neurons in a more refined way and what the functional benefit of such nuanced modulation might be. Here, we investigate this in the mouse visual cortex, where sensory response gain varies with locomotion speed. First, using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that gain modulation can multiplex behavioral information in sensory populations, without compromising the accuracy of sensory coding. To implement such multiplexing, behavioral signals should modify the sensory tuning in individual neurons. Second, we analyze neural activity in the mouse visual cortex made available by the Allen Brain Observatory. Our analysis indicates that, in agreement with the theory, locomotion-induced gain modulation can modify the tuning of sensory neurons to direction of visual motion. In that way, the visual cortex could instantiate an accurate, joint representation of sensory and movement-related signals and support computations that simultaneously require both types of information.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

This raises a fundamental question: how can excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapses co-adapt through homeostatic plasticity without disrupting network function or relying on fine-tuned parameters? We propose a solution grounded in the multidimensional nature of intracellular calcium signaling, which independently regulates protein synthesis at E and I synapses. By analytically characterizing calcium dynamics driven by spike-train statistics, we show that calcium's mean encodes firing rate, while its variance reflects spike-time irregularity, two complementary features critical for stable yet flexible spiking. Leveraging this dual signal, we construct a closed-loop model in which inhibitory synapses are regulated by calcium's mean and excitatory synapses by its variance through independent pathways. This mechanism preserves irregular spiking and stabilizes firing rates across diverse inputs. Strikingly, it also yields the empirically observed weakening of synaptic strengths with the number of inputs K as 1\\{surd}K, leading to the spontaneous emergence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. These results uncover a calcium-driven regulatory principle linking intracellular signaling to the origin of balanced activity in cortical networks.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

One such comorbidity is epilepsy, with approximately 30% of children with ASD experiencing seizures and a similar proportion of children with epilepsy displaying ASD-like symptoms. Both conditions have been associated with disruptions in the brain's excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) balance. Although early-life seizures in rodents have been linked to social impairments, direct causal evidence connecting E/I imbalance, interneuron development, and social behavior remains limited. To address this gap, we induced transient, brain-wide hyperexcitation in neonatal mice using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA_A receptor antagonist. We administered both convulsive and subconvulsive doses and assessed long-term effects on social behavior, cortical E/I balance, and parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development. PTZ-treated groups displayed impaired social preference as measured in the 3-chamber test and increased PV interneuron density within the medial prefrontal cortex.

Although labeled graphs with local spatial information and deep neural networks have provided computational frameworks for spatial navigation, significant limitations persist in modeling one-shot adaptive mapping. We introduce a biologically inspired place cell architecture that develops cognitive maps during exploration of novel environments. Our model implements a simulated agent for reward-driven navigation that forms spatial representations online. The architecture incorporates behaviorally relevant information through neuromodulatory signals that respond to environmental boundaries and reward locations. Learning combines rapid Hebbian plasticity, lateral competition, and targeted modulation of place cells. Analysis of the capabilities of the model on a variety of environments demonstrates our approachs efficiency, achieving in one shot what traditional RL models require thousands of epochs to learn. The simulation results show that the agent successfully explores and navigates to the target locations in various environments, showing adaptability when the reward positions change. Analysis of neuromodulated place cells reveals dynamic changes in neuronal density and tuning field size after behaviorally significant events.

We examined three neophobic behaviors in captive female and male Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) from a wild population introduced to the USA in 1870: responses towards novel objects, novel foods, and repeated presentations of the same initially novel object. We compared transcriptomic patterns associated with neophobia in three brain regions, the striatum, dorsal hippocampus, and rostral hippocampus, using differential expression and co-expression network analyses. We found that the striatum and hippocampus had distinct transcriptomic profiles, as did the rostral and caudal subregions of the hippocampus, supporting recent hypotheses that these subregions are functionally specialized. Despite the absence of sex differences in neophobic behaviors, neophobia-associated gene modules revealed sex-specific patterns within brain regions. For females, neophobic behaviors more strongly correlated with gene modules in the caudal hippocampus, a region involved in stress and anxiety, whereas for males, neophobic behaviors correlated with gene modules in the rostral hippocampus, a region that may play a larger role in spatial cognition. These modules exhibited significant overlap, suggesting that neophobic behaviors in both females and males are driven by shared neurobiological mechanisms, though they exhibit sex-specific patterns of brain region localization.

Burning pain due to small fiber neuropathy is an early symptom with great impact on health-related quality of life. The pathophysiological role of Gb3 accumulations in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia is incompletely understood. We have differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells of an isogenic GLA knockout line (p.S364del, hemizygous) and its healthy control into sensory neurons to model FD in vitro. We have compared both lines on transcriptional and proteomic level and investigated the effects of AGAL enzyme supplementation. FD sensory neurons showed dysregulation of disease-related pathways, including axon guidance at both RNA and protein level and microfluidic assays revealed shorter neurite length. While AGAL did not restore the transcriptomic state, it reduced Gb3 accumulation and lowered protein ephrin 5A and glycoprotein M6A level. These findings highlight axon guidance alterations in an isogenic human FD sensory model, with potential implications for early central and peripheral innervation in small fiber neuropathy.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

However, whether these effects extend to spinal cord neurons and occur in vivo has remained unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of different LPE species: myristoyl-LPE (14:0 LPE), palmitoyl-LPE (16:0 LPE), stearoyl-LPE (18:0 LPE), and oleoyl-LPE (18:1 LPE) in cultured spinal commissural neurons, and evaluated their effects in vivo using a mouse model of SCI. In cultured neurons, all LPE species promoted neurite outgrowth. Although several species demonstrated a tendency toward neuroprotection, only 16:0 LPE exhibited a statistically significant protective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxic cell death. Intrathecal administration of 16:0 LPE after SCI reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the acute phase and attenuated lesion expansion at 8 weeks post-injury. Moreover, 5-HT fluorescence intensity was increased in 16:0 LPE-treated mice, suggesting enhanced serotonergic innervation. Furthermore, administration of 16:0 LPE after SCI significantly improved hind-limb motor performance compared with vehicle controls, as assessed by the Basso Mouse Scale. Collectively, these findings suggest that intrathecal administration of 16:0 LPE reduces secondary injury and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Our findings highlight its potential as a therapeutic candidate for SCI.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Heilbron, M.", "abstract": "What makes some stimuli more memorable than others? While memory varies across individuals, research shows that some items are intrinsically more memorable, a property quantifiable as memorability. Recently, a new representational signature for image memorability was identified: the magnitude of the population response in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) correlated with image memorability. However, it is unclear if this geometric principle was confined to the visual domain or whether it represents a broader computational phenomenon observable in other stimuli domains as well. Here we show that this representational magnitude effect not only replicates for images in an independent dataset but also generalizes to an entirely different cognitive domain and neural network architecture: lexical memorability and word embeddings. Across three large-scale lexical datasets, we found that the L2 norm (vector magnitude) of word embeddings reliably predicted recognition memorability, independent of word frequency, valence, or word length. This consistency suggests the effect reflects a general property of distributed representations, where representational magnitude may capture how strongly a stimulus projects onto dominant, conceptual/semantically meaningful features in a networks embedding space. At the same time, this effect does not appear to generalize to all domains, as our analysis of a novel voice memorability dataset showed no such relationship between representational magnitude and memorability. Together, these findings indicate that the geometry of distributed representations offers a useful lens for understanding memorability, suggesting an items representational magnitude reflects its projection onto dominant dimensions of representation, in both artificial and biological systems.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

A key step in this process is the ubiquitination of Mtb or Mtb-associated structures. The E3 ligase SMURF1 catalyzes K48-linked ubiquitination, promoting bacterial clearance. However, the function of its homolog, SMURF2, in host defense remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Smurf2 deletion in murine macrophages increases SMURF1 levels, enhances LC3B lipidation, augments K48 ubiquitination of Mtb-associated structures, and reduces intracellular Mtb replication. These effects are reversed by Smurf1 deletion, indicating that SMURF2 restricts autophagy in a SMURF1-dependent manner. Mice with myeloid-specific Smurf2 deletion exhibit modestly prolonged survival following aerosol Mtb infection. In human macrophages, SMURF2 knockdown or its pharmacological inhibition with the HECT ligase inhibitor Heclin reduces Mtb replication. Together, our findings identify SMURF2 as a negative regulator of selective autophagy and host immunity to Mtb and suggest that targeting SMURF2 may represent a novel host-directed therapeutic strategy for tuberculosis.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We examined heat tolerance in 95 species of wild bees (among the most important pollinators on Earth) across the latitudinal extent of Australia. We found that nesting behaviour (plant stem, wooden cavity, or ground), which impacts the micro-climate species are exposed to, predicted species heat tolerances. We demonstrate that nesting behaviour influences the mode of selection on heat tolerance, such that species with different nesting behaviours evolve towards discrete thermal optima independently of phylogeny. This is the first example of repeated evolution of heat tolerance depending on behaviour. Finally, models that consider nesting behaviour change the rank order of which species are most at risk to climate change. Our results underscore the need to understand the drivers of heat tolerance evolution across species to better identify the taxa most at risk to climate change.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We assembled the largest taxon sampling of subg. Esula to date (321 spp.), using DNA sequences from nuclear ITS and plastid ndhF regions, and updated previous phylogenetic analyses and sectional classification of the group. We used Bayesian methods to estimate divergence times and reconstruct ancestral ranges, characterising the tempo and mode of lineage diversification that shaped the present distribution and extant diversity of the subgenus. We tested whether changes in life-history (annual vs. perennial) played a role in the diversification and current elevational distribution of subg. Esula. Our results show that subg. Esula diverged from its sister clade in the Mid-Eocene and started to diversify in the Late Eocene. The Western Palearctic was inferred to be the ancestral area of the subgenus, where the first diversification events began 41 Mya. Expansion to other continents was dated as occurring in the last 10 million years. This coincided with an increase in the diversification rate and with clade-specific rate shifts coupled with changes from annual to perennial life-histories. We found a positive correlation between perenniality and high elevations. These results support that the recent rapid diversification of subg. Esula could be associated with an evolutionary shift to perenniality, allowing colonisation of montane habitats and global range expansion beyond the Western Palearctic.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the phenotypic and allelic diversity of an Austrian maize landrace, we dissected the genetic basis of lateral root (LR) length across developmental stages. LR length, a relevant trait for breeding resource-efficient varieties, showed high heritability in our experiments. We discovered eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) for LR length at the reproductive stage R2, overlapping with four QTL at stage R6 but not with QTL detected at vegetative stage V6, suggesting that the genetic regulation of LR length might differ in vegetative and reproductive stages. We fine-mapped qlr1, the most significant QTL for LR length, to a region of 2.3 Mb containing 46 annotated genes. Based on whole-genome sequence and comparative genomics analyses we suggest a candidate gene underlying qlr1. Additionally, we examined the impact of nitrogen, phosphorus, and irrigation treatments on root and shoot development, finding that LR length positively correlates with biomass accumulation under optimal nutrient supply but not under nitrogen stress.

However, the structural and dynamic properties of these peptide-based nanodiscs remains unknown, hindering their development for the aforementioned purposes. Here we integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments to investigate the structure and dynamics of therapeutic peptide-based nanodiscs constituted of DMPC phospholipids and the amphiphilic apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide 22A. This multi-technique approach reveals the intrinsic polydispersity in size of peptide-based nanodiscs and the need for careful interpretation of averaged experimental parameters. It also demonstrates the value of benchmarking MD simulations against multiple experimental observables to validate the computational protocol and the applied force field. We obtained a description of the nanodiscs with MD simulations that is consistent with the structural information obtained from both experimental methods: averaged size and shape of the nanodiscs from SAS and peptide site-specific information from NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the nanodiscs have an average size of 90 DMPC phospholipids and 18 22A peptides with a predominantly disordered peptide orientation around the lipid matrix. The terminal regions of the peptides display greater flexibility relative to the peptide core and an enhanced C-terminal exposure to solvent, particularly at K22, a residue implicated in LCAT activation.

Here, we report development of a microfluidic device with a functionalized surface, inspired by the physiological processes of immune cell-mediated sperm selection in the female reproductive tract. A plasma-polymerized polyoxazoline (PPOx) film is applied to glass channel slides by deposition of 2-methyl-2-oxazoline, to establish a stable, biocompatible interface confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), ellipsometry, and sperm culture assays. To selectively eliminate pre-apoptotic and apoptotic spermatozoa wherein DNA damage is common, anti-phosphatidylserine (Anti-PS) antibody is immobilized to the PPOx-coated surface proximal to the channel slide inlet, while the sperm chemoattractant progesterone is adsorbed near the outlet. To optimise selective functionality, the surface topography is tailored by covalent immobilization of gold nanoparticles and addition of microchannels. Sperm recovered after processing whole liquified semen then consistently exhibit high motility and morphology, with <1% showing apoptosis-associated membrane damage or DNA fragmentation.

Among the various approaches, style transfer mapping (STM) is distinguished by its ability to align the data distribution of target users directly with that of source users, thereby enabling the reuse of pretrained classifiers without retraining. However, STM is constrained by its inherent assumption of linear relationships between the target and source domains, which is often unrealistic given the complex and nonlinear nature of biological signals. To address this problem, we propose a novel kernel-based STM (k-STM) method that incorporates nonlinear kernel functions to capture complex inter-user variability more effectively. We evaluated the proposed k-STM method using four publicly available electromyogram and electroencephalogram datasets: MyoDataset, NinaProDB5, OpenBMI, and BCI Competition IV-2a, and four backbone classifiers: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron. The experimental results demonstrate that k-STM significantly improves classification accuracy over the original STM, particularly when nonlinear kernels are employed. Statistical analyses confirm the superiority of the proposed approach across diverse datasets and classifiers. Furthermore, we examined the impact of the number of prototypes (i.e., mapping destinations) on the performance of both STM and k-STM, and found that using fewer prototypes than previously recommended can yield higher classification accuracy. Overall, the proposed k-STM constitutes a versatile, efficient, and robust nonlinear transfer-learning framework, enhancing its practical applicability in cross-subject biosignal classification.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to develop and optimize a targeted nanodrug delivery system based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to improve drug accumulation and therapeutic outcomes at vascular lesion sites. Nanoparticles prepared by the solvent evaporation-self-assembly method had an average diameter of 145.6 +/- 12.3 nm, a zeta potential of -21.4 +/- 3.7 mV, and showed uniform spherical morphology. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was 82.3 +/- 4.5%, and the drug loading (DL%) was 9.6 +/- 1.1%, indicating good drug-carrying ability. For surface modification, conjugation of ligands to the ends of PEG chains balanced the conflict between \"stealth\" and \"affinity,\" maintaining circulation stability while restoring effective binding to vascular endothelial cells. Drug release experiments demonstrated a biphasic release profile in PBS (pH 7.4): about 40% was released within 0-12 h, and cumulative release reached 76.5 +/- 3.2% at 72 h. Kinetic analysis fitted the Higuchi model (R^2 = 0.983), suggesting diffusion as the main driving mechanism. This predictable and controllable release behavior can provide both rapid effect in the acute phase and sustained therapy in the chronic phase. Overall, the PLGA nanocarrier system proposed in this study showed clear advantages in physicochemical properties, surface functionalization, and drug release kinetics. It can achieve prolonged circulation, high targeting efficiency, and controlled release in the treatment of vascular diseases.

Nanocarriers were prepared using a thin-film hydration and ultrasonic dispersion method, loaded with siRNA-HSP47, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and HPLC. In vitro release assays demonstrated that dual-targeted nanocarriers achieved sustained release with a cumulative rate exceeding 80% at 72 h, significantly higher than single-target carriers (~60%), and fitted well with the Higuchi diffusion model. In a CCl4-induced mouse liver fibrosis model (n = 48), in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed greater hepatic accumulation and prolonged retention time for dual-targeted nanocarriers, as described by a first-order elimination model. Histological staining and immunohistochemistry confirmed reduced collagen deposition and lower expression of alpha-SMA and TGF-beta1 in the dual-targeted group, while serum ALT and AST levels were significantly improved (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that dual-targeted nanocarriers effectively disrupt the inflammation-fibrogenesis feedback loop by simultaneously modulating HSC activation and endothelial inflammation, offering sustained release, enhanced hepatic retention, and superior therapeutic efficacy.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) induces significant weight loss and improves metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Among the enzymes controlling intracellular concentrations of active glucocorticoids, 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1, SDR26C1) has been extensively studied concerning obesity and post-gastric surgery interventions. However, most studies focused on either a single tissue, circulating glucocorticoid levels, or HSD11B1 activity. In this work, we showed that circulating active/inactive glucocorticoid ratio (corticosterone (B)/11-dehydrocorticosterone (A)) negatively correlated with glucose tolerance; SG in male C57BL/6 mice slightly reduced circulating mineralocorticoids and reversed the elevated ratio of B/A seen in sham-operated mice after high-fat diet, while improving glucose tolerance. This change was likely due to increased renal 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2, SDR9C3) activity after SG. To provide a comprehensive overview of the systemic effects post-surgery, we evaluated enzymes involved in glucocorticoid homeostasis across tissues on mRNA, protein, and activity level.

Using a conditional endothelial cell-specific deletion of Piezo1 in adult mice, we assessed the role of endothelial Piezo1 in mechanical overload-induced muscle hypertrophy in the extensor digitorum longus. Endothelial Piezo1 deletion blunted muscle hypertrophy following mechanical overload despite normal baseline vascularisation, as evidenced by a lack of increase in muscle mass and abolished myofibre growth. Despite being required for optimal muscle growth, endothelial Piezo1 was dispensable for muscle regeneration after injury. In line with this, the reduced muscle growth following mechanical overload was not associated with impaired myonuclear accretion. We suggest that endothelial Piezo1 participates in a myofibre partnership that regulates skeletal muscle growth in response to mechanical overload.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

This study assesses whether a single herbarium specimen can reliably represent its species based on its leaf reflectance spectrum, despite variations in age, geographic origin, or conservation method. We scanned herbarium specimens of different ages and geographic distribution of 14 species of the pantropical Annonaceae. In addition, we used a second dataset of 9 species where some specimens were conserved in alcohol prior to drying and some not. We used five supervised classification models frequently used for high-dimensional data such as spectroscopy. All models achieved high accuracy (>80%) when trained on multiple specimens per species. However, when using only one specimen per species, accuracy varied substantially depending on the taxon. Alcohol preservation prior to drying had little impact on classification success. Our findings demonstrate that herbarium specimens often retain a strong taxonomic signal in their spectra, however, inter-individual variability affects accuracy in some taxa. These findings confirm the usefulness of herbarium spectroscopy as a non-destructive tool for species identification and offer a promising avenue for digitizing historical biodiversity data into high-dimensional trait space.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Resistance-based management strategies rely on grapevine varieties carrying major resistance loci (Rpv). Although breakdown of several loci has been reported, Rpv1 had remained effective until now. Here, we provide the first evidence of Rpv1 breakdown by P. viticola in Cilaos on Reunion Island (France) and the first case of a strain simultaneously overcoming three resistances of grapevine. We combined pathogenicity assays with whole-genome sequencing to characterize a P. viticola strain collected in Cilaos in 2023, alongside a panel of eight reference strains of known virulence. Hypersensitive response and sporulation were assessed for each strain on Chardonnay (susceptible variety) and four resistant varieties carrying Rpv1, Rpv3.1, Rpv10, or Rpv12. The strain collected in Cilaos was able to overcome not only Rpv1 but also Rpv3.1 and Rpv10. On Rpv1, we observed a complete loss of host recognition with high sporulation. On Rpv3.1, the phenotype was consistent with previous breakdowns, and the strain carried the vir1 allele previously described in France. By contrast, the breakdown of Rpv10 differed from that reported in European populations: whereas European strains displayed only partial breakdown of resistance, the strain of Cilaos showed complete loss of host recognition with high sporulation. Moreover, genomic analyses revealed a novel mutation, a large homozygous deletion in the corresponding avr locus. Our genomic data analyses further suggests that this P. viticola strain shares a genetic background with populations from mainland France, raising serious concerns about the potential emergence and spread of multivirulent lineages in Europe. These findings highlight the need for large-scale virulence monitoring of P. viticola and improved strategies for the sustainable management of grapevine resistance in Europe.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are important signaling molecules, playing crucial roles in plant development and stress responses. While ROS-homeostasis is shown to be crucial for maintaining cellular functions and mediating various developmental responses, the involvement of ROS-homeostasis in the regulation of thermomorphogenic responses and the underlying genetic basis remains poorly understood. In this study, comprehensive transcriptomic analyses revealed strong induction of ROS homeostasis and signaling genes in Arabidopsis seedlings under high ambient temperature. Pharmacological and genetic experiments showed that maintaining H2O2 homeostasis is crucial for seedling thermomorphogenesis. We identified PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) as a key regulator of H2O2 homeostasis via direct transcriptional activation of CAT2 and CAT3 genes, which are involved in the regulation of H2O2 levels, to modulate hypocotyl elongation under high temperature. Genetic and biochemical experiments confirmed that CATs act downstream to PIF4 in the same signaling pathway to regulate high-temperature-responsive hypocotyl elongation. Interestingly, elevated H2O2 levels reduced PIF4 protein abundance under high temperature. Together, our findings establish a PIF4-CAT-H2O2 regulatory module, functioning alongside the canonical PIF4-Auxin module, that integrates to auxin signaling to fine-tune hypocotyl elongation under high temperature by maintaining H2O2 homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

During 3-8 August 2024, 506 narwhal observations were made from a semi-stationary boat at the head of the fjord, of which 58 were filmed with a drone. Boat observations near the north side of the fjord indicated that narwhals preferentially traveled outward to the west, with a clear link to currents. The presence of narwhals was more likely in the second half of a day but was highly intermittent, with waiting times for observers reaching as much as 15-28 h between sightings, highlighting the patience needed to observe and catch a narwhal. We also recorded a motionless sleep-like behavior at the surface, known as pugginnartoq (Greenlandic) for narwhals. Aerial drone support was useful for revealing unseen-from-sea-surface features and behaviors, which we describe as potentially interesting for future investigation. For example, drone imagery revealed that 71+/-7% of narwhals had tusks, with a mean tusk-to-body-length ratio of 0.23+/-0.01.

Past work has shown that people retrieve causally related past events during comprehension, but the exact process by which this causal inference occurs remains elusive. Here, we employed a recurrent neural network augmented with an episodic memory buffer to examine how memories are retrieved and integrated based on causal relationships between events. The model was trained to predict upcoming scenes as it watched a television episode. At every time step, the model transformed the current scene into two distinct representations--\"value\" representing memory content and \"key\" representing memory address--both of which were stored as episodic memory. The model learned to retrieve selective past values by applying self-attention over stored keys, and it integrated these retrieved values with the current scene representation to predict an upcoming scene. By separating representations used for encoding from those used for retrieval, the model learned to retrieve memories in ways that go beyond simple pattern similarity. In turn, the model represented causally related events with similar patterns beyond perceptual or semantic similarities, suggesting that it organized event representations based on latent causal structure. Memories retrieved by the model were similar to those retrieved by human participants who watched the same television episode. The model also exhibited hippocampus-like pattern separation and pattern completion, and its representational structure aligned more closely with human fMRI data than a comparison model without an episodic memory buffer. These findings suggest that the model captures the way humans represent events and retrieve memories based on causal relationships. Together, this work proposes a key-value episodic memory system as a candidate computational mechanism for how humans retrieve causally related memories to comprehend naturalistic events.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

However, typical proxies for functions, such as biomass or densities, may not completely capture this behavioural variation. We examined how grouping behaviour of an abundant parrotfish species, Chlorurus sordidus, influences the critical function of herbivory on coral reefs in the Lakshadweep Archipelago and evaluated the role of density-dependence and territorial aggression from competitors in driving group formation in the entire herbivorous fish assemblage. Feeding rates increased with group size and decreased with aggressive encounters, with parrotfish in larger groups consuming about 80% more algae per capita than solitary individuals. Group foragers also benefitted marginally from reduced territorial aggression from competing herbivores. The propensities of herbivores to form groups, and their group sizes were positively density dependent, and, to a lesser extent, were driven by access to resources defended by territorial competitors. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating behavioural variation in assessments and predictive frameworks of ecosystem functioning. As our results indicate, for social animals, key ecosystem functions are particularly sensitive to animal densities and interspecific interactions, especially when individual function varies with social context.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Glochidia parasitise fish fins and gills, and bitterling are especially vulnerable to parasitism due to their spawning association with mussels. We found the lowest glochidia load in bitterling from populations with the longest association with S. woodiana. While infection reduced swimming capacity proportionally to parasite load, this effect was not population-specific. However, post-infection mortality was highest in naive and lowest in long associated populations, indicating evolved tolerance. No long term effects on survival, growth, condition, or reproduction were observed, suggesting fitness costs are concentrated shortly after infection. These results show that novel host parasite interactions during invasions can drive rapid adaptive change, emphasising the need to consider evolutionary dynamics in invasion management.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Although various animal models have contributed to aging research, their vasculatures poorly recapitulate human physiology. Even existing tissue-engineered blood vessels fail to mimic human vascular function and pathology, hindering translational advances in vascular aging studies. Here, we present a novel human physiological vascular model fabricated via the unique molding-induced circumferential alignment of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived vascular smooth muscle cells with luminally seeded endothelial cells. This architecture enabled dynamic vasodiameter changes in response to vasoactive stimuli, including hormones and intraluminal pressure. Using iPSCs from a patient with Werner syndrome, the model recapitulated aging-associated phenotypes, such as hypercontractility and increased vascular compliance, possibly due to impaired nitric oxide bioavailability. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed age-related dysregulation consistent with vascular senescence. As a key advantage of the vasculature, spatial transcriptomic analysis demonstrated upregulation of the aging marker CDKN1A near the lumen and downregulation of COL6A1 and TPM1 throughout the vessel. Treatment with mitochonic acid 5, a mitochondria-targeted compound, significantly reversed the aging phenotypes.

Here, we identify ferroptosis suppression as a central mechanism of BTKi resistance in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Aberrant BRG1 activity protects cells from BTKi-induced ferroptosis by restricting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and labile iron. Mechanistically, BRG1 promotes resistance through both BTK-dependent survival signaling and a BTK-independent transcriptional program. The latter is mediated by BRG1-driven induction of MEF2B, which upregulates NDUFA4L2 to inhibit mitochondrial respiration, thereby blocking mitochondria-dependent ferroptosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRG1 disrupts these programs, restoring ferroptotic sensitivity and synergizing with BTKi across resistant MCL models.

However, it remains unclear whether and when sustainable agricultural practices create win-wins or trade-offs between soil carbon sequestration and food production, and how these outcomes vary across crop types, practice combinations, and environmental conditions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 2,975 paired yield and topsoil carbon observations (and 498 subsoil carbon observations) from 487 articles to assess the simultaneous impacts of reduced tillage, cover cropping, complex crop rotations, and crop residue retention on soil organic carbon stocks and maize, wheat, rice, and soybean yields. Our analysis revealed that sustainable agricultural practices generally enhanced soil carbon and crop yields, although with considerable heterogeneity. Individual practices often resulted in management trade-offs, as different practices (and crop-practice combinations) optimized either yields or soil carbon sequestration. However, practice stacking often alleviated these trade-offs by combining complementary practices. Win-wins were most likely in marginal agricultural lands characterized by warmer temperatures, water limitation, and low nitrogen application rates - conditions that represent a substantial proportion of global agricultural land area. However, our analysis revealed that the subsoil carbon responses to sustainable agricultural practices were highly variable and may offset topsoil gains, which may limit effective policy design and large-scale implementation.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) followed by removal of cardiac Independent Components (ICs) is a powerful and widely used strategy for artifact correction. Most existing methods for automatic labeling of cardiac ICs require simultaneously recorded ECG (e.g., to compute correlation with IC time course, such as CORR algorithm). However, ECG is not always available. To address this limitation, we developed CARACAS (Cardiac Artifact Removal in Absence of CArdiac Signal), a novel tool that identifies cardiac ICs using only the IC time courses. Because cardiac ICs exhibit temporal profiles highly similar to ECG signals, we applied one of our existing function designed to detect cardiac events (PQRST) in ECG signals to each IC time course. Analysis of the detected events enabled the differentiation of cardiac ICs from non-cardiac ICs, where unrelated signal variations are incorrectly identified as cardiac events.

Flavoured milk supplemented with free peptides exhibited strong antimicrobial activity, while encapsulated peptides provided a controlled and sustained release, maintaining functionality over six days. In srikhand, both plain and mango-flavoured formulations demonstrated enhanced biofunctional properties, with encapsulated peptides showing gradual peptide release, higher antioxidant activity, and better preservation of sensory quality over 15 days.

Fermentation yielded peptide fractions (<3, <5, and <10 kDa), which were analyzed using RPHPLC and LCMS/MS, identifying over 3,100 peptides. In silico screening predicted 34 peptides with antimicrobial potential, including cationic and amphipathic alpha-helical peptides primarily derived from beta-casein and kappa-casein. Functional assays demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens, particularly in the 5 to10 kDa fractions.

Physicochemical parameters such as viscosity, water activity (Aw), pH, ash content, total soluble solids, and diastase activity were measured using standard AOAC methods. Microbiological quality was evaluated by counting aerobic mesophilic bacteria, moulds and yeasts, and by checking for pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella species.

However, there is a need for the development of user-friendly tools for large-scale data analysis, disseminating the analyzed data in a visualizable format to cancer researchers with no programming skills. We developed UALCAN, a comprehensive platform that allows users to integrate disparate data to better understand the genes, proteins, and pathways perturbed in cancer and make discoveries of potential biomarkers and targets. In the current study, we describe the development of the UALCAN Mobile application (app) that will provide cancer transcriptomic data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to evaluate protein-coding gene expression based on various stratifications, including stage, grade, race, gender, and molecular-subtypes across over 30 types of cancers. In addition, the UALCAN mobile provides data analysis options for epigenetic changes due to DNA promoter methylation and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cancer proteomic data. The app provides access to large cancer molecular datasets on the go. To find changes in the expression of causative genes and proteins and to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets, UALCAN mobile app will be extremely valuable. The UALCAN Mobile app is free to use and can be downloaded from both the iOS/Apple and the Android Play Store and has been downloaded over 100 times in each of iOS and android app stores.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Also, we propose a unified framework, STAVAG, that models spatial or temporal information to identify DVGs and TVGs. STAVAG effectively identifies biologically meaningful DVGs for uncovering prognostically relevant gene modules that align with the malignant-immune-stroma structure in the tumor microenvironment, identifying marker genes in three-dimensional brain data, and detecting 12 polarization genes regulating planarian regeneration. Furthermore, by tracking the progression of myocardial infarction and tissue development, STAVAG reveals critical TVGs that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for the ultra-acute phase of myocardial infarction. STAVAG also identifies both global and local gene modules involved in mouse placentation, as well as tissue-specific and interactive TVG modules that dynamically evolve during mouse embryonic development.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We studied its effects on associative memory in adults of distinct ages, memory retention in cognitively impaired older adults, and vocabulary learning in foreign language learners. Our results show that highly memorable images significantly enhance the recall of associated words, especially when the cue image and target word are semantically unrelated. Notably, these effects persist for at least one week and are robust across age groups and cognitive status. In a foreign language vocabulary task, pairing words with memorable images led to either improved recall accuracy or reduced learning time. These findings highlight that, in addition to being an intrinsic memory-enhancing property, image memorability also serves as a general facilitator of associative memory, via a method that is easy to adopt, requires minimal conscious effort, and can benefit the general public, particularly learners and cognitive impairment patients in educational and clinical settings.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

PZA susceptibility was assessed using BMD, MeltPro MTB/PZA assay (targeting pncA mutations), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The sensitivity, specificity, agreement rate, and Kappa value of BMD (at critical concentrations (CCs) of 100 g/mL and 200 g/mL)and MeltPro MTB/PZA assay were evaluated using WGS as the reference standard. At CCs of 100 g/mL and 200 g/mL, BMD showed resistance rates of 63.6% (70/110) and 45.5% (50/110), respectively. Compared to WGS, BMD demonstrated sensitivities of 96.1% and 92.2%, specificities of 64.4% and 94.9%, with {kappa} values of 0.590 and 0.872, respectively. The MeltPro assay detected resistance in 44.5% (53/119) of strains, with 89.7% sensitivity, 98.4% specificity, and {kappa} value of 0.882.

We investigated the combined effects of soil type (clayey and sandy loam) and sugarcane genotype (IACSP-5503 and IACSP-6007) on microbiome composition and plant transcriptional profiles. Bacterial communities from soils and stalk tissues, as well as transcriptomes of 48-hour sprouted buds grown for 10 months, were analyzed. Results showed that IACSP-5503 (adapted to low-fertility soils) and IACSP-6007 (less adapted) recruited endophytic microbiota in a soil-genotype-dependent manner. In sandy loam, IACSP-5503 promoted diverse plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) (including Burkholderia, Leifsonia, and Mycobacterium), associated with nitrogen fixation, hormone production, and stress tolerance, while IACSP-6007 displayed reduced PGPB diversity and transcriptomic signatures of nutrient deficiencies. Conversely, in clayey soil, IACSP-6007 recruited more PGPBs (such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Klebsiella) linked to nutrient acquisition and defense responses. Both genotypes exhibited enhanced expression of defense- and antioxidant-related genes in clayey soil, suggesting priming effects. Overall, our findings reveal soil-dependent, genotype-specific microbial recruitment strategies, including a potential cry for help mechanism in IACSP-5503, reflecting adaptation under nutrient-poor conditions.

Computational docking, a crucial tool for predicting the structure of protein complexes, faces significant challenges in search efficiency and scoring accuracy. Here, we introduce LieOTDock, a novel framework that leverages the mathematics of Lie groups and Optimal Transport (OT) for highly efficient protein docking pose generation. The core of our method is a data-driven surface sampling technique that identifies salient geometric features for initial pairing. These initial poses are then refined via a gradient-based optimization directly on the Lie group SE(3), the natural space of rigid-body motions. This optimization is guided by a differentiable score based on Sinkhorn-regularized Optimal Transport, which measures the geometric complementarity of surface patches. We tested LieOTDock on the 1AVW benchmark, where it successfully generated a near-native pose of 3.43 Angstrom RMSD from a 5000-candidate run in under three minutes on a consumer-grade Apple M4 Mini. Our results demonstrate that LieOTDock, by its principled use of Lie theory and OT, provides a powerful and efficient framework for generating high-quality candidate structures. This work decouples the challenge of geometric sampling from final scoring, offering a robust and modular approach to the protein docking problem, though future work is needed to integrate more physically realistic scoring functions for improved candidate ranking.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

S.; Wallington, E.; Field, K.; Choi, J.", "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is an ancient relationship formed between most plants and Glomeromycotina fungi, typically in response to phosphate (Pi) limitation in soils. By hosting these fungi in their roots, plants extend their access to essential mineral nutrients and water beyond the rhizosphere, while providing the fungus with carbon in return. This mutualistic symbiosis presents a promising tool for enhancing sustainability in agriculture, as it not only supports plant nutrition but also immunity and wider soil health. However, achieving high crop yields currently relies on supplementing plants with excess Pi, which suppresses AM symbiosis. We found that this suppression is mediated by a key negative regulator of the Pi starvation response (PSR) in rice (Oryza sativa), Phosphate overaccumulator 2 (PHO2). PHO2 encodes an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme which targets various proteins involved in the PSR in Pi-sufficient conditions for protein degradation. Here we report that pho2 mutants of rice and Nicotiana benthamiana retained high AM fungal colonisation even in high Pi conditions. Our transcriptomic analysis of uninoculated rice roots revealed that pho2 mutants are less sensitive to Pi treatment and retain susceptibility to AM symbiosis by maintaining expression of a core set of AM-related genes gating the early stage AM fungal entry, such as genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis, LysM-containing plant receptors for fungal molecules, and components of the common symbiosis signalling pathway (CSSP). Furthermore, isotope tracing using 33P and phosphate transporter (PHT1) gene expression patterns collectively suggest enhanced direct and symbiotic Pi overaccumulation in pho2 mutant leaves. Together, our data reveal a new role for PHO2, as a negative regulator of AM colonisation and symbiotic Pi accumulation in shoots.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Some A. thaliana accessions such as Van-0 show strong root responses to Pseudomonas strains, including changes in root system architecture and transcriptional reprogramming. Through a forward genetic screen using Pseudomonas isolate R569, we found that the nuo NADH dehydrogenase complex, part of the bacterial electron transport chain, contributes to the bacterial activity on Van-0 roots. Using recombinant inbred lines, we further mapped a multigenic quantitative trait locus in the host that is associated with the root responses. In Van-0, the exocyst subunit EXO70E2 positively contributes to the response, while Col-0 haplotypes of malectin-like and leucine-rich-repeat domain-containing receptor-like kinases play an inhibitory role.

Traditional mating-type identification of monokaryons relies on manual inference based on their hybridization experiments; however, the process is rather complex, time-consuming and error-prone for large-scale hybridization experiments. In this study, we developed the Mating-Type Imputation (MTI) software for automatic, rapid and accurate monokaryon mating-type inference for tetrapolar fungi using a combinatorial pruning traversal algorithm. Taking the compatibility matrix from 435 hybridization experiments of 30 Flammulina velutipes monokaryons as an example, MTI takes a few minutes to infer the accurate mating-types of all monokaryons, which might take several days for manual inference by experienced investigators. Furthermore, MTI enables us to investigate how false-positives and false-negatives influence mating-type inference results. Using simulated compatibility matrix, we found that MTI could accurately detect potential false-negatives in compatibility and successfully infer the true mating-type combination with limited false-negatives, but the tool could be misled by any false-positives to result in a wrong mating-type combination, indicating that false-positives records in hybridization experiments should be strictly obviated for mating-type inferences. In summary, MTI provides an efficient tool for mating-type inference of tetrapolar fungi, offering technical support for the research paradigm in mating-type studies of edible and medicinal fungi and holding significant theoretical value and broad application prospects in the fields of fungal genetic diversity and breeding studies.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

While several studies have analyzed the transcriptome of the salivary gland at the bulk and single-cell level, no spatial transcriptomic analyses of this tissue have been published. Most of the existing publications on SGACC have predominantly relied on bulk and single cell RNA sequencing approaches, which do not resolve the spatially localized transcriptional heterogeneity nor have the resolution for defining molecular markers within tumor subpopulations. SGACC is clinically notable for the presence of multiple tumor clones, distinct spatial phenotypes, and its indolent yet invasive nature coupled with a high propensity for distant metastasis. These features may reflect co-expression of tumor-associated markers across diverse cellular niches, and a resultant biological complexity which causes standard treatment such as surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy to be largely ineffective in significantly improving long-term survival, and highlights the need for more precise, targeted therapeutic strategies. Herein, we analyzed single cell (n = 4) and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics samples (n = 5) to characterize cancer cell populations in MYB- and non-MYB-expressing cell states, delineated gene expression signatures, and identified critical molecular interactions specific to SGACC. We used Visum HD to obtain spatial transcriptomics data at 2 micrometer squared high resolution. This allowed a multi-omics approach comprising single cell and spatial transcriptomic methods to enable the discovery of novel transcriptional signatures and microenvironmental features not captured by conventional methods. Spatial mapping revealed marked cellular heterogeneity and demonstrated how tissue environments influence cellular transcriptomics. To tumor heterogeneity, we focused on tumorigenic cell populations, profiled plasma and T cell enrichment within the tumor microenvironment and identified key pathways and transcriptional drivers including the MYB-NFIB fusion underlying the tumor cluster formation. Our findings indicate an upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, autophagy, and reactive stromal cell populations. We further found evidence of partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (P-EMT) programming within MYB-expressing tumor clusters. Pathway analysis revealed that mutations in the spatial query sample prominently affect the PI3K-AKT and IL-17 signaling pathways, together with a downregulation of canonical Wnt signaling in some regions of the tissue architecture adjacent to immune cells.

Mice exposed to periodic reductions in FIO2 model arterial desaturations observed in humans and recapitulate many comorbidities of sleep apnea. Here, we perform a detailed characterization and confirm reports that mice in room air experience spontaneous, periodic desaturation events. We measured peripheral oxygen saturation in the four mouse strains most commonly used in intermittent hypoxia research (C57BL/6J, CD1, BALB/c, and 129S1) and subjected them to conscious barometric plethysmography to measure oxygen desaturations and apneas simultaneously and took measurements across a range of fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2). As expected, all strains experienced periodic apneas that were followed by desaturations and decreasing FIO2 resulted in a reduction of spontaneous apneic events (p = 0.001). Surprisingly, most oxygen desaturations were not preceded by apneas or hypopneas, and mice experienced more desaturations at lower FIO2 (p < 0.001), despite less frequent apneas. Furthermore, we found strain differences in ventilatory response consistent with prior findings and a novel strain difference in 129S1 mice. These data suggest that spontaneous desaturations are caused not only by apneas and hypopneas but also by other mechanisms, independent of respiration.

Within this mechanism, the regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis by nitrate signaling via NIN-like protein 7 as well as the loading of tZ-type cytokinins into xylem by ATP-binding cassette transporter G14 have been well studied. However, the roles of other components remain unclear. Here, we show that cytokinin perception and degradation in roots, as mediated by Arabidopsis histidine kinase 3 (AHK3) and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 4 (CKX4), modulate root-to-shoot transport of tZ-type cytokinins. Grafting experiments demonstrated that root-specific AHK3 deficiency systemically increased leaf blade area through long-distance signals of root-derived tZ-type cytokinin, perceived by shoot-expressed AHK3. Transcriptome, hormonome, and reporter analyses revealed that root-specific AHK3 deficiency reduced CKX4 expression in roots, elevating tZ-type cytokinin levels in roots and xylem sap and thereby enhancing leaf cytokinin response. Transfer experiments manipulating root nitrate levels showed that root-specific AHK3 deficiency promoted leaf blade area in a manner dependent on both nitrate and root-derived tZ-type cytokinin signaling. Moreover, both nitrate signals and root-expressed AHK3 are required for maximal CKX4 induction in roots, and root-specific CKX4 deficiency enhanced leaf blade area in a nitrate-dependent manner. These findings reveal a novel mechanism in which an AHK3-CKX4 module governs root-to-shoot transport of tZ-type cytokinins, fine-tuning leaf size according to nitrogen availability in roots.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

In vascular plants, transcriptional adaptive responses to hypoxia are rapidly mounted by Ethylene Response Factors VII (ERFVIIs), regulated by Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs) through the cysteine branch of the N-degron pathway (Cys-NDP) for oxygen sensing. However, this relatively simple regulatory circuit, consisting of both constitutively expressed as well as hypoxia-inducible ERFVIIs and PCOs, interacts with diverse signalling cues and pathways invoked by hypoxia. To understand the share of the PCO-mediated oxygen sensing mechanism in the production of hypoxia responses, we insulated the PCO/ERFVII circuit from Arabidopsis thaliana and adapted it to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a reporter gene to monitor the output of the circuit allowed us to compare the speed and amplitude of response to hypoxia in the engineered yeast and the source organism. Hypoxia triggered ERFVII stabilization both in Arabidopsis and yeast, leading to a similarly fast transcriptional response that was however larger in plants. A simple hypoxia-inducible feedback loop improved the amplitude of response in yeast, demonstrating the importance of this regulation in the endogenous PCO/ERFVII circuit. Finally, computational modelling of the yeast circuit enabled us to identify promoter competition and presence of hypoxia-inducible PCOs as key parameters that shape early hypoxia responses in plant cells.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Martins, N.", "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is causing the decline of seaweed forests in many parts of the world. Despite successful preservation efforts, their immense biodiversity is still severely underrepresented in germplasm biobanks throughout the world. These culture libraries can preserve genetic diversity and provide inoculum for marine forest restoration and mariculture ventures, and potentially accelerate the selection and breeding of climate-resilient and high-yielding strains. However, the complex life cycles and body plans of seaweeds pose a huge challenge for the development of standardized phenotyping and isolating protocols for microscopic stages, especially with the efficiency necessary to deal with the current pace of global climatic changes. Here, we present SAMMBA (Seaweed Automatable Microplate Microscopy for Breeding Approaches), an end-to-end pipeline for the high-throughput isolation, phenotyping and storage of macroalgal cells in 384-well plates (384WP). By optimizing fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis, along with a novel fragmentation method and dilution-to-extinction isolation, different unialgal seaweed tissues could be regrown after thousand-fold dilutions. In a single plate, we successfully isolated 68 singlet gametophyte fragments of Laminaria ochroleuca (39 males, 29 females; 17.7% efficiency) and 60 spores of Phyllariopsis purpurascens (12.1% efficiency). Furthermore, the taxonomic versatility of SAMMBA was demonstrated through the successful isolation of 60 unialgal cultures of red algae (Halymenia sp., Hydrolithon sp., Erythrotrichia sp.) and 10 strains of the green alga Ulva sp, without cross-contamination. The viability and unialgal nature of the isolated strains were verified by distributing a single L. ochroleuca strain across an entire 384-well plate and imaging each well over 30 days. We found that the average specific daily growth rates (daily SGR) per well were 0.130 {+/-} 0.006 and 0.117 {+/-} 0.01 day-1 for males and females, respectively, showing a significant difference between sexes (n = 768; p = 1.27e-53), while edge effects significantly reduced daily SGR in males but not in females. This approach dramatically increases experimental reproducibility and statistical power compared to conventional methods. Due to its modular design and cost-effectiveness, SAMMBA is readily adaptable to macroalgal repositories globally. It supports high-throughput, selective recovery of unialgal strains without reliance on robotic platforms, while remaining fully compatible with automation. This system significantly expands the experimental and operational capacity in macroalgal hatcheries, providing a scalable foundation for phenomics, domestication programs, and standardized, verifiable biobanking of unialgal strains. Ultimately, SAMMBA could provide critical support for breeding strategies required to ensure the resilience of marine forests and aquaculture in a rapidly changing ocean.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Inflammatory CD11c+T-bet+ B cells (ABCs) increase in spleen and adipose tissue during obesity and exacerbate metabolic dysfunction via antibodies. We now find that during obesity Tbet+ B cells also expand in the liver but not omentum or mesenteric fat. Obese mice also develop increased splenic CXCR5+ TFH and hepatic CXCR5- TPH cells which serve as likely partners for antigen-experienced MHC-II+ ABCs. We also observed that antibodies in obese mice, previously found to contribute to metabolic disease, largely circulate as inflammatory autoantigen-bound immune complexes. Perhaps most striking was our observation that obese mice lacking T-bet in B cells develop increased autoantibody titers and expanded splenic germinal center (GC) B and T helper cells. T-bet+ B cell-deficient mice make a similarly enhanced GC, TFH, TPH response to haptenated-protein vaccination with a corresponding increase in antibody affinity, although there is no additive effect of obesity. These results are consistent with GC inhibition by expanded ABCs demonstrated by others to occur during autoimmunity, suggesting a broadly universal mechanism which may also explain reduced humoral immunity and poor clinical outcomes following infection in patients with obesity and other forms of chronic inflammation.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

G.; Swope, S.

However, population genetic structure could also be present in species with highly restricted global distributions, such as habitat specialists with threatened or vulnerable conservation status. For these organisms, low dispersal distances coupled with fine-scale environmental heterogeneity could influence population genetic composition, potentially creating spatial genetic structure and genotype by environment associations. Here we use the serpentine endemic plant Calochortus tiburonensis, with a global distribution of 160 ha, to evaluate whether fine-scale structure in soil composition and low seed dispersal distances result in the development of population genetic structure. We paired soil elemental analysis with a RAD-seq SNP dataset for 24 C. tiburonensis individuals. Although no population structure was detected between C. tiburonensis sampling locations, multiple analyses identified associations between soil composition and genetic distance between individuals. This included associations with nickel and magnesium, two elements that were expected a priori to impact plant fitness in serpentine landscapes. However, redundancy analyses and a generalized dissimilarity model both suggest that total soil variation better explains differences in genetic composition between individuals, suggesting that the holistic soil environment has a role in matching plant genotypes to the appropriate microenvironment. Our results suggest that fine-scale environmental heterogeneity influences genetic differences between individuals in plant populations, even in the absence of population genetic structure. Additionally, these associations between genetic composition and fine-scale environmental heterogeneity indicate a potentially essential mechanism for preserving genetic variation on small spatial scales, as within range-limited species.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Using an unbiased approach, we identify the epithelial transcription factor grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) as a key co-regulator of PR activity in hormone responsive breast cancer cells. We show that GRHL2 interacts with PR in a progesterone-independent manner. Upon progesterone stimulation, GRHL2 and PR are both recruited to distal enhancer elements of target genes. Furthermore, GRHL2- and PR-bound elements connect spatially through chromatin looping to regulate shared targets.

With recent breakthroughs in AI modelling, these data have significantly enhanced our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying human behaviors and diseases [4-6]. However, the replicability of associations between plasma proteomics and phenotypes remains underexplored. Here, we systematically assessed the replicability of associations with recent plasma proteomics data in the UK biobank. Over 75% of cognitive function and mental health traits demonstrated high overall (proteomics-wide) replicability when brain-related traits were considered as phenotypes. Although mean cortical thickness (CT) as phenotype exhibited clearly reduced replicability, total cortical surface area (CSA) and cortical volume (CV) showed high overall replicability across hemispheres and over twenty brain regions. In comparative multi-omics analyses based on the same cohort of participants, proteomics outperformed genomics across all brain-related traits, and exceeded metabolomics for over half of traits where metabolomics also exhibited high overall replicability. Furthermore, we developed a predictive framework to estimate the replicability for potential future proteomics panels based on the crucial influential factors including dilution level, proportion of samples below the limit of detection (LOD), and sample size. Moreover, we constructed an individual replicability index for proteins and identified eleven proteins with highly replicable associations across cognitive function and mental health traits, which was in line with the recent identifications of pleiotropic proteins in large-scale population studies. Collectively, our results revealed the challenges in the association replicability of plasma proteomics under reduced data quality (from \"Explore\" to \"Expansion\" assay panels), and we further explored how to sustain high replicability in potential future panels.

The role of sEV-associated MT1-MMP in ECM degradation and the mechanisms supporting MT1-MMP loading into sEV are unknown. We previously established that the syntenin PDZ protein, in association with the syndecan (SDC), is essential for sEV from endosomal origin biogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that syntenin contributes to ECM degradation via invadopodia in MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, whereas SDC limit it. Moreover, we identify that syntenin colocalizes with MT1-MMP in late endosomes and directly interacts with MT1-MMP. Furthermore, we decipher that both syntenin and SDC are essential for the specific loading of MT1-MMP into sEV. Additionally, we show that sEV-mediated ECM degradation depends on MT1-MMP activity and syntenin.

A.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle loss in pancreatic cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for patients. In order to understand myocytes changes we examined myonuclei- and myofiber-specific dynamics during pancreatic cancer cachexia progression. Single-nucleus RNA-seq was used to interrogate myonuclear gene expression, and RNAscope and immunofluorescence characterized myofiber-specific changes. Bulk RNA-seq of skeletal muscle provided a whole-muscle transcriptomic profile. Cachexia induces a progressive loss of muscle differentiation factor Maf and its target Myh4, accompanied by increased expression of Myh1 and Myh2. This myofiber dedifferentiation occurs without evidence for fiber type shifting, regeneration, or proliferation. Single-nuclei analysis reveals global shifts in myofiber gene expression identity including the identification of a cachexia only myonuclear subpopulation. Cachexia gene expression was not restricted solely to this PDAC-specific myonuclear subpopulation and did not overlap with Myh1 and Myh2 expressing myonuclei early in cachexia. Altogether, PDAC cachexia elicits distinct transcriptional responses across different myonuclear populations. These results reveal population-specific heterogeneity in cachexia gene activation, rather than a uniform upregulation of cachexia mediators across muscle tissue. Our data suggest that myonuclei fate occurs prior to overt muscle wasting when cachexia gene expression only modestly overlaps with differentiation factors, with a strong association after irreversible muscle wasting. These findings explain the challenge of effectively targeting skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia requires addressing the changing cell population induced through non overlapping mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Although the formation of feeding organs within the roots is essential for successful sedentary parasitism, the molecular mechanisms underlying their development are poorly understood. This is partly because these organs originate from a limited number of root cells, making difficult to capture the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs during the early stages of the infection. Here, we first developed a comparative host-pathogen framework to study the nematode infection process in Arabidopsis and rice. Using a cross-species single-cell transcriptomics approach, we identified a unique molecular signature in infected root cells and show that the cellular reprogramming during these early stages is highly conserved across both host-pathogen interactions. This transcriptional cell reprogramming is associated with stemness acquisition related to de novo organogenesis process. By cell-type specific gene regulatory network analysis, we identified AtATHB2/OsHOX28 as an evolutionary conserved and key regulator of the nematode infection process. Loss-of-function of this regulator in both species results in nematode resistance without affecting root growth.

This study investigated the chemical composition of cannabis smoke generated from three strains when consumed via joints and bongs, with a focus on whether bong water effectively filters harmful compounds. Smoke samples were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). Across all samples, the smoke composition between bong and joint methods was largely consistent, with no compounds between 5 and 350 g/mol found to be completely removed by bong water. Several compounds were detected in all or nearly all samples, including {beta}-cis-Caryophyllene, phenol, p-cresol, and naphthalene, representing substances with potentially beneficial, harmful, unclear, or benign effects. Notably, {beta}-cis-Caryophyllene was consistently present in the highest quantities, suggesting possible physiological importance despite limited research compared to THC and CBD. Methodological limitations, including sample size, smoke loss during collection, and GCMS inability to detect larger particles, aerosols, and metal ions, restricted definitive conclusions regarding bong filtration effectiveness.

While extensive animal research has elucidated compartment-specific contributions to reward, learning and motor control, direct evidence for compartment specialization in humans is lacking. Methods: We defined human striatal voxels as striosome-like or matrix-like based on biases in structural (diffusion) connectivity. Then we investigated functional activation patterns in those compartment-like voxels using task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) during pre-movement cue and five motor conditions (left/right hand, left/right foot, and tongue movements). Results: Functional activation was strikingly segregated: striosome-like voxels were preferentially engaged during the cue phase, while matrix-like voxels dominated activation during motor execution, especially for tongue and foot movement. Motor tasks elicited robust bilateral activation, with contralateral activation dominating during limb movements. Activation was more lateralized in matrix-like than in striosome-like voxels. Both striosome-like and matrix-like voxels exhibited strong activation at the onset of task execution (e.g., within the first few seconds post-cue). However, activation in matrix-like voxels declined modestly over the course of the movement phase, while striosomal activation dropped sharply at task termination, suggesting a role in behavioral transitions. These findings are consistent with the role of the striosome in anticipatory evaluation and dopaminergic modulation, and matrix specialization for executing automatized routines.

While the olfactory system plays a critical role in guiding maternal behaviors such as pup retrieval and nesting, how olfactory processing itself is reshaped during motherhood remains poorly understood.

Using odor preference assays combined with liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, we identify specific volatile compounds in pup urine that may contribute to this maternal attraction. Disruption of olfactory input or restriction of contact chemosensation abolished the preference, indicating that both volatile and nonvolatile sensory modalities contribute, likely through combined input from the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and vomeronasal organ (VNO). Notably, this preference is absent in late-pregnant females, in mothers separated from pups at birth, and in virgins co-housed with pups or exposed to pup urine- highlighting that pup urine preference depends on the convergence of internal hormonal signals and external chemosensory cues.

These state-transition rules are then integrated into simulations of population dynamics. After the cell population is advanced by a timestep, the cell states are adjusted according to the new neighborhoods, using the fact that cell state transitions, which take hours, are typically much more rapid than cell population changes on the scale of weeks, and can thus be considered at quasi-steady-state. Applying OSDR2.0 to spatial proteomics data from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we find that cell state is strongly associated with local microenvironment composition. Incorporating state transitions significantly improves the ability to predict treatment response - OSDR2.0 accurately separates responders from nonresponders to chemotherapy and immunotherapy based on early post-treatment biopsies, outperforming OSDR1.0 that does not include cell state transitions. This work highlights the importance of cell state plasticity in shaping tumor response and opens a way to infer both population dynamics and cell state transitions from static clinical samples.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Among these, polyaneuploid cancer cells (PACCs), which arise via endoreplication under stressors such as hypoxia, are implicated as metastatic drivers, but how they acquire this potential is poorly understood. Here, we show that prostate cancer-derived PACCs exhibit features predictive of invasion and intravasation. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and single-cell tracking under hypoxia revealed that PACCs migrated significantly farther than Non-PACCs, consistent with local invasion. PACC trajectories showed a strong tendency to migrate toward oxygen, consistent with aerotaxis and predictive of intravasation. siRNA-mediated knockdown demonstrated that the enhanced motility and aerotaxis of hypoxic PACCs require both HIF-1 and RhoA, with RhoA expression suppressed upon HIF-1 inhibition. Altogether, we propose a HIF-1 [-&gt;] RhoA [-&gt;] motility/aerotaxis mechanism enabling PACCs to escape hypoxic cores, invade tissue, and access vasculature, highlighting them as a uniquely invasive subpopulation with implications for anti-metastatic therapies.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a hybrid computational model, implemented in PhysiCell, that integrates a discrete agent-based cell model with a continuous representation of the chemical microenvironment and ECM microstructure.

The balance between the two is quantified by the mutation load: the reduction in mean population fitness due to deleterious mutations. In large well-mixed populations, selection dominates, and the mutation load is proportional to the mutation probability per reproduction event. However, the role of spatial structure in shaping mutation-selection dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we use evolutionary graph theory to show that heterogeneous spatial structures generically amplify the effect of mutation relative to selection. In contrast to well-mixed populations, the mutation load in heterogeneous structures can remain substantial even when the mutation rate is very small, signaling a breakdown of selection. For example, in star-shaped populations the mutation rate is effectively amplified by a factor proportional to the population size. When mutation is coupled to reproduction, this leads to the proliferation of less-fit types over fitter ones, a scenario of \"survival of the weakest\". The reduction of natural selection may help explain, for example, tumour heterogeneity in spatially structured tissues. It also suggests that heterogeneous social networks can promote the persistence of unpopular opinions, thereby fostering diversity. By showing how spatial structure modulates the effect of selection, our work points to potentially new ways of steering evolution toward desired outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Studies in higher cells suggest that these aggregates of TDP-43 and FUS sequester polysomes by binding RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1), a ribosomal protein, thereby inhibiting global translation and contributing to toxicity. But RACK1 is also a scaffold protein with many other roles including a role in autophagy. Using yeast we find that deletion of the RACK1 ortholog, ASC1, reduces TDP-43 toxicity, but not FUS toxicity. TDP-43 foci remain liquid like in the presence asc1{Delta} but they become smaller. This is consistent with the findings in cell culture. However, using double label tags we establish that ASC1 does not co-localize with TDP-43 foci, arguing against the sequestration hypothesis. Instead, ASC1 appears to influence toxicity through autophagy. We previously showed that expression of TDP-43 inhibits autophagy and TOROID (TORC1 Organized in Inhibited Domains) formation and that modifiers that rescue yeast from TDP-43 toxicity reverse these inhibitions. Here we show that FUS does not inhibit autophagy. This autophagy enhanced by asc1{Delta} is non-canonical, marked by reduced TOROID formation, and effectively counteracts the autophagy inhibition caused by TDP-43. Our findings suggest that ASC1 influences TDP-43 toxicity through autophagy regulation rather than polysome sequestration, highlighting autophagy as a key therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Apical-basal polarity is established by cortical polarity proteins that define the apical, junctional, and basolateral domains. While cortical polarity proteins are highly conserved and present in most epithelia, the mechanisms that establish polarity and the requirements for canonical polarity factors can vary between tissues and organisms. For example, the basolateral polarity protein lethal giant larvae (Lgl) is essential for the polarization of most Drosophila epithelia, yet is dispensable for epithelial polarization and viability in C. elegans. To better understand the epithelial polarity program in C. elegans, we performed a whole-genome RNAi screen for synthetic lethality with an lgl-1 deletion mutant. We found that combined loss of LGL-1 and the RhoGAP protein PAC-1 (RhoGAP19D in flies) leads to embryonic lethality due to defects in elongation and rupturing of the epidermis. We observed mislocalization of junctional proteins to the lateral domain of epidermal cells, presumably weakening tissue integrity. Furthermore, we observed expansion of the apical domain, sporadic aPKC mislocalization, and localization of the basolateral polarity protein LET-413Scribble in patches surrounded by DLG-1Discs large. These observations indicate that the combined loss of LGL-1 and PAC-1 leads to an overactivity of apical domain specifying factors. Consistent with this, partial inactivation of the apical polarity regulators aPKC or CDC-42 reduced the lethality of pac-1(RNAi); lgl-1(null) animals. Taken together, our findings identify pac-1 and lgl-1 as redundant inhibitors of apical polarity factors.

While the molecular decisions that guide CNCCs toward ectomesenchymal identity remain incompletely understood, the transcription factor Twist1 plays a central role. Here, we investigate the regulation of Twist1 expression in CNCCs and find that Twist1 is expressed by late migratory ectomesenchymal CNCCs in Gallus gallus and Danio rerio embryos. Using Hi-ChIP, ATAC-seq, and CUT&RUN sequencing data, we identify a distal enhancer for Twist1 within the Hdac9 locus that is active in the neural tube and CNCCs. Notably, this enhancer is directly bound by TFAP2 transcription factors and is active in pre-migratory CNCCs, a stage when Twist1 transcripts are not detectable in CNCCs. We reconcile this temporal discrepancy by showing that the Twist1 3' UTR of multiple vertebrate species (but not the non-vertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis) is sufficient to destabilize GFP transcripts in the neural tube and surface ectoderm. Together, these findings reveal a vertebrate-specific, two-tiered regulatory mechanism that uncouples enhancer activity from transcript accumulation, gating the onset of Twist1 expression in CNCCs and the acquisition of ectomesenchymal identity in vertebrate CNCCs.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Myoelectric control uses electromyography (EMG) signals for muscle-machine interfacing with applications in prostheses, augmented/virtual reality, and consumer electronics. However, factors such as changes in the limb's position during activities of daily living reduce the controller's reliability. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that reduce this limb position effect to increase the widespread adoption of these technologies. Approach. We developed an open-source device to standardise myoelectric control experiments. The device has sixteen locations for automatically positioning the participant's arms to perform hand gestures or grasp objects, with lights and sensors for guidance and timekeeping. We used this device to collect data from eighteen healthy participants in a five-session study under three modalities: performing five hand gestures with a static or dynamic limb and moving three objects. We recorded forearm electromyography and kinematics of the upper limb and trained a linear discriminant analysis model to assess the classifier's accuracy across different modalities and arm positions. Main results. The classifier's accuracy with a static limb was decreased when tested on untrained positions, confirming the limb position effect. More training positions improved accuracy, with four optimally balancing the training burden and classifier accuracy. Classifiers trained with data from dynamic movements outperformed when tested on dynamic data. Furthermore, adding kinematic data to the classifier increased accuracy yet significantly reduced learning rates. However, training with a dynamic limb improved this learning rate. Significance. The limb position effect can be countered by training with multiple positions and including kinematic data. Classifiers with EMG and kinematic data should be trained using a dynamic limb to achieve high accuracy with reasonable amounts of training data.

Similar to bacterial cells that transiently tolerate antibiotics, cancer cells surviving therapy can increase their mutation rate, enhancing the likelihood of acquiring resistance-conferring mutations and evolving into resistant cells. This adaptive mutability has been linked to transcriptional reprogramming of DNA damage repair mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies to target such mechanisms are currently lacking. Here we show that translational control mediates the adaptive mutability of melanoma drug-tolerant cells by regulating the translation of the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) component 53BP1. The specific inhibition of 5 prime-UTR-driven 53BP1 mRNA translation was sufficient to impair NHEJ and mutability. We found that the eIF4A RNA helicase, a key component of the eIF4F translation complex, regulates 53BP1 mRNA translation. Consequently, targeting the eIF4A with two small molecule inhibitors significantly delays the acquisition of resistance to combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi/MEKi) in BRAFV600-mutant melanoma xenograft models and cell lines by reducing the mutability of drug-tolerant cells.

We find that many cell types exhibit looping structures in PCA and UMAP space that correspond to transcriptional oscillations at each larval stage. Oscillatory gene expression is found in all cuticle-producing cell types, including glia, but not detected in neurons or muscle. We develop rigorous statistical approaches for de novo identification of oscillatory genes and cell types, yielding >5,000 genes. While many oscillatory genes relate to cuticle production, each cell type expresses largely distinct genes, suggesting that cuticle production is a patchwork of cell-type-specific programs. Finally, we derive a potential set of regulatory transcription factors that can explain coordinated oscillatory gene expression and find that shared upstream factors likely control gene timing across cell types.

In response, Escherichia coli adapts its phenotype to minimize mortality, which is followed by beneficial mutations. Most genome-wide transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling the adaptations remain unidentified. We studied the genome-wide, time-resolved, transcriptional program of susceptible E. coli cells under non-lethal rifampicin stress. Dynamically, the transcriptome widely diverged from the control, but later partially realigned. The mechanisms were changes in RNAP and Gyrase levels, promoter sequences, transcription factor network, intergenic distance, sensitivity to DNA supercoiling buildup, {sigma} factor specificity, (p)ppGpp, and a few global regulators. These results show that the genome-wide response dynamics to rifampicin is influenced by the structure of the gene regulatory network. Next, we compared the evolutionarily distant pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In both species, adjacent genes on the DNA exhibited similar response strengths. Also, the response strengths of orthologous genes were correlated, suggesting that both species implement similar (likely beneficial) phenotypic adaptations. In support, E. coli orthologs were enriched in the mechanisms identified as influential. Overall, E. coli, and likely other bacteria, have mechanisms influencing specific gene cohort responses to non-lethal rifampicin stress, which likely enhances survivability, thus facilitating the emergence of resistance.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin through a repeating unit known as the nucleosome. In this chromatin environment, DNA is constantly exposed to several sources of DNA damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG). 8oxoG can base pair with cytosine (8oxoG:C) or form a mutagenic base pair with adenine (8oxoG:A), which can lead to single base transversions if left unrepaired. To date, the structure and dynamics of these two possible 8oxoG base pairs in the nucleosome remain unclear. Furthermore, whether MutY homologue (MUTYH) excises 8oxoG:A base pairs in the nucleosome remains elusive. Here using a combination of cryogenic-electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemistry we determined the structure and dynamics of 8oxoG:C and 8oxoG:A base pairs in the nucleosome and characterize MUTYH activity in nucleosomal DNA. We found that nucleosomal 8oxoG:C forms a stable base pair using its anti conformation, while nucleosomal 8oxoG:A forms a more dynamic base pair using its syn conformation that is unable to be processed by MUTYH. This work provides fundamental insight into the accommodation of oxidative damage in the nucleosome and how this damage contributes to increased mutagenic transversions in nucleosomal compared to linker DNA.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

L.; Guei, J.; Chapman, M. P.; Brothers, P. N.; Desai, S.", "abstract": "The single-stranded DNA binding protein of bacteriophage T4, gp32, has important roles in replication, recombination, and repair. gp32 possesses three domains: the central (core) domain which contains the binding trough for single-stranded DNA, the N-terminal domain, which interacts with the core domain of an adjacent ssDNA-bound protein, bringing about binding cooperativity, and the C-terminal domain, which interacts with other proteins involved in replication, recombination, and repair. The essential residues within the N-domain for the association with the adjacent DNA bound gp32, Lys-Arg-Lys-Ser-Thr, the \"LAST Motif\", is almost identical to the ssDNA-interactive residues within the core domain binding trough, and was the basis of a model in which a \"closed\" {rightleftarrows} \"open\" conformational change within core domain controls DNA binding. In this study, we show that alteration of the core domain LASTsequence, while maintaining its composition, can have an effect on the binding parameters, and may be the result of a shift in the closed-open equilibrium. Additionally, utilizing a gp32 truncated at residue 227, as well as amino acid substituted variants, we have further localized the residues within the core domain responsible for the protein-protein association leading to cooperative ssDNA binding. Truncation leads to an increase in the non-cooperative affinity for single-stranded nucleic acids, which can be explained by the absence of a closed conformation in this variant. The truncated protein forms a tight complex with core domain on a 12-residue oligonucleotide, a potential candidate for further structural study.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we inserted microRNA target sites (MTS) for miR-122 or miR-142 at various positions of the poly(A) tail of synthesized luciferase reporter mRNA. These modifications significantly reduced luciferase expression in non-target tissues in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating position-dependent selective expression control. Furthermore, by incorporating triple-MTS sequences for miR-142, miR-126, and miR-148a in all possible combinations at the 5' end of the poly(A) tail, we identified triple-MTS arrangements that simultaneously decrease luciferase activities in three non-target hepatic cell types, while preserving robust expression in hepatocytes. The results highlighted the importance of MTS insertion order for optimal mRNA silencing. These triple-MTS modules significantly expanded the utility of single miRNA-responsive elements, enabling cell-type selective regulation for mRNA therapeutics.

Structural differences between protein conformations are quantified by comparing the organization of loop structures within their cross-link networks. Validation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in native and denatured states shows that at least 500 cross-links requiring 5-10 replicate measurements are needed for reliable detection of structural divergence. Leave-one-out analysis confirms that structural transitions are global, highlighting the importance of comprehensive cross-link datasets. The coverage of unique cross-links was evaluated using accumulation curves from randomized permutations.

While these functions are well established, its role in protein homeostasis, another energy-intensive process, has remained unclear. Here, we performed multi-omics analyses in wild-type and PPAR knockout mice treated with the PPAR agonist fenofibrate to define its broader role in proteostasis. Interestingly, chronic PPAR activation suppressed hepatic secretory pathways, reducing secretome gene expression and circulating serum proteins, and downregulated genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation, glycosylation, folding, and trafficking. Concurrently, PPAR activation enhanced proteasome activity, which was associated with selective induction of proteasome 26S subunit non-ATPase (PSMD) family members. In addition, hepatic protein synthesis was strongly attenuated. This was associated with an increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), that in turn was linked to disrupted iron homeostasis. Together, these findings identify PPAR as a regulator of proteostasis, suppressing protein synthesis and secretion while promoting protein degradation pathways. Beyond its canonical role in lipid and glucose metabolism, we conclude that PPAR exerts an additional energy-conserving function by coordinating proteostasis, expanding our understanding of its systemic metabolic role.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Methods: A total of 56 non-repetitive isolates of E. coli from in or out patients of UTI were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Screening for the production of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamases (ESBL) was determined in third generation Cephalosporins resistant isolates by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) E-strip, followed by phenotypic confirmation by DDST, CDST and ESBL E-strip method. Further confirmation was done by molecular method, PCR was carried out for detection of bla-CTX-M, bla-TEM and bla-SHV.

In this study, we sought to determine whether geographic and phylogenetic distance constrains HGT within and between bacterial species. To address this question, we isolated strains (n = 17) of two closely related bacterial species, Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces pratensis from two ecologically similar sites. We identified homologous recombination events within the core genomes of these species (557 recent and 457 ancient) and determined that patterns of recombination were constrained primarily by phylogeny rather than geography. Notably, shell accessory genes were over three times more likely to be shared between the same species than with non-related geographical neighbors. The richness of secondary metabolite gene clusters is highly variable with an average of 35 - 55 clusters per genome, depending on clade membership. The majority of secondary metabolite gene clusters (60%) are found in all strains, indicating that they were present in the most recent common ancestor of S. griseus and pratensis. We conclude that most HGT in the core and accessory genome is phylogenetically constrained, while HGT of shell genes is more likely constrained by geography. This outcome indicates that the predominant mechanisms of HGT favor high phylogenetic relatedness, and that rapid gene acquisition and loss in the accessory genome could aid with adaptation to contemporary environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA and its associated complex members are recruited to HPV replication factories during the late phase of the HPV life cycle. HIRA is also recruited to HPV replication factories generated by amplification of a replicon with a minimal origin and expression of the viral replication proteins E1 and E2, demonstrating that the E1 and E2 proteins are sufficient for HIRA recruitment. Downregulation of HIRA expression reduces HPV31 DNA amplification and viral transcription in differentiated keratinocytes. Histone H3.3 that is highly phosphorylated on serine residue 31 is also enriched at sites of HPV replication and this modification links the DNA damage response to chromatin that supports rapid gene activation. We propose that deposition of histone H3.3 generates viral minichromosomes that are highly primed to support the late stages of the HPV life cycle.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

However, our understanding of these interactions in field conditions and at strain-resolution remains limited. This hinders the development of effective biocontrol applications, as laboratory findings often fail to translate to field settings due to insufficient insights into in situ interaction network structures. This study addresses this limitation by employing taxon-specific high-resolution amplicons to resolve a cross-kingdom co-occurrence network within the wheat phyllosphere microbiome. We performed in-depth monitoring of strains from the hub genus Pseudomonas, revealing a high degree of strain-specificity of Pseudomonas interactions both within and across kingdoms. Through negative interaction modelling, we identified a consortium of ten biocontrol taxa with the potential to suppress seven fungal pathogens in field conditions. Additional stabilizer strains were found to likely enhance persistence. We validated the strain-specific interactions of Pseudomonas with the major fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using co-inoculation experiments with genotypes retrieved from the same field. Consistent with our prediction, we identified a P. poae isolate as the most antagonistic towards the pathogen both in vitro and in planta. Our study demonstrates that taxon-specific high-resolution network inference can effectively map microbial interaction networks and predict strain-specific interaction patterns of biocontrol genotypes with high persistence under field conditions.

While recent models emphasize the importance of mechanical cues in establishing body axis symmetry in Hydra tissue spheres, the precise role of the Wnt pathway, known to be central to axial patterning, in regulating tissue mechanics and cytoskeletal organization remains unclear. In this paper, we pharmacologically modulated the canonical Wnt pathway using Alsterpaullone and iCRT14 and assessed their effects on regeneration, tissue rheology, and actin organization in Hydra tissue spheres. We found that Wnt activation prevents full regeneration, softens the constitutive tissues, disrupts osmotic oscillations, leads to an accumulation of dense actin filaments but impairs their orientational order. Conversely, we found that Wnt inhibition partially impairs regeneration and reduces actin filament presence while preserving alignment. Using micro-aspiration and time-lapse imaging, we characterized the changes in the nonlinear elasticity and osmotic oscillations under both conditions. These results support and unify two existing mechano-chemical models of Hydra patterning, suggesting that Wnt-driven feedbacks on both tissue stiffness and actin order contribute to the robust emergence of body axes.

These disruptions have weakened traditional seed systems and potentially damaged local crop diversity. In this context, to strengthen the country's food security and climate change adaptation of smallholder farmers, there is an urgent need to revive agricultural research and breeding programs for the main food crops grown in the country. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is the most important food crop after maize and sorghum in Somalia, providing inexpensive protein for humans and biologically fixed nitrogen for low-input crop production systems in the country. This study assessed the current status of cowpea production, identified breeding priorities across three agroecological zones in southern Somalia, and established a core germplasm collection for future breeding programs. Farmer surveys were conducted in Baidoa, Afgoie, and Jowhar, involving interviews with 150 farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire. The results showed that over 60% of farmers cultivate cowpea for both household consumption and market purposes. While the crop is predominantly grown as an intercrop, nearly 45% of farmers in Afgoie grow it as a sole crop. Marked regional differences were observed in varietal preferences, with farmers in Afgoie favouring erect, uniformly maturing cultivars with a dark-red seed colour, whereas other regions demonstrated more diverse preferences. Production constraints also varied by location, with drought identified as the primary limitation in Baidoa, and pests and diseases as the major challenges in Afgoie and Jowhar. Accordingly, farmers ranked early maturity as the top breeding priority in Baidoa, whereas disease and pest resistance were the primary targets in Afgoie. Furthermore, we established a germplasm collection representing Somalia's cowpea diversity from both the pre- and post-war periods. The collection also includes a subset of global cowpea diversity and accessions with known desirable agronomic traits.

In the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, chromosome segregation is especially critical during transmission from host to mosquito: rapid mitoses generate male gametes, and subsequent meiosis in the zygote seeds the next generation of infection. Here, we identify Aurora-related kinase 1 (ARK1) as a central regulator of chromosome segregation in both mitotic and meiotic contexts. ARK1 localises to spindle poles, spindles, and kinetochores, and its depletion results in short and multipolar spindles, kinetochore misalignment, and failed chromosome partitioning. ARK1 forms a minimal Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) with INCENP1 during male gametogenesis, but a more elaborate CPC with INCENP2, kinetochores, centromeric histones, and spindle assembly checkpoint proteins during meiosis. This stage-specific modularity allows Plasmodium to prioritise male gamete formation whilst safeguarding faithful chromosome inheritance during zygote development, ensuring parasite transmission to the mosquito.

Their virulence depends on the excessive, uncontrolled activity of secreted proteases that sustain chronic inflammation, leading to the destruction of tissues supporting the tooth. Paradoxically, Tf also encodes multiple protease inhibitors, including miropin, a serpin with a broad range of targets. Here, we demonstrate that both native and recombinant miropin effectively inhibit lysine-specific gingipain (Kgp) and thiol protease (Tpr), impairing the growth of Pg in peptide-limited media and reducing its virulence in vivo. A rationally designed variant, RVK-miropin, also inhibited both lysine-specific and arginine-specific gingipains, fully suppressing Pg proliferation and virulence in a mouse infection model. Miropin is abundant on the surface of Tf and forms covalent inhibitory complexes with Pg proteases. In an oral gavage model of periodontitis, coinfection with wild-type Tf (but not a miropin-deficient mutant) and Pg significantly reduced alveolar bone loss caused by Pg alone. Miropin thus counteracts Pg virulence factors and host inflammatory responses, revealing an unexpected protective role for Tf. This challenges the traditional view of Tf as a primary periodontal pathogen, suggesting a context-dependent role as a microbial modulator within the dysbiotic biofilm. Beyond periodontal disease, the unique ability of miropin to inhibit structurally diverse proteases makes it a promising candidate for the development of new therapies that restore proteolytic balance in the periodontium.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We have recently developed a model of persistent S. aureus colonization using the mouse-adapted S. aureus strain JSNZ. This strain is efficiently transferred from the parents to the offspring, leading to lifelong and usually asymptomatic colonization. Here we report that adult male mice frequently develop spontaneous infections of their preputial glands (preputial gland adenitis, PGA), which are characterized by significant pus production and gland enlargement. This study aimed to characterize PGA in terms of phenotype, causative agents, and the pathogen-specific antibody and T cell responses. To this end, we compared naive mice, S. aureus-colonized PGA-negative mice with S. aureus-colonized, PGA-positive mice. PGA occurred in 8/12 (67%) of the male breeding animals and in 17/25 (68%) of the adult male offspring. The infection was not self-resolving, but persisted for several months. Genotyping revealed that the colonizing S. aureus strain JSNZ was the causative agent of PGA. The infection caused a purulent inflammation, characterized by massive bacterial aggregates and neutrophil infiltrates in the gland lumen leading to complete disruption of the glandular architecture. PGA induced a strong, but localized release of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-17, MIP-1alpha, and KC in the infected gland. T cells from PGA-draining lymph nodes as well as splenocytes reacted to in vitro re-stimulation with a S. aureus antigen cocktail with the proliferation of Th17 cells, and the release of IL-17 and IFN-gamma, corresponding to a type 1/3- immune response. To conclude, the pathology of this spontaneous and chronic S. aureus infection is driven by a strong type 3-biased immune response that is unable to clear the infection.

In most bacteria, CopA-like P1B-type ATPases mediate Cu detoxification by exporting cytoplasmic Cu to the periplasm or extracellular environment. In this study, we show that Caulobacter vibrioides lacks a canonical CopA-like ATPase but encodes a single FixI/CcoI-type Cu-transporting ATPase, previously implicated in Cu delivery to the cbb-type cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) in species such as Rhodobacter capsulatus. C. vibrioides harbors two terminal cytochrome c oxidases in its cytoplasmic membrane: an aa-type and a cbb-type Cox. We also demonstrate that the activity of cbb-Cox requires the FixI-type Cu transporter and the periplasmic Cu chaperone PccA. In contrast, aa-Cox activity depends on PccA and the inner membrane-bound protein CtaG. Since the mechanism of Cu acquisition for aa-Cox remains largely unknown, we conducted a genetic screen and identified a novel outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor (TccA) that is specifically required for aa-Cox function. We also showed that cbb-Cox is upregulated under microaerobic conditions, possibly such as those encountered on solid media where O2 diffusion is limited. Under normoxic conditions, the expression and the activity of cbb-Cox decrease, and aa-Cox becomes the predominant terminal oxidase. These findings demonstrate that C. vibrioides differentially utilizes its Cox enzymes in response to O2 availability and relies on a distinct Cu trafficking pathway for their maturation, including an outer membrane component that has not been previously described in bacterial Cu homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

S. pneumoniae is also an important model organism for basic and biomedical research, with a number of strains with different characteristics being used. To address this, we have created the manually curated pan-genome database PneumoWiki (https://pneumowiki.med.uni-greifswald.de) that integrates genomic data from 43 S. pneumoniae strains with various aspects of functional annotation. All data relating to a specific gene and gene product are compiled on a Gene page. In addition to the gene and protein sequences and annotation from NCBI RefSeq, the Gene pages contain data on, for example, gene essentiality, protein function and localization, and transcriptional regulation. The information is supplemented with links to the data sources as well as to other databases and relevant literature. The basic concept of PneumoWiki is the interlinked presentation of pan-genome-based and strain-specific information. Therefore, register tabs with strain names at the top of the Gene pages allow switching between orthologous genes and the corresponding pan-genome page. The pan-genome gene pages contain a summary with functional information and the occurrence of the gene, an orthologue table for the 43 S. pneumoniae strains, a multiple-strain genome viewer as well as a protein sequence alignment. PneumoWiki was developed as a user-friendly tool and is available free of charge. The data collected in PneumoWiki are accessible via various download options to support bioinformatic applications. Overall, PneumoWiki is a resource for the pneumococcal research community that supports the analysis and interpretation of research data and, in particular, enables the integration of the knowledge available for different S. pneumoniae strains.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Because of the short read length, sequences often can be identified reliably only to the family or genus levels. Long read sequencing with whole-length 16S rRNA sequencing can improve taxonomic resolution, but often only to the species level. StrainID is an alternative approach that amplifies a large segment of the ribosomal operon, including the entire 16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer, and a portion of the 23S rRNA gene. This longer amplicon is designed to allow ribotype-level classification. Although studies have demonstrated the utility of StrainID for several sample types, it has not yet been validated for saliva. Here, we compared the performance of StrainID to short read amplicons with saliva samples as well as a synthetic mock DNA community and human and mouse fecal samples. Short reads were amplified with primer pairs appropriate for the corresponding sample type, and were classified with two different taxonomic databases. For both saliva and fecal samples, we found that StrainID performed similarly to short reads overall and demonstrated a key benefit with phylogenetic-based beta diversity tests and taxonomic classification. Our results further build on establishing StrainID as a valid method and specifically validate its use with saliva samples.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We performed an overexpression library screen to gain insights into essential cellular processes in T. brucei and identified genes whose overexpression impaired parasite growth. One of the three top-ranking candidates we validated exhibited a notable phenotype. TbFOP, an uncharacterized protein, has an N-terminal arginine-rich domain and a C-terminal FOP (Friend Of PRMT1) domain. TbFOP overexpression substantially increases antisense transcription across the genome, particularly at Transcription Termination Sites (TTSs). This phenotype resembles that observed in trypanosome cells lacking a component of the transcription termination complex PJW/PP1 and cells lacking TTS chromatin marks, two histone variants, and base J DNA modification. Base J is synthesized in two steps: hydroxylation of dT to 5-hydroxymethyl-dU (5hmU) by JBP1 & JBP2, and the glucosylation of 5hmU to glucosyl-5hmU (base J) by JGT. Interestingly, human FOP interacts with 5-hydroxymethyl-dC (5hmC) generated by TET enzymes that are orthologs of T. brucei JBP1/2. Our study reveals TbFOP as a novel transcription termination factor that may interact with TTS-associated 5hmU, thereby interfering with the function of termination factors.

We report the widespread presence of 6mA across 17 isolates of nematodes, along with an exploration of the 6mA landscape in the genomes of six notorious agricultural pathogen root-knot nematodes (RKNs). Our results indicate that 6mA has a conserved GAG motif in different nematodes but exhibits different distribution patterns and effects on gene expression. The distribution of 6mA in transposable elements differs between polyploid and diploid nematodes, suggesting lineage-specific epigenetic regulation potentially associated with polyploidy. Importantly, we identified two potential 6mA demethylases, MiNMAD-1 and MiNMAD-2, and confirmed their catalytic activity and site. Subsequent host-induced gene silencing of minmad-1 resulted in a significant increase in plant resistance to three polyploid RKNs species. A detailed functional characterization revealed that knocking down minmad-1 impaired the expression patterns of various virulence genes in the parasitic stage, thereby decreasing the virulence of RKNs on hosts. Our findings suggest that 6mA demethylase may serve as an epigenetic marker linked to pathogen virulence, enhancing our understanding of RKN biology and providing novel resources for the development of RKN prevention and control strategies.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

CNMs frequently result from mutations in either BIN1, MTM1, or DNM2 genes, with DNM2 being a key GTPase that plays a pivotal role in muscle membrane interactions with MTM1 and BIN1. Previous studies indicate that reducing DNM2 transcript expression by half could correct CNM phenotypes regardless the genetic forms, paving the way for a broad-spectrum CNM-therapy. We evaluated CRISPR/Cas13X.1-mediated DNM2 transcript knockdown, as a therapeutic application in a unique naturally-occurring canine CNM model harboring the DNM2R465W/+ mutation, the most frequent pathogenic variant in patients.

While progress has been made in the directed differentiation of pluripotent PSCs, such cultures promote hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) over HSCs. Thus, elucidating signals, factors, and markers associated with HSC versus HPC lineage development in the embryo is imperative. During mouse embryonic development, HSCs and HPCs originate from hemogenic endothelium (HE) through a process critically dependent on the transcription factor Runx1. Here, we identified a Runx1 enhancer that distinguishes emerging dorsal aorta HSCs from HPCs. Phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic analyses of Runx1 +110 enhancer-GFP reporter (110GFP) transgenic embryos showed that 110GFP expression marks HPCs, but not the emerging HSC lineage. Comparative transcriptomics revealed a 17-gene signature associated with in vivo long-term HSC potential. Furthermore, 110GFP- preHSCs showed increased expression of Jarid2 and other PRC2 components, suggesting a role for epigenetic regulation in establishing the HSC fate during EHT. Finally, single-cell multiome analysis of dorsal aorta EHT identified the Runx1 +3 enhancer as preferentially accessible in preHSC and underlined the specific activity of the +110 enhancer in HPCs. Our study demonstrates the power of cell-type specific enhancer-reporter models to dissect cell fate decisions in development and provides new inroads to label and/or perturb HSC versus HPC fate decisions in vivo and in vitro.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

While the CW promoted abundant, metabolically active, and functionally redundant microbial communities, the phylogenetic composition diverged primarily between water and sediments. Microbial profiles in CW outlet waters converged towards those of the lagoon baselines, suggesting gradual ecological recovery. The CW attenuated the occurrence of potential pathogens (e.g., Francisella spp., Campylobacter spp.) and limited ARG dissemination, though sediments remained reservoirs of microbial and genetic signatures. Functional profiles, dominated by chemoheterotrophy, denitrification, and sulfur respiration, remained stable across environments, reflecting microbial resilience.

Tree mortality of sapling-sized trees has been observed within five to seven years of infection. The Litylenchus crenatae subsp. mccannii (Lcm) nematode is currently recognized as the major causal pathogen of BLD. Scientists first observed BLD in Ohio in 2012 and it has since spread and been detected in 15 states in the USA and one Canadian province. Understanding how this novel pathogen disperses is important for the development of management strategies and predictive models. The spread of BLD to new spatial areas may be due to the transportation of Lcm by animal vectors. We investigated birds as dispersal vectors of Lcm via ectozoochory (external) and endozoochory (internal). The ectozoochory objective was to determine if Lcm can be detected from ectoparasites and or feathers collected from wild birds caught in BLD areas. The endozoochory objectives were to determine if Lcm can be detected in the feces of wild-caught birds in BLD-infected areas, and if viable Lcm can be detected in feces from wild-caught birds kept in cages and fed Lcm nematodes. From 2021 to 2023 we collected 70 ectoparasite and feathers samples (ectozoochory) and 149 fecal samples (endozoochory) from 156 birds in areas in Ohio and Pennsylvania exhibiting BLD. We used molecular and microscopy methods to assess the presence of Lcm. Results confirmed Lcm presence in seven ectozoochory samples, and 14 endozoochory samples from six avian species: tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), American goldfinch (Spinus tristis), and downy woodpecker (Dryobates pubescens). These novel findings are among the first to detect plant parasitic nematode DNA in avian biological samples. The methods described in this manuscript could be applied to future BLD research as well as studies on animal vectors and forest pathogens. Understanding which bird species are vectors of Lcm will facilitate the creation of predictive models and develop preventative management strategies to protect uninfected American beech stands.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Grazing and selectivity were evaluated considering prey trophic mode and cell size as key food quality descriptors in copepod diets, and the impact of microzooplankton grazing was quantified for comparison. Copepod ingestion rate on eukaryotes ranged from 3.4 to 138 ng C ind-1 d-1. Diet was mostly derived from mixotrophic (5-89%) and heterotrophic (0-84%) prey, while autotrophs had a minor contribution (2-17%). Overall, nanoplankton provided the highest C intake to copepods (62-99%) rather than more abundant but smaller picoplankton (0.8-38%). Copepod-mediated Chla removal was not detected, although gut content revealed ingestion of 0.8 g Chla ind-1 d-1. Slight selection emerged in favor of picoplankton versus nanoplankton, suggesting a possible trophic cascade. Ingestion of 15N-labelled prey indicated active consumption by copepods of consumers (protistan nano-micrograzers or small metazoans). We found significantly greater nitrogen consumption (~5-fold) when using 1-2 m 15N-prey (Synechococcus), compared to <1 m sized prey (Prochlorococcus). Microzooplankton grazing on eukaryotic (0.07-2.5 d-1) and prokaryote (0.3-2.1 d-1) prey greatly exceeded copepod grazing. Microzooplankton diet consisted mainly of heterotrophs (25-59%), and mixotrophs (13-41%) with a lower contribution of autotrophs (12-33%). Nanoplankton constituted the main dietary source for microzooplankton (95-98%), whereas picoplankton was 2-5%. Most of the daily production was removed by microzooplankton (111%) leaving copepods a secondary role in consumption (7%), likely supported by ingestion of larger prey and indirect nutrient channeling.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Our objectives were to define the key cell populations across tissues in a highly atherogenic mouse model of atherosclerosis under obese and normal-weight conditions, and to explore tissue-specific cellular changes and interactions associated with obesity. Methods We employed 5-prime single-cell RNA sequencing combined with antibody staining in Ldlr-/- Apob100/100 male mice, comparing two groups: animals fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and those maintained on regular chow as non-obese controls. We harvested aorta, epididymal and perivascular adipose tissues, and spleen from each animal. Aorta samples were CD45+ enriched, and a panel of 138 antibodies was used to generate CITE-seq libraries. Spatial transcriptomics of human carotid arteries and aorta were used to confirm the expression of top targets from the mouse model. Immunohistochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence were used to validate the findings.

While the genetic basis of iris pigmentation has been extensively studied in humans, little is known about iris pigmentation in pigs. Iris pigmentation in pigs varies from different shades of brown or pale irises to heterochromia manifesting either as different colors between both irises (heterochromia iridum) or multiple colors within a single iris (heterochromia iridis). This study investigates the genetics of iris pigmentation variability in the Swiss Landrace and Swiss Large White pig breeds. Iris pigmentation was phenotyped in 837 Swiss Landrace and 328 Swiss Large White pigs of which the majority also had array-derived genotypes. A high prevalence of heterochromia iridum (18.6%) was observed in the Swiss Landrace breed. Heritability estimates for iris pigmentation were high in both breeds (heritability = 56.0 to 57.2%). Iris pigmentation was not genetically correlated with production traits. Genome-wide association analysis identified several loci associated with iris pigmentation, including regions near functional candidate genes such as TYR, ALX4 and DCT. The strongest association was detected near the KITLG gene, which was identified as a candidate gene for iris pigmentation in a previous study on Italian Large White pigs. Fine-mapping identified a highly significantly associated (P=3.8x10-11) missense variant in KITLG (5 94084790 G>A, rs342599807, p.R124K) as a potential causal variant for pale and heterochromatic iris pigmentation in Swiss pigs.

Their recognition by innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells has been widely studied, but very little information is available on adenovirus interaction with neutrophils. Using cytometry and confocal and electron microscopy, we showed that neutrophils bind to antibody-coated adenoviruses and engulf them in a phagosome. Using a single-cell transcriptomic approach, we found that adenovirus phagocytosis activates a specific transcriptional program in neutrophils. It also triggers calcium entry into neutrophils, reactive oxygen species production in the phagosome, and CXCL8 release. Moreover, 4 hours after adenovirus incubation, 50% of neutrophils undergo calcium- and RIPK3-dependent cell death, accompanied by Neutrophil Extracellular Trap emission. Because of this rapid cell death, engulfed adenoviruses are not fully degraded after 3 hours, and the remaining viruses are still capable of expressing their genome in target cells. Thus, our data suggest that, during adenoviral infection, the neutrophil response may promote a pro-inflammatory environment that could damage host tissues.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

During this period, communities of up to dozen shorebird species coexist on suitable habitats at land-water interfaces. By video recording 22 species of migrating and wintering shorebirds in different sites, we show that their distribution according to the water height at which they forage is not random but follows a gradient of increasing water height according to increasing species body size. Species-specific beak and tarsus lengths are positively correlated with the water height at which the different species forage. Our data do not support a trade-off in investment between beak length and tarsus length in our study species set. Congeneric species that are expected to be morphologically and ecologically more similar forage at contrasted water heights.

Three prominent classes of molecules in this environment include phenolic acids, lignans, and enterolignans, which have been linked to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as protection from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. The abundance of these molecules in the gut microbiome as well as their biological significance motivated the development of the LC-MS/MS method reported herein, which provides a simple, robust, and high-throughput approach to simultaneously quantify a 17-membered panel of phenolic acids, lignans, and enterolignans in human fecal microbiome samples. This method employs liquid-liquid extraction, which allows for cost-effective sample preparation by using common laboratory materials. Additionally, fecal samples are lyophilized prior to extraction to mitigate confounding effects introduced by variability in water content that exists across individuals' samples. Inclusion of 0.1% acetic acid in the chromatographic solvents optimized peak shape and signal intensity. Plastic microcentrifuge tubes imparted substantial interferences for some analytes, which was resolved through use of glass vials. Using this method, 60% of human fecal samples from 10 individuals showed that phenolic acids bearing a catechol motif were in significantly greater abundance than were guaiacols. As specific gut bacteria can transform guaiacols into redox-active catechols, determination of guaiacol:catechol ratios in fecal samples may afford a biomarker of gut microbiota anti-oxidant potential.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Current strategies to mature these cells fall short of achieving in vivo-like physiology. Macrophages, members of the innate immune system, reside in the heart and exert positive effects on cardiomyocyte function. We hypothesized that developmentally informed addition of macrophages to cardiomyocytes would improve their maturity. While some recent studies have added macrophages to stem cell-derived models of the human myocardium, these previous approaches do not replicate the early colonization of the heart. Addition of macrophages to developing cardiomyocytes 8 days after the start of differentiation significantly alters cardiomyocyte behavior. We show that macrophages drive improvements in metabolic capabilities of cardiomyocytes. Developing cardiomyocytes shed lowly polarized mitochondria, adopt a new mitochondria network architecture, and develop more active mitophagy programs after >20 days coculture with macrophages. This interaction is dependent on macrophage MerTK reception of cardiomyocyte-derived mitochondria material. These results inform our understanding of the responsibility of macrophages in the development of the myocardium, and we hope that these interactions can be leveraged to produce more physiologically relevant models of the human myocardium.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the conformational plasticity of FUS-RRM in its native state using advanced NMR techniques, particularly 15N chemical exchange saturation transfer and heteronuclear adiabatic relaxation dispersion experiments, to capture slow and fast microsecond (s) timescale dynamics. We further examine the influence of environmental factors such as pH and ATP on the conformational plasticity and the aggregation behaviour of FUS-RRM. Our findings show that both ATP and pH perturb the fast and slow s-timescale dynamics of FUS-RRM, and the aggregation behaviour. Specifically, a contrasting effect of ATP on slow and fast s-ms dynamics at pH 6.4 and 4.6, along with the corresponding changes in aggregation behavior, suggest a complex relationship between ATP, pH, and protein aggregation kinetics.

In the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, we identify Hydra, a previously unrecognized globular domain embedded within TgSNF2L, one of two ISWI paralogues. Hydra is structurally unique, lacking homology to any known protein fold, and represents a lineage-specific insertion in an otherwise structurally conserved protein family. Biochemical analyses reveal that the isolated Hydra domain self-assembles into stable oligomers, undergoing reversible equilibrium with its monomeric form. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis reveals discrete globular assemblies, though little consistency could be obtained, suggesting a highly dynamic complex. Deletion of Hydra from full-length TgSNF2L disrupts its intrinsic ability to form higher order oligomers in solution, yielding predominantly monomeric and dimeric species. Functionally, the Hydra-driven multimerization of TgSNF2L modulates its availability for chromatin engagement in response to cell-cycle cues.

IM30 and its bacterial homolog PspA belong to the ESCRT-III superfamily, proteins previously thought to be restricted to eukaryotes and archaea. Despite low sequence similarity, IM30 shares key structural and functional features with eukaryotic ESCRT-IIIs, including a conserved 1-2 helical hairpin core and the ability to form oligomeric barrel- or rod assemblies that mediate membrane remodeling. Using IM30 variants, we now show that initial membrane recruitment of IM30 is driven by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged 1-3 helical hairpin and negatively charged lipid surfaces, paralleling the role of charged helical regions in some eukaryotic ESCRT-IIIs. This likely initiates lateral assembly of IM30 into higher-order barrel or rod structures on the membrane. Once assembled, 0 helices within these oligomers engage and stabilize internalized membrane tubules, mirroring membrane interaction strategies of eukaryotic ESCRT-IIIs, which use both N-terminal sequences and charged residues on 1/2. Thus, our findings demonstrate a conserved membrane binding and remodeling mechanism across the ESCRT-III superfamily, underscoring an evolutionary link in membrane dynamics between pro- and eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Mosquito viromes have been reported to be highly diverse and dynamic, under the influence of host and ecological factors. However, the spatio-temporal flux in virome compositions remains to be understood due to the lack of longitudinal data. Here, we sought to identify and quantify the relative importance of the host and ecological factors that influence virome diversity and composition from 15 mosquito species across time and narrow- or broad-scale biogeographies. We found that host species is the strongest determinant of virome diversity, whereas the influence of ecological factors on virome distribution vary across host species and virus family. In addition, we observed that closely related virus species are occasionally associated with closely related mosquito species. Our findings therefore highlight the importance of considering the ecological and evolutionary forces of virome dynamics and connectivity in terms of its taxonomic constituents instead of a single entity.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Our RNAseq profiling study of the hippocampus from rhesus monkeys with chronic alcohol use identified the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1C as a promising therapeutic target. However, data regarding CACNA1C expression in AUD and whether inhibition of CACNA1C can attenuate ethanol contextual memories remains limited. We tested the hypothesis that hippocampal CACNA1C expression is increased in human and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with chronic alcohol use. Further, we used a mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to test the hypothesis that Nifedipine, a CACNA1C-selective L-type calcium channel antagonist, can attenuate ethanol-induced CPP. CACNA1C mRNA expression was increased in the hippocampus of subjects with AUD (p<0.03). Increased densities of CACNA1C neurons (p<0.01) and glia (p<0.02) were observed in rhesus monkeys with chronic alcohol use. Ethanol-treated mice spent more time in the ethanol-paired chamber compared to the vehicle animals (p<0.04), demonstrating ethanol-induced CPP. This effect was attenuated by Nifedipine, as time spent in the ethanol-paired chamber in the ethanol + Nifedipine group was not significantly different from the vehicle group. These findings demonstrate that chronic alcohol use increases CACNA1C expression in the hippocampus across species and that a CACNA1C subtype-selective antagonist reduces ethanol-induced CPP.

To investigate their distinct roles, we generated two lines of inducible transgenic mice in which either GCs or PCs could be selectively ablated in adulthood by administration of the progesterone receptor antagonist RU-486. This system combined a Cre recombinase-progesterone receptor fusion, in which Cre activity is induced in an RU-486-dependent manner, with a Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin A expression to achieve cell-type-specific ablation. High-dose RU-486 induced nearly complete loss of either GCs or PCs and resulted in severe ataxia. When partial ablation was induced by low-dose RU-486, different phenotypes emerged. Mice retaining about 20% of PCs were still able to improve motor coordination in the rotarod test and maintained performance in the balance beam test comparable to that of controls. In contrast, mice with about 30% of GCs remaining showed marked deficits, failing to improve across rotarod trials and exhibiting reduced latency to fall in the balance beam test. These results suggest that while both GCs and PCs are indispensable for motor coordination, a sufficient number of GCs is required for both motor coordination and motor learning. This inducible ablation model highlights the differential contributions of cerebellar neurons and provides a valuable tool to dissect circuit-specific functions in the adult brain.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

With learning, L5 ET neurons underwent pronounced tuning modifications and developed robust, categorical responses, whereas L2/3 and L5 IT neurons did not. This categorical code was task engagement-dependent: it was present during behavior and absent during passive listening in the same neurons on the same day, indicating context-gated expression. Using a generalized linear model to dissociate stimulus- from choice-related signals, we confirmed that categorical selectivity in L5 ET neurons reflected sensory encoding rather than motor confounds. All three populations carried choice signals, but these were strongest in L5 ET neurons, suggesting a role in linking sensory categorization to action selection. These findings identify a projection-specific, deep-layer cortical output channel in which L5 ET neurons acquire categorical representations and selectively propagate behaviorally relevant signals to downstream targets.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

Environmental factors such as socioeconomic status and adversity can have an outsized influence on neurocognitive development. However, not all environmental factors have the same influence on cognitive and brain development. In the current study, we examined the differential influences of SES (i.e., parental education and neighbourhood safety) and adversity on the maturation rate of functional networks in children and adolescents. Using resting-state fMRI data, independent component analysis with dual regression was computed to identify six networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Left Executive Control Network (ECN), Right ECN, Hippocampal (HPC), Salience, and Sensorimotor networks) of interest in children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 (N=216, acquired from the Healthy Brain Network). A neural maturity index was generated based on the degree of similarity between the spatial configuration of the six networks in each youth brain to that of an adult template (1243 total, with a mean age of 26; independently by sex). Regression analyses were used to determine the association between neural maturity, social-cognitive abilities and environmental factors such as parental education, neighbourhood safety and number of negative life events (adversity). We found one sensory (sensorimotor) and two association (default mode and executive control) networks matured faster than other networks. Only the rate of maturity of the DMN and HPC were associated with environmental factors. Maturity of the DMN was associated with less adversity and better social cognitive ability, whereas maturity of the HPC network was associated with younger participants with higher IQs. Moreover, these effects were stronger in females than males.

This subcortical pathway may facilitate rapid responses to salient visual stimuli and could explain phenomena such as blindsight. However, controversies remain about the organization of the subcortical pathway, its role in visual processing, and how the cortical and subcortical pathways mature across development. Methods: To address these questions we used longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data from 4361 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, reconstructing every major segment of the cortical and subcortical amygdala pathways. We tested the existence of the subcortical pathway against null tractography models, characterized cortical and subcortical pathways development across early adolescence, and investigated their association with visual processing speed. Results: We provide evidence for the existence of bilateral pulvinar-amygdala pathways against a null model (all p < 0.001, corrected). While cortical tracts involving the primary and extrastriate visual cortex and the inferior-temporal cortex strengthened with chronological age and over pubertal development, we demonstrate that subcortical pulvinar-amygdala connectivity decreased over pubertal development. Greater connectivity strength of the right pulvinar-amygdala tract was associated with faster responses on a visual task for both emotional face and place stimuli, a relationship also seen for cortical tracts. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the existence of pulvinar to amygdala tracts in the largest sample of adolescent participants studied to date. Greater connectivity in both cortical and subcortical tracts were associated with faster reaction time on a visual task, but further work will be needed to investigate the specificity of this association in terms of both task and tract. In line with the hypothesized importance of the subcortical pathway in early development, we show that the developmental trajectories of cortical and subcortical pathways diverge and highlight the influence of pubertal development, with cortical pathways generally strengthening and subcortical pathways weakening across early adolescence.", "date": "2025-09-05", "journal": ""}

We show that activation of WNK signaling stabilizes GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, while inhibition enhances receptor internalization. This regulation depends on the phosphorylation state of two previously uncharacterized residues in the central linker region of the gephyrin scaffold protein. Modulating WNK activity alters neuronal activity and the kinetics of GABAergic currents. In vivo, expression of a phospho-mimetic form of gephyrin at WNK-targeted sites produces anxiolytic effects.

Past studies provide support for important effects of mutation bias on adaptive change, but leave open the empirical question of how strongly and how broadly evolutionary patterns depend on taxon-specific mutational tendencies. To characterize this effect quantitatively, we aggregated frequency spectra of adaptive amino acid changes from 14 species, comprising over 5000 total adaptive events, primarily from adaptive laboratory evolution studies. We then paired each species-specific spectrum of adaptive changes with independent measurements of the mutation spectrum of that same species. Across the 14 species, we find considerable heterogeneity in the relative frequencies of the six possible types of single-nucleotide changes, for both the mutational and adaptive spectra. Comparing these spectra across species, we find that, for any given mutation type, the stronger the bias toward or against that type in a species' mutation spectrum, the more enriched or depleted it tends to be in that species' adaptive spectrum.
