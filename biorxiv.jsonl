The use of fluorescent genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) in conjunction with miniaturized microscopes is an exciting emerging toolset for recording neural activity in unrestrained animals. Despite their potential, current miniaturized microscope designs are limited by using image sensors with low frame rates, sensitivity, and resolution. Beyond GECIs, there are many neuroscience applications which would benefit from the use of other emerging neural indicators, such as fluorescent genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) that have faster temporal resolution to match neuron spiking, yet, require imaging at high speeds to properly sample the activity-dependent signals. We integrated an advanced CMOS image sensor into a popular open-source miniaturized microscope platform. MiniFAST is a fast and sensitive miniaturized microscope capable of 1080p video (1920x1080 pixels), 1.5 m resolution, frame rates up to 500 Hz (achieved with windowing: 1920 x 55 pixels height) and high gain ability (up to 70 dB) to image in extremely low light conditions. We report results of ~300 Hz in vivo imaging of freely behaving transgenic Thy1-GCaMP6f mice, high speed 500 Hz in vitro imaging of a GEVI and in vivo GEVI imaging in head-fixed mice. Our results extend miniaturized microscope capabilities in high-speed imaging, high sensitivity and increased resolution, opening the door for the open-source community to use fast and dim neural indicators.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

However, current deep learning approaches are limited by incomplete observability and the lack of ground-truth labels in real experiments. Consequently, models are often trained on synthetic data, which leads to the well-known \"model mismatch\" problem when simulated dynamics diverge from true neural activity. To overcome these challenges, we present Deep Domain Adaptive Matching (DeepDAM), a training framework that adaptively matches synthetic and in vivo data domains for neural connectivity inference. Specifically, DeepDAM fine-tunes deep neural networks on a combined dataset of synthetic simulations and unlabeled in vivo recordings, aligning the model's feature representations with real neural dynamics to mitigate model mismatch. We demonstrate this approach in rodent hippocampal CA1 circuits as a proof of concept, achieving near perfect connectivity inference performance (Matthews correlation coefficient 0.97-1.0) and substantially surpassing classical methods (0.6-0.7). We further demonstrate robustness across multiple recording conditions within this hippocampal dataset. Additionally, to illustrate its broader applicability, we extend the framework to two distinct systems without altering the core methodology: a stomatogastric microcircuit in Cancer borealis (ex vivo) and single neuron intracellular recordings in mouse, where DeepDAM significantly improves efficiency and accuracy over standard approaches. By effectively leveraging synthetic data for in vivo and ex vivo analysis, DeepDAM offers a generalizable strategy for overcoming model mismatch and represents a critical step towards data-driven reconstruction of functional neural circuits.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

P.; Verma, S.; Thirumalai, V.", "abstract": "Purkinje neurons are critical for the functioning of the cerebellum, which is among the oldest and most conserved regions of the vertebrate brain. In mammals and in larval zebrafish, Purkinje neurons can generate tonic firing even when isolated from the network. Here we investigated the ionic basis of tonic firing in Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish using voltage clamp for isolation of membrane currents along with pharmacology. We discovered that these neurons express L-type and P/Q-type high voltage- gated calcium currents, T-type low voltage-gated calcium currents and SK and BK- type calcium dependent potassium currents. Among these, L-type calcium currents and SK-type calcium-dependent potassium currents were indispensable for tonic firing, while blocking T-type, P/Q-type and BK currents had little effect in comparison. We observed that action potentials were broadened when either L-type or SK channels were blocked. Based on these results, we propose that calcium entry via L-type calcium channels activates SK potassium channels leading to faster action potential repolarization, in turn aiding the removal of inactivation of sodium channels. This allows larval zebrafish Purkinje neurons to continue to fire tonically for sustained periods. In mammals also, tonic firing in Purkinje neurons is driven by calcium channels coupling to calcium-dependent potassium channels, yet the specific types of channels involved are different. We therefore suggest that coupling of calcium channels and calcium-dependent potassium channels could be a conserved mechanism for sustaining long bouts of high frequency firing.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/dACC) and anterior insula are key brain regions implicated in effort-based decision-making. Here, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 7 Tesla on 69 healthy participants in these brain regions to uncover the neurometabolic factors that influence these differences. We designed and applied an effort-based decision-making task requiring mental and physical effort to probe motivated behavior, complemented by computational modeling to extract key behavioral parameters. Gradient boosting machine learning was applied to explore the predictive role of specific metabolites in motivated behavior. Our results reveal that a model established on dmPFC/dACC metabolites explains decisions to exert high mental effort and sensitivity to mental effort. In particular, glutamate, aspartate, and lactate in dmPFC/dACC, three metabolites linked through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis, were identified as key discriminative metabolites in the dmPFC/dACC, predictive of mental effort choices, underpinning energy supply and cognitive processes. Anterior insula metabolites did not significantly relate to effort-related decisions. Notably, glutamine and lactate levels between the periphery (plasma) and the dmPFC/dACC were correlated, suggesting a metabolic link between peripheral and central biomarkers of effort. Our findings provide novel insights into the neurometabolic underpinnings of motivated behavior and propose novel biomarkers for mental effort-based decision-making.

However, most of this sequence data is unassembled, or where assembled was done so with no consistent assembler or quality control. Although this data has great potential, these inconsistencies make it unsuitable for large-scale analyses, and inaccessible for most researchers to reuse. Therefore in our previous effort, we released a uniformly assembled set of 661,405 genomes, consisting of all publicly available whole genome sequenced bacterial isolate data up to a cutoff of November 2018, enriched with various search indexes to make the data easier to sort and use. In this study, we first extend the dataset up to August 2024 with the same consistent assembly pipeline, more than tripling the number of genomes available. We also expand the scope of the dataset beyond genomes, as we begin a global collaborative project to generate annotations, species-specific analyses, evolutionary data, new search indices, and protein structural data. Our collaboration is therefore grass-roots, driven by the needs of different research communities within microbiology. In this paper, we describe the project as of release 2024-08, comprising 2,440,377 assemblies. All 2.4 million genomes have been uniformly reprocessed for quality criteria and to give taxonomic abundance estimates with respect to the GTDB phylogeny. We further enrich the dataset with sequence annotations from Bakta, antimicrobial resistance predictions from AMRFinderPlus, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions for the 17.7M hypothetical proteins. By applying an evolution-informed compression approach, the full set of genomes is just 130Gb: a reduction of about 23x compared to compressing individual assemblies. To make the resource as accessible as possible, we also provide multiple search indexes, a method for alignment to the full dataset, and cloud-based access to all the genomes.

Despite this flexibility, its implementation faces two challenges: the choice of eigenvectors and the default use of least-squares regression, which may reduce robustness under non-stationary evolution. A further source of uncertainty concerns the applicability of conventional rules for model complexity, such as the \"samples-per-variable (SPV) [&ge;] 10\" guideline. Here we propose an optimized PVR framework that addresses these issues. First, we show that eigenvectors selected independently from different traits often diverge, leading to inconsistent results, and that using their union provides stronger control of phylogenetic non-independence. Second, we evaluate robust regression estimators within PVR, demonstrating that PVR-MM, and in some cases even PVR-L2, maintain high accuracy under non-stationary evolutionary shifts where other non-robust methods deteriorate. Third, through simulation we reassess the SPV [&ge;] 10 rule, showing that PVR tolerates eigenvector counts well beyond this conventional threshold, offering more flexibility but requiring careful monitoring. Extensive simulations across diverse tree structures and evolutionary scenarios confirm that the optimized framework enhances both accuracy and robustness.

However, it is unclear which disrupted cognitive processes underlie impaired motivation, and whether impairments persist following remission. Decision-making concerning exerting effort to obtain rewards offers a promising framework for understanding motivation, especially when examined with computational tools which can offer precise quantification of latent processes. Methods: Effort-based decision-making was assessed using the Apple Gathering Task, where participants decide whether to exert effort via a grip-force device to obtain varying levels of reward; effort levels were individually calibrated and varied parametrically. We present a comprehensive computational analysis of decision-making, initially validating our model in healthy volunteers (N=67), before applying it in a case-control study including current (N=41) and remitted (N=46) unmedicated depressed individuals, and healthy volunteers with (N=36) and without (N=57) a family history of depression. Results: Four fundamental computational mechanisms that drive patterns of effort-based decisions, which replicated across samples, were identified: overall bias to accept effort challenges; reward sensitivity; and linear and quadratic effort sensitivity. Traditional model-agnostic analyses showed that both depressed groups showed lower willingness to exert effort. In contrast with previous findings, computational analysis revealed that this difference was primarily driven by lower effort acceptance bias, but not altered effort or reward sensitivity. Conclusions: This work provides insight into the computational mechanisms underlying motivational dysfunction in depression. Lower willingness to exert effort could represent a trait-like factor contributing to symptoms, and might represent a fruitful target for treatment and prevention.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

By knocking out surface receptors Osmr, Tgfbr2, or Il1r1 on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we uncover that TGFBR2 signaling loss uniquely induces the emergence of a Col18a1hi CAF cell state that is distinct from previously described fibroblast states and is associated with worse survival in human PDAC patients. Further application of a local as well as combinatorial gene knockout technology in CAFs reveals a circuit in which these Col18a1hi CAFs reshape the TME by recruiting Siglec-Fhi neutrophils via Cxcl5 expression; and that the Col18a1hi CAF cell state is further dependent on TNFR1 and canonical Wnt signaling.

Here, we used more than four decades of data on wild baboons (Papio sp.) in Amboseli, Kenya, to examine the effects of \"early lactational synchrony\" (the proportion of females in a group with an infant <90 days old) on female-female agonistic interactions and infant survival. Because early lactation is energetically demanding for mothers and high-risk for infants, we expected both female-female aggression and protection by males to intensify during this period. In support, when early lactational synchrony was high, rates of female-female agonism increased. High-ranking females increased their time associating with adult males, while the time that low-ranking females associated with adult males decreased. Furthermore, high early lactational synchrony strongly predicted infant mortality, even though periods of high synchrony tended to be brief in duration in this nonseasonally breeding population. This association may result from both aggression among adult females and infanticidal behavior by peripubertal females. These findings provide novel evidence that synchronous reproduction alters competitive regimes and compromises reproductive outcomes even in nonseasonal breeders.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

This is primarily because perennial individuals can carry signatures of past selection regimes. We studied bract color polymorphism in a nocturnal ginger Curcuma caulina to ask: (i) Do nectar rewards, reproductive compatibility and pollinator visitation differ among color morphs? (ii) Does morph abundance correlate with fitness via ecological (pollinator-mediated) or physiological (compatibility) pathways? (iii) Do these traits predict realized reproductive success? Methods: We measured 22 floral/vegetative traits (n=30 per morph), nectar rewards (106 flowers), pollinator visitation rates (648 hours), and physiological compatibility (471 hand-pollinations treatments) and natural fruit and seed set ([&ge;]50 per morph) across three dominant morphs. Path analysis tested direct and indirect effects of morph abundance, nectar traits, pollinator visitation, and compatibility on reproductive fitness. Key results: Morphs did not differ in their morphological traits but showed differential nectar and reproductive compatibility traits. The rare red-white morph produced the highest nectar energy, received the most visits, had a leaky self-compatibility, and yet showed lowest seed count per fruit, while the most common green-red morph was self-incompatible, showed higher cross-compatibility and had highest seeds per fruit. The second common green-white morph showed intermediate abundance and also showed leaky self-compatibility. Path analysis indicated that morph abundance had both direct and indirect effects on reproductive fitness, mediated by nectar, pollinator visitation and compatibility. Conclusions: Reproductive success of the polymorphic C. caulina is a result of multi-trait interactions including pollinator interaction. That is, nectar traits and mating-system differences shape reproductive fitness of the morphs.

Treating this disease is particularly difficult since the articular cartilage lacks intrinsic repair capacity even though mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in the joint environment and have robust chondrogenic potential. We have previously shown that there is heterogeneity of MSC sub-types within the human synovium, yet it remains unclear if any of these MSC types can regenerate cartilage and/or impact OA disease progression. Therefore, we have undertaken this study focusing on clonally derived MSC populations derived from the synovium of normal and OA patients to characterize if any MSC populations can positively impact OA disease trajectory in a rat model of OA. MSCs were clonally isolated by indexed flow cytometry, expanded in culture and then characterized for differentiation capacity and by quantitative proteomics. MSC clones were then transplanted into a xenograft rat OA model and treatment effect was determined by histology and immunofluorescence outcomes. We identified heterogeneity in putative MSCs derived from within and between patient groups (normal vs. OA) and the ability of these cells to effect repair in a rat OA model. However, these different sub-types of MSCs could not be distinguished by traditional cell surface markers showing the need for a better understanding of these populations at the single cell level. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, CD47 was identified a novel marker of human MSCs. Using the same rat model of OA, CD47Hi expressing cells were found to have robust treatment efficacy and directly contributed to the formation of new articular cartilage tissue. Characterizing MSCs is essential to understand which sub-types are appropriate for further clinical investigation. If OA patients still have functional MSCs in their synovium, then it is possible these cells can be exploited for cartilage regeneration / OA treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigate this question through the lens of exophers - large, evolutionarily conserved EVs known to enhance proteostasis, extend lifespan, and improve reproductive fitness. Our study uncovers distinct regulatory mechanisms driving EV production in response to pathogen-derived volatile metabolites and non-volatile secretome, providing insights into host-pathogen signaling before physical interaction. We reveal a sophisticated network that adjusts EV production based on pathogen proximity: non-volatile secretome (including tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro), signaling an immediate threat, activate immune-dependent EV pathways, while volatile metabolites, forewarning potential danger, initiate immunity-independent exopher production. Both responses rely on sensory neurons, with ASK, ADL, and AWC neurons playing central roles in each, and additional input from ASI, AWB, and ASH neurons specifically enhancing non-volatile secretome-induced EV production. Downstream signal integration is mediated by a circuit involving the RMG hub and AIB/AIA interneurons, with the AIB-specific NPR-9 receptor playing a critical role. Molecularly, we identified multiple GPCRs, including SRI-19, SRI-36/39, and SRR-6, as crucial for the non-volatile response, and revealed that SRR-6 functions in the intestine to regulate muscle exopher production, demonstrating a novel gut-muscle signaling axis. Notably, exposure to volatile pathogen metabolites significantly boosts offspring fitness during infection in SRI-19-dependent manner, albeit at the cost of maternal survival when conditions are being harsher. Thus, our study shows that C. elegans distinguishes pathogen proximity through compound types, activating EV-dependent physiological responses tailored to either immediate or anticipated threats to optimize survival across generations.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

However, this memory is not fixed and can be updated through new experiences, such as learning that the threat is no longer present. This process of updating, known as extinction or reversal learning, is highly dependent on the context in which it occurs. How the brain represents cues, contexts, and their changing threat value remains a major question. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel fear learning paradigm to track the neural representations of stimuli across fear acquisition, reversal, and test phases. We found that initial fear learning creates generalized neural representations for all threatening cues in the brain's fear network. During reversal learning, when threat contingencies switched for some of the cues, two distinct representational strategies were observed. On the one hand, we still identified generalized patterns for currently threatening cues, whereas on the other hand, we observed highly stable representations of individual cues (i.e., item-specific) that changed their valence, particularly in the precuneus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, we observed that the brain represents contexts more distinctly during reversal learning. Furthermore, additional exploratory analyses showed that the degree of this context specificity in the prefrontal cortex predicted the subsequent return of fear, providing a potential neural mechanism for fear renewal. Our findings reveal that the brain uses a flexible combination of generalized and specific representations to adapt to a changing world, shedding new light on the mechanisms that support cognitive flexibility and the treatment of anxiety disorders via exposure therapy.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

However, protein modifications including deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, and conversion of glutamine or glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, can change the sequence of peptides, leading to spurious taxonomic detections and potentially inaccurate archaeological interpretations. While a handful of examples of this phenomenon have been reported in the literature, the issue is potentially much wider reaching than currently realised. In reality, any time a peptide containing a deamidated glutamine or asparagine residue, an unmodified glutamic acid or aspartic acid residue, or a pyroglutamic acid modification is detected by proteomic search software, the sequence, and therefore potentially its taxonomy, may be incorrect, which could potentially lead to unsound archaeological interpretations. The Demodifier is a fast, open source tool which solves this issue by screening for modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomy, enabling archaeologists to make informed interpretations of the taxonomies of peptides detected in ancient samples. To assess its utility, The Demodifier is tested against an archaeological dataset containing all unique peptides reported in palaeoproteomic studies of dental calculus and vessels. The results reveal that modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomies are severely under-reported, occurring 15% more frequently than previously understood. Modifications were found to produce three different types of inaccurate taxonomic matches: those which yielded completely different taxonomic lowest common ancestors to the input peptide, those which were more taxonomically specific than the input peptide, and those which were less taxonomically specific than the input peptide. The Demodifier therefore enables the rapid detection of potentially inaccurate peptide taxonomies, avoiding spurious archaeological interpretations in future studies.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The PVT was administered three times in short-wavelength 'blue' light [SWL, high melanopic illuminance], long-wavelength 'red' light [LWL, low melanopic illuminance], and bright white light [BWL] of high correlated color temperature, and white dim light [DL] as the control condition. PVT measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as intra-individual Reaction Time (RT) variability and the number of lapses; mean RT; and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during SWL and LWL, and they enhanced their optimum response capability during LWL. There were no significant effects of BWL, and light did not appear to have effects on RT variability. Surprisingly, SWL was not superior to LWL.

Generative machine learning (ML) models, particularly the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), offer an emerging strategy to enhance conformational sampling. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of DDPM in generating atomistically accurate conformational ensembles across proteins of varying size and structural order, ranging from the 20-residue folded Trp-cage and 58-residue BPTI to the 83-residue intrinsically disordered region Ash1 and the 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein $\\alpha$-Synuclein. Training DDPM on relatively short MD trajectories using both torsion angle and all-atom coordinate data, we demonstrate that it can reproduce key structural features such as secondary structure, radius of gyration, and contact maps, while effectively sampling sparsely populated regions of the conformational landscape. Notably, DDPM can also generate novel conformations, including transitions not explicitly observed in the training data. However, the model occasionally overlooks low-probability regions and may produce conformers with unclear physical relevance, warranting independent validation. These limitations are particularly evident in flexible systems such as IDPs. Overall, this work benchmarks DDPM as a viable tool for augmenting MD simulations, offering enhanced sampling with significant computational savings, while noting its limitations in capturing low-populated conformers.

We examined TCR repertoires in double-positive thymocytes and single-positive thymic cells, including CD8 and CD4 effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), derived from male and female organ donors. Minimal sex-based differences were observed in V and J gene usage, and there were no notable differences in TCR repertoire diversity, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length, amino acid composition, or network structure. No TCR sequences were exclusive to either sex. However, female effector T cells exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of TCRs specific to self-antigens implicated in autoimmunity compared to males, while female Tregs showed a reduced frequency of such TCRs. These differences were not observed for TCRs targeting self-antigens unrelated to autoimmunity or antigens associated with cancer or viruses.

We explored Upbound and Downbound cerebellar micromodules, which are organized loops of IO neurons, cerebellar nuclei neurons and microzones of PCs characterized by their unique molecular profiles and different levels of baseline firing. Our findings show synaptic weight convergence followed by stability of synaptic weights. In line with their relatively low and high intrinsic firing, we observed that Upbound and Downbound PCs have a propensity for potentiation and depression, respectively, with both PC types reaching stability at differential levels of overall strength of their parallel-fiber (PF) inputs. The oscillations and coupling of IO neurons participating in the Upbound and Downbound modules determine at which frequency band PFs can be stabilized optimally.

Alteration of metabolism and hormone homeostasis leads to the formation of tumour-like galls in the roots of affected plants. Host plant energy metabolism, defence and developmental processes are under strong temporal control and the very same processes are affected by clubroot. For the first time, this study uses time-resolved transcriptome analyses to explore how P. brassicae affects Arabidopsis thaliana in the night during intermediate (14 days after inoculation; DAI) and late (21 DAI) infection. Day-night differences in gene expression were more pronounced in younger rather than older plants in our differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Consequently, intermediate phases of infection showed more day-night differences than later ones. Clustering of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in functional categories highlighted how some of the typical processes known to be disrupted by clubroot infection are more significantly affected in the night and also uncovered some disrupted exclusively in the night. RNA modification stood out as the most unambiguously upregulated process in infected Arabidopsis roots in the night. Analysis of the interaction between clubroot infection and diel oscillations in gene expression detected modifications in the rhythmicity of central circadian clock components during the infection.

Facial gestures are one fundamental set of communicative behaviors in primates, generated through the dynamic arrangement of dozens of fine muscles. While much progress has been made uncovering the neural mechanisms of face perception, little is known about those controlling facial gesture production. Commensurate with the importance of facial gestures in daily social life, anatomical work has shown that facial muscles are under direct control from multiple cortical regions, including primary and premotor in lateral frontal cortex, and cingulate in medial frontal cortex. Furthermore, neuropsychological evidence from focal lesion patients has suggested that lateral cortex controls voluntary movements, and medial emotional expressions. Here we show that lateral and medial cortical face motor regions encode both types of gestures. They do so through unique temporal activity patterns, distinguishable well-prior to movement onset. During gesture production, cortical regions encoded facial kinematics in a context-dependent manner. Our results show how cortical regions projecting in parallel downstream, but each situated at a different level of a posterior-anterior hierarchy form a continuum of gesture coding from dynamic to temporally stable, in order to produce context-related, coherent motor outputs during social communication.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

We found that NVS are distinctively preceded by neural activity changes in frontal and parietal EEG channels qualitatively different to that for voluntary saccades. However, only the ERP amplitude changes in frontal channels, but not in parietal channels, were different from saccadic preparation. A source reconstruction analysis additionally revealed that presaccadic neural activity originated mainly in the premotor cortex. Frequency spectrum analyses showed increased synchronization in alpha to low gamma bands suggesting complex top-down and bottom-up processing. We propose that this presaccadic activity while thinking represents evidence accumulation and attentional shifts, as shown before in the premotor cortex during sensorimotor tasks.

These sources can originate from distinct channels, such as internally maintained latent cognitive representations or externally presented sensory cues. Because these signals are often stochastic and carry inherent uncertainty, integration is challenging. However, the neural and computational mechanisms that support the integration of such stochastic information remain unknown. We introduce a computational neuroimaging framework to elucidate how brain systems integrate internally maintained and externally cued stochastic information to guide behavior. Neuroimaging data were collected from healthy adult human participants (both male and female). Our computational model estimates trial-by-trial beliefs about internally maintained latent states and externally presented perceptual cues, then integrates them into a unified joint probability distribution. The entropy of this joint distribution quantifies overall uncertainty, which enables continuous tracking of probabilistic task beliefs, prediction errors, and updating dynamics. Results showed that latent-state beliefs are encoded in distinct regions from perceptual beliefs. Latent-state beliefs were encoded in the anterior middle frontal gyrus, mediodorsal thalamus, and inferior parietal lobule, whereas perceptual beliefs were encoded in spatially distinct regions including lateral temporo-occipital areas, intraparietal sulcus, and precentral sulcus. The integrated joint probability and its entropy converged in frontoparietal hub areas, notably middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus. Entropy adaptively reconfigured connectivity, first strengthening coupling with sensory regions, then motor and premotor regions that encode task output, and finally prediction-error circuits.

Here we investigate how microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, regulate the retinal stem cell niche. We identify that bona fide retinal stem cells express the chemokine ccl25b while its cognate receptor, ccr9a, is expressed in microglia. These microglia form a static surveillance ring adjacent to the stem cell niche and actively phagocytose retinal stem cells. We show that targeted mutation of ccl25b affects microglia mobility and leads to reduction of retinal-stem cell-derived material in microglia.

Objectives: To compare the phenotypic, functional, and metabolic profiles of circulating monocytes from individuals with TBI, TBD, and healthy controls (HC), and assess the impact of treatment. Measurements: Peripheral blood monocytes were profiled using high-dimensional flow cytometry, Luminex cytokine/chemokine assays, and SCENITH, a flow-based metabolic assay. Unstimulated and Mtb-stimulated monocytes from treatment-naive and treated individuals were analysed. Main Results: Monocytes from TBI and TBD showed distinct phenotypes from HC, marked by elevated CD14 and CD45RA. HLA-DR was reduced in TBI versus HC and further decreased in TBD. TNF receptors were downregulated in TBI but unchanged in TBD. Baseline cytokine and chemokine profiles in TBI and TBD were similar (yet distinct from HC), but Mtb stimulation elicited a stronger cytokine response in TBI. Metabolically, TBI and TBD monocytes exhibited increased glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial dependence versus HC. Treatment partially restored mitochondrial function. Upon Mtb challenge, TBI monocytes had higher glycolytic capacity than TBD. Conclusions: Monocyte metabolic plasticity and cytokine production distinguish latent from active TB and are partially reversible with treatment. Circulating monocyte metabolism reflects TB immune status and may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target.

In the present work we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show P13L of Omicron enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations, but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles.

Infections by P. jirovecii are treated using the antifolate combination drug trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), targeting the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). In recent years, there has been an increase of treatment failure, with no mutations observed in the DHPS, implying the potential evolution of resistance through this pathogen's DHFR (PjDHFR). Experimental methods to study this pathogen are limited, as it cannot be grown in vitro. Model fungi are insensitive to TMP-SMX due to unknown mechanisms, preventing the use of functional complementation to study mutations causing resistance to this specific drug combination. In a previous study, we conducted deep mutational scanning (DMS) on PjDHFR to identify resistance mutations to methotrexate (MTX), another antifolate drug. Here, by leveraging this data, as well as computational data modeling aspects of protein function and stability in the PjDHFR-MTX complex, we train a machine learning model to predict the effect of mutations on MTX resistance. We find that the model can predict the effect of mutations outside of its training dataset (balanced accuracy on training set: 98.3%, and 88.3% on testing set). We also find that the best predictors of resistance, such as distance to ligand and effect on region flexibility, are coherent with previously established models, and that experimental data about the effect of mutations on protein function is critical to optimize model performance. Using this model on computational data generated using the PjDHFR-TMP complex, we predict the effect of mutations on resistance to TMP. We predict TMP resistance mutations in PjDHFR that did not confer resistance to MTX, one of which had been characterized in vitro as reducing affinity to TMP by 100-folds. We compare the predictions from this model to PjDHFR sequences from previously and newly sequenced clinical samples. Our results offer a resource to interpret the impact of amino acid variants in PjDHFR on TMP resistance, as well as methods to predict resistance in hard-to-study organisms.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

This study investigated this question in the domain of human spatial navigation using high-field fMRI, a novel navigation task, and desktop virtual reality. Participants learned and retrieved spatial locations using landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Behaviorally, participants benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral evidence of cue integration. Notably, the posterior hippocampus exhibited stronger positional coding in the combination condition than in both single-cue conditions. Additionally, positional coding in the hippocampus predominantly reflected actual, rather than self-reported, locations, suggesting relatively early involvement in the cue integration process. These findings suggest that the hippocampus supports precise memory-guided navigation by integrating different spatial cues, a function beyond simple spatial representation. More broadly, this work helps reconcile the longstanding debate regarding the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation versus episodic and relational memory, facilitating a unified understanding of hippocampal function.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

In this study, we found that Slc35g3 knockout male mice were sterile due to impaired sperm functions in uterotubal junction passage, zona pellucida binding, and oocyte fusion. Mouse SLC35G3 has UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity, and its ablation caused abnormal processing of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome membrane proteins.

The adrenergic mechanisms by which intramyocardial nerves contribute to arrhythmogenesis are poorly understood. Semaphorin-plexin signaling pathways are responsible for developmental guidance of sympathetic nerves onto the heart and have previously been associated with VAs in humans. Objective: To investigate adrenergic control of arrhythmogenesis, we probed the cardiac electrophysiology of a Plexin-A3/-A4 double knockout mouse with loss of cardiac adrenergic nerves. Methods: We studied cardiac structure and function using tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry, and echocardiography. We utilized ECG and optical mapping of action potentials to evaluate electrophysiologic responses to pharmacologic beta ({beta})-adrenergic stimulation and blockade. We measured circulating catecholamines and quantified {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) density in cardiac membranes. Finally, we performed a phenome-wide association study utilizing data from the UK Biobank to search for associations between PLXNA4 and human arrhythmias. Results: Mice with loss of plexin-dependent cardiac innervation had structurally normal hearts but displayed spontaneous VAs driven by adrenergic hypersensitivity, as well as increased cardiac {beta}AR density. Several human PLXNA4 variants were associated with arrhythmia phenotypes. Conclusion: These data establish a model of VAs driven by enhanced adrenergic receptor signaling, in the absence of structural heart disease, which can be used to investigate adrenergic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and to identify novel antiarrhythmic targets.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

It is thus critical to better understand their immune system and mechanisms of antiviral immunity. Despite an increasing number of studies, much is still unknown about the molecular mechanisms that govern bat-virus interactions, especially given the large diversity of bat species. Dicer is a conserved ribonuclease with multiple activities that can modulate antiviral immunity, including the detection of viral RNA as part of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, the maturation of micro RNAs, and the direct inhibition of innate immunity in mouse and human cells. In view of these complex activities of Dicer, we tested its antiviral activity in Myotis myotis nasal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we did not see strong evidence of RNAi in these cells, but instead saw a proviral effect of Dicer for two alphaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki forest virus. We also observed a striking relocalization of Dicer to cytoplasmic foci upon infection with these viruses, which did not occur in the several human cell lines we tested. These foci contained dsRNA and viral plus strand RNA, suggesting that they are sites of viral replication. Finally, we found that factors specific to M. myotis cells are needed for Dicer relocalization. Overall, we propose that Dicer can play different roles in different bat species and/or cell types, and is being repurposed by alphaviruses to promote viral replication.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The current study developed novel cell-assembled scaffolds for co-delivering human ASCs and ECFCs within a supportive decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) matrix, with the objective of enhancing their localized retention and augmenting their capacity to stimulate adipose tissue regeneration. Human ASCs and ECFCs were seeded separately onto human-derived DAT microcarriers under cell-type specific conditions.

Co-culture with ECFCs within the scaffolds was shown to modulate ASC pro-angiogenic gene expression, with some ECFCs forming tubule-like structures in vitro in both the ASC+ECFC and ECFC alone groups. In vivo bioluminescence imaging using a dual luciferase reporter system showed that co-delivery with ASCs enhanced ECFC retention following subcutaneous implantation in athymic nu/nu mice, but co-delivery did not alter the localized retention of viable ASCs.

Due to the distinct growth dynamics of each strain, uncontrolled consortia have unstable composition dynamics, leading to the rapid loss of the community level function. Several approaches have been developed to stabilize consortia, with most relying on communicated-mediated growth and death feedback. These approaches require accurate communication between strains to maintain control, something which is not guaranteed under non-well-mixed conditions. As such, these methods are of limited utility in consortia applications with poorly mixed environments e.g. industrial scale bioreactors or soil. Here, inspired by microbial phase variation dynamics, we introduce an alternative, communication-free approach in which a set of genetically identical cells switch stochastically between distinct phenotypes. In this scheme, the population composition is dynamically stable and determined by the rates of transitions between states. Mathematical modeling indicates that this approach can stabilize consortia. Experimentally, we used reversible DNA inversions catalyzed by serine recombinases to implement a dynamic consortium. We then characterized the dynamic properties of the consortium at the single cell and bulk levels, and demonstrated control in 2- and 3-state consortia.

We tested the hypothesis that non-invasive audiovisual stimulation in the form of flashing lights and sounds (flicker) at 40 Hz improves attention in an attentional vigilance task and affects neural oscillations associated with attention. We recorded scalp EEG activity of healthy adults (n=62) during one hour of either 40 Hz audiovisual flicker, no flicker as control, or randomized flicker as sham stimulation, while subjects performed a psychomotor vigilance task. Participants exposed to 40 Hz flicker stimulation had better accuracy and faster reaction times than participants in the control groups.

This method reconstructs pedigrees by iteratively incorporating pairwise kinship relations into a set of candidate pedigrees, with pruning and sampling to reduce its search space; it optionally considers supporting information such as haplogroups and skeletal age-at-death estimates. We evaluate this method on a variety of simulated pedigrees with varying error rates and missingness. We also use this method to reconstruct several published pedigrees that were originally manually reconstructed; for one, we present a potential alternative topology. repare optionally incorporates user-inferred pedigree constraints, enabling \"human-in-the-loop\" reconstruction workflows. Especially when used with these user-inferred constraints, we find that repare represents a powerful and flexible tool for ancient pedigree reconstruction.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Droplet-based single cell technologies, particularly those based on nuclei isolation, such as simultaneous RNA+ATAC single-cell multiome, are susceptible to exogenous ambient molecule contamination, which can increase noise in cell type-level associations. We reasoned that genotype-based sample multiplexing can provide an opportunity to infer this ambient contamination by leveraging DNA variation in sequenced reads. Thus, we developed ambimux, a likelihood-based method to estimate ambient fractions and demultiplex single-cell multiome experiments using genotype-level data. Ambimux models the ambient or nuclear probability at the read level and thus can classify empty droplets and estimate droplet-specific ambient molecule fractions in each modality. We first evaluated our method using simulated data sets across a range of parameters. We found that ambimux closely estimated the ground truth droplet contamination fractions in the RNA (MAE=0.048) and ATAC (MAE=0.042) modalities. As a result, ambimux maintained high specificity (>95%) and was able to correctly assign singlets at considerably high ambient fractions (up to 60%) for both RNA and ATAC modalities. In comparison with models that do not consider ambient contamination, these only maintained similar sensitivity levels at considerably lower ambient fractions (up to 25%). We then generated a real data set of seven visceral adipose tissue biopsies run on a single 10x Multiome channel. We ran ambimux and detected 4,986 singlets, capturing similar numbers as other methods. Then, we sought to evaluate the fidelity of the ambient fraction estimates from ambimux. We split singlets into ambient-enriched (>5% contamination in both modalities) or nuclear-enriched (<5% in both) droplets and performed gene-peak linkage analysis. Low ambient droplets resulted in more significant hits with gene-peak links enriched at the transcription start site relative to high ambient droplets, suggesting that the ambient droplets identified by ambimux hamper the identification of biologically meaningful signals. In summary, we developed a joint single-cell multiome demultiplexing method, ambimux, that accurately models and estimates ambient molecule contamination in each modality.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether items from the same psychological scale evoke similar neural activation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region consistently implicated in self-referential processing. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants completed a self-reference task in which they judged how well 72 personality-related questionnaire items (e.g., from the Big Five, emotion regulation, and well-being scales) described themselves. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that items from the same scale elicited more similar multivoxel activation patterns in the mPFC compared to items from different scales. This effect was specific to the self-reference task and was not observed during a semantic judgment control task using the same items. Furthermore, the mPFC encoded not only categorical scale membership but also graded psychological similarity among scales, as reflected in inter-scale behavioral correlations. Importantly, these effects remained significant even after controlling for sentence-level semantic similarity using multiple regression RSA, indicating that the observed neural structure reflects psychological rather than linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that the mPFC integrates internally constructed evidence in a construct-sensitive manner during self-report, and they open new avenues for linking psychological assessment with neural representation. We discuss the implications for understanding self-report as a cognitive process and for future work on neuroimaging-informed scale validation.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Here, using a macaque model of SIV/Mtb coinfection, we investigated whether treatment of SIV infection with ART influenced control of a subsequent Mtb challenge compared to SIV infected macaques who were not treated with ART. Using a macaque model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-Mtb co-infection, macaques were first infected with SIVB670, SIVB670 with ART, or saline followed by a low-dose Mtb inoculation with serial clinical, microbiological, PET CT imaging, and immunologic assessments. At necropsy, gross pathology, viremia, bacterial burden, and immunologic parameters were compared. SIV-TB animals had greater gross pathology and total bacterial burden than TB only and SIV/ART/TB groups. However, despite normal blood CD4 counts and undetectable SIV RNA, SIV/ART/TB macaques showed similar clinical parameters and extrapulmonary involvement as SIV/TB animals. Analysis of barcoded-Mtb suggests ART control of SIV replication does not prevent Mtb extrapulmonary dissemination. These data indicate that people living with HIV on ART remain at high risk of bacterial dissemination and extrapulmonary TB disease, particularly when methods to identify extrapulmonary disease are inconsistent.

Here, we report elevated circulating pro-apoptotic proteins in EOPE patients at early pregnancy, along with concurrent CASP3 activation and GSDME cleavage in a subset of EOPE placentas. Using multiple trophoblast cell lines, we demonstrate that trophoblast cells, which highly express GSDME, undergo a shift from apoptosis to CASP3-dependent pyroptosis, driving inflammation. Notably, pyroptotic trophoblasts further induce pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization within placental villi organoids, establishing a feedback loop that amplifies both trophoblast pyroptosis and inflammatory responses in trophoblast organoids-macrophage assembloids. In vivo, CASP3-GSDME-mediated trophoblast pyroptosis contributes to systemic inflammation in wild-type pregnant mice but not in Gsdme-/- mice.

We tested whether the distribution of Bd in natural aquatic environments can predict host infection patterns.

Using a high-capacity water filtration method coupled with digital and real-time PCR detection assays, we quantified Bd in water and amphibian samples. Our results revealed a strong positive correlation between Bd DNA concentrations in water samples and infection loads on amphibian skin samples.

E.; Kravitz, A.", "abstract": "Deficits in social motivation are a core feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. While a range of tools have been developed to quantify social motivation in rodents, most rely on brief tests in dedicated apparatuses that can introduce stress and novelty, potentially reducing test reliability. Most current approaches are also typically not suited to studying learning across days or circadian rhythms of social motivation. To address these challenges, we developed a social operant task that can run around-the-clock for multiple days in the mouse homecage, continuously monitoring social motivation around the circadian cycle. The task consists of a custom-built automated door that was installed between two rodent homecages and configured so one mouse could trigger the door to open with a nose-poke action from within their cage. When open, the door allows for social interaction with the neighboring mouse through a perforated stainless-steel panel, which did not allow the mice to cross over into the neighboring cage. Mice opened the door multiple times each day, allowing us to quantify their amount and daily rhythms of social motivation. In our first experiment, C57BL/6J mice (both sexes) were individually housed with an empty adjacent cage for five days, after which a same-sex social partner was introduced for another nine days. Mice opened the door at significantly higher rates when the social partner was present vs. absent, confirming that mice were motivated to earn social interaction. This task also revealed a circadian rhythm to social motivation that peaked about 2 hours after the peak in their feeding rhythm. We speculate that mice first addressed their caloric needs each day before changing their priority to social behavior. Given prior literature implicating the dopamine system in social motivation, we also tested whether dopamine antagonists would block social motivation in our task in a new group of 14 mice (both sexes). The dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (delivered systemically at 0.3mg/kg SC) reduced social seeking without affecting locomotor activity or food intake, demonstrating a selective role for dopamine D1 receptors in social motivation. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (delivered systemically at 0.3mg/kg SC) also reduced social seeking, but reduced locomotor activity and food intake as well, demonstrating a general reduction in behavior that was not specific to social motivation. Overall, our task offers a way for studying social motivation in the rodent homecage, which has advantages for studying disorders that involve both social and circadian disruptions.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The reasons why some people attract more mosquito bites than others remain largely mysterious. In the Mosquito Magnet Trial, we investigated differences in mosquito attraction amongst festivalgoers with varying levels of hygiene and intoxication. Methods Our study was conducted in a slightly steamy pop-up laboratory inside four connected shipping containers at Lowlands Festival in The Netherlands (August 18-20, 2023). Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire on hygiene, diet, and festival-related behaviour (including alcohol uptake and shared sleeping arrangements). Mosquito attraction was measured using a custom designed setup: a transparent cage with perforations where female Anopheles mosquitoes were offered a choice between a sugar-feeder and the participants arm. Mosquitoes could only smell, not bite, the participant's arm. Attraction was quantified through video imaging, measuring arm landings relative to total landings. Mosquito attraction was correlated with questionnaire responses and skin microbiota profiles collected from forearm skin swabs. Results Amongst the 465 included participants, mosquitoes showed a clear fondness for those who drank beer over those who abstained from the liquid gold (Fold Change 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.63, PFDR<0.001). Attraction was also contagious: participants that successfully lured a fellow human into their tent the previous night also proved more enticing to mosquitoes (FC 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.58, PFDR=0.002). Meanwhile, skipping the morning showering routine and using sunscreen reduced mosquito attraction (FC 0.52, 95% 0.38-0.70, PFDR<0.001). Streptococci were more abundant on the skin of highly attractive individuals (Puncorrected=0.017), and the overall abundance of malodour associated bacteria was high -- possibly reflecting the container's smell. Conclusion The Mosquito Magnet Trial, to our knowledge the largest study of its kind, was conducted in a loosely controlled setting with a selection bias towards science loving festivalgoers. That said, using our custom designed experimental set-up, we found that mosquitoes are drawn to those who avoid sunscreen, drink beer, and share their bed.

Our previous studies demonstrated that WNT2B loss-of-function leads to severe intestinal enteropathy in humans and increases chemically-induced colitis in mice, suggesting a protective function in the colon. Therefore, we investigated how loss of WNT2B affects CRC development. We used azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to model colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and AOM-induced mutagenesis to model sporadic CRC. We measured the number and size of tumors and performed histopathological and molecular analyses. We also analyzed the Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate WNT2B expression in human colon cancer. In CAC and CRC mouse models, Wnt2b KO mice showed decreased survival and enhanced tumor burden. Moreover, Wnt2b KO mice had larger tumors and enhanced dysplasia, with a higher frequency of animals progressing from adenomas to adenocarcinomas compared to control littermates. Wnt2b KO animals frequently presented with intestinal bleeding and rectum prolapse, which resembles obstructive CRC. Furthermore, WNT2B expression was downregulated in human CRC samples compared to healthy controls, which predicted a significantly lower patient survival. These findings support the conclusion that WNT2B is required for maximal resistance against tumorigenesis and raise the possibility that selectively increasing WNT2B signaling may be a useful colon cancer prevention strategy.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

We investigate sex-specific alterations in brain vascular function and cognition in a murine model of preeclampsia induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Methods: Pregnant mice received L-NAME (gestational day 7 to 19). Offspring were assessed at postnatal day 5 (P5) and in adulthood (4-5 months). Brain vascular development, angiogenesis, perfusion, cold-induced vasoconstriction, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity were assessed in vivo and ex vivo. Offspring's serum was applied to brain endothelial cell cultures to evaluate endothelial activation and barrier function. Adult cognitive performance was evaluated through behavioral tests and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) recordings. Results: L-NAME offspring (P5) exhibited reduced brain vascular density, decreased tip cell formation, and impaired cold-induced vasoconstriction, most prominently in males. BBB integrity was compromised, with increased permeability and reduced expression of tight junction proteins (claudin-5, ZO-1), again more pronounced in males. Serum from L-NAME offspring induced endothelial activation and barrier dysfunction in vitro. These effects were accompanied by increased brain and systemic levels of hypoxia markers and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-). Adult L-NAME offspring showed cognitive deficits in recognition and spatial memory tasks, with female offspring displaying more pronounced impairments. These behavioral findings paralleled a reduced magnitude and impaired stabilization of hippocampal LTP in females. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to a preeclampsia-like environment induces persistent, sex-specific neurovascular and cognitive deficits in offspring.

In this study, we investigated the role of epigenetic regulation, particularly DNA methylation mediated by DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1), in early seedling biomass heterosis using hybrids between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Columbia-0 and C24. Loss of DDM1 function in F hybrids resulted in a significant reduction of rosette diameter, confirming that DDM1 is essential for heterosis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses revealed extensive genotype-specific changes in gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in ddm1 mutants. Notably, ddm1-F hybrids exhibited upregulation of genes categorized into 'xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity' and downregulation of genes categorized into 'circadian rhythm', which may contribute to reduced growth vigor. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing showed widespread hypomethylation in ddm1 mutants, yet the overlap between differentially methylated and expressed genes was limited, suggesting indirect or context-dependent regulatory effects. Additionally, we examined the role of salicylic acid (SA) in heterosis using SA-deficient mutants and found that variations in endogenous SA levels did not correlate with biomass heterosis under normal conditions. Our findings suggest that heterosis in A. thaliana is dependent on the maintenance of parental epigenetic divergence, particularly in DNA methylation patterns mediated by DDM1.

Biochemical characterization of the two recombinant enzymes confirmed activity on PET, the primary degradation products Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and Mono-(Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). These are the first DLHs to be reported being active on plastics and our findings indicate that Flavobacteria harbor an unexpectedly wide range of PET-active promiscuous enzymes.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The development of rapid visual detection methods capable of distinguishing epidemic MDV-1 strains from vaccine strains is crucial for early disease warning, vaccine efficacy evaluation, and precise disease control. We developed a novel isothermal detection system that integrates recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with CRISPR/Cas14a technology for the visual identification of epidemic MDV-1 strains. This method operates at a constant temperature of 37{degrees}C and allows for either real-time analysis or endpoint visual readout without the need for complex instrumentation. Our results showed no cross-reactivity with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), MDV-1 vaccine strains, or herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT). Plasmid DNA standards were used to determine the sensitivity of the assay and the detection limit was 24.6 copies/L. Clinical evaluation using 24 field samples confirmed that the method successfully identified all MDV-positive cases, demonstrating its diagnostic reliability. In conclusion, we have developed a rapid, instrument-free, and highly specific nucleic acid detection platform for MDV-1 by combining the sensitivity of RPA with the specificity of CRISPR/Cas14a technology, offering promising potential for field-based diagnostics and disease surveillance.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

We introduce single-molecule Flow Cytometry (smFC), integrating high-numerical aperture oblique plane microscopy (OPM) with microfluidics to achieve optical sectioning and photon collection efficiencies suitable for single-molecule detection on flowing cells. Using super-bright, large Stokes shift fluorophores, smFC can detect labelled membrane proteins on cells with digital precision down to ~2 molecules per cell, compared to an unlabelled control. This represents an improvement in the detection limit of 10 to 80-fold depending on the probe. We apply smFC to quantify the distribution of the membrane receptor c-kit in triple-negative breast cancer cells with unprecedented sensitivity. This revealed a previously unidentified distribution of 60% c-kit negative cells and 40% with low-abundance but heterogenous (1-200 mol/cell) surface distribution that is undetectable by conventional FC. These results establish smFC as a robust platform for high-throughput, quantitative single-molecule analysis in cell populations, opening new avenues for detecting rare biomarkers and quantifying the presence of low-abundance membrane proteins and targetable surface molecules with digital precision.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

We observed a strong dichotomy between the mAbs based on reactivity profile.

C.; Rapp, J. D.; Iavarone, A. T.; Carlson, H. K.; Coates, J. D.", "abstract": "The anaerobic conversion of organic matter to methane and carbon dioxide typically relies on obligate syntrophic interactions between bacteria and methanogenic archaea, where interspecies hydrogen (H2) transfer enables thermodynamically constrained reactions to proceed near equilibrium. Syntrophs couple the oxidation of fermentation products such as fatty acids and alcohols to the reduction of protons to form H2. These reactions can only proceed if low H2 concentrations are maintained by H2-consuming syntrophic partners. Here, we describe \"lithosyntrophy,\" a novel mode of syntrophic interaction in which electrons that drive hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis originate from an inorganic compound rather than from the canonical organic substrates. Candidatus Phosphitivorax anaerolimi strain Phox-21 oxidizes phosphite (HPOH32-, oxidation state +3) to phosphate coupled to hydrogenogenesis in an obligate energetic dependency on a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanoculleus sp. Physiology experiments, thermodynamic calculations, genomic annotation, and metaproteomics analysis collectively revealed a mechanism for syntrophic phosphite oxidation in Phox-21, which requires phosphite, acetate, and CO2 as co-substrates. In this pathway, electrons derived from phosphite drive H2 production via an electron-confurcating hydrogenase. Unlike previously characterized acetogenic phosphite oxidizers that grow without exogenous acetate, Phox-21 requires acetate to regenerate AMP, a cofactor required by the phosphite dehydrogenase, PtdF. Lithosyntrophic phosphite oxidizers may play important roles both in transferring reducing equivalents as well as biologically available phosphorus to other members of their surrounding microbial communities. We infer that lithosyntrophic DPO emerged before acetoclastic methanogenesis and was a major sink for acetate in the Archaean when phosphite was more abundant.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Previously Cotton et al. (2020) identified underground isoleucine biosynthesis routes that can replace the canonical route in Escherichia coli, after they deleted the enzymes that catalyze the formation of its precursor 2-ketobutyrate. Using this strain and short-term evolution we identify a new pathway for isoleucine biosynthesis based on the promiscuous activity of the native enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase II. We demonstrate that this enzyme catalyzes the previously unreported condensation of glyoxylate with pyruvate to generate 2-ketobutyrate in vivo. The gene encoding this enzyme, ilvG, is inactivated by a frameshift mutation in the laboratory model strain E. coli K-12 MG1655. Its evolutionary reactivation we report here points to a potential natural role in isoleucine biosynthesis in E. coli. Isoleucine biosynthesis proceeds with a further condensation step of 2-ketobutyrate with pyruvate, again catalyzed by AHAS, giving the proposed pathway the unusual property of recursivity. The discovered enzyme activity uses glyoxylate and pyruvate as direct central metabolic precursors for isoleucine biosynthesis instead of its canonical  indirect biosynthesis via the amino acid threonine. Unlike previously discovered underground isoleucine routes by Cotton et al., this route is more likely to play a role in natural isoleucine biosynthesis in E. coli due to the use of ubiquitous metabolites and its activity in aerobic conditions. The discovered route further expands the known metabolic space for isoleucine biosynthesis in E. coli and potentially other organisms, and could find applications in biotechnological isoleucine production.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

In a transcriptomic study of respiratory nasal swab specimens from children hospitalised with acute wheeze, a significant alteration was found in the expression of the serine/arginine rich splicing factor (SRSF) kinase, SRPK1, between HRV positive children with acute exacerbations and HRV negative controls. As this kinase can regulate host RNA splicing, we hypothesised that HRV infection could dysregulate the expression of host mRNAs to affect antiviral functions or to alter the morphological features of the infected respiratory epithelium. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of SRPK1 in primary bronchial epithelial cells resulted in increased HRV16 replication while overexpression of SRPK1 reduced viral replication. In a primary bronchial epithelial 3D model infected with HRV16 decreased phosphorylation of SRSF1, 3 and 6 was observed. Furthermore, transcriptomic and alternative splicing (AS) bioinformatic analysis revealed the significantly altered AS of 1228 host genes during infection. Subsequent pathway analysis revealed the enrichment of most of these genes in networks related to cilia development and function.

We hypothesized that a wheat mutant defective in root hair elongation could recruit more P-cycling bacteria and AMF compared to its wild-type background to compensate for the loss of root hairs. Through quantitative polymerase chain reaction and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) staining, we quantified the enrichment of bacterial P-cycling genes and AMF colonization across different stages of wheat development and in differentially P fertilized soils in the presence and absence of root hair elongation. The loss of root hair elongation led to an enrichment of P-cycling bacteria during very early seedling development, where P mineralizing bacteria dominated over P solubilizing bacteria. The AMF symbiosis was only fully established after several weeks of growth, but then arbuscularisation became dominant over bacterial P mineralization in the root hair mutant. Wheat can recruit and rely on bacterial P mineralization to meet their P needs before the AMF symbiosis is fully dominant and then release these bacteria once the AMF symbiosis is developed.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

R.; Moran, D.", "abstract": "The concept of resource extraction in the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is rarely explored. In this framework, antimicrobial susceptibility is viewed as a finite resource that is depleted through the use of antimicrobials -- thus, AMR represents the exhaustion of this resource. In this work, we examine the system dynamics of AMR using causal loop diagrams to define both the structure and behaviour of two variants of the system. We then evaluate the robustness of the system dynamics models through sensitivity testing. The first model is inspired by a classic \"Limits to Growth\" structure, in which antimicrobial use practices depend on recent observations of treatment success or failure. The second differs by including AMR surveillance informing antimicrobial prescribing instead of anecdotal experience. The models consider one \"bug-drug-mutation-context\" combination at a time, but can be applied to different microbes, antimicrobials, and host populations in human or veterinary contexts. Multiparameter sensitivity analyses of relative fitness and timescale parameters were carried out on both model variants. Several key differences in model behaviour over time were observed between the socio-ecological Limits to Growth structure and the modified version in which human judgment, with its associated time lag, is bypassed. The models help explore the effects of human behaviour and associated time lags on patterns of population-level antimicrobial susceptibility over time, applying an established modelling technique in a novel context to generate new insights -- notably that plateaux in AMR observed in the field could be in part due to human behaviour rather than purely evolutionary forces. The framing of antimicrobial susceptibility as a variably renewable natural resource is valuable not only as an avenue for alternative modelling approaches, but also as a more collaborative framing for public and policy engagement to promote sustainable management of this common pool resource.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Community composition changes with the growth of individual members, yet current methods to estimate microbial growth in communities face substantial limitations.

Gene expression data provide an information-rich readout of community activity that could reflect growth, however, cross-species comparisons in community settings remain challenging. An approach using expression signatures of universal, single-copy marker genes provides independence from reference genomes and may thereby enable comparability across species. Here, we present a transcriptomic, marker gene-based growth classifier that predicts the growth states of bacterial strains from different phyla cultivated in diverse conditions. We demonstrate its application in vivo in gnotobiotic mice carrying the same bacterial strains, and in a more complex synthetic community, where predicted growth states align with reported growth inhibition induced by systemic inflammatory response.

These bacteria are often co-isolated in polymicrobial urinary tract and lung infections, the latter of which is associated with increased disease severity and worse clinical outcomes. Despite their overlapping niches and clinical relevance, little is known about how these two pathogens interact and how those interactions influence human health. Given the growing recognition that microbial interactions are key drivers of disease, we investigated how P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae influence one another. We discovered an antagonistic interaction in which P. aeruginosa restricts the growth of K. pneumoniae. This inhibition is driven by phenazine production in P. aeruginosa, specifically the secondary metabolites pyocyanin and pyorubin, which are both necessary and sufficient to suppress K. pneumoniae growth. Using a diverse set of clinical isolates, we found that this antagonism is strain dependent. Both the susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to phenazines and the ability of P. aeruginosa to restrict K. pneumoniae growth varies between strains. Moreover, the necessity of phenazine production is specific to the site of infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that strain background and environmental context are critical determinants of pathogen interactions.

This change has coincided with rapid alterations in ice-dependent ecosystems, including those supporting crabeater seals - the most abundant Antarctic seal and one of the largest mammalian consumers of krill. Despite their ecological importance, population estimates for ice seals remain scarce due to the difficulty of surveying large-scale, remote, ice-covered habitats. In 2023, during an abnormally low sea ice year, we conducted aerial surveys over Crystal Sound and Marguerite Bay during the end of the breeding season, flying over 1,000 km of transects. Seals were extremely sparse in the resulting imagery - occupying less than 1% of the surveyed area. This posed a significant challenge for both manual annotation and automated detection.

Our method leverages hierarchical clustering with just two tunable parameters, avoiding the computational burden and opacity of deep learning models. Using this method, we identified 758 seals within a ~350 km2 survey subset, achieving a test recall of 82%. In the absence of concurrent tagging data to estimate haul-out corrections, we refrain from extrapolating to a population estimate.

We conducted a large-scale forest experiment in 11 regions across Germany. Each region included two districts, representing small forest landscapes. In one district, we implemented patches with ESBC treatments, while in the other, serving as the control, we established patches without ESBC. Hoverflies were sampled in three seasonal intervals and across, in total, 234 forest patches (50 x 50 m) using pan traps. We applied a new integrative meta-analytic framework that incorporates sample completeness to quantify taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity (TD, FD, PD) using Hill numbers at , {beta}, and {gamma} scales. All three {gamma}-diversity dimensions - TD, FD, and PD - were significantly higher in structurally heterogeneous forest landscapes than in homogeneous ones. The strongest effects were observed for TD, indicating functional and phylogenetic redundancy among species. Effect sizes declined with increasing order of Hill numbers, suggesting that rare species benefit most from structural heterogeneity. In most regions, {gamma}-diversity gains were driven by increases in -diversity rather than {beta}-diversity, highlighting the importance of interventions to increase local structural complexity.

Here, we explored the population diversification of the filamentous cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus, a photoautotrophic edificator with significant importance for dryland ecosystems worldwide. By constructing a 132-genome dataset spanning multiple climate zones across four continents, we integrated intraspecific genomics with environmental association analyses to elucidate the population genetic structure and molecular mechanisms underlying the divergence of the M. vaginatus continuum. Our findings reveal that adaptive differentiation is driven by the combined effects of natural selection, homologous recombination, and gene family turnover, with varying contributions across different phylogroups. The evolution of core and accessory genomes exhibits complementary patterns, with genome-wide association studies demonstrating the predominant role of the core genome in population divergence. Selection, followed by neutral evolution and recombination, mediates trade-offs in life-history strategies, while environmental factors shape these evolutionary processes. Notably, while local edaphic variables exert direct influences on Tajima's D values, they demonstrate predominantly indirect modulation through alterations in the selection-to-gene gain ratio (S/G). pH emerges as the principal abiotic driver governing population genetic signatures, operating through coordinated effects on both S/G and the proportion of selected genes undergoing recombination (SUR).

However, the factors that influence the integration and long-term retention of transferred genes remain poorly understood. The pangenome of the grass Alloteropsis has a high turnover of laterally acquired genes, and here we combine expression, methylation and genomic data to identify factors promoting their long-term persistence. Most transferred genes appear to be degenerating, showing lower expression levels and/or greater sequence truncation compared to their vertically inherited homologs. These degenerating genes also show significantly higher levels of DNA methylation, potentially indicating transcriptional silencing. The likelihood of a transferred gene being retained will be influenced by how easily it can be expressed in the recipient genome. In Alloteropsis, putatively functional laterally acquired genes had expression levels significantly more similar to their donor xenolog than to their vertically inherited homolog. This pattern suggests that transferred genes may carry cis-regulatory elements encoded on the fragment of DNA that moves between species, facilitating their expression in the new genomic context. Evolutionary novelty may also increase the likelihood that selection retains a transferred gene. However, only a significant difference in expression level, not sequence divergence, between donor and recipient orthologs is associated with successful lateral gene transfer. Overall, our results show that most transferred genes degrade over time.

Our results revealed a substantial variation among populations in genetic diversity and interpopulation differentiation which was strongly related to known host. Populations known to specialize on Atlantic salmon exhibited high genetic diversity (mean He = 0.24) and low inter-population differentiation (Fst = 0.026), even between rivers draining to opposite coasts. In contrast, populations known to specialize on brown trout or occurring where only trout are available consistently showed lower genetic diversity (mean He = 0.15 / 0.14) and much higher inter-population differentiation (Fst = 0.160 / 0.271), with many populations being highly genetically distinct even when geographically proximate. Principal component analysis and neighbor-joining trees confirmed this pattern, with salmon-specialist populations clustering together while trout-associated populations formed discrete, population-specific clusters. These findings mirror previously observed patterns in other parts of the M. margaritifera range and indicate that population sizes and migratory behavior of hosts may drive contrasting evolutionary trajectories in pearl mussel populations. The striking genetic differences between salmon- and trout-specialist populations have important implications for conservation planning, as they indicate differential capacity for local adaptation and vulnerability to reduced population sizes. Our results suggest that population genetic characteristics could be used to predict host associations for unstudied populations, providing a valuable tool for conservation management. The study emphasizes the importance of considering both direct impacts on pearl mussel populations and the status of their salmonid hosts when developing conservation strategies for this rapidly declining species.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells with regenerative, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, making them a promising tool in cell-based therapies. Increasing evidence suggests the therapeutic effects of MSCs are largely mediated by secreted paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate extracellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to target cells. The lipid composition of EVs is critical for their stability, uptake, and functional activity. Sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide, plays a key role in EV biogenesis by influencing membrane curvature allowing for invagination and budding of MVBs. However, the impact of SMase treatment on the characteristics and therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs remains largely unexplored. In this study, human MSCs were cultured with SMase for 24 hours and EVs were isolated via ultracentrifugation. EV size distribution was analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), microRNA (miRNA) profile was determined using RNA-sequencing, while lipidomic and proteomic profiling were assessed using mass spectrometry. Functional assays were conducted to assess changes in bioactivity. NTA revealed a shift in EV production, with a higher vesicle concentration in SMase induced MSCs compared to untreated cells. SMase treatment significantly altered MSC-EV composition, leading to increased ceramide and glycosphingolipids. In addition, the modifications in protein and miRNA EV cargo were found to be associated with pathways involving TNF- signaling, vesicle trafficking, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Functional assays indicated greater suppression of TNF- in activated macrophages and greater tubular network formation in HUVECS. These findings provide new insights into distinct biophysical and biochemical changes in MSC-derived EVs following SMase stimulation, potentially enhancing their therapeutic properties and may inform strategies for optimizing future EV-based therapies.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Mutations in DBP residues disrupt HNH activation and impair the coupled catalytic activity of both nucleases, identifying this cryptic DBP as a key regulator of Cas9 metal-dependent activity.

This expansion triggers neuropathological events, leading to progressive motor disturbances. Currently, no approved therapy exists for this debilitating condition, but compelling evidence suggests that targeting the serotonergic system can significantly attenuate SCA3 disease progression in animal models. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of NLX-112, a highly selective serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) full agonist, in the CMVMJD135 transgenic mouse model of SCA3. Methods: NLX-112 (0.625 and 5 mg/kg/day) and tandospirone (a 5-HT1AR partial agonist used as a comparator; 20 and 80 mg/kg/day) were administered chronically in drinking water for 34 weeks, starting prior to symptom onset. To evaluate the effects of the drugs on SCA3 mice, motor-related behavioral tests and neuropathological techniques were employed. Results: Treatment with the higher dose of NLX-112 led to improvements in motor coordination and balance, and slowing of symptom deterioration as the disease progressed. These beneficial effects were not achieved with tandospirone. NLX-112 treatment also elicited neuroprotective effects, reducing dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) cell loss and astrocyte reactivity in the substantia nigra. Conclusions: NLX-112 treatment, started presymptomatically, enhanced motor function, slowed disease progression and elicited neuroprotective effects in SCA3 mice, supporting its further development as a drug candidate for treatment of ataxia and related movement disorders.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

We identified cathepsin B as a novel upstream activator of caspase-8 activation through a non-canonical cleavage mechanism, conferring to caspase-8 an original activity profile distinct from its apoptotic role. Disruption of this cathepsin-B-caspase-8 axis, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only impairs the generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages but also reprograms these cells towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype.

M.; OByrne, C.", "abstract": "Abstract In the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, SigB is the central regulator of general stress response (GSR) and it mediates host entry by promoting acid resistance and epithelial cell attachment. The post-translational regulation of SigB activity is complex and is controlled by multiple genes. There is significant evidence that mutations can readily arise in these regulatory genes, or in sigB itself, leading to reduced SigB activity, which suggests that there is considerable genetic plasticity In the GSR. To further investigate this, we defined the complete genome sequence of a clinical isolate with attenuated SigB activity and investigated how it adapts to lethal acidic challenge (mimicking the selective pressure encountered during entry into the host). Acid resistance developed rapidly and 6 acid resistant derivatives (ARDs) were selected for further investigation. All 6 ARDs restored SigB activity due to mutations acquired in rsbW, which encodes an antagonist of SigB. These mutations resulted in non-canonical start codons (rsbWATG to rsbWATA or rsbWATT) or premature translation termination (rsbW-). A translational reporter assay demonstrated distinct differences in translation efficiency between three start codons: ATG>ATA>ATT, suggesting that a perturbation of RsbW:SigB stoichiometry alters SigB activity. We then analysed start codon usage for all conserved genes in 60,692 L. monocytogenes genomes available in the NCBI database. This analysis revealed flexible usage of start codons associated with genetic clades in 39 conserved genes, 13 of which are involved in virulence and stress response. Further, we show that flexible use of canonical start codons (ATG and GTG) also mediates different levels of expression of virulence and stress response genes. Taken together, we show the genetic plasticity of GSR regulation in a model pathogen, and highlight the importance of translational control as a means of fine-tuning gene expression during short-term adaptation and long-term evolution for optimal fitness. Author Summary The general stress response (GSR) in foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is important for environmental stress response and for host entry, but GSR is also highly variable across wild isolates. In this study, we analysed the evolutionary trajectory of a clinical isolate with attenuated GSR and characterized the adaption by this strain to a host-mimicking stress (acidic condition). Under extreme selective pressure, mutations disabling a negative regulator of the GSR were enriched. Interestingly, several independently occurring mutations negatively affect the translation initiation by using non-canonical start codons. Prompted by this, we analysed the population-wide start codon usage by examining all available L. monocytogenes genomes available (n = 60,690). This analysis revealed differential start codon usage in 39 conserved genes that are associated with different genetic clades. Furthermore, we demonstrated differential translation efficiencies between the different canonical start codons. This work highlights the genetic plasticity of GSR in the important food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes and shows that altered translational start codon can be used as means of regulatory control. Together the data suggest that genetic changes in the regulation of the GSR might confer niche-specific fitness advantages.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

This is because measuring colony-forming units (CFU), the standard assay to quantify inhibition, is too slow, labour-intensive, and costly, and can be unreliable at high drug concentrations. To offer an alternative for high antimicrobial concentrations, we measured the change in light intensity from bioluminescent Escherichia coli over time and compared it with the change in CFU counts as a proxy for population size. Currently, luminescence assays are commonly used below the MIC, but have not yet been evaluated extensively in the super-MIC range. For 12 of the 21 antimicrobials tested, luminescence- and CFU-based rates did not differ significantly. To investigate the source of the discrepancies observed for the remaining 9 antibiotics, we introduced a size-structured population model with a continuum of cell sizes to simulate the impact of filamentation on the light signal, and complemented the findings with microscopy imaging. Discrepancies between the two rates fell into two classes. First, because light intensity tracks biomass more closely than population size, luminescence can indicate a shallower population decline when bacteria filament. Second, CFU-based estimates can indicate a steeper population decline when antimicrobial treatment reduces the number of colonies formed per viable bacterium. This effect can result from changes in clustering behaviour, physiological changes that impair culturability, or antimicrobial carry-over. With these caveats addressed, bioluminescence offers an efficient, high-throughput alternative for quantifying bacterial dynamics at super-MIC concentrations, although its suitability depends on the chosen metric (biomass vs. cell number) and on whether the antimicrobial induces filamentation or affects culturability.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

A combined genetic/genomics approach on five affected siblings of Northern European ancestry from the island of Newfoundland, Canada identified a premature stop mutation in Karyopherin subunit 7 (KPNA7, c.49C>T, p.R17X). KPNA7 maps to OTSC2 (7q22.1), is the newest of the seven-member importin- family of nuclear transporters and plays a critical role in early embryonic cleavage events and zygotic genome activation.

In contrast to invertebrate orthologs, vertebrate TRPM2 channels inactivate due to evolutionary alterations in amino acid sequence around the selectivity filter. Human TRPM2 (hsTRPM2) serves as a deep-brain temperature sensor important for body temperature regulation, and its gating is exquisitely temperature dependent. To address whether TRPM2 is temperature sensitive also in ectotherms that lack body temperature regulation, here we investigated the functional properties of zebrafish (Danio rerio) TRPM2 (drTRPM2) across the temperature range of 15oC to 37oC. The rate of ion permeation through the open pore was weakly temperature sensitive (Q10~1.3) as expected for a diffusion-limited process. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ligands (ADPR and Ca2+) drTRPM2 open probability showed no temperature dependence. Moreover, for both ADPR and Ca2+, the apparent affinities for channel activation were unaffected by temperature, reporting a standard enthalpy of opening near zero for drTRPM2. Inactivation of drTRPM2 is an order of magnitude slower than that of hsTRPM2. To address whether in both orthologs the same mechanism underlies inactivation, we studied its temperature sensitivity. For both drTRPM2 and hsTRPM2 inactivation rate was modestly temperature dependent (Q10 ~2.7 and ~4.4). A triple substitution which converts the post-filter sequence of drTRPM2 into the corresponding human sequence accelerated drTRPM2 inactivation by >20-fold.

In king penguins, the breeding cycle lasts more than a year, and the start of egg-laying extends over 3 months, with early-breeders laying eggs around December and late-breeders around February. Consequently, late-born chicks have less time to grow and build up their energy reserves before the Austral winter. It is however not known whether late-born chicks display alternative physiological strategies to catch up before winter. Variation in metabolic rate is one important pathway driving differences in growth patterns, as it is directly involved both in energy allocation processes and fitness. The conversion of resources into energy occurs in mitochondria, and the efficiency of this conversion is likely to play a fundamental role in explaining individual heterogeneity in growth and survival. The purposes of this study were to investigate the differences in red blood cell mitochondrial metabolism between early- and late-born king penguin chicks and to assess whether morphometric phenotypes could be explained by differences in mitochondrial metabolism. Late-chicks expressed higher mitochondrial metabolism compared to early-chicks at 100 days post-hatching, probably linked to the stress related to winter environmental conditions and a decrease in parental feeding rates. We did not find a clear association between chick mitochondrial metabolism and growth patterns, suggesting that mostly environmental conditions contributed in explaining different metabolic phenotypes. As king penguin populations in Crozet may face changing breeding conditions (changes in feeding area and foraging trips duration) in relation to global changes, studying the physiological traits and adaptations underlying the chick growth and survival may help understanding the response of king penguins facing challenging conditions.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

In data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), our proposed method mitigates bias and yields high accuracy in predicting cortical thickness measures when generalizing the model to new data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed harmonization method can reduce site-related variance in centile scores estimated using data from the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium (LBCC). Altogether, our results demonstrate that CB-Predict effectively harmonizes new sites and thereby enables effective translation of neuroimaging models to additional samples.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Even though several studies have shown that many influenza viruses can enter the CNS, the neuropathogenesis of seasonal (H3N2 and H1N1) and pandemic (pH1N1 2009) IAV infections is poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cellular tropism, replication efficiency and associated functional consequences using a human stem cell-derived neural co-culture model of neurons and astrocytes. All viruses were able to infect neurons in the co-culture model, although this infection did not result in efficient replication and release of progeny virus. In addition, infection did not result in visible cell death or apoptosis. However, functional analyses revealed that IAV inoculation resulted in a reduction of spontaneous neural activity and a partial reduction of neural excitability. This study shows that seasonal and pandemic IAVs can disrupt neural homeostasis, without efficient virus replication or the induction of cell death. However, these functional changes in neural activity can contribute to cognitive problems during IAV infections in the acute and potentially post-acute phase of the infection.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

V.; Vorobyeva, N. E.; Vatolina, T. Y.; Levitsky, V. G.; Zhimulev, I.", "abstract": "Genome and chromosome maps have played a great role in the development of molecular genetics and biology. Gene activation, expression, and inactivation directly depend on the chromosomal (protein, nucleosomal) environment of the gene and formation of specific protein complexes on various gene structures. Polytene chromosomes are the only object in which interphase chromosomes can be analyzed, but the known Drosophila genome maps provide only an abstract view of gene distribution on a physical map, and there is no connection between these genes and the structures of interphase polytene chromosomes. A combination of bioinformatic methods was applied in this study; the data on interphase distribution of chromatin, H3K36me3 histone modifications, and the insulator protein Chriz, as well as the ChIP-seq, FAIRE-seq, and FISH methods, were used to investigate the genome-wide localization of key marker proteins. Having combined these mapping techniques for the small region 1AF of the X chromosome, we developed a novel method for analyzing the mutual arrangement of developmental and housekeeping genes, their promoters, and various types of proteins in the interphase genome and chromosome structures: compacted black bands, interbands, and gray bands, as well as sites of localization of exons and introns of housekeeping genes. Mapping was based on three consecutive stages: the 4 state Hidden Markov Model (hereinafter referred to as 4HMM) and data distribution for H3K36me3 and Chriz from the cells in which polytene chromosomes had been formed were used to localize interbands; FISH probes were then prepared from interband DNA, and blocks of developmental and housekeeping genes in interphase chromosome structures were mapped. The elaborated mapping methods can be further used to build similar maps for the entire interphase genome of Drosophila. Comparison of the map of bands and interbands in the region 1AF revealed full matching of the boundaries of black bands (developmental genes) and TADs. Within the regions where the housekeeping genes are located (the groups of interbands and gray bands), the TADs is formed on the basis of a gene cluster (the interbandgray band complex).", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The use of Wolbachia-mediated biocontrol represents a promising, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable strategy for managing dengue transmission. However, the susceptibility of existing Wolbachia strains utilized in controlling Aedes aegypti necessitates the investigation of novel strains to enhance dengue control efficacy. This study aimed to identify potential alternative Wolbachia strains for dengue control by comparing the genomes of seven Wolbachia pipientis strains: wMel, wAlbB, wlrr, wHm-C, wAnm, ant7, and a strain isolated from Aedes aegypti. We conducted comprehensive genomic analyses, including phylogenetic assessments, metabolic pathway evaluations, and characterization of the Cytoplasmic Incompatibility Factor (Cif) genes. Our analyses identified the strain wCin2USA1 as a strong candidate for alternative dengue control strategies. This strain demonstrated remarkable genomic similarities to wMel, an already established strain used as biocontrol for Aedes aegypti. Importantly, this strain presented two distinct pairs of Cif genes from different monophyletic types, each homologous to the Cif genes found in wMel and wAlbB. This genetic architecture suggests a high degree of compatibility and demonstrates promising potential for the suppression of Aedes aegypti populations through the induction of Cytoplasmic Incompatibility. The presence of multiple intact prophage regions also suggests greater adaptability compared to established strains. Our findings support the hypothesis that wCin2USA1 could serve as an effective biocontrol agent against dengue transmission. This work provides critical insights into developing innovative Wolbachia-based interventions aimed at mitigating the persistent threat posed by dengue fever. Future research should concentrate on optimizing release methodologies, evaluating ecological impacts, and assessing the strain's effectiveness against the dengue virus.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Elevated levels of sEH and COX-2 found in AD patients and animals suggest their involvement in neurodegeneration, glial activation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. This study evaluated a new dual sEH/COX-2 inhibitor, PTUPB, on cerebrovascular function and cognition in TgF344-AD rats. The rats received oral PTUPB (2mg/kg/day) for 25 days. Body weight, plasma glucose, and HbA1c levels remained stable between PTUPB- and vehicle-treated AD rats. PTUPB significantly improved recognition memory in AD rats, as detected by the Novel Object Recognition test. Pressure myography showed that PTUPB restored myogenic responses and increased the distensibility of the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) in AD rats. Acute PTUPB (0.1 and 1M) enhanced myogenic contraction in response to elevated perfusion pressure in AD MCAs, with minimal effects in wild-type vessels. Vehicle-treated AD rats displayed impaired functional hyperemia, whereas PTUPB (1M) significantly restored this response. Transcriptomic analysis of cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from AD rats indicated that PTUPB influences genes related to contractility, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These results provide new evidence that dual inhibition of sEH and COX-2 improves cognition in AD, likely by enhancing myogenic responses and increasing cerebral artery distensibility. Our findings highlight the potential of PTUPB as a therapeutic approach for cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Historically considered to be an extracellular pathogen, recent evidence has emerged that P. aeruginosa is able to survive and replicate within human cells.

Here we describe the application of a novel peptide-based therapeutic against recalcitrant populations of bacteria residing within lung epithelial cells. This antimicrobial peptoid is able to target intracellular bacteria without harming host cells. In addition, we have shown that peptoid TM5 exhibits synergy with three antibiotics that otherwise have low efficacy against P. aeruginosa, effectively rescuing drugs that have become clinically obsolete. These synergistic combination therapies are also capable of reducing intracellular bacterial reservoirs, opening the door for potential new strategies against chronic P. aeruginosa infections.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

The ribcage plays a critical role in both respiration and locomotion but its adaptations to running are largely unexplored. Robustly testing adaptation in wild populations is challenging, so we use artificial selection for voluntary wheel-running behaviour (i.e., High Runner or HR mice) to directly test form-function relationships associated with sustained running. We compared ribcage configuration and shape of HR (males: 52, females: 47) to control (males: 48, females: 48) mice using rib counts and 3D Geometric Morphometrics. Two of four HR lines had an additional rib and increased variation in the proportion of true to false ribs, suggesting that ribcage patterning has been impacted by selection. This variability among lines suggests that selection for wheel running has resulted in adaptations that are expressed variably among the selected lines, resulting in \"multiple solutions\" to selection. Total ribcage shape did not vary significantly between HR and Control mice. Instead, the effect of selection varied along the ribcage, with significant effects in the caudal ribs. Further, the caudal ribcage of HR mice showed increased disparity, within-rib, and among-rib integration compared to controls. The strong response of caudal ribs indicates a modular pattern of adaptation, with cranial ribs possibly constrained by their role in ventilation. This study demonstrates that adaptation in the mammalian ribcage is likely shaped by a complex interplay of selection and craniocaudal integration and may result in variation at multiple anatomical levels (count, shape, modularity).", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Their thin-walled barrel-shape architecture is composed of two symmetrical, antiparallel half-shells, each containing 39 copies of the major vault protein (MVP). The spacious lumen of the vault suggests a role in cellular transport. To facilitate cargo encapsulation and release, the vault is thought to open into two halves, yet the molecular mechanism governing vault opening remains elusive. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and multi-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the structural factors giving flexibility to the human vault protein. Using cryo-EM, we identified two alternative conformational states of the human vault, along with the half-vault shell. MD simulations of these structures show extensive, breathing-like motions, porous solvent-exposed surfaces, and distinct structural variability between conformational states. The stable intermediates and the flexibility at the interface of the half vaults together suggest a possible mechanism for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the vault.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Motivated by these developments, we implemented a software package, \\pkgname, which builds on state-of-the-art methods for measuring local distortion and displays them in an intuitive and interactive way.

F.; Wohlgemuth, M.", "abstract": "To successfully execute natural tasks, animals must continuously monitor and integrate dynamic sensory information to guide behavior. While this process, known as active sensing, is fundamental to goal-directed behavior, the mechanisms by which sensory information supports motor planning, particularly across different behavioral contexts, remains poorly understood. We investigated sensory and motor activity in the superior colliculus (SC) of echolocating bats, a powerful model system to study active sensing behaviors due to their reliance on self-generated sonar signals. We recorded multichannel SC activity while bats performed spatial navigation and target tracking behaviors. We hypothesized that changes in sensory signals (i.e., returning echoes) drive quantifiable adjustments in SC activity related to sonar call production, and that adaptive changes in SC sensorimotor processing are preserved across behavioral contexts. We examined pooled SC activity using a dimensionality reduction technique to isolate the largest changes in firing rates across multichannel SC recordings. We then examined the variation in SC activity from the time of echo arrival (sensory input) to call production (motor output). Our data show that increases in call rate are associated with shorter trajectory lengths in neural state space, reflecting reduced variability and increased efficiency in population activity. Strikingly, when bats cluster calls into sonar sound groups (SSGs, which are rapid bursts of calls to increase sensory sampling), SC activity is distinct from times when bats produce isolated calls. Notably, we find that successive SSGs lead to progressively shorter trajectory lengths, suggesting a refinement of sensorimotor processing across successive SSGs. Together, our findings demonstrate that sensorimotor population dynamics in the SC follow common principles across distinct behavioral tasks. These results support a fundamental role for the SC in adaptive sensing and highlight its contribution to flexible sensorimotor transformations in natural behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}

Goal-directed sweeps predicted upcoming trajectories to remembered goal locations, were coordinated with prefrontal cortex activity and preferentially replayed during sharp-wave ripples.

We compare extracellular recordings of TSC organoids with intraoperative electrocorticography from TSC patients to reveal striking functional similarities, including high-frequency oscillations - an electrical biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. In TSC, a human-specific interneuron sub-type derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence drives network hyper-synchronization through increased spontaneous firing and altered excitability. Inhibiting overproliferation of its progenitors via long-term epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition prevented the onset of this pathological phenotype at functional and morphological levels.

Kanold, P.; Charles, A.", "abstract": "Neural population activity is often stereotyped into recurring activity patterns, i.e., neural motifs, which can be seen as the fundamental building blocks in sensory processing and cognition. In this work we study the codes carried by such neural motifs in primary auditory cortex A1, and analyze how they build on and complement traditional views of single-unit coding. In particular, we study, using two-photon calcium imaging (CI), how activity in A1 differentially represents both sensory stimuli and task and behavioral variables in each of the parallel single neuron and population motif scales. While CI enables the study of neural motifs by capturing the activity of large neural populations, identifying motifs in CI is hampered by the temporal imprecision of current motif-detection algorithms when applied to CI data. We thus developed a new algorithm for motif detection, which enabled us to identify widespread stimulus-encoding motifs as well as a small number of motifs jointly encoding stimulus and choice in Layer 2/3 of A1. These motifs consist of small groups of neurons that are neither clustered nor regularly ordered in space. Interestingly, active neurons within task-encoding motifs exhibit mixed encoding properties inconsistent with the motifs they participate in. Together, these results demonstrate how single unit activity and neural motifs in A1 L2/3 provide different levels of coding granularity containing different information in parallel within the greater neural population. Generally, our results indicate that downstream populations, by selecting which scale of a population drives them, can be selective in the information collected for later cognitive processing.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": ""}
