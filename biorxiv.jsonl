In this study, we utilized a femtosecond laser-induced impulse to break the coupling between the growth cone and the substrate, enabling us to evaluate the strength of the binding between the growth cone and a laminin on the substrate, and also determine the contribution of adhesion strength to neurite outgrowth and traction force for the outgrowth. We found that the adhesion strength of axonal L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM)-laminin binding increased with the laminin density on the substrate. In addition, fluorescent speckle microscopy revealed that the retrograde flow of F-actin in the growth cone was dependent on the laminin density such that the flow speed reduced with increasing L1CAM-laminin binding. However, neurite outgrowth and the traction force did not increase monotonically with increased L1CAM-laminin binding but rather exhibited biphasic behavior, in which the outgrowth was suppressed by excessive L1CAM-laminin binding. Our quantitative evaluations suggest that the biphasic outgrowth is regulated by the balance between traction force and adhesion strength. These results imply that adhesion modulation is key to the regulation of neurite outgrowth.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Vespasiani, D. M.; Pask, A. J.; Gallego Romero, I.", "abstract": "Marsupials and placental mammals exhibit significant differences in reproductive and life history strategies. Marsupials are born highly underdeveloped after an extremely short period of gestation, leading to prioritization of the development of structures critical for post-birth survival in the pouch. Critically, they must undergo accelerated development of the oro-facial region compared to placentals. Previously we described the accelerated development of the oro-facial region in the carnivorous Australian marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart Sminthopsis crassicaudata that has one of the shortest gestations of any mammal. By combining genome comparisons of the mouse and dunnart with functional data for the enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, we investigated divergence of craniofacial regulatory landscapes between these species. This is the first description of genome-wide face regulatory elements in a marsupial, with 60,626 putative enhancers and 12,295 putative promoters described. We also generated craniofacial RNA-seq data for the dunnart to investigate expression dynamics of genes near predicted active regulatory elements. While genes involved in regulating facial development were largely conserved in mouse and dunnart, the regulatory landscape varied significantly. Additionally, a subset of dunnart-specific enhancers were associated with genes highly expressed only in dunnart relating to cranial neural crest proliferation, embryonic myogenesis and epidermis development. Comparative RNA-seq analyses of facial tissue revealed dunnart-specific expression of genes involved in the development of the mechanosensory system. Accelerated development of the dunnart sensory system likely relates to the sensory cues received by the nasal-oral region during the postnatal journey to the pouch. Together these data suggest that accelerated face development in the dunnart may be driven by dunnart-specific enhancer activity. Our study highlights the power of marsupial-placental comparative genomics for understanding the role of enhancers in driving temporal shifts in development.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, females in estrus developed only mild CDI 1-2 days later, while females in proestrus developed deadly disease. Mirroring the delayed effect of the estrous cycle, pre-infection prolactin levels formed a complex network with immunoglobulins and cytokines that affected early CDI severity one day after challenge. Similarly, pre-infection progesterone and luteinizing hormone formed a network that affected CDI two days after challenge. As expected, immune effectors early in the infection formed a hormone-independent network that concurrently correlated with CDI severity. Interestingly, early infection follicular stimulating hormone levels created a network that affected the CDI recovery phase.

Some dyads can maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak or fleeting ties. Evidence accumulates that aspects of social relationships are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals can be principally driven by two distinct processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of individuals, and dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to interact specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness. We present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We also provide a basic R package bamoso, which implements models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes. We demonstrate critical features of the proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level social features and individual-level outcomes in a unified model. Our model provides a principled foundation to explain variation in dyadic interactions. This approach allows us to address questions about the relationship between variation in sociality characteristics and other features of interest, both within and across species.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

However, this is complicated by the fact that {beta}-lactamases reduce the antibiotic concentration in their environment, thereby altering their own selective advantage via eco-evolutionary feedback. We investigated the effect of such feedback on the spread of bacterial strains expressing {beta}-lactamase enzymes conferring different levels of resistance to the cephalosporin cefotaxime. Specifically, we conducted head-to-head competitions between two clinically observed {beta}-lactamase mutants, TEM-19 and TEM-52, with low and high activity against cefotaxime, respectively. By experimentally varying nutrient levels, we altered cell density and hence the strength of ecological feedback and examined its impact on competitive fitness and strain coexistence across a range of cefotaxime concentrations. A population dynamic model, parameterized solely with independently measured traits, revealed cell density as the key mediator of this feedback. Our results show that cell density dictates whether the resistant strain (TEM-52) outcompetes or stably coexists with the susceptible strain (TEM-19). By validating our model with experimental data, we showed that it can reasonably predict the equilibrium frequencies based on dose-dependent growth rates and antibiotic degradation rates of both strains. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering ecological feedback for understanding the fate of antibiotic-degrading mutants, including in clinical environments.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We identified monotonic dose-response relationships between standardized chemical concentrations, in terms of toxic units, for selected chemical use groups and organic matter decomposition by decomposer-detritivore-systems as well as photosynthesis by algae and macrophytes. By contrast, consistent relationships were not found for other ecosystem functions, such as organic matter decomposition by microbial decomposers alone and primary production under the conditions studied. Importantly, the shape and direction of the relationships identified here match those reported in field-based studies, indicating a decrease in functioning as chemical stress increases, strengthening the ecological relevance of our findings. Finally, we found a disconnect between regulatory ecological quality targets and ecological outcomes, highlighting a need to re-evaluate risk assessment approaches if they are supposed to be ecologically meaningful and protective of ecosystem functions.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Inhibiting keratinocyte cytonemes reduced Notch expression within undifferentiated keratinocytes, leading to abnormal differentiation and hyperproliferation, resembling human skin disease phenotypes. Overproduction of Interleukin (IL)-17 signal, associated with skin diseases like psoriasis, induces psoriatic phenotypes by reducing cytoneme extension in zebrafish.

While recent structural investigations, particularly of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FtsEX (PaeFtsEX), have shed light on complex interactions and proposed activation mechanisms, the structural intricacies governing PG degradation by the FtsEX complex and EnvC in Escherichia coli cytokinesis remain unexplored.

Upon EnvC binding, ATPase activity markedly increases. High-resolution structures of EcoFtsEX, both in the presence and absence of EnvC, reveal a symmetrical conformation of EcoFtsEX capable of accommodating the inherent asymmetry of EnvC, mediated by flexible loops within the periplasmic domain. Our negative-staining imaging showcases an elongated EcoFtsEX/EnvC/AmiB complex reminiscent of the PaeFtsEX system.

Such sensory-guided behaviors are necessarily brain-wide endeavors, requiring a plethora of distinct brain areas, including those that are involved in aspects of decision making, motor planning, motor initiation, and reward prediction. ACtx comprises a number of distinct excitatory cell-types that allow for the brain-wide propagation of behaviorally-relevant sensory information. Exactly how ACtx involvement changes as a function of learning, as well as the functional role of distinct excitatory cell-types is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by designing a two-choice auditory task in which water-restricted, head-fixed mice were trained to categorize the temporal rate of a sinusoidal amplitude modulated (sAM) noise burst and used transient cell-type specific optogenetics to probe ACtx necessity across the duration of learning. Our data demonstrate that ACtx is necessary for the ability to categorize the rate of sAM noise, and this necessity remains stable across learning. ACtx silencing substantially altered the behavioral strategies used to solve the task by introducing a fluctuating choice bias and increasing dependence on prior decisions. Furthermore, ACtx silencing did not impact the animal's motor report, suggesting that ACtx is necessary for the conversion of sensation to action. Targeted inhibition of both intratelencephalic and extratelencephalic projections on just 20% of trials had a modest effect on task performance, but significantly degraded learning. Taken together, our data shows that ACtx plays a critical role in both the acquisition and expression of categorical behavior, and that distinct excitatory projections play important roles in learning and plasticity.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe a novel paradigm which provides a distinct measure of each process and apply it to people with focal epilepsy, a condition associated with hippocampal dysfunction, comparing them with healthy young and older participants. Pattern separation and pattern completion were observed in healthy younger individuals. A specific deficit in pattern completion was identified in people with focal epilepsy, while the healthy older cohort showed degraded ability to perform pattern separation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we simulated human performance using an auto-associative neural network.

When examining repeated reaches to the same target, we found that the reduced velocity resulted from both an immediate deficit and a gradually developing compensatory slowing to reduce passive inter-joint interactions. However, the slowed hand velocity did not account for the fragmented and variable movement trajectories observed during the cerebellar block.

Early exposure to microbes can have lasting influences on the assembly and functionality of the host's microbiota, leaving a life-long imprint on host health and disease. Studies of the role played by parental care in microbial acquisition have primarily focused on humans and hosts with agricultural relevance. Anuran vertebrates offer the opportunity to examine microbial community composition across life stages as a function of parental investment. In this study, we investigate vertical transmission of microbiota during parental care in a poison frog (Family Dendrobatidae), where fathers transport their offspring piggyback-style from terrestrial clutches to aquatic nurseries. We found that substantial bacterial colonization of the embryo begins after hatching from the vitelline envelope, emphasizing its potential role as microbial barrier during early development. Using a laboratory cross-foster experiment, we demonstrated that poison frogs performing tadpole transport serve as a source of skin microbes for tadpoles on their back. To study how transport impacts the microbial skin communities of tadpoles in an ecologically relevant setting, we sampled frogs and tadpoles of sympatric species that do or do not exhibit tadpole transport in their natural habitat. We found more diverse microbial communities associated with tadpoles of transporting species compared to a non-transporting frog. However, we detected no difference in the degree of similarity between adult and tadpole skin microbiotas, based on whether the frog species exhibits transporting behavior or not. Using a field experiment, we confirmed that tadpole transport can result in the persistent colonization of tadpoles by isolated microbial taxa associated with the caregiver's skin, albeit often at low prevalence. This is the first study to describe vertical transmission of skin microbes in anuran amphibians, showing that offspring transport may serve as a mechanism for transmission of parental skin microbes.

Primary cultures of rodent neurons recapitulate several aspects of this polarity regulation, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon specification, dendrite formation, and neuronal migration. However, the process by which the preexisting bipolarity of migrating neurons is disrupted to form multipolar dendrites remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that MTCL2, a microtubule-crosslinking protein associated with the Golgi apparatus, plays a crucial role in this type of polarity transformation observed during the differentiation of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). MTCL2 is highly expressed in CGNs and gradually accumulates in dendrites as the cells develop polarity. MTCL2 knockdown resulted in the generation of longer and fewer dendrites by suppressing the bipolar-to-multipolar transition of dendrite extension observed in the normal polarization process. During this process, the Golgi apparatus shifts from the base of the preexisting bipolar neurites to the lateral or apical side of the nucleus in the cell body. There, it forms a close association with the microtubule cage that wraps around the nucleus. The resulting upward extension of the Golgi apparatus is tightly coupled with the randomization of its position in the x-y plane. Knockdown and rescue experiments demonstrated that MTCL2 promotes these Golgi position changes in a microtubule- and Golgi-binding activity-dependent manner. These results suggest that MTCL2 promotes the development of multipolar short dendrites by sequestering the Golgi apparatus into the microtubule cage from the base of the preexisting neurite.\n\nSignificance StatementPrevious studies have shown that neurons polarize the localization of the Golgi apparatus, thereby facilitating the development of asymmetrically elongated dendrites. In contrast, the present study demonstrated that to symmetrically extend multiple dendrites, cerebellar granule neurons sequester the Golgi apparatus within a microtubule cage surrounding the nucleus. This represents a novel mechanism through which neurons suppress polarized vesicle transport. These findings also reveal an entirely novel function of microtubule cages, which have only been reported for their role in neuronal cell migration. The present study also revealed the involvement of the novel microtubule-regulating protein MTCL2, which links the Golgi apparatus to microtubules, and the LINC complex, which links microtubules to the nuclear membrane, in this process.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviorally-relevant communication signals.

Despite the development of numerous bioinformatic programs, identifying the most effective tool is challenging due to non-overlapping results and varying efficiency across studies. Benchmarking efforts have highlighted some of the limitations of these tools, often evaluated on either real or simulated data.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether the functionality of this neural system is similarly altered in response to other natural rewards. In this study, we used fiber photometry combined with a behavioral reward test to investigate the effects of six weeks of excessive cafeteria (CAF) diet consumption on ventral tegmental area (VTA) neural activity and behavioral responses to food and sexual rewards in female rats. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to a CAF diet reduced the exploration and consumption of food rewards. These behavioral changes were accompanied by attenuated neural activity in the VTA. Similarly, reductions in VTA activity were observed in response to a sexual partner, although no significant behavioral differences were detected during sexual interactions. Moreover, a two-week reversal diet of standard chow proved insufficient to restore VTA neural activity in CAF-exposed animals, which continued to exhibit decreased VTA responses to both food rewards and sexual partners. Our results suggest that prolonged junk food exposure induces desensitization of the VTA, resulting in reduced responsiveness to natural rewards.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

P.; Muniz, M.; Bui, M.

There is a consensus among quantitative geneticists that the G-matrix can evolve through \"deep\" time. Yet, quantitative genetic models for the evolution of the G-matrix are conspicuously lacking. In contrast, the field of macroevolution has several stochastic models for univariate traits evolving on phylogenies. However, despite much research into multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods, analytical models of how multivariate trait matrices might evolve on phylogenies have not been considered. Here we show how three analytical models for the evolution of matrices and multivariate traits on phylogenies, based on Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry and stochastic differential (diffusion) equations, can be combined to unify quantitative genetics and macroevolutionary theory in a coherent mathematical framework. The models provide a basis for understanding how G-matrices might evolve on phylogenies, and we show how to fit models to data via simulation using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Such models can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the evolution of genetic variances and covariances, together with the evolution of the traits themselves, and how these might vary across a phylogeny. This unification of macroevolutionary theory and quantitative genetics is an important advance in the study of phenotypes, allowing for the construction of a synthetic quantitative theory of the evolution of species and multivariate traits over \"deep\" time.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

To identify potential transcriptional programs across animal models and human patients with AD and EP, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide transcriptomic analysis. Our investigation included mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy (pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced; n = 280), AD transgenic models (7 transgenic models expressing human tau or amyloid pathology; n = 257), and performed cross-species validation in human cohorts (EP: n = 182; AD: n = 301). We identified a highly conserved immune-related module across all models and patient cohorts. The hub consensus signatures of this module were centered around a microglial synaptic pruning pathway involving TYROBP, TREM2, and C1Q complement components. Gene regulatory network analysis identified TYROBP as the key upstream hub signature. These signatures showed consistent up-regulation in both conditions and strong diagnostic potential. Differential expression analyses revealed their predominant expression in specific microglial subpopulations associated with complement-mediated synaptic pruning and immune activation. Neural circuit modeling further demonstrates the asymmetric sensitivity of synaptic pruning to network dynamics. Loss of inhibitory synapses has a disproportionately significant impact on neural network excitation/inhibition balance and synchronization. Our findings support microglial complement-mediated synaptic pruning as a conserved central pathway linking neurodegeneration to epileptogenesis, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for AD and EP comorbidity.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

R.; Beck, D.; Westlye, L. T.; Tamnes, C. K.; Norbom, L. B.", "abstract": "Pregnancy- and birth-related factors affect offspring brain development, emphasizing the importance of early life exposures. While most previous studies have focused on a few variables in isolation, here we investigated associations between a broad range of pregnancy- and birth-related variables and multivariate cortical brain MRI features. Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 years from the ABCD Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global surface area. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both surface area and cortical thickness. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bi-directional frontal area variations, and reduced cortical thickness across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global surface area and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.\n\nSignificance StatementEarly life stages, including pregnancy and birth circumstances, are critically important for a wide range of real-life outcomes for the child. In this study, we linked maternal complications during pregnancy and low birth weight and prematurity to globally reduced cortical surface area, and low birth weight and prematurity, in addition to pregnancy and birth complications, to complex cortical structural patterns later in late childhood. Our findings underscore the importance of providing support to mothers and children during these crucial phases, helping to ensure optimal conditions for healthy child development.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "CTCF-mediated chromatin folding plays a key role in gene regulation, however the mechanisms controlling chromatin organization across cell states are not fully elucidated. Comprehensive analyses reveal that CTCF binding stability and cohesin overlap in mice and humans, are regulated by species specific differences in CTCF binding site (CBS) accessibility and enrichment of motifs corresponding to expressed TFs. By analyzing TFs, we confirm the co-operativity and competitiveness of TF/CTCF binding, which we further validate by allele specific analysis of SNPs. TF motif enrichment at CTCF bound sites is determined by cell state-specific transcriptional programs, which either stabilize or destabilize CTCF binding, as reflected by changing TF concentration. To examine CTCF binding in the context of nucleosome positioning, we performed single molecule nano-NOMe-seq. Subsetting reveals a continuum of binding states for CTCF, which are differentially represented at accessible versus inaccessible CBSs. As expected, CTCF degradation leads to a progressive loss of binding and nucleosome repositioning giving profiles similar to CTCF free CBSs. We also observe a similar time dependent effect when the cohesin subcomponent, SSC1 is degraded although CTCF remains bound, indicating that cohesin mediates CTCF-associated nucleosome repositioning. Stratified analysis of CTCF signal strength and accessibility reveals that in the presence of cohesin, CTCF strength contributes to nucleosome repositioning and chromatin insulation independent of accessibility. However, cobound TFs can uncouple the relationship between signal strength and nucleosome repositioning, without affecting the connection between repositioning and insulation. These studies identify mechanisms underlying cell state-specific CTCF profiles, linked to local and long-range chromatin organization.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We used a novel method to investigate the TME in vitro called multicellular circulating co-culture, to characterize how EVh interferes with tumoral and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages. EVh promoted monocyte differentiation to M2-like macrophages and inhibited macrophage-derived phagocytosis in endothelial and tumoral cells.

Biomechanics is an important contributor to pregnancy success, and alterations to normal uterine biomechanical functions can contribute to an array of obstetric pathologies. Few studies have characterized the passive mechanical properties of the gravid human uterus, and ethical limitations have largely prevented the investigation of mid-gestation periods. To address this key knowledge gap, this study seeks to characterize the structural, compositional, and time-dependent micro-mechanical properties of the nonhuman primate (NHP) uterine layers in nonpregnancy and at three time points in pregnancy: early 2, early 3, and late 3 trimesters. Distinct material and compositional properties were noted across the different tissue layers, with the nonpregnant endometrium and pregnant decidua being the least stiff, most viscous, least diffusible, and most hydrated layers of the NHP uterus. Pregnancy induced notable compositional and structural changes in the decidua and myometrium but had no effect on their micro-mechanical properties. Further comparison to published human data revealed marked similarities across species, with minor differences noted for the perimetrium and nonpregnant endometrium. This work provides insights into the material properties of the NHP uterus and demonstrates the validity of NHPs as a model for studying certain aspects of human uterine biomechanics.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In many existing studies, participants' emotional ratings in interval scales are considered the true reflection of their emotional experiences. However, recent research suggests that ordinal annotations of emotions can more accurately capture the emotional expression process, providing a potential method for more precise emotion measurement. However, our understanding of the characteristics and validity of this new form of emotion representation is still relatively lacking. In particular, there is a lack of research using neural signals to explore the validity and neural basis of ordinal emotion representation. In this study, we used a video-elicited electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset (n = 123) to identify the neural basis of ordinal emotion representation and demonstrate its validity from a neural perspective. Furthermore, we explored various characteristics of ordinal emotion representation, showing how it is superior to the interval form. First, we conducted inter-situation representational similarity analysis (RSA) and inter-subject RSA to test the degree to which ordinal representation captures both group commonalities and individual differences of emotion. Next, we investigated the characteristics of ordinal representation under different combinations of emotion items, including uni-variate and multivariate emotions, positive and negative emotions. Our results show that both group commonalities and inter-subject variations in EEG features are better explained by ordinal emotion representations than by interval ones. Multivariate ordinal representations showed better inter-subject reliability and higher representational similarity with EEG features compared to uni-variate counterparts, highlighting the co-occurrence nature of human emotions. Compared to negative emotions, ordinal representation showed greater improvements for positive emotions, suggesting that the complexity of positive emotions is well captured by ordinal representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that multivariate ordinal emotion ratings provide a more accurate measure of real emotional experience, which is crucial for enabling machines to precisely understand and express human emotions.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

T.; Barker-Clarke, R.; Hinczewski, M.; Maltas, J.; Scott, J. G.", "abstract": "Adaptive populations rarely evolve in a static environment. Therefore, understanding and ultimately controlling the evolution of a population requires consideration of fluctuating selective pressures. The fitness landscape metaphor has long been used as a tool for representing the selective pressures a given environment imposes on a population. Much work has already been done to understand the dynamics of evolution on a single fitness landscape. More recently, evolution on fluctuating or sequentially applied landscapes has come to the fore of evolutionary biology. As more empirical landscapes are described, metrics for describing salient features of paired landscapes will have uses for understanding likely evolutionary dynamics. Currently, Pearson correlation coefficient and collateral sensitivity likelihoods are used to quantify topographical relatedness or dissimilarity of a pair of landscapes. Here, we introduce the edge flip fraction, a new metric for comparing landscapes, which quantifies changes in the directionality of evolution between pairs of fitness landscapes. We demonstrate that the edge flip fraction captures topographical differences in landscapes that traditional metrics may overlook which have important consequences for the trajectories of populations evolving on them. By applying this metric to both empirical and synthetic fitness landscapes, we show that it partially predicts the collateral sensitivity likelihoods and can inform the optimality of drug sequences. We show that optimal drug sequences that keep populations within lower fitness regions require shifts in evolutionary directions, which are quantified by the edge flip fraction. Edge flip fraction complements existing measures and may help researchers understand how populations evolve under changing environmental conditions, and could yield clues in the pursuit of evolutionary control.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we took a proteomic approach and identified 174 proteins that bind to arsenic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were markedly enriched among the arsenic-binding proteins, and we demonstrate that arsenic-binding to nuclear import factors results in their relocation from the nuclear envelope and subsequent aggregation in the cytosol. Similarly, nuclear pore proteins that make up the nuclear pore complex mislocalized and aggregated in arsenic-exposed cells.

In addition to its diploidy and favorably small genome size, the C. ficifolium model provides a shorter generational period and smaller overall plant size as compared to C. quinoa, while displaying relevant agronomic trait variations amenable to gene-trait association studies. The C. ficifolium 'Portsmouth' nuclear genome was sequenced using PacBio HiFi Long Read technology and assembled using Hifiasm. After manual adjustments, the final ChenoFicP_1.0 assembly consisted of nine pseudochromosomes spanning 711.5 Mbp, while 22,617 genes were identified and annotated. BUSCO analyses indicated a nuclear genome completeness of 97.5%, and a proteome and transcriptome completeness of 98.4 percent. The chloroplast genome assembly detected two equally represented structural haplotypes differing in the orientation of the Short Single Copy region relative to the Long Single Copy region. Phylogenetic and parentage analyses pointed to an unspecified AA diploid species and away from C. ficifolium as the likely maternal chloroplast and mitochondrial genome donor(s) during the initial tetraploidization event in the C. quinoa lineage. Using the new ChenoFicP_1.0 reference genome, a GWAS was performed on a previously studied C. ficifolium F2 population to further define region(s) implicated in the control of three key agronomic traits: days to flowering, plant height, and branch number. This analysis localized control of all three traits to a 7 Mb interval on pseudochromosome Cf4. This region contains approximately 770 genes, including the FTL1 locus, thus confirming and extending our prior, single-marker analysis showing association of these three traits with an FTL1 amplicon length polymorphism.

Here, we compare the evolutionary advantage of different persistence strategies found in prokaryotic plasmids. Through intracellular competitions between plasmid genotypes, we find that the combination of active partitioning during cell division with a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for post-segregational killing increases plasmid fitness more than either strategy alone. Mathematical modeling of long-term plasmid evolution, calibrated with empirical plasmid loss dynamics, further supports these findings. A survey of enterobacterial genomes indicates that partitioning and TA systems are core features of large conjugative plasmids. Indeed, we confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized type I TA system in IncX3 plasmids, which serve as important vectors of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens.

Here, we identify specific sensory adaptations associated with the emergence of predatory feeding behaviours in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. While Caenorhabditis elegans uses contact-dependent sensing primarily to avoid threats, Pristionchus pacificus has co-opted this modality to support both avoidance and prey detection, enabling context-dependent predatory behaviour. To uncover a potential mechanism underlying the evolution of P. pacificus prey perception, we mutated 27 canonical mechanosensory genes and assessed their function using behavioural assays, automated behavioural tracking, and a machine learning analysis of behavioural states. While several mutants showed mechanosensory defects, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also impaired prey detection, indicating the emergence of a novel mechanosensory module linked to predatory behaviour. Furthermore, disrupting both mechanosensation alongside chemosensation revealed a synergistic influence for these modalities. Crucially, both mechanosensation and chemosensation pathways converge in the same environmentally exposed IL2 neurons, and silencing these cells induced severe predation defects validating their importance for prey sensing. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of mechanosensory and chemosensory systems that act together to shape the evolution of complex behavioural traits.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Extensive research in cognitive control has demonstrated that error-induced responses in peripheral autonomic measures, such as pupil diameter and heart rate, correlate with the quality of the subsequent behavioral adjustment. Here, we perform ANS measurements during a motor learning task to investigate error-induced ANS responses in implicit motor learning. In a series of experiments, we measured multimodal autonomic signals including pupil diameter, skin conductance, and heart rate while participants made a reaching movement under occasional proprioceptive or visual perturbations of different magnitudes. We characterized the phasic autonomic responses to the induced errors and evaluated their influence on motor learning, which was quantified by comparing the trials immediately before and after the error event (single-trial reach adaptation). Consistent with previous research, the results revealed the sequence of ANS responses induced by unexpected motor errors; the pupil dilation, increased skin-conductance, and heart rate deceleration. These responses also demonstrated a clear dose-dependent increase in responses to errors in both visual and proprioceptive modalities. Furthermore, a latent factor analysis using motor learning and multimodal autonomic response data allowed us to detect a statistical relationship between the latent autonomic states and the motor learning rate, suggesting the suppression of implicit motor adaptation by error-induced sympathetic activity. These results provide novel insights into how ANS-tagged internal states affect implicit motor learning.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In vitro, SegB binds a centromeric DNA sequence adjacent to the segAB operon, and in vivo forms a distinct focus on each segregating chromosome. SegA, a ParA-like ATPase, binds DNA non-specifically in vitro and promotes chromosome compaction and segregation in vivo. During division, SegA shifts from chromosome-associated puncta to form a single, elongated figure that runs between separating SegB foci. Late in division, SegA retreats to regions surrounding separated SegB foci. Elongated SegA figures appear in segB knockout cells but no longer lie perpendicular to the division plane.

However, a challenge in ancient genomic analysis is the relatively low genome coverage for most samples, limiting analysis to pseudohaploid genotypes. Genotype imputation offers potential to alleviate this limitation by improving information content and accuracy in low coverage genomes. To test this we used published high coverage (>8x) goat palaeogenomes, imputing downsampled genomes using the VarGoats dataset (1,372 individuals) as a reference panel. Measuring concordance between imputed and high coverage genotypes, we find high concordance after filtering for common (>5%), high confidence variants, with 0.5x genomes reaching >0.97 concordance. There is a trade-off between coverage, genotype probability (GP) thresholds, and genotype recovery, where higher coverage and more lenient GP thresholds result in higher recovery, and a reduction in heterozygous false positive rates with stricter thresholds. We then imputed 36 goat palaeogenomes with [&ge;]0.5x coverage to examine runs-of-homozygosity (ROH) and identity-by-descent (IBD) patterns. Using a novel approach combining ROH profiles across tools, we find that among Neolithic goats, ROH increases with distance from the Zagros Mountains, suggesting a large effect of the initial dispersal of managed herds. Inbreeding levels decrease across Southwest Asia in more recent periods. IBD mirrored this pattern, with less relatedness in the early herding site of Ganj Dareh compared to higher relatedness in goats from later in the dispersal process. These findings provide insights into the genetic consequences of early goat management on demography, and confirm the utility of imputation in leveraging low coverage palaeogenomes.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

E.; Greening, M.; Sormanni, P.; D'Adamio, L.", "abstract": "Delivery of therapeutics to the brain is restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A promising strategy to overcome this involves exploiting receptor-mediated transcytosis pathways, such as those mediated by transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed on brain endothelial cells and naturally transports iron-bound transferrin across the BBB. To leverage this mechanism, we immunized camelids with human TfR1 and cloned 470 VHH nanobody sequences from their B cells. From this repertoire, 24 nanobodies (TfR1b-Nbs) were identified that bind cell membrane human TfR1. These nanobodies were produced in CHO-S cells, a mammalian expression system widely used in therapeutic protein production for its ability to support proper folding, disulfide bond formation, and human-compatible post-translational modifications. CHO-S cells also generate very low endotoxin levels, making them suitable for clinical-grade manufacturing. TfR1b-Nbs were screened for binding to human TfR1, lack of interference with transferrin binding and TfR1-mediated iron uptake, and the ability to cross the BBB via human TfR1-mediated transcytosis in newly generated humanized Tfr1h knock-in rats. To improve developability and reduce potential immunogenicity, selected TfR1b-Nbs were humanized and optimized using the AbNatiV algorithm, enhancing humanness, solubility, and VHH-nativeness. Eight optimized TfR1b-Nbs retained BBB permeability and were fused to humanized TNF inhibitors (TNFI- or TNFI-{beta}), generating 16 heterodimers. Fusion to TNFI served as a functional readout, confirming that TfR1b-Nbs can shuttle biologically active, BBB-impermeable payloads into the CNS. All heterodimers demonstrated CNS delivery after intravenous administration, and selected constructs also reached the brain via subcutaneous injection, maintaining high serum and CSF levels for up to 72 hours. A pilot study with one heterodimer showed that chronic administration in rats humanized for both transferrin and TfR1 caused no hematological toxicity or signs of anemia, a key safety concern when targeting TfR1. These results establish humanized TfR1b-Nbs, designated NewroBus, as promising BBB shuttles for the safe and effective therapeutic delivery of biologics to the brain.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Rather than assuming exponential autocorrelation decay, we define timescales by projecting the fMRI time series onto these approximating models, requiring only stationarity and mixing conditions while incorporating robust standard errors to account for model misspecification. We introduce theoretical properties of timescale estimators and show parameter recovery in realistic simulations, as well as applications to fMRI from the Human Connectome Project. Comparatively, the time-domain method produces more accurate estimates under model misspecification, remains computationally efficient for high-dimensional fMRI data, and yields maps aligned with known functional brain organization.

M.; Iruzubieta, P.; Fernandez-Lopez, R.; Crespo, J.; de la Cruz, F.", "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial condition influenced by the gut microbiome (GM). While previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between MASLD and key microbial clades using low-resolution 16S rRNA profiling, we employed high-resolution metagenomic sequencing and multi-marker taxonomic classification across three independent cohorts to identify robust microbial and functional signatures of MASLD. We consistently detected a depletion of Agathobacter rectalis, a known butyrate producer, in MASLD patients. Functionally, MASLD was characterized by a depletion of genes involved in butyrate and methane biosynthesis -particularly within the crotonyl-butyryl-CoA axis- alongside an enrichment of genes driving the production of endogenous alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol. Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts -rather than taxonomic changes alone- play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Recent results show that in silico prediction methodology can improve and outperform laboratory data-based methods for predictions of Vss and F. The main objectives were to evaluate the simple allometry principle for CL and CL/F, how well simple allometry predicts CL and CL/F in humans, and whether a combination of simple allometry and in silico predictions can improve predictions of CL and CL/F in humans.\n\nMethodsThe literature was searched for CL and CL/F-data in animal species and man. Data from at least 2 species, and preferably 3 or 4, and humans, for each compound (only small drugs) were used for the evaluation. The software ANDROMEDA by Prosilico was used for in silico predictions.\n\nResults and DiscussionThe evaluation shows limited support for the theoretical basis and empirical evidence and applicability of simple allometry for the prediction of CL and CL/F. There are many deviations from the simple allometric relationship (such as relatively low liver weight and blood flow in humans and 140-fold underprediction to 5,800-fold overprediction), skewness (including general overprediction, cases where humans deviate, and relatively high CL and low F in rats) and limited interspecies relationships (R2=0.07-0.19 for CL in animals vs humans). With 43 qualified compounds, R2 for CL and CL/F with simple allometry reached ca 1/3 (log scales). With the combination of simple allometry and in silico it was possible to improve the predictive performance. 31 to 124 % (average 68 %) improvement were found for R2, <2-fold error and median error, whereas maximum errors were reduced to 1/13 to 1/6. In silico predictions alone were even better - 19 to 176 % (average 96 %) and 1/157 to 1/25, respectively.\n\nConclusionSimple allometry is associated with limited theoretical and empirical support for predictions of CL and CL/F in humans, and can be clearly improved when combined with (or replaced by) new in silico prediction methodology. This is in line with the ambition to reduce and replace animal testing in drug development and need for methodological improvement.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Participants judge which of two tactile stimuli, one on each hand, came first. A key finding is that TOJ performance declines when the arms are crossed, likely due to interactions between tactile, proprioceptive, and visual information. The TOJ crossing effect has been widely reported, but studies have employed various analysis methods, leaving open whether the choice of method influences the effect's magnitude. Moreover, some studies have reported modulations by the availability of visual information, response modality, or speeded response requirements. Through an exhaustive, systematic literature search, we identified 37 experiments that investigated the TOJ crossing effect. Meta-analysis estimated the effect size at approximately 1.4. The moderators did not significantly affect this estimate, though this is likely due to too few studies being available to obtain sufficient statistical power. The large effect size supports the TOJ task's use in other, e.g. developmental and clinical, research. However, the lack of statistically significant effect modulation by the moderators calls for caution when applying it for research questions beyond the crossing effect itself.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Combining neuroimaging and computational modeling, this study examined how future interaction prospects--a key element of social bonds--modulate reactive and proactive punishment. Participants acted as second- or third-party punishers, responding to allocation offers from individuals with or without future interactions. Results showed that participants imposed harsher punishment on both fair and unfair offers from individuals they did not expect to interact with, aligning with lower self-reported social closeness. Heightened provocation sensitivity, reflected in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity, drove the increased reactive punishment toward wrongdoers without future interactions, whereas punishment of future-interacting transgressors was associated with enhanced dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC) activity. A stronger preference for relative advantage and reduced harm sensitivity, linked to dlPFC and temporoparietal junction activity, mediated greater proactive punishment towards non-future-interacting individuals. Moreover, proactive punishment and underlying neurocognitive processes followed a collective retaliation pattern, increasing after unfair (vs. fair) behavior from another non-future-interacting individual.

Here, we present a paradigm that combines measurement of curiosity, insight (aha), understanding and liking to outline the contours of this epistemic arc and study their neuronal mechanisms. In two preregistered experiments we employ the \"title effect\" - the fact that additional semantic information accompanying an artwork (such as titles) can change how an observer understands and enjoys a piece of visual art. Participants viewed paintings (5s trials) and rated their curiosity for seeing the title. This was followed either by the original title or a dummy title lacking additional information (untitled), and a second presentation of the painting, after which participants rated strength of aha, aesthetic liking, and feeling of understanding the artwork.\n\nIn a behavioral online study (N=55 participants) we replicate a set of previous findings and establish that visual art together with their titles can prompt strong feelings of aha. The association between the collected ratings is complex, partly nonlinear, and shaped by the type and amount of information provided by the stimulus material. In an EEG, ECG and eye tracking study with the same paradigm (N=49 participants) we aimed to characterize the temporal sequence of processing. Our findings show a primacy of (felt) understanding among the (neuro)physiological correlates of meaning making. Robust decoding of curiosity both before and after the titles substantiates its relevance within the epistemic arc. Aha could be decoded from pupil size after seeing the title, but not from the EEG. Lastly, though more difficult, a fast initial EEG response related to aesthetic liking could be decoded. In this study we traced and characterized the epistemic process of meaning making and its role in aesthetic evaluation of visual art.

The growing prevalence of kratom products enriched with 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG), an active metabolite of mitragynine (MG), necessitates evaluating the respiratory effects of these alkaloids and determining if naloxone reverses their potential respiratory depressant effects. Respiratory parameters were measured in awake, freely moving female and male Sprague-Dawley rats using whole body plethysmography. To minimize handling-induced artifacts and ensure precise respiratory recordings, drugs were administered intravenously. Morphine and 7-HMG induced significant respiratory depression, evidenced by reductions in breathing frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume. In contrast, MG administration unexpectedly increased respiratory frequency. Naloxone fully reversed the respiratory depression induced by both morphine and 7-HMG but did not alter the respiratory stimulant effects produced by MG. These findings demonstrate that 7-HMG exhibits significant respiratory depressant properties similar to classical opioids, and importantly, such depressant effects are effectively antagonized by naloxone. Conversely, MG exerts respiratory stimulant effects through mechanisms independent of opioid receptor pathways. Collectively, these data highlight crucial pharmacological distinctions between kratom alkaloids, underscoring the risk associated with high 7-HMG-containing kratom products and suggesting that the predominant alkaloid MG may offer a safer respiratory profile.\n\nSignificance StatementThe prevalence of kratom products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG), a {micro}-opioid receptor agonist, underscores the need to evaluate respiratory effects of kratom-related alkaloids and their reversal by naloxone. 7-HMG induced significant respiratory depression comparable to morphine, which was reversed by naloxone. Conversely, mitragynine, kratoms most abundant alkaloid, unexpectedly increased respiratory frequency unaffected by naloxone.

Prediction of individual differences in motor learning is of theoretical significance and practical relevance. Brain as the central neural apparatus supporting motor control and learning has attracted considerable research efforts on examining brain functional and structural predictors of individual differences in motor learning. Many previous studies applied a resting state (RS) approach in recording brain activity, selected the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) a priori as a seed or region of interest (ROI), and reported that functional connectivity between M1 and other brain regions predicted individual differences in tasks mostly on motor sequence learning. However, task-evoked brain neural activity and connectivity that represent different brain dynamics from spontaneous brain dynamics have not been studied in this line of research. This study presents findings on RS and finger-tapping evoked cortical somato-motor network (SMN) neural connectivity correlates with individual performances in a visuomotor adaptation (VMA) task, based on analysis of multimodal data from the Cam-CAN study. SMN nodes were initially localized through finger-tapping evoked brain magnetic fields as sampled with magnetoencephalography (MEG). It was found that SMN node specific neural connectivity strength at the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during different stages around finger tapping but not in RS were significantly correlated with individual mean target errors in the final adaptation stage.

In contrast, changes in LTM were observed during FAM and OMM. They were characterized by pre-stimulus alpha increase at somatosensory areas, and modulations of fronto-medial and fronto-parietal theta-alpha synchronizations.\n\nConclusionsDifferent meditation states do not influence bottom-up sensory pain processing. However, they significantly alter cognitive/affective pain mechanisms in state- and trait-dependent ways. In novice meditators, a positive emotional disposition during meditation can suppress the distribution and cognitive/affective appraisal of nociceptive signals. In expert meditators, effects of meditation states on pain processing are critically guided by advanced control of internal attention leading to fine-tuned involvement and functional segregation of cognitive control and attention networks.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

However, significant within-person variability in spindle attributes complicates their utility in predicting cognitive deterioration. This study aimed to uncover distinct spindle types and their relevance to memory decline using data-driven clustering.\n\nMethodsPolysomnography was collected from younger (n = 43, ages 20-45 years) and older cognitively healthy adults (n = 34, ages 60-81 years). Spindles were clustered into four groups using multiple features and spatiotemporal context, irrespective of participant age.\n\nResultsResulting clusters were hierarchically defined by the sleep stage, slow oscillation concurrence, and hemisphere. Stage N3 spindles (15%; predominantly coinciding with slow oscillations) formed a distinct group, followed by N2 spindles coinciding with slow oscillations (27%). Remaining N2 spindles were categorized into unilateral (41%) and bilateral clusters (17%). In older adults, there was a reduced proportion of N2 bilateral spindles and an increased proportion of N2 spindles concurrent with slow oscillations. Reduced proportion of N2 bilateral spindles was associated with better composite memory performance in younger adults, whereas higher spindle power, regardless of cluster belonging, was associated with reduced memory benefit from sleep compared with wakefulness.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate differing expression of spatiotemporal spindle clusters in older age, as well as intertwined dynamics between spindle propagation, SO concurrence, and frequency shifts in ageing. In addition, spindle heterogeneity aligned with global sleep stage dynamics. These results emphasize the interconnectedness of spindle activity with overall sleep patterns, underscoring the importance of spatiotemporal context within and across sleep stages.\n\nStatement of significanceThis study used data-driven clustering to explore sleep spindles as potential markers for age-related memory decline. We identified spindle clusters determined by sleep stage, slow oscillation concurrence, and hemisphere propagation. Notably, older adults showed altered expression of these clusters, indicating age-specific dynamics. Further research should focus on distinguishing spindle deterioration from broader sleep changes in older age. Such insights could pave the way for early detection and intervention strategies in cognitive decline, highlighting sleeps crucial role in maintaining cognitive health and resilience in aging populations. These findings hold promise for developing targeted approaches to enhance mental wellness and quality of life in older adults.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

These potent norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors promote wakefulness, suppress appetite, enhance physical performance, and are purported to increase attentional abilities. Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded conflicting results about the effects of stimulants on the brain's attention, action/motor, and salience regions that are difficult to reconcile with their proposed attentional effects. Here, we utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the large Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to understand the effects of stimulants on brain functional connectivity (FC) in children (n = 11,875; 8-11 years old) using network level analysis (NLA). We validated these brain-wide association study (BWAS) findings in a controlled, precision imaging drug trial (PIDT) with highly-sampled (165-210 minutes) healthy adults receiving high-dose methylphenidate (Ritalin, 40 mg). In both studies, stimulants were associated with altered FC in action and motor regions, matching patterns of norepinephrine transporter expression. Connectivity was also changed in the salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMN), which are important for reward-motivated learning and closely linked to dopamine, but not the brain's attention systems (e.g. dorsal attention network, DAN). Stimulant-related differences in FC closely matched the rs-fMRI pattern of getting enough sleep, as well as EEG- and respiration-derived brain maps of arousal. Taking stimulants rescued the effects of sleep deprivation on brain connectivity and school grades. The combined noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of stimulants may drive brain organization towards a more wakeful and rewarded configuration, explaining improved task effort and persistence without direct effects on attention networks.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Among them, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) plays a key influence. However, the transcriptional programs it engages remain poorly defined due to the limited accessibility of human brain tissue. To address this, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived model of early forebrain differentiation, enabling a precise dissection of SHH-driven transcriptional programs over time. RNA sequencing revealed dynamic transcriptomic landscapes governing forebrain neuroectoderm specification and dorsoventral patterning. In addition, pharmacological perturbation of SHH signaling allowed to identify an extended collection of novel forebrain regionalization markers, including several previously unrecognized dorsal and ventral determinants. By combining in vivo human datasets with functional mouse studies, we enhanced the biological relevance of this extended network of putative SHH-regulated genes and long non-coding RNAs in shaping early forebrain architecture. This work advances our understanding of the temporal dynamics of SHH signaling in human neurodevelopment and provide critical molecular insights into midline brain malformations.

The current study quantified the environmental impacts of 31 commercially available dry dog foods purchased in the UK, categorised as plant-based, poultry-based, red meat-based (beef and lamb) and veterinary renal diets.\n\nMethodEnvironmental metrics including land use (m{superscript 2}/1000 kcal), greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2eq/1000 kcal), acidifying emissions (g SO2eq/1000 kcal), eutrophying emissions (g PO3-eq/1000 kcal), and freshwater withdrawal (L/1000 kcal) were estimated using life cycle assessment datasets and adjusted for ingredient composition and energy density. Foods were additionally standardised to 100% moisture-adjusted content, and group differences were evaluated statistically.\n\nResults and discussionPlant-based diets demonstrated the lowest impacts across all measures. Poultry-based and veterinary diets showed intermediate profiles, while beef- and lamb-based foods exhibited substantially higher impacts. Beef-based diets required 101.12 m{superscript 2} land and emitted 31.16 kg CO2eq per 1000 kcal dry food, compared to 2.71 m{superscript 2} land and 2.79 kg CO2eq for plant-based. Beef-based foods generated 7.1-fold higher acidifying emissions and 16.4-fold higher eutrophying emissions, compared to plant-based foods. Lamb-based foods were the most freshwater intensive (677.01L/1000kcal), compared to plant-based (246.95L/1000kcal). Whilst moving to a circular food system has the potential to reduce environmental impact, current pet food manufacturing practices compete with human food supply and are not nutritionally necessary for dogs to thrive. These findings highlight a major opportunity to mitigate the environmental footprint of companion animal nutrition through reformulation towards higher inclusion of plant-based ingredients.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

While the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying observational learning are well understood, less is known about whom people prefer to learn from in the context of observational learning. One hypothesis posits that learners prefer individuals who exhibit a high degree of decision noise (randomness in action selection), free riding on the costly exploration of others. An alternative hypothesis suggests that learners prefer individuals with low decision noise, and imitate consistent and reliable behavior. In a preregistered experiment, we found that most participants preferred to learn from low-noise individuals. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that participants who preferred lownoise individuals tended to rely on imitation of others actions, whereas those who preferred high-noise individuals relied more on learning from others reward outcomes. These findings offer a potential computational account of how learning styles shape partner selection in social learning.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn our daily lives, we often learn by watching others. For example, when starting a new job, we might watch an experienced colleague to learn effective strategies, or an inexperienced coworker to avoid common mistakes. While previous studies have examined how people learn by observing others, less is known about how we decide whom to observe. This study explored whether people prefer to learn from individuals who make consistent choices or those who behave more randomly. At first glance, the answer seems obvious: we would naturally prefer to learn from those who make consistent, reliable decisions. However, there can also be value in learning from someone who behaves unpredictably. For example, when searching for a good restaurant, observing an adventurous friend who tries unfamiliar places might help us discover hidden gems. Despite this potential advantage, we found that most participants preferred consistent decision-makers. Further analysis revealed that participants who favored reliable partners tended to imitate their actions, while those who chose more exploratory partners focused more on outcomes. Our findings suggest that personal learning styles shape partner preferences. These insights could help us understand how people choose whom to learn from in everyday settings like classrooms, or workplaces.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Computational approaches to drug repurposing leverage large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to identify new indications for existing drugs.

In this study, we propose Riemann-GNN, an end-to-end framework that combines hyperbolic geometry, graph neural networks (GNNs), and causal inference for interpretable drug repurposing. Riemann-GNN embeds multi-relational biomedical KGs into a hyperbolic Riemannian manifold modeled by the Poincare ball, effectively capturing the hierarchical structure of biomedical entities. On top of this geometry, we introduce a causal reasoning module that extracts disease-centric subgraphs and applies intervention-based inference using structural causal models. This module provides mechanistic explanations for predicted drug-disease associations. We evaluate our model on PrimeKG, a comprehensive biomedical KG with over 129,000 nodes and 4 million edges, achieving AUROC = 0.971, AUPRC = 0.963, and Recall@20 = 0.847, significantly out performing several state-of-the-art baselines.

In this setting, state-of-the-art solutions rely on Bloom filters as a way to index all k-mers (substrings of length k) in the documents. To answer a query, the k-mers of the query string are tested for membership against the index and documents that contain at least a user-prescribed fraction of them (e.g., 75-80%) are returned. Methods and results: Here, we explore an alternative index design based on k-mer minimizers and integer compression methods. We show that a careful implementation of this design outperforms previous solutions based on Bloom filters by a wide margin: the index has lower memory footprint and faster query times, while false positive matches have only a minor impact on the ranking of the documents reported.

This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of HO-3867, a STAT3 inhibitor, and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, alone and in combination in an immunocompetent (IC) syngeneic ovarian cancer progression model. Methods: The ability of HO-3867 to induce macrophage polarization was assessed in RAW264.7 cells, while its impact on anti-tumor immunity was evaluated in splenocytes co-cultured with ID8 and OC ascites cells. Immune modulation, including cytokine induction, extracellular vesicle (EV) release, and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) protein expression, was analyzed in-vitro and using in-vivo OC model. The therapeutic effects of HO-3867 and bevacizumab were examined in vivo by measuring ascites volume, EV secretion levels, and immune cell populations via flow cytometry. Results: Our results demonstrate that combination therapy significantly reduced ascites accumulation, and limited peritoneal disease spread in ovarian cancer mouse models. EV analysis revealed a decrease in total EVs and CD9+ subpopulations, which correlated with the associated ESCRT proteins involved in EV formation and secretion implicating EVs in tumor progression and immune modulation. Flow cytometry analysis of ascites immune cell populations showed that combination therapy reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their PD-L1 expression, while enhancing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity via granzyme B secretion. Cytokine profiling revealed upregulation of IFN-{gamma} and downregulation of IL-6, IL-10 and CXCL-2 suggesting enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, HO-3867 promoted macrophage polarization toward tumoricidal M1 phenotype and reduced MDSC expansion in- vitro, enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion: HO-3867 and bevacizumab synergistically reprogram the tumor microenvironment, inhibit EV-mediated progression, and enhance antitumor immunity.

While biting, mosquitoes inject viruses but also saliva factors that modulate feeding and potentially viral transmission. However, studying this interplay is limited by our ability to quantify saliva release. Here, we developed a transgenic Aedes aegypti line that secretes fluorescent markers in saliva, enabling visualization of probing sites on human skin explants and quantification of salivation. Saliva secretion remained robust under diverse physiological conditions but was significantly reduced upon Zika or chikungunya virus infection. Nevertheless, virus release did not correlate with levels of saliva factors, suggesting decreased salivation does not lower chances of viral transmission. Our results bring perspective to the previously described increase in probing behavior in infected mosquitoes, indicating it may be caused by lower release of saliva factors. Thus, the negative impact of infection on salivation may have been selected to facilitate virus transmission.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Hundreds of autoimmune disorders, including arthritis, lupus etc., affect millions of people all over the world. Studying those disorders using mouse models is crucial for understanding the disease mechanisms. Knowing the genome sequence of these mouse models would help with those vital studies. B10.RIII is one of the most susceptible mouse strains used as a model to understand autoimmune diseases but did not have its genome sequenced until now. In this study, we generated the first, high-quality chromosome level genome sequence of B10.RIII, using a combination of long read, short read and optical mapping techniques. The B10.RIII genome sequence scored higher than the reference mouse genome both in assembly completeness and assembly quality. The B10.RIII genome annotation based on the reference genome identified about 98% of the known reference genes. We believe the availability of B10.RIII genome sequence will help advance the understanding of autoimmune diseases, giving the researchers a better idea on its unique genetic makeup. Comparative studies of B10.RIII with other mouse models could also significantly enhance the power of these models towards their clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

To address this issue, we employed Ewing sarcoma (EwS) as a model as it is driven by a single driver oncogene, namely chimeric EWSR1::ETS fusion transcription factors, whose fluctuating expression levels promote diverse transcriptional programs. While EWSR1::ETS-high cells display a rather sessile but proliferative phenotype and EWSR1::ETS-low cells are more invasive, the mechanisms underlying these different phenotypes remain poorly characterized. Here, using an integrative functional genomics approach, we show that low EWSR1::ETS fusion activity in patient tumors associates with poor outcome and increased signaling of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). AHR signaling enrichment correlates with increased tumor infiltration by immunosuppressive cells and worse overall patient survival. Knockdown of EWSR1::ETS in EwS spheroid models cultured in human plasma-like media strongly alters tryptophan metabolism resulting in increased secretion of the AHR ligand kynurenine. Silencing of EWSR1::ETS reduced killing of EwS cells by natural killer (NK) cells, while AHR silencing increases NK cell-mediated killing. From a cell-intrinsic perspective, AHR knockdown inhibits proliferation, clonogenic, and spheroidal growth of EwS cells in vitro, which can be recapitulated by pharmacological AHR inhibition. Furthermore, AHR knockdown decreases tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our results illustrate how oncogene-mediated metabolic reprogramming of amino acid metabolism can translate into more aggressive disease phenotypes in cancer.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We have explored the therapeutic potential of the oncolytic Maraba virus strain MG1. We show that MG1 undergoes productive replication and exerts direct oncolysis of established EWS cell lines, doxorubicin-resistant EWS cell lines and patient-derived Ewing sarcoma (PDES) cell cultures more recently established from tumours. In contrast, primary mesenchymal stem cells (the likely cell of origin of EWS) were resistant to MG1, with IFN-I being a major determinant of tumour cell selectivity. MG1 treated PBMC produced IFN-I and killed EWS cells in vitro, in a natural killer (NK) cell-dependent manner.

It modulates various mitochondrial processes including protein and lipid transport and is causally linked to a variety of human diseases. To gain a broad overview of the various pathways modulated by the MICOS complex, we examined its molecular neighbourhood. For this, we employed proximity biotinylation assays using APEX2 fused to four MICOS subunits (MIC10, MIC13, MIC26 and MIC27) in the respective mammalian knockout cells. These four MICOS-APEX2 fusion proteins integrated into the native MICOS complex and properly localised as revealed by electron microscopy combined with DAB staining and STED super-resolution nanoscopy. Here, we identify 119 common and 50 unique proteins, termed MICOS NanoDomain Network (MINDNet) encompassing the versatile proximity proteome of the MIC10/MIC13/MIC26/MIC27 subcomplex playing multifaceted mitochondrial functions. The MINDNet revealed a large number of OXPHOS proteins, protein translocases of the IM and OM, mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and solute carrier family transporters. Using the cues obtained from the proximity interaction studies, we investigated the role of all the MICOS proteins in modulating the function of the OXPHOS complexes. Among all the MICOS proteins, MIC10 and MIC60 consistently regulated the assembly and activity of the OXPHOS complexes.

Copper (Cu), while essential, can be toxic in excess and is regulated by Cu transporters such as CTR1. However, the role of CTR1 in ischemic retinopathy remains unclear. Methods and Results: Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced by elevating intraocular pressure to 110 mmHg for 40 minutes in the right eye of Ctr1 heterozygous and wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, IR triggered rapid CTR1 upregulation and increased retinal Cu levels (measured by ICP -MS). IR injury caused retinal ganglion cell loss, inner retinal thinning, vascular degeneration, and apoptosis, all of which were significantly attenuated in Ctr1 heterozygous mice. Ctr1 heterozygous mice also exhibited reduced microglial (Iba1) and glial cells (GFAP) activation and preserved visual function, as assessed by electroretinography. Mechanistically, IR-induced superoxide production (DHE staining), upregulation of NADPH oxidase components (NOX2, p47phox), and NFkB activation were markedly suppressed in Ctr1 heterozygous mice. Treatment with the Cu chelator tetrathiomolybdate similarly reduced retinal thinning, neurovascular damage, apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress after IR injury. Conclusions: CTR1 plays a central role in mediating Cu-dependent oxidative stress, neurovascular degeneration, and inflammation following retinal IR injury. Targeting the CTR1-Cu axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic retinopathy.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In particular, nanoUHPLC/High-Resolution nanoESI-MS/MS enables the characterization of proteins in complex biological samples due to its high sensitivity, accuracy, and scalability. However, LC-MS/MS proteomics might still be susceptible to laboratory and sample-associated contaminants, which can significantly compromise the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, an accurate identification and annotation of such contaminants is crucial for the development of robust proteomics databases and spectral-libraries related search engines. This approach is of special interest in the field of secretome and extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-enclosed nanostructures that contain a variety of proteins crucial for cell-to-cell communication and translational applications. Results When working in ex vivo/in vitro settings, proteins from fetal bovine serum (FBS), commonly employed in standard cell culture media, may interfere with the proteome analysis. To address this issue, we conceived and designed SPROUTS_DB, Serum Protein Repository Of Unwanted Target(ed) Sequences DataBase, a dedicated resource to catalog serum-derived contaminants. Starting from media supplemented with EV-depleted FBS, we simulated cell growth conditions - in the absence of cells - followed by ultracentrifugation. LC-MS/MS analysis of these samples resulted in the identification of a novel set of 1,288 contaminant proteins, which has been deposited in the ProteomeXchange repository (identifier PXD044137). SPROUTS_DB contains primarily soluble proteins, mainly related to the Gene Ontology categories Extracellular Region and Extracellular Space, in line with the nature of the starting sample. In contrast, only a small fraction of the contaminants is classified as membrane-associated proteins, supporting the limited vesicle contamination in the complete medium, due to the use of EV-depleted FBS. Of note, we demonstrated that SPROUTS_DB outperforms existing contaminants databases, ensuring that only peptide spectra relevant to the examined sample are retained and identified as true positive data. Conclusions Considering that even proteins from phylogenetically distant organisms share extensive stretches of sequences, SPROUTS_DB is designed to discern contaminants from real sample proteins of interest, minimizing false positive identifications.

Here, we identify Tomosyn-2 as a key regulator of {beta}-cell maturation. Tomosyn-2 expression declines with age in mouse islets, coinciding with enhanced biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and reduced {beta}-cell proliferation. Genetic deletion of Tomosyn-2 improves glucose tolerance, elevates plasma insulin levels, and augments islet insulin secretion, without altering systemic insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Tomosyn-2 interacts with syntaxin-1A (Stx1A) to inhibit insulin granule exocytosis by limiting SNARE complex formation. Transcriptomic and network analyses reveal that Tomosyn-2 loss reprograms gene expression to strengthen the coupling between insulin secretion and proliferative pathways. Its deletion also reduces {beta}-cell proliferation and mass expansion, suppresses cell cycle and Akt1 signaling, and promotes {beta}-cell identity, maturation, and altered islet architecture. These findings identify Tomosyn-2 as a crucial molecular switch that orchestrates the balance between proliferation and functional maturation during postnatal {beta}-cell development.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Previously, maintenance of nuclear morphology and integrity was thought to be solely dependent on a force balance between nuclear mechanical resistance and actin antagonism. However, our recent work revealed that inhibiting RNA polymerase II suppresses nuclear blebbing independent of altering force balance, but the mechanism remains unknown. Through removing cell culture media serum and then adding it back, we can decrease and then restore transcriptional activity. Decreasing transcriptional activity decreases nuclear bleb formation, stability, and rupture while returning transcriptional activity restores nuclear blebbing. These modulations of transcriptional activity did not alter nuclear or actin mechanics. The mean square displacement (MSD) of chromatin domains labeled via transfected Cy3-dNTPs revealed that transcription activity regulates chromatin motion. To determine if increasing chromatin motion is a mechanism to increase nuclear blebbing, we used an established RAD51 inhibitor BO2. We verified BO2 increases chromatin domain motion which resulted in increased nuclear blebbing. We reveal the mechanism by which transcriptional activity drives nuclear blebbing is through chromatin motion.

Recent studies have revealed the atomic structures of many multi-component ciliary complexes, providing new insights into their mechanisms of action that are vital for cilia's biological functions. However, little is known about the structure, proteome, and function of full-length radial spoke 3 (RS3), which is distinct from the structurally well-characterized RS1 and RS2. Radial spokes are conserved megadalton complexes that transmit mechanochemical signals from the central pair of microtubules to the dynein motors, thereby coordinating ciliary motility. Here, we combined cryo-electron microscopic single-particle reconstruction, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), proteomic analysis, and computational modeling to determine the 3D structure and atomic model of RS3 from mouse respiratory cilia. Our structure reveals all protein components of RS3, including regulatory and metabolic enzymes, such as a protein kinase A subunit, adenylate kinases and malate dehydrogenases. We have confirmed the important role of adenylate kinase 7 in RS3 by cryo-ET analyses of respiratory cilia in AK7-deficient mice, which display primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our findings suggest that RS3 is an important regulatory hub and cluster of metabolic proteins that helps to maintain ATP at the levels required for sustained dynein motor activity and ciliary beating.

To avoid pathophysiological effects, STIM1 must respond precisely and reversibly to changes in ER Ca2+ content while maintaining a low basal activity under resting, ER-replete conditions. Here we combine single-molecule FRET measurements of full-length dimeric STIM1 in lipid membranes with an AlphaFold2 structural model to describe the structure and regulation of the resting state. We show that STIM1 activity is controlled by the combined operation of four relatively weak restraints, or brakes. The Ca2+-bound EF-SAM luminal domain acts as a steric restraint to inhibit spontaneous activity. In the cytosolic region, the domain-swapped interaction and alignment of CC11 with CC3 of CAD positions the apex of CAD next to the ER membrane, where electrostatic lipid-protein interactions further stabilize the inactive conformation. A fourth brake is created by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the two CC12/3 domains attached to the base of CAD. Disruption of any one of these brakes leads to STIM1 activation, showing that the concerted action of these relatively weak restraints is required to prevent spontaneous activity in resting cells with full ER Ca2+ stores, while enabling reversible activation in response to changes in store content.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

To enhance therapy outcomes, it is crucial to identify interventions that can synergize with ICB therapy to overcome tumor resistance. Therefore, we need to define the cellular mechanisms that sensitize tumors to cytotoxic T cells. CD8 T cells rely on cytokines such as TNF to carry out their cytotoxicity against tumors, and recent findings link select tumor mutations in the TNF pathway to increased T cell killing, in a manner dependent on RIPK1 kinase. Here, we demonstrate that sensitized tumor cells fail to initiate inhibitory RIPK1 phosphorylation at site S25 upon T cell attack, thereby foregoing a pro-survival checkpoint early in TNF signal transduction. Consequently, tumor cells experiencing a loss of TNF-induced RIPK1 S25 phosphorylation exhibit increased RIPK1 activation and fail to recruit non-canonical IKK kinases (TBK1 and IKKe) to the TNFR1 complex. Functional knockouts of TBK1 and IKKe in melanoma cells result in heightened sensitivity not only in CD8 T cell but also in Natural Killer cell attacks.

Here we determine the mechanism by which USP28 stabilizes p53 and show that USP28 is required not only for an efficient stress response but also for maintaining basal p53 levels in some cancer cells. Loss of functional USP28 allows cells to evade mitotic stress and DNA damage responses in a manner that is specific to cell type and cancer context. We identify a prevalent, shorter USP28 isoform critical for p53 stabilization. Its C-terminal domain mediates PLK1-dependent binding to 53BP1, a dimerization-driven interaction necessary for mitotic stress memory, p53 stabilization, and cell cycle arrest. Cancer-associated missense mutations in this domain disrupt 53BP1 binding, impair nuclear localization, and destabilize USP28, compromising p53 stabilization.

Disrupting JAK/STAT signaling in airway epithelia during development is lethal, triggers apoptosis, and in adults, reduces lifespan while increasing vulnerability to chronic smoke exposure. Conversely, chronic hyperactivation of JAK/STAT signaling induces significant cell-autonomous epithelial remodeling, evidenced by epithelial thickening, tracheal narrowing, and impaired barrier structure, mirroring the pathological features of chronic lung disease. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway effectively reverses these defects. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses further reveal that maintaining a balance in JAK/STAT signaling is essential for preserving cellular junctions and secretory functions.

Motor domain mutation N93K, previously described as activity-impairing, causes in fact an almost non-significant defect on motor function in vitro. Conversely, it increases NM2-A filament stability and interaction with the myosin chaperone UNC45a in stress fiber-forming cells. This also alters its subcellular localization and effect on adhesion dynamics. Similar cellular effects are observed in cells expressing NM2-A E1841K, a prototypical tail mutation. In cells devoid of stress fibers such as megakaryocytes, NM2-A N93K forms large, amorphous, concentration-dependent aggregates that also contain wild type NM2-A and UNC45a. Conversely, NM2-A E1841K forms concentration-independent aggregates that exclude wild type NM2-A and UNC45a.

By employing sialic acid-targeted glycocapture enrichment of surface proteins coupled with high-throughput shotgun mass spectrometry, we identified podocalyxin (PODXL) and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) as novel components of the chondrogenic cell surfaceome. The expression and function of CNTFR and PODXL on chondrogenic cells were validated using western blotting, immunocytochemistry and transient gene silencing. Notably, silencing of CNTFR and PODXL revealed divergent transcriptional effects on COL1A1, a key marker of fibrocartilage and matrix quality, indicating opposing roles in regulating extracellular matrix composition and chondrocyte identity. The identification of PODXL and CNTFR provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chondrogenesis. The expression of CNTFR on chondrogenic cells suggests a potential role for neurotrophic factors in chondrogenesis and cartilage repair strategies. PODXL, a sialomucin linked to cell-matrix interactions and migration, is potentially involved in maintaining early chondrocyte phenotypes and mediating chondrogenic signals. Altered PODXL and CNTFR in synovial fluid or serum could represent diagnostic biomarkers for early OA, enabling minimally invasive monitoring of cartilage degeneration.

Here, we used long-read direct RNA-sequencing to map transcript isoform changes in mouse ovaries across reproductive age. Comparing young and aged mice under controlled gonadotropin stimulation, we identified widespread alternative splicing changes, including shifts in exon usage, splice site selection, and transcript boundaries. Aged ovaries exhibited increased isoform diversity, favoring distal start and end sites, and a significant rise in exon skipping and intron retention events. Many of these age-biased splicing events altered open reading frames, introduced premature stop codons, or disrupted conserved protein domains. Notably, mitochondrial genes were disproportionately affected. We highlight Ndufs4, a Complex I subunit, as a case in which aging promotes a truncated isoform lacking the canonical Pfam domain. Structural modeling suggests this splice variant could impair Complex I assembly, providing a mechanistic link between splicing and mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging ovary. These findings support the existence of a splicing-energy-aging axis in ovarian physiology, wherein declining mitochondrial function and adaptive or maladaptive splicing changes are intertwined. Our study reveals that alternative splicing is not merely a byproduct of aging but a dynamic, transcriptome-wide regulatory layer that may influence oocyte competence and ovarian longevity.

The metalloprotease OMA1 mediates constitutive and stress-inducible processing of its mitochondrial substrates, but the number of functionally characterized targets remains limited. Using multiproteomic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that the membrane-anchored inner membrane space (IMS) protein AIFM1 serves as a mitochondrial stress-responsive substrate of OMA1. OMA1 cleaves AIFM1 in the IMS under stress conditions with a kinetically slower reaction than that of its conventional substrate, dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Membrane dislocation of cleaved AIFM1 in mitochondria reduces its binding to subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, leading to decreased respiratory activity and ultimately impaired cell growth. Mechanistically, we revealed that AIFM1 broadly safeguards the mitochondrial proteome under steady-state conditions by mediating the import of proteins, particularly respiratory complex I subunits, via the TIM23 complex. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for OMA1 in integrating mitochondrial stress sensing and cellular energetics by altering the AIFM1 topology.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we report a unique pentanucleotide repeat (TTGGG)n as the typical telomeric repeat sequence for Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies). Based on genomic information from ten Odonata species, (TTGGG)n was considered the most likely candidate for telomeric repeat sequences. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using 12 Odonata species, clear (TTGGG)n signals were detected at the chromosome ends in both dragonflies and damselflies. By Southern hybridization using 63 Odonata species, strong (TTGGG)n signals were detected from the majority of species covering all three suborders of Odonata, indicating that the telomeric repeat of the common ancestor of extant Odonata is (TTGGG)n. Notably, there were a few Odonata species in which (TTGGG)n signals were faint or absent, suggesting that the telomeric repeat sequence has repeatedly diverged in Odonata, even within genera such as Sympetrum. We also identified telomerase genes in both dragonflies and damselflies, and in some species, more than two telomerase genes are suggested to be present. Overall, this study demonstrates the ancestral acquisition of novel telomeric repeats and their repeated alteration in Odonata.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Wnt proteins are lipid-modified, secreted morphogens that activate biological programs in a concentration-dependent manner. Their secretion depends on specialized trafficking components, including the cargo receptor Evi/Wls, and often involves apical re- internalization and transcytosis. However, several critical steps in Wnt/Wg trafficking remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disc to uncover novel regulators of Wg secretion. We identified Vps15, a regulatory subunit of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K(III)) complex, as an essential factor for Wg trafficking at the apical membrane. Loss of Vps15 leads to pronounced apical accumulation of Wg in producing cells, elevated extracellular Wg levels, and reduced expression of Wg target genes. Our data indicate that PI3K(III) activity is required for efficient apical endocytosis of Wg, independent of Evi/Wls abundance. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for the PI3K(III) and lipid biogenesis in Wg secretion within polarized epithelia, enhancing our mechanistic understanding of Wnt trafficking.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Evolution of bacterial resistance to phage and phage counter-resistance (coevolution) during therapy may explain some of this variation, the dynamics of which may be affected by interactions with the patients immune system. Here, we examine how a pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa coevolves with two clinically relevant bacteriophages (14-1 and PNM) when in the presence of macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line). We show macrophages reduced the rate by which bacteria were killed by bacteriophages, likely by reducing bacteria-phage contact rates. Over evolutionary time-scales, macrophages increased the proportion of phage resistant bacteria compared to where macrophages were absent. These differences in resistance rates were likely driven by the early advantage in density offered by macrophages to bacteria, exclusion of PNM from the phage cocktail which otherwise increased in frequency in the absence of macrophages. Consequently, macrophages significantly altered the short- and long-term efficacy of a phage cocktail. In line with a growing body of work, our results suggest that the immune system can reduce the efficacy of phage therapy, potentially driving variable outcomes in therapy success in patients.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

However, the stereomicroscope transillumination design is suboptimal, as a single incident beam at the specimen plane is shared and transmitted via two laterally offset detection axes. This flaw limits life science applications due to the transparent nature of samples which results in poor contrast images. We use a single additional element in the illumination path to correct the illumination uniformity across the field of view and, by doing so, enhance image contrast and facilitate detection of refractive structures in transparent biological specimens. We designed and fabricated an integrated lens-biprism element using low-cost, consumer-grade 3D printing methods and consumables. This 3D printed lens-biprism distributed diverging rays from a single incandescent light source into two parallel beams that converged at the specimen plane and transmitted through the respective left and right detection axes of a stereomicroscope. This improved transillumination setup increased the image contrast by up to 67.62% compared to the conventional stereomicroscope setup.

Together with other sensory modalities, olfaction is involved in the control of food intake. Olfactory cues can influence eating behaviors, yet the nutritional status and diet can also alter olfactory abilities. Patients with metabolic disorders present impaired olfactory sensitivity which could in turn worsen their eating behaviors. Here we examined the short-term impact of a Western diet enriched in fat and sugar (High-Fat High-Sugar, HFHS) on the anatomy and physiology of the olfactory epithelium of mice. After 8 weeks of diet, HFHS fed animals presented higher adiposity without overweight, were glucose intolerant without any change in basal blood glucose or plasma insulin. A buried food test indicated impaired olfactory capacities in the HFHS group. Whereas food related odours increased food intake in control chow fed animals, HFHS mice showed an altered response to olfactory appetitive food cues. HFHS fed mice presented olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) with shorter cilia. Finally, electro-olfactogram (EOG) recorded in response to different odorant molecules showed lower amplitudes in HFHS fed mice. HFHS diet withdrawal during one month at the end of the HFHS diet exposure improved metabolic parameters and restored both the OSN cilia length and EOGs. Our results show that diet enriched in fat and sugar can rapidly alter the physiology of the olfactory epithelium before the development of significant metabolic disorders. Anatomical changes of individual olfactory sensory neurons may participate to the reduced olfactory sensitivity.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we modeled resting-state functional flexibility across the adult lifespan (ages 18-88) using structural balance theory. Our findings align with the predictions of the SENECA model (Synergistic, Economical, Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging), revealing a midlife neurocognitive transition: (i) from a metabolically costly, flexible DMN-FPN architecture, toward (ii) a more redundant configuration dominated by low-cost, sensory-driven interactions. The medio-parietal DMN and the Cingulo-Opercular Network (CON) are crucial to this transition, contributing to maintain global brain activity near a critical dynamic regime in older adulthood that optimizes for cognitive flexibility in face of declining metabolic resources.

Such parafoveal previewing may serve as a form of priming, facilitating subsequent processing at fixation. In this study, we investigated whether parafoveal priming leads to both a reduced neural response - akin to repetition suppression - and a more selective neural representation, consistent with neuronal sharpening. Participants performed a visual exploration task involving natural object images that were either parafoveally previewed or not, while magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were recorded. Event-related fields revealed a reduced neural response when an image had been parafoveally presented 250 ms earlier. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed enhanced decoding of object category following parafoveal priming, suggesting increased neural specificity. These findings support the idea that parafoveal previewing contributes to neural sharpening, potentially aiding evidence accumulation by forming sparse and precise representations of objects during visual scene exploration.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The Montreal Urban Community (MUC) wishes to assess the extent of the presence of exotic or invasive animals in waterbodies on the Island of Montreal to coordinate mitigation measures. Here, I present animal profiles, primarily mammals, birds, and fish, from twelve waterbodies on the Island of Montreal using amplicon sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from environmental DNA. Water samples were collected, and total DNA was extracted. PCR amplifications of a portion of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA genome were performed with primers designed to primarily target mammals, fish, and birds. After sequencing, the animal lineages and their proportions were determined. Our results showed that invasive animals, primarily fish such as pumpkinseed, common carp or brown bullhead, were detected in high proportions in five water bodies. However, I did not detect any exotic animals. I also detect significant proportions of sequences affiliated with bovine, porcine and several marine fish species, which was unexpected as these animals are not living on the Island of Montreal. Given the commercial or industrial activities surrounding the water bodies, sequences of these unexpected animals are likely related to the release of meat or seafood waste into the water bodies. Our molecular approach is effective for assessing the animal profiles of water bodies. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the presence of animal waste.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We encountered nearly half (156) of all Dutch bee species. Almost 10% of all individuals belonged to red-listed species, especially in early spring when we observed rich ground nesting bee communities with their associated kleptoparasites. Wild bee abundance and diversity increased with more flowering plant species present, but saturated at low flower species richness. This early saturation suggests that even modest conservation efforts could effectively alleviate floral resource limitation for pollinators. In contrast to the overall pattern, red-listed species occurrence increased with flower diversity without saturating effects and correlated stronger with landscape level factors.

L.", "abstract": "Background: Vici syndrome (VS) is a rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by profound developmental delay, seizures, immune deficits, cardiomyopathy, and progressive motor dysfunction, with a median survival of approximately 42 months. This devastating condition is caused by pathogenic variants in the EPG5 gene, which encodes a key regulator of autophagy. Loss of EPG5 function leads to the accumulation of toxic intracellular material and widespread cellular dysfunction. Currently, there are no effective treatments for VS. The underlying cellular mechanisms driving the progressive neurological decline in VS remain poorly understood. Although previous studies using Epg5 knockout models have demonstrated severe neurological phenotypes, these models have not been comprehensively characterized for molecular and cellular deficits within the central nervous system. Methods: We report the generation and analysis of novel genetically engineered mouse models of VS, including a strain harboring a truncating mutation that recapitulates a pathogenic variant identified in a VS patient and a strain with an Epg5 null allele. These mutant models were used to further understand the underlying molecular deficits of the nervous system. Results: These novel Epg5 mutant mouse models exhibited incompletely penetrant perinatal lethality and neurological deficits were detectable by six weeks of age, which worsen over time. Histological analysis revealed widespread expansion of microglia and astrocytes throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Transcriptomic profiling of CNS tissue revealed robust neuroinflammatory signatures, implicating the activation of both microglia and astrocytes. Notably, the molecular profiles of Epg5-deficient mice share features with disease-associated microglia observed in other models of neurological disease and injury. Conclusions: The analysis of these novel mouse models of Vici syndrome suggest a critical role for neuroglial activation in the pathogenesis of VS. These novel in vivo models will be a valuable platform for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy-related neurodegeneration in congenital disorders of autophagy.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

PAX3::FOXO1 dosage affects expression signatures related to cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and myogenesis.

Parental burying beetles typically rear their larvae on carcasses buried in nests; however, they occasionally raise brood-parasitic larvae from eggs dumped by other females. Parasitic larvae must hatch synchronously with host larvae because the host parents indiscriminately accept any larvae during that period. However, parasites in burying beetles are assumed to have more severe restrictions on synchronous hatching than those in birds because of less predictability of reproductive sites, the necessity for ovarian development at the site, and difficulty in adjusting by oviposition. Is the hatching of parasitic larvae synchronized with that of host larvae, even if the reproductive behavior of the parasites lags behind that of the host owing to restrictions? In the burying beetle Nicrophorus quadripunctatus Kraatz, we observed the hatching of host and parasite offspring under experimental conditions in which female parasites (intruders) encountered carcasses that had been secured by female hosts (residents) two days earlier. In 14 of the 40 replicates, defeated intruders dumped eggs, residents laid 36 eggs, and intruders laid six eggs on average. The hatching of intruder offspring was synchronized with that of the resident offspring despite the two-day lag. Egg dumping is regarded as brood parasitism.

Hence, understanding the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underpinning the processes of learning to read is highly relevant. Here, we use two orthographic learning datasets from baboons and humans to investigate how they implement visual orthographic representations in a learning task of known and novel letter strings. We use two connectionist models (i.e., CORnet-Z and ResNet-18) and a mechanistic model (i.e., the Speechless Reader model, SLR) to investigate orthographic learning and infer the underlying neuro-cognitive processes. The connectionist models employ neuronally plausible architectures. The SLR versions are transparent neuro-cognitive models of orthographic decision behavior. Central to the SLR implementations are three types of prediction error representations that we use for computational phenotyping (i.e., pixel, letter, and letter-sequence level prediction errors). This approach allows us to infer the underlying representations in orthographic decisions. First, we fit the models and simulate the datasets to compare their performance (i.e., all models see the same sequence of stimuli as humans and baboons). Second, after comparing the model performance, we evaluate how the orthographic decisions have been implemented based on the representations used in the SLR models. We find that the SLR, especially on the trial-wise metrics, outperforms the CNNs in both datasets, with both connectionist models generating behavioral responses without a considerable overlap with individual human or baboon responses. Inspecting the SLR representations, we found that both species implemented the most informative representations that developed from visual to more complex orthographic representations with increased learning.

Quantifying this degradation relative to a reference baseline remains a key challenge. Yet, this quantification is essential to provide the necessary resources to regenerate ecosystems. We address this challenge by studying the energetics of population dynamics, where energy inputs such as sunlight and rainfall are transformed into other forms of energy embodied as biomass. This approach provides a unifying framework to quantify degradation across diverse ecosystems via the energetic ecodeficit: the extra energy supply the degraded ecosystem would require to regenerate to a reference state. This energetic deficit can then be translated into a monetary ecodeficit, representing the economic cost of regeneration, considering the local cost of embodied energy. Our analysis reveals nonlinear relationships between biomass loss and energetic ecodeficit, including points of no return beyond which restoration becomes economically infeasible. We showcase our methodology using the current mammal deficits across the African savanna, finding that the monetary ecodefict is about 100 times larger than current estimates. Our work demonstrates how integrating energetic principles into conservation planning can transform ecosystem valuation globally, linking ecosystems and economies sustainably.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

R.; Roslin, T.", "abstract": "Interactions between species are often assumed to occur whenever species pairs co-occur, allowing us to reconstruct local ecological networks from a deterministic 'metaweb'. Thus, a species' set of metaweb interactions defines its Eltonian niche - the biotic conditions under which it can exist. However, both species and interactions may also have Grinnellian niches, reflecting relationships between probability of occurrence and environmental conditions. Over the past few years, we have explored how stochasticity in the occurrence of species and links, and environmental imprints on these, shape ecological interaction networks. In this perspective, we use a set of our empirically characterised networks to show that both species and link occurrence are stochastic, with probabilities conditional on the environment. This insight improves our ability to model observed variation in network structures. We argue that future research should incorporate environmental impacts on both species and links, thus merging the Grinnellian and the Eltonian niche concept.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

C.; Kapishnikov, S.", "abstract": "Soft X-ray microscopy (SXM) is a powerful tool for nanoscale 3D imaging of hydrated, intact cells. However, its application is limited by pixel-wise-correlated noise inherent in the imaging process. While the deep-learning-based framework Noise2Inverse has been proposed for tomography denoising, the lack of robust validation for newly revealed features raises concerns regarding their practical biological utility. We argue that denoising the raw tilt series, instead of on the reconstructed tomogram, offers a significant advantage by leveraging the tomographic reconstruction process to mitigate local prediction errors through averaging. Consequently, features present in the tomogram reconstructed from a denoised tilt series exhibit higher credibility, as falsely predicted details on certain tilt series slices are likely to be averaged out. Nevertheless, denoising the tilt series remains challenging due to the spatially correlated noise that occurs in bioimaging. Existing self-supervised methods relying on a single noisy image struggle with such noise, while the Noise2Noise framework necessitates paired noisy datasets for training. This study addresses these challenges by investigating practical imaging workflows in SXM and related bioimaging modalities to identify existing imaging resources as training data for tilt series denoising. We compare the denoising performance when applied to tilt series versus reconstructed tomograms and evaluate the efficacy of chosen methods on real biological specimens to assess their applicability within practical SXM research. Our findings establish a robust and efficient denoising strategy for SXM by directly addressing the complexities of noise in the raw tilt series.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

It is manufactured using a crow endoskeleton, supported and rearticulated by a geared mechanical metastructure to enable controllable passive deformation. The metastructures and bone braces are designed to affix the femur bone to the tibiotarsus, whilst still permitting kinematic movement between the tibiotarsus and the tarsometatarsus of the crow skeleton. The rearticulated hips function as a fulcrum between the upper and lower body parts, whilst concurrently enabling sagittal rotation of the crow skeleton about the hips. Static compression tests, finite element analyses, and in-situ tests conducted using Sundoli shows that the deformation behaviours of metastructures with and without supports are acutely sensitive to the angle of the tarsometatarsus relative to both the ground and the loading direction, highlighting the importance of designing the metastructure holistically and with consideration to the entire skeletal structure. At different loads and angles, the metastructures exhibit variable stiffnesses over their full deformational ranges, demonstrating their effectiveness in protecting the brittle biological bones. Using a metastructure as a mechanism for passive joint rearticulation enables Sundoli an ability to support a payload 8.7 times its body weight without lateral support (an 870\\% payload ratio) and 14 times its body weight with lateral support (a 1400\\% payload ratio).

While there are several potential reasons for this, previous data from our lab demonstrated that female ACL explants have an impaired remodeling response to loading, which may prevent the repair of fatigue damage and lead to increased ACL rupture. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanisms driving the impaired remodeling of female ACLs to cyclic loading, including the role of estrogen. ACLs were harvested from male and female New Zealand white rabbits and cyclically loaded in a tensile bioreactor followed by bulk RNA-sequencing. Additional ACL explants treated with or without estradiol were analyzed using RT-qPCR to determine the regulatory effect of estrogen on markers for tissue remodeling and inflammatory cytokines with cyclic loading. We found that female ACLs exhibited significantly fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to loading compared to male ACLs. Additionally, multiple mechanotransduction pathways were enriched with loading only in the male ACLs. While a few estrogen-related pathways were enriched in both male and female ACLs with loading, the expression of tissue remodeling markers was not different between estrogen treatment and vehicle control. Together, our findings highlight specific mechanotransduction pathways that may be responsible for the muted biological response of female ACLs to load, which provides a potential explanation for the increased rate of ACL tears in women.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In this study we aimed at validating ActTrust(R) against the widely used GT3X+ and comparing activity counts to metabolic equivalents (METs) derived from indirect calorimetry during treadmill walking and running. Fifty-six young adults (34 men, 22 women) participated in controlled effort exercises including light, moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous activity intensities. We developed a general linear model to estimate energy expenditure (EE) from movement count of combinations of GT3X+ and ActTrust devices placed at hip or wrist. We then estimated cut-off points for each intensity range. Our results showed correlations between treadmill speed, METs, and movement counts across all devices and placements combinations. Our proposed model performed well with balanced accuracies above 0.77 for all intensity ranges and over 0.9 for light and moderate activity.

Furthermore, increased phosphorylation near the CaMKII{delta}-B nuclear localization signal in non-responders prevented its auto-activation dependent nuclear translocation.

However, research comparing historical and modern vital rates is needed to identify demographic factors that may explain declines. Based on matrix models, adult female survival has the greatest effect on the intrinsic rate of growth. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in annual female survival may explain contemporary declines in populations if that vital rate has decreased concomitant with population declines. We searched peer-reviewed literature, student theses and dissertations, and government reports for empirical estimates of annual female survival across the range of wild turkeys. Of the 51 resulting estimates of annual female survival across all subspecies, most were [&ge;]0.6 through 2012, but 8 out of 10 estimates post-2012 were lower, consistent with observed trends in population trajectories. We used matrix models to illustrate that the observed change in annual female survival estimates indeed predicts a declining population trajectory, even when other important vital rates are at the high end of the published range of process variation. If the published annual female survival estimates represent those experienced more broadly in populations, our meta-analysis and matrix models indicate that decreases in this vital rate help explain declines observed in populations in some regions. The causative factor(s) associated with the apparent declines are unknown, and little research has evaluated management strategies to increase annual female survival. Accordingly, we encourage wild turkey researchers to focus efforts on producing robust estimates of annual female survival, cause-specific mortality, and rigorous evaluation of management strategies to improve annual female survival.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Humans reach for everyday objects such as pens and cups with stereotypically smooth, relaxed movements, explained in part by optimality. Maximizing accuracy can explain the smoothness and minimizing effort the relaxed timing. But these aspects combined do not optimize the whole, nor do they explain why people vary their timing depending on context, or reach smoothly even when accuracy is not demanded. These realities either challenge the notion of optimality or demand its redefinition. Here we propose that everyday reaching is predicted more generally by minimizing energy expenditure plus a weighted cost of time, adjustable for individual and context. A model of this Energy-Time objective simultaneously predicts human speed trajectories, durations, and peak speeds, without needing separate theories for each. The time valuation is identifiable from a single observation of one's time to reach a fixed distance, which then independently predicts how they reach any other distance. This single context-specific parameter can similarly predict reaches with low accuracy or speed demand unexplained by previous theories. The energy term is physiologically measurable and explains that smoothness and slowness are economical. The competing time cost explains how everyday movements can be modulated about an individualistic preference. Energy and time exert systematic influence on the speeds and durations of everyday movements.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Sixty-three participants performed an auditory distractor task while supra-threshold but task-irrelevant sounds were presented in the background. Whereas one group was aware of these stimuli, another group remained unaware. Comparing brain responses to the critical sounds between aware and unaware participants while controlling for correlates of sensory and postperceptual processing revealed that auditory awareness was associated with significantly increased activity in secondary auditory but not in fronto-parietal areas.

Currently available methods are capable of making detailed predictions about many areas, but human raters do not agree as well with these methods as they do with each other. Although highly accurate, human raters require substantial time and expertise that many researchers do not have. Additionally, human raters require functional data for drawing visual area boundaries that requires additional scan time, budget, and expertise to collect. Here, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) models to predict the boundaries and iso-eccentric regions of V1, V2, and V3 in both the Human Connectome Project dataset and the NYU Retinotopy dataset. CNNs trained to use the same functional data available to human raters predicted these boundaries with an accuracy similar to humans, while CNNs trained to use only anatomical data had a lower accuracy that was nonetheless higher than that of any currently available method. A comparison of the model accuracies when predicting eccentricity-based boundaries and polar angle-based boundaries suggests that eccentricity is substantially less closely tied to anatomical structure than polar angle and that the cortical magnification function, at least in terms of eccentricity, varies substantially between subjects. We further find that the fraction of V1, V2, and V3 that can be accurately parcellated into function regions using gray matter structural data alone is ~75% (~80% of the inter-rater reliability of human experts), implying a much tighter coupling between structure and function in these areas than previously estimated.

A priority in hemiparetic gait rehabilitation is the restoration of gait symmetry. While split belt treadmill training has shown promise in correcting spatial gait asymmetry, weight bearing and propulsion asymmetry remain resistant to improvement. As an alternative approach, we tested asymmetric surface stiffness walking to induce signatures of neuromotor adaptation relevant to correcting weight bearing and propulsion asymmetries in hemiparetic stroke. We hypothesized that a bout of asymmetric stiffness walking would elicit aftereffects in the form of asymmetries in weight bearing, propulsion, and plantar flexor activity. Twelve healthy young adults performed a 10-minute bout of asymmetric stiffness walking on an adjustable stiffness treadmill. We measured baseline and post-perturbation ground reaction forces (GRF) and spatio-temporal measures during 5-minute walking bouts on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill. After asymmetric surface stiffness walking, participants walked with increased vertical GRF and plantar flexor muscle excitations during push-off on the perturbed side relative to unperturbed. Participants also decreased their mid-stance vertical GRF and increased their peak braking GRF on the perturbed side relative to unperturbed. Counter to our hypothesis, they did not increase their propulsion GRF on the perturbed side. We conclude that asymmetric stiffness walking elicited a neuromotor adaptation towards a relative increase in push-off in the target limb, albeit primarily vertically aligned in our cohort of healthy young adults, and that gait adaptation to asymmetric stiffness walking should be investigated in individuals with push-off asymmetries.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The endocannabinoid system is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target for modulating neuroimmune environments, given its role in regulating synaptic plasticity, immune responses, and neuroinflammatory cascades. However, the extent to which cannabinoids influence HIV-associated neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on astrocyte growth characteristics, viability, and senescence-associated cytokine release following exposure to HIV Tat protein using primary mixed glial cultures derived from rhesus macaques. Real-time impedance-based cellular integrity assessments were conducted using the xCELLigence system, while morphological analyses and cytokine quantification were performed using phase-contrast microscopy and multiplex immunoassays. Treatment of macaques with THC protected the astrocytes from virus-induced senescence. Further, THC facilitated a rapid recovery from Tat-induced decline in astrocyte adhesion, suggesting a compensatory effect. THC promoted glial process elongation and morphological complexity, indicative of a shift toward a neuroprotective phenotype. Furthermore, THC significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion, including TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}, in an apparently dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that THC may modulate neuroinflammation in PLWH by promoting astrocytic survival, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhancing neurotrophic signaling. However, prolonged exposure to high-dose THC may negatively impact glial survival.

However, robust and interpretable biomarkers of the brain's current excitability state are lacking. Objective: We investigated whether entropy derived from singular value decomposition of short electroencephalography (EEG) segments could serve as a biomarker of cortical excitability as probed by TMS. Methods: Entropy was computed from 1-second EEG segments preceding single-pulse TMS applied over the motor cortex. We assessed whether spontaneous fluctuations in pre-pulse entropy predicted trial-by-trial variability in TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Additionally, we evaluated whether entropy tracked stimulation-induced changes in cortical excitability. Results: Higher pre-pulse entropy, particularly over frontal regions, was associated with larger MEP amplitudes. TMS locally increased entropy over the motor cortex, while entropy decreased in other regions during the intervention. Participants who showed greater local increases in entropy from pre- to post-intervention also demonstrated larger increases in corticospinal excitability.

In vitro studies have shown that the balance between primary and secondary bile acids strongly affects spore germination, growth, and cellular physiology of Clostridioides difficile, a major nosocomial gut pathogen. In vivo correlations between microbiome composition, bile acid metabolome, and colonization resistance have led to the hypothesis that 7-dehydroxylating bacteria such as Clostridium scindens protect against C. difficile infection by producing secondary bile acids like deoxycholic acid. However, due to the genetic intractability of known 7-dehydroxylating species, direct experimental validation of this causal relationship has been. In this study, we leveraged the first available 7-dehydroxylation-deficient baiH mutant to test the direct role of 7-dehydroxylated bile acid production in C. difficile colonization resistance in vivo. We colonized gnotobiotic mice with isogenic wild-type or baiH strains of the recently described 7-dehydroxylating species Faecalicatena contorta, including wild-type C. scindens- mice as a positive control. Wild-type F. contorta accumulated 7-dehydroxylated bile acids at levels equivalent to C. scindens, in a strictly baiH-dependent manner. However, despite equivalent bile acid profiles, wild-type F. contorta failed to replicate the C. difficile-restrictive phenotype observed with C. scindens. These findings demonstrate that commensal clostridial 7-dehydroxylation alone is not sufficient for enhancing colonization resistance to C. difficile.

Transposon insertions with negative phenotype were identified in genes encoding a triacylglycerol lipase, a lipase chaperone, type II secretion system components, HTH-type transcriptional activators, and a polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis repressor. To validate the involvement of these genetic elements in mcl-PHA degradation, we generated insertional mutants using a CRISPR-associated transposase system (CAST). Complete loss or reduced extracellular mcl-PHA depolymerase activity was observed in the CAST mutants, validating their involvement in mcl-PHA degradation. In addition, the interruption of these genetic elements showed a loss of lipase activity, suggesting that the enzymes responsible for mcl-PHA depolymerase are lipases with substrate ambiguity; moreover, docking experiments supported these findings. Together, we identify B. vietnamiensis as a source of enzymes capable of degrading extracellular mcl-PHA and demonstrate the power of combining activity-based screening, Tn-seq, and CAST to rapidly establish gene-to-function links.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The present study aimed to identify sponges and assess the biological activity of their extracts against human disease-causing organisms, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Morphological characterization and DNA barcoding of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene characterized three sponge species (Biemna fistulosa, Callyspongia diffusa and Haliclona fascigera). The Kirby-Bauer test assessed the antimicrobial activity of the extracts and the inhibition zone diameters (IZD) were measured. The extracts were further subjected to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests to determine the antibiotic susceptibility. The Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify and quantify the organic compounds in the sponges extracts. The methanolic extract of B. fistulosa (28.00 {+/-} 3.5 mm) and H. fascigera. (28.33 &{+/-} 3.8 mm) exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against E. coli surpassing the positive control (27.67 {+/-} 0.9 mm). The inhibitory activity of ethyl acetate extract of the C. diffusa (29.33 {+/-} 2.4 mm) against P. aeruginosa was observed to be higher compared to the standard antibiotic streptomycin (26.67 {+/-} 0.7 mm). The methanolic extract of H. fascigera demonstrated the lowest MIC (0.53 {+/-} 0.0 mg/ml) in compared to the streptomycin drug (1.36 {+/-} 0.0 mg/ml), and showed an MBC of 1.25 mg/ml against E. coli. The GC-MS chromatogram data analysis identified 114 distinct compounds categorized into 39 classes across three sponge extracts, with 11.4% of these compounds demonstrating documented antimicrobial activity against human pathogens. This study corroborates sponges as a promising source of bioactive compounds, which are valuable leads for drug discovery and development.

Yet, it faces significant threats from land-use changes, pollution, agricultural intensification, and climate change. Effective predictive modeling tools are urgently needed to inform conservation and management strategies. Although species distribution models (SDMs) have been successful for aboveground biodiversity, their application to soil biodiversity is limited by scarce large-scale datasets with spatial mismatches between environmental data and soil habitats. Recent advances, including environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, now allow extensive multi-taxa assessments of soil biodiversity. Simultaneously, remote sensing technologies provide high-resolution spatial data, potentially overcoming traditional coarse-gridded environmental limitations. This study evaluates Earth Observation Foundation (EOF) models, deep learning models pretrained on massive remote sensing datasets to summarize earth observation images into embeddings, to predict multi-trophic soil biodiversity in the French Alps. We compare models using EOF-derived embeddings from orthophotos with coarse-gridded and high-quality in-situ variables. We modeled relative abundance for 51 trophic groups across seven taxa using Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks, evaluating four data configurations: coarse-gridded environmental data, high-quality in-situ data, EOF embeddings, and a hybrid embedding-tabular approach. High-quality in-situ climate and soil data consistently delivered the highest predictive accuracy, especially for microbial and fungal groups. EOF embeddings provided valuable spatial context but did not surpass in-situ data performance, showing partial redundancy. Integrating remote sensing data can enhance biodiversity modeling in areas lacking detailed in-situ measurements, underscoring their complementary role in ecological assessments.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Lethal mutagenesis is a strategy to achieve viral extinction by drugging viral mutation rates beyond an extinction threshold. Accurate estimation of the extinction threshold is critical, as elevating viral mutation rates near, but not past this threshold increases the likelihood of mutations that could result in drug resistance, vaccine escape, or increased pathogenesis. Traditional models of lethal mutagenesis rely on the Poisson distribution, which assumes a uniform mutation rate across individuals. Yet, RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) can have varied mutation rates due to mutations in the polymerase complex. This variability suggests that lethal mutagenesis models incorporating mutation rate diversity, such as ones using the gamma-Poisson distribution, may be more accurate for RNA viruses. Poisson models assume count data have equal mean and variance, while gamma-Poisson counts are overdispersed (variance greater than mean). Here we provide experimental data showing that IAV mutations are overdispersed, indicating that the gamma-Poisson distribution is more appropriate for modeling IAV mutations. Modeling of lethal mutagenesis using the gamma-Poisson distribution reveals that the degree of overdispersion is critical in determining survival or extinction. Increased overdispersion shifts the extinction threshold higher, indicating that Poisson-based models have underestimated the mutation rate required to achieve viral extinction and avoid viral escape or accelerated evolution. Furthermore, time to extinction in simulated populations is significantly longer with gamma-Poisson-based models than Poisson-based. This investigation of how mutation rate variability affects lethal mutagenesis will directly impact antiviral drug design and strategy, thus advancing efforts to combat virus outbreaks and future pandemics.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Measures of maximal joint mobility provide insight into articular function and its limits on potential joint motion and thereby behaviour. In extinct vertebrates the reconstruction of joint mobility permits us to decipher shifts in locomotor evolution. Such measurements are generally limited to studies of osteological joint mobility. However, only a subset of osteologically feasible poses are biologically feasible because true joint mobility is limited by soft tissues, such as ligaments, that seldomly preserve in the fossil record. To address this issue, we implemented an in silico model to simulate avian glenohumeral (shoulder) movement and the constraints imposed by six ligaments on its joint mobility. We evaluated our in silico model of the partridge shoulder joint with measured ex vivo shoulder mobility using X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM). Our results indicate that modelling ligamentous constraints is integral to accurately quantifying shoulder function due to the role of ligaments in maintaining articular contact during complex glenohumeral motion. Our approach enables more confident estimates of functional joint mobility in both extant and extinct vertebrates and thereby stands to improve inferences of behaviour and musculoskeletal function in the vertebrate fossil record.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

P.; Akhunov, E.; Johnson, B. E.; Clinesmith, M.; Fritz, A. K.", "abstract": "Additive gene action is assumed to underly quantitative traits, but the eventual poor performance of elite wheat lines as parents suggests that epistasis could be the underlying genetic architecture. Sign epistasis is characterized by alleles having either a beneficial or detrimental effect depending on the genetic background, which can result in elite lines that fail as parents in certain parental combinations. Hence, the objective of this study were to test the existence of sign epistasis and examine its consequences to wheat breeding. The presence of sign epistasis is expected to distort the allele frequency distribution between two interacting genes compared to neutral sites, creating strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). To test this hypothesis, analysis of interchromosomal LD in breeding families was performed and detected 19 regions in strong disequilibrium, whose allele frequency distribution matched the sign epistasis prediction and falsified the competing hypothesis of additive selection. To validate these candidate interactions while avoiding the biases of a circular analysis and the confounding effects of genetic drift, two independent sets of populations were analyzed. Genetic drift was attributed to creating the sign epistasis patterns observed in eleven interactions, but there was not sufficient evidence to reject the sign epistasis hypothesis in eight interactions. Sign epistasis may explain the poor performance of elite lines as parents, as crossing lines with complementary allelic combination re-establishes epistatic variance in the offspring. Reduction in the effective population size in certain crosses may also occur when unfavorable sign epistatic combinations are deleterious. The potential existence of di-genic and higher order epistatic interactions in elite germplasm can tremendously impact breeding strategies as managing epistasis becomes imperative for success.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Recently human patient genome sequencing has defined unique patient variants that result in disease states with different phenotypes than those observed with null alleles.

We have optimized a zebrafish gene editing platform to successfully generate 11 patient variants (first round: NF1 R1276Q, NF1 G484R, VMA21 G55V, SPOP D144N, SGO1 K23E, Pex10 H310D, and FKRP C318Y; second round: NF1 R681*, NF1 M992del, P53 R175H, and PKD2 L656W) and 1 research allele (p53 K120R). We used CRISPR/Cas9 guide directed cleavage along with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODNs) repair templates to generate these models. We evaluated multiple oligo orientations and sizes, but did not find a unified consensus orientation or size that significantly impacted efficiency, emphasizing the need to empirically evaluate multiple variations for the best homology directed repair (HDR) rate. We determined PCR amplicon Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluation of HDR efficiency at the F0 embryo level is best for determining the ideal guide and oligo combination. Further NGS evaluation of DNA from progeny from F0s (germline derived), not F0 biopsy DNA, is essential to identify germline transmitting founders. Surprisingly we find that most founders exhibit a jackpot effect in the germ line but not in the somatic tissue. We found NGS superior to using ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits) for determining HDR frequency. When applicable, allelic-specific PCR or allelic specific restriction digestion can be used to genotype mutation carrying F1 generation animals, however we demonstrated that false positives occur.

Using whole-genome sequencing, chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Xenium), we defined how major driver mutations influence spatial tumor organization. We found that IDH-mutant gliomas frequently harbored inflammatory microglia expressing CX3CR1 specifically within their astrocyte-like malignant neighborhoods. In contrast, glioblastomas demonstrated relatively higher T-cell infiltration and enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations. We further compared glioblastomas harboring EGFR amplifications due to extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications versus linear chromosomal 7 gains. Tumors with EGFR ecDNA displayed increased presence of mesenchymal-like malignant cells, and higher interactions between pericytes and mesenchymal-like malignant cells, likely driven by hypoxia-associated vascular proliferation. Our findings reveal that the mode of oncogene amplification (linear versus ecDNA) shapes distinct tumor architectures and transcriptional dynamics.

H.", "abstract": "In temporal interference (TI) electrical brain stimulation (EBS), an emerging neuromodulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard EBS. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the directions in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI EBS. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum and provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, this is the first published closed-form expressions for these specific orientations in the context of TI stimulation. We mathematically derive these compact formulas and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytic direction formula of maximum modulation depth is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression offers a faster and more precise alternative to numerical iterative optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used (Grossman et al., 2017) formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength than the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions to fine tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Overall, this work represents a detailed treatment of TI electrical fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

By analyzing early (superficial) and late (deeper) photon arrival times, we identified a significant drop in CBF shortly after injury, with a partial recovery observed at 2 hours post-trauma. Power spectral analysis of the blood flow index revealed significant alterations in LFO bands, particularly in slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) and slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz) ranges, with p < 0.05 at both early and late gates. These changes were more pronounced than BFI alterations alone, indicating that LFOs may serve as sensitive biomarkers of neurovascular disruption.

Their carbon lattice structure, denoted by chiral (n,m) indices, determines the wavelength of their near infrared fluorescence emission. Commercially available SWCNT are polydisperse, containing many (n,m) species with overlapping fluorescence peaks, leading to spectral congestion. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) has emerged as a valuable tool to sort SWCNT according to their chiral structure and promises improved nanosensor performance as well as unique opportunities for multiplexing. Previous applications of ATPE have enabled ratiometric sensors, but simultaneous detection of multiple analytes using distinct SWCNT chiralities has yet to be realized. This hurdle is largely due to the contrasting surface chemistries needed for ATPE sorting and those needed for biosensing applications. In this work, we introduce a method for purifying multiple chiralities of SWCNT which can be functionalized with molecularly specific antibodies to create a multiplexed sensor platform. We utilize aminated DNA (DNA-NH2), which serves as both a conduit for ATPE sorting and an intermediate linker for later antibody conjugation, to realize this goal. We demonstrate that chemically modified DNA enables ATPE sorting, supporting the broad future utility of the technique. We further show that chirality-sorted SWCNT-DNA-NH2 serve as excellent base constructs for antibody conjugation, forming highly specific sensors with enhanced optical properties (compared to unsorted SWCNT sensors). Importantly, one batch of monochiral base constructs can be functionalized with different antibodies towards different biological applications. Finally, we show that we can sort and functionalize two separate SWCNT chiralities and combine them together to create a multiplexed sensor platform where each peak responds distinctly to its target. There are vast opportunities for expansion of this work through the use of alternative DNA sequences to enable sorting, various SWCNT chiralities, and virtually any commercially available antibody for molecular recognition.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Although actin dynamics is well known to contribute to pathfinding in wide axonal tips, typically referred to as growth cones, we also observe dynamic actin remodeling throughout neurites and at other, narrower, neurite tips. We find that actin-wave speeds do not change significantly in the first two weeks of neurite development on flat substrates, but decrease over the same period in neurites on nanoridges. The ability of nanoridges to guide actin waves and the neurite-tip direction also decreases as neurites mature, both for narrow tips and wide growth cones.

In this study, we present a statistical mechanics-based framework that explains how such disparities naturally emerge from biologically plausible rules of interaction and regulation. By modeling proteins as elements whose activity levels and outputs evolve through mutual comparison and feedback, we demonstrate that power-law distributions can arise without assuming any intrinsic heterogeneity. The model also captures a recursive feature of disparity: even among highly active proteins, a new skewed distribution reappears when a subpopulation is isolated, reflecting the scale-invariant structure commonly observed in complex adaptive systems. We analytically derive these patterns under both positive and negative feedback scenarios and identify key conditions under which long-term functional dominance is established.

Postmortem, receptor autoradiography was performed to determine levels of AT1R in 13 brain regions in untreated and treated Tg-SwDI mice compared to wild-type controls (C57Bl/6J). Results: No statistically significant differences among groups were observed in any of the 13 regions analyzed. However, trends with medium to large effect sizes were observed.

Among the most significant is the emergence of a more complex brain, exemplified by the dramatic transformation of the dorsal cortex from a single layer of excitatory projection neurons (ExNs) in ancestors to a multilayered cerebral neocortex enriched with diverse intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) ExN subtypes. These ExNs established specialized projection systems, such as the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum, enhancing brain connectivity and functionality. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these mammalian-specific adaptations remain elusive. By comparing the landscape of gene expression and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in mouse ExN subtypes and by cross-species examination of mammalian and non-mammalian CREs, we identified mammalian-specific CREs and expression patterns. The mammalian-specific CREs include a subset bound by ZBTB18 that are associated with genes defining IT and ET subtypes and connectivity. Both ZBTB18 and these target genes have previously been implicated in intellectual disability and autism. Deletion of Zbtb18 in mouse ExNs dysregulated target gene expression, reduced molecular diversity, diminished corticospinal and callosal projections, and increased intrahemispheric cortico-cortical association projections to the prefrontal cortex, resembling features of non-mammalian dorsal pallium. Interestingly, ZBTB18 binding motifs are highly enriched in callosally projecting IT-biased CREs, where they show higher conservation specifically in mammals.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive morphological and transcriptomic comparison of S. japonicum derived from mouse and rat hosts at multiple time points post-infection, identifying the period between 12 and 24 days post-infection (dpi) as a critical window for developmental arrest in parasites from rats. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed a high-resolution cellular atlas of S. japonicum at 14 and 24 dpi from both host species, revealing host-dependent alterations in cell composition and transcriptional programs during parasite development. Functional analyses further demonstrated that impairments in mitochondrial function and anaerobic glycolysis contribute to the developmental arrest observed in parasites from rats. Additionally, downregulation of ribosomal genes was associated with reduced protein synthesis and impaired cell proliferation. Together, these findings suggest that disruptions in energy metabolism and ribosomal function are key drivers of developmental arrest in non-permissive hosts. This study provides novel, parasite-centered insights into host permissiveness and identifies potential molecular targets for schistosomiasis control strategies.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In mammalian cerebellum, three types of astroglial cells -Bergmann glial cells (BGs), inner granule cell layer (IGL) astrocytes, and white matter (WM) astrocytes- arise in postnatal timing from two types of progenitors: Bergmann glia-like progenitors (BGLPs) and astrocyte-like progenitors (AsLPs). While BGLPs are known to differentiate into BGs and IGL astrocytes in postnatal day 6 (P6) mice, their fate immediately after birth remains unclear due to technical challenges in specifically labeling BGLPs. In this study, we demonstrated that both BGLPs and AsLPs gradually decrease from P0 to P10. Using in vivo electroporation to label BGLPs, we found that BGLPs in P0 mice differentiate not only into BGs, IGL astrocytes but also WM astrocytes. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis (Xenium, 5k),we achieved the isolation and comparative profiling of BGLP clusters from P0 and P6 mice. This analysis revealed that P0 BGLPs exhibit more stem cell-like features, while P6 BGLPs show a shift toward BG-like characteristics. These findings indicate that BGLPs immediately after birth possess higher pluripotency than previously recognized.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Pruyne, D.", "abstract": "Background: Actin filament organization in cardiomyocytes critically depends on the formin Fhod3, but no role has been previously described for Fhod3 in skeletal muscle development. Results: We demonstrate here that in zebrafish mutated for one of two fhod3 paralog genes, fhod3a, skeletal muscle of the trunk appears normal through 2 days post-fertilization, but afterward exhibits myofibril damage, including gaps between myofibrils and myofibril fragmentation. Although myofibril damage appears progressive, fhod3a mutant embryos differ from muscular dystrophy models in that damage is not activity-dependent, but is exacerbated by inhibition of muscle activity. Moreover, fhod3a mutants show no evidence of sarcolemma disruption. Rather, our results suggest myofibril damage coincides with growth of the skeletal muscle fiber contractile apparatus. Neither the second paralog, fhod3b, nor the more distantly related fhod1 appear to contribute to embryonic skeletal muscle development, but simultaneous mutation of fhod3a and fhod3b was associated with pericardial edema suggestive of cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate a fhod3 homolog is dispensable for initial myofibril assembly in skeletal muscle, but promotes myofibril stability during muscle fiber growth. This is the first demonstration that Fhod3 contributes to skeletal muscle development in a vertebrate.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

How this GRN mechanistically guides neural competence remains poorly understood. In this study, we present integrated transcriptional, genetic, and genomic analyses to uncover the regulatory mechanisms of SOX2, a key factor in establishing neural identity in RPCs. We show that SOX2 is preferentially enriched in the RPC-specific enhancer landscape associated with essential regulators of retinogenesis. Disruption of SOX2 expression impairs retinogenesis, marked by a selective loss of enhancer activity near genes essential for RPC proliferation and lineage specification. We identified the RPC transcription factor VSX2 as a binding partner for SOX2, and together, SOX2 and VSX2 co-target a core, retina-specific chromatin repertoire characterized by enhanced TF binding and robust chromatin accessibility. This cooperative binding establishes a shared SOX2-VSX2 transcriptional code that promotes the expression of critical regulators of neurogenesis while repressing the acquisition of alternative lineage cell fate. Our data illuminate fundamental biological insights on how transcription factors act in concert to drive chromatin-based genetic programs underlying retinal neural identity.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In the germline, its precise regulation is critical to ensure both the elimination of aberrant cells and the maintenance of reproductive capacity. However, the molecular mechanisms that control apoptotic susceptibility in germline cells remain poorly defined. Here, we identify stand still (stil) as a female germline-specific regulator of apoptosis in Drosophila. Loss of stil leads to near-complete depletion of germline cells at the time of eclosion, associated with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene reaper (rpr) and activation of caspase-dependent cell death. Reporter assays in S2 cells show that Stil directly represses rpr transcription through its N-terminal BED-type zinc finger domain. Despite the absence of stil, undifferentiated germline cells remain resistant to apoptosis. Analysis of publicly available chromatin data reveals that the rpr locus in these cells resides in a closed, H3K9me3-enriched chromatin state, suggesting a Stil-independent mode of transcriptional silencing. Together, our findings uncover a dual mechanism that protects the female germline from rpr-dependent apoptosis: active repression by Stil in differentiating cells and chromatin-mediated silencing in undifferentiated cells. This work provides new insights into the transcriptional and chromatin-based mechanisms that maintain germline cell identity and survival.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Here, leveraging infrared light-mediated temporospatial-resolution lineage-tracing technology, we demonstrate that in zebrafish, HSCs do not originate from the DA. Instead, following the DA hematopoiesis, which produces hematopoietic precursors with limited renewal potential, lifelong renewable HSCs emerge from the supra-intestinal artery (SIA). Remarkably, while the DA produces hematopoietic cells from unipotent HECs, the SIA generates hematopoietic cells from both unipotent HECs and bipotent vessel-resident hemangioblasts (VRHs). These VRHs undergo multiple rounds of division and budding, generating both hematopoietic cells and SIA-resident endothelial cells. The distinct characteristics of DA and SIA cells are further reinforced by single-cell transcriptomic profiling.

Cognitive outcomes were assessed via Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Barnes Maze (BM) tests prior to surgery, and during sub-acute (1-2 weeks) and chronic (8 weeks) phases post-stroke.

In interaction with environmental conditions and competitive pressure, pollinators cognition shapes their movement patterns, which in turn determine pollen transfers. However, models of animal-mediated pollination often make simplifying assumptions about pollinator movements, notably by not incorporating learning and memory. Better considering cognition as a driver of pollinators movements may thus provide a powerful mechanistic understanding of pollen dispersal. In this exploratory study, we connect pollinator behaviour and plant reproduction by using an agent-based model of bee movements implementing reinforcement learning. Simulations of two bees foraging together in environments containing twenty flowers shows how learning can improve foraging efficiency as well as plant pollination quality through larger mating distances and smaller self-pollination rates, while creating spatially heterogeneous pollen flows. This suggests that pollinators informed foraging decisions contribute to genetic differentiation between plant subpopulations. We believe this theoretical exploration will pave the way for a more systematic analysis of animal-mediated plant mating patterns, as model predictions can be tested experimentally in real bee-plant systems.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Understanding collective animal behaviors, such as schooling in fish, presents significant observational challenges due to rapid and complex interactions. To address these difficulties, we developed an innovative closedloop VR environment allowing precise control and measurement of interactions between real and virtual fish. This setup incorporates high-speed 3D tracking, real-time visual feedback, and automated data processing, creating realistic and interactive scenarios.We present experimental results, obtained with Rummy-nose tetras (Hemigrammus rhodostomus), showing that freely moving real fish consistently adjusted their speed, depth, and spatial positioning to follow virtual fish effectively. Fish matched moderate virtual speeds comfortably, struggled slightly at higher speeds, and actively maintained vertical positioning to sustain group cohesion. Fish also displayed significant environmental awareness, adjusting their proximity to the tank walls while maintaining visual contact with virtual fish. The implementation of this VR system provides critical insights into sensory and cognitive processes underlying collective movement and decision-making in fish. By revealing both flexibility and constraints in fish behavior, our findings underscore the potential of VR technology to study social interactions in controlled yet realistic settings. Ultimately, this VR system advances our understanding of collective animal behaviors and lays a foundation for future studies across different species, enhancing insights into the neural and behavioral mechanisms of group dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Differences in habitat selection between geographical areas may imply behavioral adaptations to local environmental conditions. Understanding the potential of adaptation of species along broad geographical ranges is of primary interest to anticipate potential changes in species behavior or distribution range in the context of climate changes. In this study, we investigated the habitat selection and the daily movement patterns of the Eurasian Woodcock, Scolopax rusticola, a bird species that winters across widely varying climatic zones. We tracked 89 individuals wintering in the Mediterranean regions with GPS-VHF transmitters, where climate and habitats conditions differ significantly from the oceanic regions. To assess how they responded to varying habitat and environmental conditions, we collected data across four geographical regions spanning a gradient of Mediterranean climatic influence -- ranging from northern subareas with denser forest and deeper soil to southern subareas characterized by less productive forests, garrigues, and rocky soil. In wetter regions, woodcocks generally commuted between diurnal resting in forested areas and nocturnal feeding in open habitats, though less frequently than described in studies from other climatic regions. Under drier conditions, they often remained within forest habitats, displaying higher daytime activity and reduced nocturnal movement. Across all subareas, denser forests were selected during the day. The selection for nocturnal forest microhabitats varied by subarea, e.g., denser low vegetation was more strongly selected in southern subareas, while forest habitats highly covered by forest herbs were mostly avoided in northern subareas. Our findings underscore the remarkable behavioral flexibility of woodcocks, highlighting their potential to adapt to global change. However, the occurrence of escape movements under the driest conditions suggest that this change in behavior and habitat selection may be an early warning sign of the effects of climate change on the wintering areas.

P.", "abstract": "Termites of the species Odontotermes obesus are found widely across the Indian peninsula. Their presence is visible due to the large over-ground mounds that they build across the landscape. These mounds house their entire colony, including major and minor workers, soldiers, the queen and king, and their brood. In addition, the termites also farm a specific variety of fungus within the mounds, which helps them break down the cellulose-rich food. The precise function of the mound architecture is the subject of some debate, and it has been argued that its structure serves physiological functions including thermoregulation or gas exchange for the entire colony. We hypothesized that if the mound structure indeed serves an important function, termites must be able to sense and repair any injury to their mound structure. To test this hypothesis, we created a hole in the mound wall and observed the dynamics of ensuing breach repair. The breach is quickly detected and repaired by the termites along a consistently sigmodial pattern involving the exponential recruitment of termites during the initial phases of repair, and a derecruitment of termites in the final phases. This behavior provides us with an assay to investigate various phenomena pertaining to mound-building, and to examine the sensory cues involved in detection and repair of the mound. From the basic considerations about the stimuli involved, we developed a logistic model to describe breach repair behavior, highlighting the critical role of a systemic cue in initiating this response. Through a series of experiments utilizing various behavioral assays, we identified the presence of light as this systemic cue that triggers mound repair. When light enters the mound, it triggers construction activity in termites, even though the major and minor workers responsible for repairs do not have image-forming eyes. This suggests that termites detect light through an extraocular mechanism", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We developed a novel rat model of perinatal fentanyl exposure to characterize NOWS symptoms and investigate enduring behavioral and molecular outcomes. Offspring born to fentanyl-exposed dams exhibited reduced survival, lower body weight, spontaneous withdrawal symptoms, and mechanical hypersensitivity. In adolescence, these rats displayed negative affect, while in adulthood, they showed increased fentanyl self-administration, heightened drug-seeking during reinstatement, and elevated corticosterone levels during withdrawal. To explore the molecular underpinnings of these physiological and behavioral outcomes, we conducted RNA-seq in the central amygdala of adult rats, revealing dysregulated pathways related to GPCR signaling, adaptive immune response and neurodevelopmental processes. These transcriptional changes provide insights into the mechanisms driving addiction vulnerability and stress-related behaviors following early fentanyl exposure.

Chronic NOX2 activity sustains oxidative stress/damage and drives neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). NOX2 acts as a priming signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which also plays a role in secondary injury after TBI. GSK2795039 is a small molecule brain penetrable drug that inhibits NOX2 in a NADPH competitive manner. Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 using GSK2795039 can reduce secondary neuroinflammation after TBI, specifically via inhibition of downstream NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in both resident microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells in the injured brain. Methods: Immortalised microglial (IMG) cells or primary microglia were pre-treated with GSK2795039 (NOX2 inhibitor) or MCC950 (NLRP3 inhibitor) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin to induce NOX2/ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The controlled cortical impact model, pharmacokinetic analyses, multi-dimensional flow cytometry, histology and neurobehavioral assessments were used to translate in vitro findings to an experimental TBI model in adult male C57BL6/J mice. Results: The small molecule NOX2 inhibitor, GSK2795039, attenuated microglial NOX2 activity, thereby reducing ROS, nitrite and cytokine levels, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome components in pro-inflammatory microglia. TBI recruited NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta}+ neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes into injured brain parenchyma with peak monocytic NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta} production at 3 days post-injury (DPI), coincident with peak NOX2/ROS/IL-1{beta} expression in microglia. Systemic administration of GSK2795039 (100mg/kg; I.P.) starting 2 hours post-injury attenuated NOX2/IL-1{beta}+ microglial and infiltrating myeloid cell activation at 3 DPI. In addition, NOX2 inhibition reduced numbers of IL-1R+ T cells in the brain of TBI mice, indicating that myeloid-T cell crosstalk was altered by GSK2795039 treatment. Innate and adaptive neuroimmune changes were associated with improvements in motor function post-TBI. In the chronic phase through 28 DPI, pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 by GSK2795039 treatment resulted in modest improvements in neurobehavioral deficits and TBI neuropathology. Conclusions: These preclinical studies identify the NOX2-ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome axis along with myeloid-T cell crosstalk as effective targets for TBI neuroinflammation. Our translational studies indicate that NOX2 may be a promising therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in microglia, and peripheral immune cells, following experimental TBI in mice.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined whether these measures dissociate different perceptual states during an auditory attention task. Participants (Main and Control experiments; N = 34 and 27, both sexes) listened to tone sequences designated as 'Target', 'Distractor', and 'Probe', designed to isolate active attention from suppression of irrelevant input. We focused on four physiological signals: pupil diameter (PD), pupil dilation rate (PDR), blink rate, and microsaccades (MS). Compared to a control condition, both Target and Probe intervals elicited sustained PD increases, blink suppression, and prolonged MS inhibition indicating extended attentional engagement. Interestingly, the Distractor interval also showed prolonged blink suppression and elevated PDR, suggesting active arousal to suppress irrelevant input. However, MS dynamics during Distractors were indistinguishable from control, implying that attention was not allocated to the distractors despite the heightened arousal. This dissociation supports the interpretation that MS is specifically modulated by attentional allocation, while PD and blinks also reflect general arousal or suppressive mechanisms. Overall, these findings reveal that PD, MS, and blinking capture distinct aspects of cognitive control. Together, they offer a multidimensional framework for studying selective attention and distractor suppression in complex tasks.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

This study employs a multimodal neuroimaging approach, integrating quantitative multi-parameter mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI, to investigate the neural correlates of dream recall frequency (DRF) in a large cohort of 258 healthy individuals. By employing Linked Independent Component Analysis (LICA), we were able to discern distinctive patterns of brain structure and function that correlated with variations in DRF. Our findings elucidate a complex relationship between dream recall and brain microstructure integrity, particularly in white matter regions of the orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and occipital cortex. Higher DRF was related to increased white matter microstructure integrity in these regions and decreased gray matter volume in occipital and temporal areas. In terms of functional measures, higher DRF was associated with reduced connectivity across a range of resting-state networks, including the default mode, visual, and dorsal attention networks. This was particularly evident in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that enhanced dream recall may be related to the organization of higher-order visual and cognitive processing areas, supporting a top-down model of dreaming.

However, neural differences potentially contributing to these alterations are often small, and conflicting evidence obscures the directionality and underlying mechanisms of these alterations. Like many psychiatric conditions, OCD follows a fluctuating symptom trajectory, with symptoms shifting dramatically over months, either naturally or due to treatment. Yet, the absence of longitudinal neuroimaging studies limits our understanding of the neural mechanisms driving these changes. Here, we used precision functional mapping in highly sampled individuals with OCD, uncovering a striking imbalance within frontostriatal networks. We identified a twofold expansion of the salience network in these individuals and a concomitant contraction of the frontoparietal network. Notably, salience network expansion was driven by border shifts, encroaching on adjacent executive networks and leading to their contraction. This imbalance within frontostriatal networks may relate to excessive attention to internal stimuli and lack of goal-directed control, which are classically observed in OCD. Longitudinal analyses of neuroimaging data collected over several months revealed frontostriatal connectivity changes tracking symptom severity. Overall, these findings pinpoint network-level features that may confer risk for individuals with OCD and highlight dynamic connectivity shifts tied to severity of OCD symptoms over time.

Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with aging. We engineered bioorthogonal tools which allowed us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and study its turnover with aging, its propensity to aggregate, and its interaction with microglia. We discovered neuronal proteins degraded on average twice as slowly between 4- and 24-month-old mice with individual protein stability differing between brain regions. Further, we describe the aged neuronal 'aggregome' encompassing 574 proteins, nearly 30% of which showed reduced degradation. The aggregome includes well-known proteins linked to disease as well as a trove of proteins previously not associated with neurodegeneration. Unexpectedly, we found 274 neuronal proteins accumulated in microglia with 65% also displaying reduced degradation and/or aggregation with age. Among these proteins, synaptic proteins were highly enriched, suggesting a cascade of events emanating from impaired synaptic protein turnover and aggregation to the disposal of these proteins, possibly by the engulfment of synapses by microglia. These findings reveal the dramatic loss of neuronal proteome maintenance with aging which could be causal for age-related synapse loss and cognitive decline.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

They emerge through a transition in decision-making strategy, from flexible adaptation to current demands (goal-directed behavior) to automatic repeats of previous behaviors (habitual behavior). This transition of decision-making strategy induces changes in an underlying cognitive process for selecting an action while superficially maintaining the execution of the selected action. However, the neurocircuit mechanisms supporting these changes remain unexplored. By developing a behavioral paradigm capable of inducing this transition within a defined time window, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the neuronal circuits involved in this process using ex vivo electrophysiology, optogenetic erasure of synaptic plasticity and in vivo Ca2+-imaging. We found that the decision-making strategy and action execution are orthogonally controlled by plasticity in distinct cortical pathways. Erasure of these changes independently alter the decision-making strategy or the action execution without influencing each other, supporting a dichotomous circuit mechanism. This study underscores the critical role of pathway-specific cortical plasticity in regulating the multifaceted process shaping habitual behavior, offering valuable insights into the pathological mechanisms of maladaptive habits, such as compulsive disorders.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate a network mechanism for flexibly adjusting the sensitivity of ongoing motor execution to external inputs in different sensorimotor contexts. We trained mice to make sequences of licks directed at a moving target. In a random subset of trials, they made \"backtracking\" licks by abruptly switching motor programs based on tactile feedback. We divided sessions into alternating cued blocks of trials; sensory-driven backtracking was required during one block-type, but not in the other. Targeted optogenetic stimulation of tongue/jaw somatosensory cortical inputs to the tongue premotor (anterolateral motor, or ALM) cortex that were precisely timed to arrive near the motor switching point reliably induced licking movements resembling those in backtracking trials. This effect was more readily induced during blocks with sensory-driven backtracking, and was also accompanied by larger optically-evoked deviations in neural activity. Population activity patterns could be separated along a latent axis that discriminated between block-types. On single trials, the location of population activity along this axis correlated with the impact of optogenetic stimulation and influenced the speed of sensory-driven motor switching. Our findings provide causal evidence for how external inputs are integrated with internal context signals to achieve flexible motor control.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

M.; Halassa, M.; Palva, S.", "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is the fundamental ability to rapidly adapt behavior to the environment, even when the contextual rules are implicit and change suddenly. Such type of task switching is commonly measured with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), in which cards need to be sorted by a changing rule that is not explicit to participants and thus needs to be deduced from feedback. Crucially, this ability to adapt to changing task rules in the absence of instructive cues shows large individual variability of which neural mechanisms have remained unknown. Preparative un-cued task switching has previously been connected to prefrontal theta and parietal alpha band amplitude modulations. However, it has remained unknown whether these local oscillation dynamics or large-scale network interactions would enable cognitive flexibility and explain the interindividual performance differences therein. Here, to test this possibility, we collected MEG data during the WCST from N = 26 participants. To assess individual variability in cognitive flexibility, we calculated the number of late errors as a proxy for learning speed and implemented a new sequential learning model for estimating the impact of feedback sensitivity on individual performance. To investigate the neural dynamics, we computed local and network oscillation dynamics from individually source-reconstructed data. Higher switching accuracy was predicted by local gamma (52-96 Hz) band amplitude increases and parietal alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-32 Hz) band suppression as well as sustained frontoparietal alpha band (9-15 Hz) network desynchronization. Individuals with higher sensitivity to positive feedback showed larger alpha- and beta-band amplitude modulations and alpha network desynchronization, whereas sensitivity to negative feedback was mainly associated with larger gamma amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that individual variability in un-cued task switching is due to differential learning speed and sensitivity to feedback, the neural basis of which relies on distinct local and large-scale oscillatory network mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Under MA, participants showed improved sustained attention task performance as well as functional connectivity signatures of higher sustained attention and arousal. These network changes emerged consistently across resting-state and task-based fMRI, indicating that MA influences attention- and arousal-related networks regardless of cognitive context. Furthermore, a support vector classifier distinguished functional connectivity patterns observed during the MA and placebo conditions, identifying connections overlapping with networks related to arousal. Together, these findings align with prior work on other psychostimulants like methylphenidate, showing that MA modulates sustained attention and related large-scale brain networks.

While acute stress activates adaptive neuroendocrine and behavioral mechanisms, chronic stress leads to desensitization of these responses, disrupting hormone secretion, neuronal activity, and behavior. Chronic stress is a well-established risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, many of which show distinct prevalence and presentation patterns between sexes. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex-dependent effects remain poorly understood. This study investigated how acute and chronic stress differentially affect neural activation patterns in male and female mice, with the hypothesis that sex-specific adaptations to chronic stress underlie divergent vulnerabilities to neuropsychiatric disorders. We employed three experimental groups: a control group (no stress), an acute stress group (one hour of restraint stress), and a chronic stress group (one hour of restraint stress daily for ten days). Neural activity was assessed by quantifying c-Fos-positive cells using immunohistochemistry. Acute stress induced widespread neural activation in both sexes, with notable sex differences in c-Fos expression in regions of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain. Chronic stress led to the desensitization of neuronal activity in most of these regions. Notably, chronically stressed females exhibited more desensitization in specific hypothalamic and amygdaloid regions compared to males. Despite this, corticosterone release remained elevated in stressed females, indicating a decoupling of hormonal and neural responses. These findings suggest that chronic stress elicits distinct neural adaptations in males and females, potentially contributing to the sex-specific vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding these mechanisms may inform targeted interventions for stress-related pathologies.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

These macrostructural changes are parallel with developmental changes in brain neurochemistry, probed in the human brain using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). This includes neurotransmitters such glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as building blocks of neuronal and associated tissue such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and those involved in metabolism such as creatine (Cr). While previous research has linked MRS-measured neuro-metabolite levels to bulk tissue composition (e.g., gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), the relationship between neurochemistry and more granular macrostructural metrics, such as cortical thickness, area, volume, and local gyrification, remains unexplored. This study investigates the association between MRS-measured neuro-metabolite levels in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and PPC-voxel cortical macrostructural metrics in a developmental cohort of 86 individuals aged 5-35 years. We also examine whether PPC metabolite concentrations associate with whole-brain structural metrics to determine whether associations are region-specific or more broadly generalisable. Our findings reveal significant positive associations between PPC cortical thickness, volume, local gyrification index (LGI) and Glx (glutamate + glutamine) levels, likely because differences in cortical microstructure, including dendritic arbour complexity, contributes to variation in both cortical macrostructure and Glx activity across development. Additionally, PPC Glx:GABA+ ratio negatively associated with subcortical gray matter volume, while PPC total NAA positively associated with cerebral white matter volume, suggesting a link between regional neurochemistry and broader brain structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for macrostructural and broader brain structural characteristics when interpreting the neuroanatomical correlates of MRS-measured metabolites, beyond controlling for bulk tissue composition.

Historically, filopodial dynamics have been studied in great detail in 2D in cultured cells, and more recently in 3D culture as well as living brains. However, there is a lack of efficient tools to trace and track filopodia in 4D images of complex brain cells. Results: To address this issue, we have developed a semi-automatic workflow for tracing filopodia in 3D images and tracking the traced filopodia over time. The workflow was developed based on high-resolution data of photoreceptor axon terminals in the in vivo context of normal Drosophila brain development, but devised to be applicable to filopodia in any system, including at different temporal and spatial scales. In contrast to the pre-existing methods, our workflow relies solely on the original intensity images without the requirement for segmentation or complex preprocessing. The workflow was realized in C++ within the Amira software system and consists of two main parts, dataset pre-processing, and geometrical filopodia reconstruction, where each of the two parts comprises multiple steps. In this paper, we provide an extensive workflow description and demonstrate its versatility for two different axo-dendritic morphologies, R7 and Dm8 cells. Finally, we provide an analysis of the time requirements for user input and data processing.

Single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Intracranial Electrical Stimulation (IES) are widely used to probe cortical excitability and connectivity, but their electrophysiological effects have never been compared. Objective. This study aims to fill this gap by using high-density scalp electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) as a common read-out to compare human brain responses to TMS and IES. Methods. The dataset includes TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) acquired from healthy subjects (n=22) and IES-evoked potentials (IEPs) recorded from drug-resistant epileptic patients (n=31) during wakefulness. In a subset of subjects TEPs (n=12) and IEPs (n=13) were also recorded during NREM sleep. Amplitude, spectral, and spatiotemporal features of TMS and IES responses, as well as their estimated electrical fields, were compared. Results. We observed marked differences between TMS and IES responses. During wakefulness, IEPs are considerably larger, slower and associated with a suppression of cortical activity, whereas TEPs are characterized by multiple waves of recurrent activation. These differences are attenuated during NREM, during which both TMS and IES elicit large EEG responses associated with a prominent suppression of cortical activity. At the global level, the spatiotemporal complexity of the responses to both TMS and IES decreases consistently following the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep. Conclusion. Despite the limitations due to different subject populations (healthy vs pathological), our findings provide a first reference to parallel non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation and to interpret their differential effects.

There remains a need for robust, controlled, and ethical lesion methods. Here, we present Cre recombinase expression as a reproducible alternative to excitotoxic lesions in mice. Using high titration adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, we show that Cre expression induces focal neurodegeneration across brain regions, affecting both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This effect is independent of viral serotype or fluorescent tags and is not visible with standard staining but is revealed by neuronal markers.

However, path integration is prone to cumulative error, which can be amplified when body-derived information is inconsistent between encoding and retrieval paths. Drawing on evidence from sensorimotor reactivation during memory retrieval, we hypothesized that re-enacting encoding-related movement patterns could serve as a body-derived mechanism to counteract such errors. In a novel virtual reality task with motion tracking, participants learned unique, irregular step sequences linked to specific target distances during an encoding phase. They later reproduced these distances in complete darkness under three conditions: self-paced free retrieval, retrieval with encoding-congruent movements, and retrieval with encoding-incongruent, regular gait. During free retrieval, participants naturally re-enacted encoding-related movements associated with improved distance reproduction. As predicted, distance estimation was significantly more accurate during congruent retrieval than during incongruent retrieval. These behavioral findings are consistent with a neural network model in which retrieved encoding-related motor patterns correct path integration errors in grid cells. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and computational evidence that body-derived, encoding-related motor patterns can enhance distance estimation, possibly by filtering grid cell error accumulation, offering new insights into embodied mechanisms of path integration.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Potassium-selective channelrhodopsins (KCRs) have emerged as promising alternatives to chloride-conducting channels for optogenetic inhibition of cellular excitability, but they exhibit dynamic ion selectivity shift under prolonged or intense illumination, causing activation. This inhibition to activation transition limits their utility for silencing circuits. Through behavioral and electrophysiological analyses in Drosophila, and C. elegans, we found that the C29D variant of KCR1 maintains the most stable potassium selectivity among tested variants. While other KCR variants showed excitation defects, KCR1-C29D consistently provided robust in vivo inhibition across cell types, illumination conditions, and species. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that while most KCRs show declining PK/PNa ratios during illumination, KCR1-C29D maintains stable ion selectivity, consistent with its robust silencing capability.

Despite clinical application, molecular and anatomical understanding of this area has remained elusive. To help solving this, we took advantage of our recent data from transcriptomics analysis in mice, and applied fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on macaque and human brain sections. In accordance with a glutamatergic phenotype, we observed VGLUT2 mRNA across the STN, with quantification revealing higher VGLUT2 density in the ventromedial (vm) STN than dorsal STN. Unexpectedly, we identified HTR2C mRNA uniquely localized to vmSTN, while absent in dorsal STN. HTR2C thereby molecularly defines a distinct vmSTN domain, hereafter named vmSTNHTR2C. Based on the role of the serotonin (5-HT) 2C receptor in mood, vmSTNHTR2C may spatio-molecularly correspond to the limbic STN. The ventralized HTR2C profile was strongest in anterior STN and coincided with serotonergic innervation. The presence of vmSTNHTR2C was identified also in the human brain, but absent in the mouse. Strong HTR2C anteriorly revealed a new far-anterior STN domain. Comparing HTR2C with TAC1, a para-STN marker, para-STN was identified at the anterior STN, partly intermingled with the MFB. Thus, anterior STN shows several unique molecular and anatomical features in the primate brain.

C.; Azhar, D.; Zukowsky, D.; Heys, J. G.", "abstract": "The hippocampus creates cognitive maps, or internal representations that reflect knowledge of the external world. Hippocampal time cells are thought to represent the temporal structure of experiences, or temporal context. However, it remains unknown whether hippocampal time cells display learning dynamics that reflect increased knowledge of the temporal relationships that define a context. To address this gap, we utilized a behavioral paradigm with a shaping curriculum that allows animals to systematically acquire knowledge of temporal structure, ultimately enabling them to perform a temporal Delayed Non-Match to Sample (tDNMS) task. We conducted two-photon calcium imaging on large populations of CA1 neurons as mice progressed through the curriculum, from their initial exposure to the task structure to their successful discrimination of context at the end of training. Time cells were present from the outset, yet their activity evolved with experience, both at the single-cell level and across the population. Notably, at key moments in the curriculum, time cell dynamics adapted to reflect whether mice generalized across contexts or discriminated between them. Our findings suggest that CA1 time cells not only represent temporal context but may also reflect the processes by which temporal relationships are utilized. Hippocampal time cells therefore serve as a cognitive map, representing temporal relationships in a manner that reflects cognitive demands.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Since its introduction in 2008, however, its scalability has been severely hindered by the computational bottleneck of iterative parameter refinement. Current state-of-the-art implementations either sacrifice precision for speed or rely on slow iterative parameter updates, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Here, we present a novel mathematical reformulation of the General Linear Model (GLM), wrapped in a GPU-Empowered Mapping of population Receptive Fields (GEM-pRF) software implementation. By orthogonalizing the design matrix, our approach enables the direct and fast computation of the objective function's derivatives, which are used to eliminate the iterative refinement process. This approach dramatically accelerates pRF estimation while maintaining full accuracy. Validation using empirical and simulated data confirms GEM-pRF's accuracy, and benchmarking against established tools demonstrates an order-of-magnitude reduction in computation time. With its modular and extensible design, GEM-pRF provides a critical advancement for large-scale fMRI retinotopic mapping. Furthermore, our reformulated GLM approach in combination with GPU-based implementation offer a broadly applicable solution that may extend beyond visual neuroscience, accelerating computational modelling across various domains in neuroimaging and beyond.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The ability to switch focus to a relevant sound source while inhibiting an irrelevant one requires attentional control and is crucial for navigating busy auditory scenes. Objective measures of attentional control could be beneficial in clinical contexts, such as fitting hearing aids. In a dual-task paradigm, we investigated whether pupil responses reflect relevance-dependent selectivity and if this selectivity correlates with selective behavioral performance. Participants with self-reported normal hearing (N = 21, Age: 27 to 66 years, pure tone average: -4 to +26 dB HL) listened to continuous speech from the front (primary task) while background sounds, consisting of a name followed by a two-digit number, were presented from the left and right. The secondary task involved memorizing and later recognizing numbers from either the right or left side (i.e., relevant). We observed increased pupil responses to sounds from the relevant side compared to the irrelevant side, indicating selectivity. Additionally, participants who exhibited stronger selectivity recognized more numbers correctly. Interestingly, pupil responses did not differ between hits and misses, but a stronger response to stream confusions versus correct rejections was found, suggesting that participants were more challenged by inhibiting irrelevant sounds than shifting attention to relevant sounds. In sum, our findings demonstrate that pupillometry provides valuable insights into attentional control abilities.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

While DRG neurons have been extensively studied and classified based on size, molecular markers, and functional characteristics, very little is still known about SGC heterogeneity and its potential implications on sensory processing in the DRG. Single cell transcriptional analyses have proposed the existence of SGC subtypes, yet in situ validation, spatial distribution, and potential functional implications of such subtypes are still largely unexplored. Here, we present the first comprehensive in situ characterization of SGC heterogeneity within the mouse DRG. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and advanced imaging techniques, distinct SGC subclusters were identified, validated, and spatially mapped within their native anatomical context. We visually identify four distinct subpopulations: 1) a predominant population of perisomatic SGC sheaths defined by the expression of marker proteins traditionally used to characterize the entire SGC population, including FABP7, KIR4.1, GS, and CX43. 2) OCT6+ SGCs occasionally being found in mosaic perisomatic sheaths, and consistently associated with axonal glomeruli, primarily ensheathing initial segment axon. 3) SCN7A+ SGCs, exhibiting no/low expression of traditional SGC markers and forming specialized homogenous sheaths around non-peptidergic neuron subtypes, implicating their potential role in pruritic (itch-related) conditions. 4) Interferon response gene-expressing SGCs, responding to Herpes Simplex Virus infection, suggesting potential involvement in antiviral protection. Finally, we investigate human DRG and find an inner perisomatic SGC layer surrounded by an outer SGC layer, with traditional and novel markers distinctively distributed between the two layers.

S.; Yartas, G.; Pagliarini, M.; Schaefer, M.; Huber-Lang, M.; Roselli, F.", "abstract": "Peripheral consequences following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are characterized by both systemic inflammatory responses and autonomic dysregulation, with almost all peripheral organs affected. One of the main immune regulatory organs, the spleen, shows high interaction with the brain which is controlled by both circulating mediators as well as autonomic fibers targeting splenic immune cells. The brain-spleen axis does not function as a one-way street, it also shows reciprocal effects where the spleen affects neuroinflammatory and cognitive functions post injury. To date, systemic and splenic inflammatory responses are measured by cells or mediators located in circulation. Nevertheless, most of the signaling and inflammation post injury takes place in the organs. Therefore, we set out to investigate the early signaling landscape in the spleen following TBI, using phospho-proteomic signaling approaches and immunofluorescence stainings to investigate novel molecular and cellular players. Based on the signaling signature, we found a rapid influx of basophil granulocytes towards the spleen, which are recruited via CXCL1 expressed by B-cells and dendritic cells. The basophils activate B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) via the IL-13/IL-13Ra1 signaling pathway to enhance protein translation through the long non-coding RNA NORAD. The early recruitment of basophils and subsequent activation of B cells and DCs, is short lived and sets at 3dpi. Interestingly, the rapid recruitment of basophils is inhibited by ethanol intoxication in TBI. In conclusion, basophils recruitment to the spleen may serve as an early mediator of systemic inflammatory responses to TBI with potential implications for research on biomarkers and therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

B.; Pires dos Santos, I.; Taylor, H.; Mostany, R.", "abstract": "The loss of ovarian estrogen during the menopause transition has been identified as a risk factor for increased cardiometabolic and neurovascular dysfunction, age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. A wealth of studies using rodent models of menopause have highlighted the cardio- and neuroprotective effects of 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) treatment when administered within a critical period, though these have yet to be successfully translated to human populations in clinical trials of hormone therapy. A proposed explanation for this mismatch in results is the \"healthy cell bias,\" where estrogen is only beneficial when initiated in physiologically intact systems. Our study investigates whether pre-existing metabolic dysfunction attenuates the effects of E2 on neurovascular coupling (NVC) in a rodent model of menopause. Female mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet (CD) for 11 weeks to induce metabolic dysfunction, followed by ovariectomy (OVX) and subsequent E2 or vehicle (Veh) treatment. NVC was assessed in awake mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy of penetrating arterioles (PAs) in the somatosensory cortex, barrel field. Mice developed glucose intolerance and increased adiposity yet displayed intact NVC following 11 weeks of HFD exposure. Following ovariectomy, E2 treatment enhanced NVC responses regardless of diet. Interestingly, in HFD-fed mice, E2 appeared to reduce basal PA diameter relative to Veh, suggesting health status-specific mechanisms of action. These results indicate that PAs retain functional sensitivity to estrogen treatment in the face of metabolic impairment, which has implications for the use of hormone therapy in women that arrive at the menopause transition with varied pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

This antibody was generated against 2AT-L, a structurally defined A{beta} oligomer mimic composed of three A{beta}-derived {beta}-hairpins arranged in a triangular fashion and covalently stabilized with three disulfide bonds. In the current study, we set out to determine if pAb2AT-L is neuroprotective against toxic aggregates of A{beta} and found that pAb2AT-L protects human iPSC-derived neurons from A{beta}42-mediated toxicity at molar ratios as low as 1:100 antibody to A{beta}42, with a ratio of 1:25 almost completely rescuing cell viability. Few other antibodies have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects at such low ratios of antibody to A{beta}. ThT and TEM studies indicate that pAb2AT-L delays but does not completely inhibit A{beta}42 fibrillization at sub-stoichiometric ratios. The ability of pAb2AT-L to inhibit A{beta}42 toxicity and aggregation at sub-stoichiometric ratios suggests that pAb2AT-L binds toxic A{beta}42 oligomers and does not simply sequester monomeric A{beta}42.

Previously, we and others have shown that it is possible to increase donor retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival by inhibiting the microglia-RGC interaction with Annexin V or through reprogramming microglia with the soluble Fas ligand. However, the exact mechanisms of the microglia/macrophage activation and their heterogeneity following transplantation remain unknown. To address this question, the donor RGC were differentiated from Brn3b-Tdtomato-Thy1.2 human embryonic stem cells using a 3D protocol, followed by dissociation and RGC purification. RGC were delivered subretinally (1.5x104 viable cells/eye) into 3-6-month-old CX3CR1GFP knock-in mice. Three days after transplantation retinas were dissociated into single-cell suspension and GFP-positive myeloid cells isolated using FACS. Of the sorted cells, up to 10,000 viable cells per sample were used for single-cell RNA library preparation and sequenced using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. In addition, several retinas were fixed and stained for donor RGC (mCherry) and host microglia/macrophages (Iba1). RNA Velocity was used to reconstruct the myeloid cell population and activation trajectory from scRNAseq data. We observed continuous bi-directional transition of microglia/macrophages from a homeostatic to an activated state. We also observed that the response to the transplant falls into the classic disease-associated-microglia (DAM) activation paradigm with a decrease in expression of the homeostatic gene Tmem119 and an increase in expression of disease-associated genes including Apoe, Lgals3, and Spp1. Our findings show that the host retinal myeloid cell population undergoes activation upon transplantation of stem-cell derived donor RGC, with a molecular profile of the activated cells similar to that of activated myeloid cells associated with neurodegenerative diseases of the brain and the eye. Advanced integrated transcriptomic analysis shows separate activated-to-homeostatic and homeostatic-to-activated trajectories suggesting the reversibility of this process.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Despite increasing recognition of sex differences in brain function, little is known about how PV-INs differ between males and females under healthy conditions. Previous work has pointed to sex differences in PV-IN vulnerability in disease and injury models. Here, we investigated sex differences in PV-IN characteristics, connectivity, and function in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of healthy mice. We found that female mice have significantly fewer PV-INs in the RSC compared to males, yet exhibit comparable memory induced neuronal activation (fos expression). Despite their lower numbers, female PV-INs displayed greater synaptic connectivity, as evidenced by increased synaptotagmin-2 (Syt-2) puncta per PV-IN and higher axonal bouton density. Additionally, fewer female PV-INs were surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), suggesting greater plasticity in female inhibitory networks. From ex vivo slice electrophysiology recordings we observed greater excitability in female PV-INs compared to male PV-INs and, a reduced incidence of IPSCs. These findings indicate that female mice may compensate for reduced PV-IN numbers through enhanced synaptic output, preserving inhibitory function in the RSC. Finally, using spatial transcriptomic profiling of PV-INs we observed a number of differentially expressed genes that are consistent with the observed structural and functional differences between female and male PV-INs. Understanding these sex-specific inhibitory mechanisms is crucial for developing more targeted interventions for conditions involving PV-IN impairment and for understanding sex specific vulnerabilities to certain conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Using the 6-OHDA mouse model of PD/LID, we combined in vivo and ex vivo recordings to isolate the effect of repeated treatment in LID worsening and other motor fluctuation-related phenotypes. We found that LID worsening is linked to potentiation of levodopa-evoked responses in both D1-/D2-MSNs, independent of changes in dopamine release or MSN intrinsic excitability. Instead, strengthening of glutamatergic synapses onto D1-MSNs emerged as a key driver. Moreover, we found changes in D2-MSN activity that specifically influenced LID duration, potentially contributing to motor fluctuations, which paralleled a reduction in D2R sensitivity.

Here, we examine multiple functional characteristics of astrocytes distinguished by their specific spatial relation to inhibitory synapses made on distinct hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell domains: astrocytes covering the peri-somatic area in stratum pyramidale (SP) receiving input from Parvalbumin interneurons, or the apical dendritic area in stratum radiatum (SR) innervated by inhibitory inputs from Somatostatin interneurons. Whole-cell dye-filling and confocal imaging of SR astrocytes showed a typical bushy organization of processes while those of SP astrocytes were more polarized, indicating astrocyte morphological heterogeneity. In addition, SP astrocytes formed a smaller, yet polarised syncytium and displayed greater input resistance relative to SR astrocytes. The two populations of astrocyte are functionally different as indicated by their intrinsic Ca2+ signaling properties: SP astrocyte Ca2+ events had a lower frequency and temporal density, but greater amplitude, relative to SR astrocytes. Using the territorial segregation of inhibitory synapses, we observed that the selective activation using DREADD or blockade with intracellular BAPTA of the two populations of astrocytes regulated inhibitory synapses exclusively in their own syncytial territory. Furthermore, each astrocyte population selectively mediated long-term depression at the respective inhibitory synapses through Ca2+- dependent modulation of post-synaptic targets. These results indicate domain-specific regulation of inhibitory synapses by distinct SP and SR astrocyte syncytia. Transcriptional analysis revealed enriched gene expression in SP relative to SR astrocytes, notably for regulation of cell growth and morphology, synaptic function and signaling.

We examined electrophysiological (EEG) responses to clicks and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in 49 older (29 female) and 26 younger (20 female) adults to determine the extent to which auditory nerve (AN) deficits in older adults contributed to functional and structural changes throughout the auditory system. Older adults exhibited smaller AN responses, similar brainstem responses, and larger auditory cortex (AC) responses, demonstrating progressive central gain. Audiometric thresholds were not predictive of EEG measures. Reduced AN function predicted deficits in cortical microstructure (lower AC fractional anisotropy, FA) in older adults, consistent with myelin degeneration. These lower FA values in the AC of older adults also predicted larger AC responses and more central gain. Older adults exhibited significantly lower AC FA and higher mean diffusivity (MD) than younger adults, and AC FA and MD were significant predictors of speech-in-noise (SIN) recognition in older adults. The results suggest that reduced afferent input in older adults not only results in functional changes throughout the auditory system consistent with progressive gain, but also contributes to deficits in AC structure beyond those explained by age alone, contributing to SIN deficits. Understanding the complex effects of age, reduced AN input, central gain, and AC structure on SIN recognition may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

A comprehensive set of 1805 different hyperparameter configurations was tested, including variations in the DL architectures and data pre-processing.

Interpersonal coordination occurs from two complementary processes entailing voluntary (planned) and spontaneous (emergent) synchronization, of which neurofunctional underpinnings are unknown. We investigated the brain correlates of these two synchronization processes during an fMRI finger-tapping task. Dyads formed by IN and OUT scanner participants were instructed to reproduce a target tempo and concurrently try to synchronize to (Joint Action, JA) or resist synchronization with (Non-interactive, NI) the partner's tapping, whose hand was always visible to the IN participant. Faster, slower, or equal tempi were used to induce within-dyad co-regulation. Results revealed the emergence of tempo contagion: participants tapped faster in response to the partner's faster taps and vice versa for slower taps. The magnitude of such an interpersonal contagion effect was similar across conditions but associated with the activity of different neural structures. Tempo contagion correlated positively with lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTc) activations in the JA condition but negatively with cerebellar activations in the NI condition. This suggests visuomotor information is exploited in opposite ways depending on the task instructions: the LOTc promotes co-regulation to achieve synchronization in JA, whereas the cerebellum prevents tempo contagion to preserve individual stability in NI. This latter result is supported by a negative functional connectivity between the cerebellum and LOTc.

Novelty strongly modulated odor responses in the AON, but only weakly in the aPCx. Pharmacological and chemogenetic inactivation of the AON but not the aPCx disrupted exploratory responses. During long-term habituation over multiple days, sensory representations were drifting in the AON whereas they became stable within one day in the aPCx.

The mtDNA lesions in the RPE detected a trend of increase in 15-month-old DJ-1 WT and DJ-1 KO RPE in all regions compared to 3-month-old mice. In the retina, a significant increase in mtDNA lesions/10kb accumulation in the 15-month-old DJ-1 WT RIV was detected compared to 3-month-old DJ-1 WT. The OGG1 levels significantly increased in 3-month-old retinal lysates compared to the 3-month-old DJ-1 WT. Our findings suggest that DJ-1 is critical for mitochondrial regulation and function in RPE and retina. The observed changes reflect mitochondrial dysfunction related to absence of DJ-1.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

W.; Smith, S.; Vidaurre, D.", "abstract": "Understanding how differences in brain structure relate to differences in cognition across the lifespan is essential for addressing age-related cognitive decline. Since age is strongly associated with both brain structure and cognition, predictive models often risk simply capturing age effects. To mitigate this risk, deconfounding is typically applied to remove the linear effects of age. Here, we propose to treat age instead as a moderator variable, therefore capturing changes in how brain structure and cognitive abilities are statistically connected. For this view to hold, variations in brain structure linked to differences in cognitive performance in older subjects (e.g. related to disease) would differ from those in younger subjects. Using structural brain imaging data from the UK Biobank, we found evidence supporting this, and that the generalisability of prediction models depends on the age group used to train the model. These findings highlight the complex nature of age-related brain-cognition interactions, and suggest that the optimal modelling approach depends on the population under study.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Specific neural cell types, such as microglia, undergo maladaptive changes with age, including increased inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in regulating plasticity and brain ECM dynamics, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function in the setting of aging. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced synapse phagocytosis. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction. Harnessing its activity may mitigate detrimental effects of age-associated insults on microglia function.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

All brain regions showed a significant proportion of offset responses often combined with onset and sustained responses in the same neuron. However, using population activity decoders, we observed that neural representations after the sound offset show a three-fold increase in sound encoding accuracy in the cortex relative to subcortical areas. This result indicates that cortical offsets encode a more precise short-term memory of the elapsed sound than subcortical offsets and that they likely result from specific computational steps.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We studied the impact of prepubertal gonadectomy on evoked dopamine release in male Mus spicilegus, a mouse whose adolescent life history has been carefully characterized in the wild and laboratory. To examine how puberty impacts the dopamine systems in M. spicilegus males, we removed the gonads prepubertally at P25 and then examined evoked dopamine release in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and nucleus accumbens core regions of striatal slices at P60-70. To measure dopamine release, we used near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to enable study of spatial distribution of dopamine release sites in each striatal region. We found that prepubertal gonadectomy led to a significantly reduced density of dopamine release sites and reduced dopamine release at each site in the dorsolateral nigrostriatal system compared to sham controls. By contrast, mesoaccumbal dopamine release was comparable between sham and gonadectomized groups. Our data suggest that during adolescence the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system is significantly affected by the rise in gonadal hormones in males, while the mesoaccumbal system shows no detectable sensitivity at this time point. These data are consistent with molecular studies in rodents that suggest nigrostriatal neurons are sensitive to androgens at puberty, and extend our understanding of how gonadal hormones could impact the spatial distribution and release potential of dopamine terminals in the striatum.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We performed ex vivo {omega}DTD and histology in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sham-operated rats (P = 17) 24 hours post reperfusion.

These responses are mediated by mechanosensory neurons distributed across the body, whose axons project into somatotopically organized brain regions corresponding to body location. How mechanosensory neurons interface with brain circuits to transform mechanical stimulations into location-appropriate behavior is unclear. We previously described the somatotopic organization of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) around the Drosophila head that elicit a sequence of location-aimed grooming movements (Eichler et al., 2024). Here, we use a serial section electron microscopy reconstruction of a full adult fly brain to identify nearly all of BMN pre- and postsynaptic partners, uncovering circuit pathways that control head grooming. Postsynaptic partners dominate the connectome, and are both excitatory and inhibitory. We identified an excitatory hemilineage of cholinergic interneurons (hemilineage 23b) that elicit aimed head grooming and exhibit varied connectivity to BMNs from different head locations, revealing lineage-based development of a somatotopic parallel circuit architecture. Presynaptic partners provide extensive BMN presynaptic inhibition, consistent with models of sensory gain control as a mechanism of suppressing grooming movements and controlling the sequence. This work provides the first comprehensive map of a somatotopically organized connectome, and reveals how this organization could shape grooming. It also reveals the mechanosensory interface with the brain, illuminating fundamental features of mechanosensory processing, including feedforward excitation and inhibition, feedback inhibition, somatotopy based circuit organization, and developmental origins.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) in the primate brain are critically involved in working memory during tasks that require the retention of information over a delay. These same regions have also been implicated in reinforcement learning (RL), where information about an animal's choice and its outcome is retained to update future reward expectations based on past experiences. We investigated whether spatial memory, required across different behavioral contexts, relies on a shared neural mechanism. To explore this, we analyzed neural activity recorded from rhesus monkeys engaged in three distinct tasks: the oculomotor delayed response task (ODR), a visual search task, and the matching pennies game, each requiring the retention and use of similar spatial information under different cognitive demands. The ODR task demands only prospective memory, as the selection of action is dictated by the location of visual cue, and the subject must retain this intended action for execution after a temporal delay. In contrast, the matching pennies task engages both retrospective and prospective memory: retrospective memory of previous choice and its outcome to inform decision-making, while prospective memory is needed to carry out that decision. Visual search task, by comparison, does not explicitly require either retrospective or prospective memory. Our analysis revealed that neural signals encoding retrospective memory of the animal's choice in the visual search and matching pennies tasks were not correlated with the prospective working memory signals of visually cued locations in the ODR task, in either the DLPFC or LIP. Moreover, retrospective choice signals in the visual search and matching pennies tasks were not correlated with each other. In contrast, neural activity related to upcoming choices (prospective memory) in the LIP showed significant correlations across all three tasks. In the DLPFC, prospective choice signals were correlated between the visual search and ODR tasks, but not between those tasks and matching pennies. Additionally, in the DLPFC, neural signals representing previously rewarded choices were significantly correlated with working memory signals during the ODR task. These results suggest that the LIP supports a consistent, shared mechanism for prospective memory linking a committed action to its eventual execution. In contrast, the DLPFC might mediate the transformation of retrospective memory, integrating past choices and outcomes into a decision and its associated prospective memory.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Standard linear dynamical models of recurrent networks are unreasonably sensitive to the precise values of the synaptic weights, since stability requires all eigenvalues of the recurrent matrix to lie within the unit circle. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically and numerically, that an arbitrary recurrent neural network can remain stable even when its spectral radius exceeds 1, provided it incorporates divisive normalization, a dynamical neural operation that suppresses the responses of individual neurons. Sufficiently strong recurrent weights lead to instability, but the approach to the unstable phase is preceded by a regime of critical slowing down, a well-known early warning signal for loss of stability. Remarkably, the onset of critical slowing down coincides with the breakdown of normalization, which we predict analytically as a function of the synaptic strength and the magnitude of the external input. Our findings suggest that the widespread implementation of normalization across neural systems may derive not only from its computational role, but also to enhance dynamical stability.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In Parkinson's disease (PD), motor impairments can affect sleep quality. This study explored the interrelationships between sleep disruption, gait difficulties, and cognition in PD, with a specific focus on the potential mediating role of PVS. Methods: 348 participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) were divided into healthy controls (HC), prodromal individuals, and patients with PD. Insomnia levels indicated sleep disruption, and walking difficulties severity were considered. Cognition was measured with the Symbol Digit Modalities (SDM) test. PVS volume fractions in white matter (WM-PVS) and basal ganglia (BG-PVS) were quantified using an automated segmentation pipeline developed by our team. Mediation analyses were conducted to assess whether PVS mediated the relationship between gait impairment and cognition, as well as the relationship between sleep and gait problems. Finally, we examined whether baseline PVS volume fraction predicted disease progression, as indexed by cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers collected after five years. Results: PVS did not mediate the relationship between gait difficulties and cognition, or between sleep disruption and motor symptoms. Greater walking impairment was directly associated with poorer cognition. Insomnia severity was directly associated with greater walking problems. BG-PVS was negatively associated to cognition. Longitudinally, PVS burden was not predictive of disease progression. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep and motor impairments independently contribute to cognitive function in PD, but these effects are not mediated by PVS burden.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We examined how longitudinal changes in FC involving MTL and PMC during resting-state, episodic memory encoding, and retrieval relate to subsequent amyloid- and tau-PET burden, longitudinal episodic memory performance, and the APOE4 genotype in 152 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the PREVENT-AD cohort. We found APOE4- and fMRI paradigm-dependent associations of change in FC strength with pathology burden and change in episodic memory performance. Decreasing FC over time, or ''hypoconnectivity'', within PMC during rest in APOE4 carriers and during retrieval in APOE4 non-carriers was related to more amyloid and tau, respectively. Conversely, increasing FC over time, or ''hyperconnectivity'', within MTL during encoding in APOE4 carriers and between MTL and PMC during retrieval independent of APOE4 status was related to more tau. Further, increasing FC between MTL and PMC during rest, unlike during encoding, was beneficial for episodic memory.

In order to reconstitute a 3D organoid mimicking the in vivo neural and endothelial cells development, we cultured iPSC-derived embryoid bodies in sequentially applied endothelial and neuronal induction media along with Matrigel embedding. The resulting 3D organoid consists of both neural cells and endothelial cells with vascular like structures, as determined by immunostaining. With scRNA-Seq analysis, the brain organoid was confirmed to contain neural cell types similar with human brains, including a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and glia. Furthermore, when compared with traditional cerebral organoids without endothelial cells using RNA-Seq analysis, the endothelial containing neural organoids (EC-neural organoids) showed difference in gene profiles and favored angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Of the differentially expressed genes, KRBA2 expression was found higher in neural cells and its inhibition by siRNA treatment resulted in decreased transcriptions of a variety of genes such as neuronal differentiation specific genes but not in genes specific to pluripotent stem cells such as OCT4.

Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and biochemistry analyses, we established class I HDACs as novel TRiC substrates and elucidate TRiC-assisted folding of HDAC1 and HDAC3 during its ATPase cycle, orchestrated by distinct co-chaperone and cofactor networks. In the closed TRiC chamber, both HDAC1 and HDAC3 adopt near-native states with shared binding interfaces. However, their open-state configurations diverge: Hsp70 and PDCD5 engage atop and within TRiC, respectively, for HDAC3, whereas prefoldin (PFD) binds atop TRiC for HDAC1, suggesting roles in substrate delivery and folding modulation. Furthermore, an unexpected bent conformation of CCT4, detected in TRiC-HDAC1 complex, may facilitate co-chaperone dissociation from TRiC. In contrast, HDAC8 folds independently of TRiC.

Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Importantly, integrative ChIP-seq and Micro-C data analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CTCF and CP190 to strengthen the formation of topological boundaries.

Dedifferentiation, the process by which mature cells revert to a multipotent state, holds great potential for regeneration but also poses a risk of tumorigenesis.

Here, we investigate how the oncogenic potential of dedifferentiation varies across different neural lineages in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). We found that Nerfin-1 inactivation causes oncogenic phenotypes in the central brain (CB) and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) but not optic lobe (OL). In contrast, Lola inactivation leads to tumour overgrowth specifically in the OL. We identify Chinmo, an oncogenic temporal transcription factor, and its regulation by ecdysone signalling as key determinants of these differential responses. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism by which the regulation of temporal factors like Chinmo influences the tumorigenic outcome of dedifferentiation.

In a second experiment, we show that once turned away the expression associated with prior direct gaze no longer mattered; instead a submissive facial expression accompanying the gaze shift delayed gaze-following. Direct comparison of both experiments reveals that expressions accompanying direct gaze trigger earlier gaze-following responses than the same expressions joining gaze aversion. These results document the pronounced behavioral importance of the valuation of expressions signaling danger, arguably creating heightened alertness in monkey observers, thereby priming their gaze-following to allow for immediate conflict resolution.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

A.; Kao, A. B.", "abstract": "Cognitive abilities are central to how animals navigate complex environments. Beyond individual cognition, group living can also enhance navigation by pooling individually acquired information. One way this may be achieved is by following experienced leaders, which requires recognizing expertise within group members. Alternatively, accurate decisions could also emerge without expert opinions, through simpler mechanisms like the 'wisdom of crowds' principle that average out individual biases. Consequently, collective navigation strategies range from cognitively complex to simple, and yet, the prevalence or interplay of different collective strategies in nature remains unexplored. In this study, we asked: what is the navigation mechanism(s), requiring minimal cognitive demands, that is necessary and sufficient to quantitatively replicate the experimental results of a 2017 study on homing pigeons (Columba livia), which showed that sequential chains of bird pairs flying home -- similar to a game of telephone -- led to shorter homing routes compared to control birds flying individually or in fixed pairs. Our results show that the experimental data aligns closely with the simplest strategy -- route averaging. Surprisingly, the complex mechanism of selectively propagating the best flight through social learning offered no additional advantage. We further observed that mixed strategies, although not supported by the experimental data, in theory combined advantages from both averaging and active selection of better routes, resulting in even greater performance. Hence, our results highlight the potential for future research to investigate selective pressures shaping the evolution of cultural learning and trade-offs among different decision mechanisms theoretically available to social animals in nature.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Objective: We examined how astrocyte-derived ApoE isoforms impact neuronal morphology and used structural modeling to explore functional divergence. Methods: Neonatal rat hippocampal neurons were cultured with astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) from mice expressing human ApoE3, ApoE4, or chimpanzee ApoE. Neuronal outgrowth was quantified after 72 hours. Results: Chimpanzee ACM increased neurite number by 30% over human ApoE isoforms. However, chimpanzee ACM resembled ApoE4 functionally, producing 40% shorter neurites and spines. Structural modeling supported greater similarity to ApoE4.

BarPenk neurons are active selectively during voiding, when the external urethral sphincter (EUS) relaxes, and their optogenetic activation elicits time-locked suppression of EUS activity. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons induces a sex-specific, aberrant pattern of micturition behavior, while targeted ablation impairs voluntary marking behavior in response to female cues. We observe multiple regions involved in visceromotor regulation and behavioral state control projecting to BarPenk neurons, supporting their role as integrators of internal state and environmental context to drive urinary output.

However, its impact on how voluntary actions are initiated and subjectively experienced remains underexplored. Similarly, how directing attention to different phases of an action, such as intention formation versus execution, and anticipating outcomes of an action, modulates the neural readiness for movement, has yet to be fully examined. This study investigates whether spatial proximity, attentional focus, and anticipated action outcomes influence action preparation and action awareness, using a virtual reality adaptation of the Libet clock paradigm during EEG recordings. Neural results reveal that attentional focus and anticipated action outcomes modulate different phases of motor preparation, as indexed by the readiness potential (RP)-a gradual buildup of neural activity preceding voluntary movement. Focusing on decision timing (without subsequent action outcomes) enhances early RP amplitude and decreases the late RP slope, suggesting increased preparatory neural engagement during intention formation. In contrast, focusing on action execution leads to a steeper late RP slope, indicating later and faster motor activity buildup when attention is directed toward movement onset. Anticipating action outcomes increased late RP slope, which was accompanied by the temporal binding effect: when a tone followed the action, both decision and action estimates shifted toward it. Spatial proximity influences RP dynamics specifically in tasks when participants focused on their intention to act in the absence of an outcome. Behavioural results show that actions are perceived as occurring earlier when the clock is displayed near compared to far, indicating that PPS influences the temporal perception of action timing. Overall, these findings highlight the dynamic interplay among external spatial context and internal cognitive processes in shaping motor preparation and action awareness. Importantly, a temporal internal attentional focus on intention to act modulates early RP-traditionally considered an unconscious stage of neural readiness. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how PPS and the locus of attention on specific action phases affect action preparation and awareness, with potential implications for future research on the sense of agency and voluntary action decision making.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Because robust FFRs require averaging across approximately 3000 stimulus repetitions, conventional acquisition is time-intensive. We introduce the Rapid FFR, a technique that minimises recording time by presenting the stimulus continuously (i.e., without interstimulus intervals) and by averaging across individual response cycles. This study aimed to: (a) compare Rapid and Conventional FFR performance under time matched conditions; (b) assess test-retest reliability of both methods, and (c) examine potential neural adaptation during extended Rapid FFR recordings. Design: All participants (37 in total) were young adults with clinically normal hearing. In Experiment 1, FFRs were elicited from 16 listeners using a 128 Hz sawtooth wave presented in two ways: (1) continuously over approximately 1 minute in each polarity for the Rapid FFR and (2) as discrete tone bursts (1500 trials per polarity) for the standard FFR. Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNRs), response amplitudes, and test-retest reliability were compared across techniques. In Experiment 2, the Rapid FFR was recorded continuously from 21 listeners for nearly nine minutes to assess potential adaptation over time. Results: The Rapid FFR produced significantly higher SNRs than the standard FFR, reflecting improved recording efficiency. Both techniques captured inter-individual differences reliably, with comparable frequency-domain response patterns across participants. In particular, measures derived from the Rapid FFR showed strong agreement with those from the standard FFR for lower harmonics (F0-H3). Higher harmonics (H4-H7) exhibited greater variability but remained consistent between techniques. In the prolonged recording condition, FFR amplitudes remained stable over time, with no significant decline across the nine-minute recording. This indicates that continuous stimulation did not result in measurable neural adaptation or response fatigue. Conclusions: The Rapid FFR offers a time-efficient alternative to standard protocols, preserving signal fidelity and reliability while enabling shorter acquisition times. These findings suggest that the Rapid FFR is well-suited for use in populations where long recordings are challenging (e.g., in infants and the clinic) and can facilitate more extensive experimental designs within a single session. The method holds promise for advancing both research and clinical applications of the FFR. Future studies should explore its use across a broader range of sounds (in particular, dynamically varying ones) and listener groups.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Neuroinflammation is an invariant feature of all chronic neurologic diseases, including epilepsy, and acute brain insults, including status epilepticus (SE). The generalized seizures of SE trigger a robust inflammatory response involving astrocytosis, erosion of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of brain-resident microglia, and recruitment of blood-borne CCR2+ monocytes into the brain. We have shown that blocking monocyte recruitment into the brain via global Ccr2 knockout or systemic CCR2 antagonism with a small molecule alleviates multiple deleterious SE-induced pathologies, including BBB damage, microgliosis, neuronal damage, and monocyte brain invasion in the days following pilocarpine-induced SE. This study aimed to determine if fleeting CCR2 antagonism improves SE-associated cognitive impairments in the long term. Here, we show that the brief antagonism of CCR2 eliminates the profound deficit in working memory in the Y-maze and retention memory in the novel object recognition test but does not attenuate anxiety-like behavior in the open field arena. Microgliosis and astrocytosis were observed in brain sections from SE mice after the behavioral tests, and CA1 hippocampal astrocytosis mildly correlated with performance in the Y-maze. Notably, SE mice exposed to the vehicle showed robust neuronal loss in the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus, and mice treated with the CCR2 antagonist showed less neurodegeneration in both the cortex and hippocampus. Our results indicate that monocyte brain infiltration after SE opens a window for preventing cognitive co-morbidities and neurodegeneration with an orally available CCR2 antagonist.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Obesity is also linked with altered neurocognitive functions, including impaired learning and memory. Whether these changes are secondary to neuroinflammation vs. other comorbidities associated with obesity is unknown. Here, we modeled the chronic low-grade inflammation that accompanies diet-induced obesity, but in the absence of obesity or consumption of an obesogenic diet. Male rats were implanted with intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps, continuously dispensing either saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin produced in the gut that triggers inflammation when in circulation. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that LPS exposure led to neuroinflammation, with an increased number of Ionized Calcium-Binding Molecule 1 (Iba1+) cells in the amygdala and hippocampus in LPS rats vs. controls. Given that these brain regions are associated with impulse control, anxiety-like behavior, and learning and memory, we tested whether chronic LPS treatment impacted these behaviors. Interestingly, LPS exposure did not affect hippocampal-dependent memory in the Morris water maze, novel location recognition, or novel object in context memory tests, suggesting that neuroinflammation in the absence of obesity does not induce memory impairments. Further, chronic LPS significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and food impulsivity in an operant-based procedure. LPS animals also had significantly lower corticosterone and melatonin levels when compared to controls, which may contribute to these behavioral outcomes. These results suggest that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity is not driving obesity-associated memory impairments but does reduce anxiety and food-motivated impulsive responses.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

In guinea pigs, the synapses between IHCs and low-SR ANFs have been shown to be more vulnerable to noise exposure compared to other ANF subtypes, but not in a study performed in CBA/CaJ mice, questioning if these results can be generalized. Here, an LYPD1 reporter mouse model on a C57Bl/6J background with specifically labeled group 1C, low-SR ANFs was used to examine whether LYPD1 positive ANF synapses are more vulnerable to noise exposure. Six-week-old mice were exposed to an 8-16 kHz octave band noise presented at 100 dBA for 2 hours. One week later, cochlear tissue was harvested to quantify ANF synapses and compare the percentage of LYPD1 positive ANF synapses in noise-exposed and unexposed animals. Auditory brainstem response measurements were performed to assess hearing function after noise exposure. The number of all ANF synapses and the percentage of LYPD1-positive ANF synapses were reduced following noise exposure, concurrent with increased ABR thresholds and decreased ABR wave 1 amplitudes.

M.; Blinder, P.", "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience have enabled simultaneous collection of multimodal datasets, including behavioral tracking, physiological signals, and neuronal recordings. Yet most analysis tools process these streams independently, often requiring manual alignment and custom code. This fragmentation limits reproducibility and interpretability at the experiment level, particularly in models where cognitive impairments are subtle, and reflects a broader tendency to analyze behavior as isolated events rather than as a structured process. Topological methods, though successful in other domains, remain underused in behavioral neuroscience, leaving the architecture of decision-making largely unexplored. To address these, we developed NaviGraph (Navigation on the Graph), a flexible, open-source pipeline designed to integrate diverse data types into a unified graph-based framework suited for spatial decision-making studies. By modeling decision points as graph nodes and populating them with behavioral, neuronal, and physiological parameters, NaviGraph offers a holistic, multi-layered perspective on cognition, enabling computation of spatial and topological metrics. This approach shifts the focus from isolated modalities to comprehensive interpretation, making behavioral patterns more accessible and easier to validate across datastreams. We applied NaviGraph to a trial-based spatial memory task in a complex maze and uncovered nuanced sex- and genotype-specific differences. In a knock-in model of Apolipoprotein {epsilon}E (apoE4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, females exhibited deficits detectable only through topological metrics, including inefficient navigation and increased visits to decision points, aligning with the heightened cognitive vulnerability observed in female apoE4 human carriers. Wildtype females, in contrast, displayed more direct recall navigation compared to males. To demonstrate NaviGraph's multimodal capabilities, we mapped neuronal activity from head-mounted miniaturized microscope calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex, an area extensively involved in path integration, alongside head orientation dynamics and behavioral trajectories onto the graph structure. This unified framework enabled visualization of decision-point-specific neuronal activity patterns, subpopulation dynamics linked to path familiarity, and physiological- behavioral alignment.

The paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) has been considered a hub brain area for controlling the anxiety network in the brain. Recent structural and functional investigations indicate that the PVT exhibits diverse neural signals aligned with early-life events, which are highly linked with anxiety-like behaviors. However, it remains unknown if repeated ethanol exposure during adolescence will affect the coordinated brain activities of the PVT in adulthood, and consequent behavioral adaptation. Here we show that adolescent repeated intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) triggers anxiety-like behaviors and parallelly induces the glutamatergic adaptation in the PVT after four weeks withdrawal from the last ethanol exposure. The firing rates, along with the spatiotemporal calcium transients in the PVT neurons during behavior were increased in the AIE mice compared to those in the counterpart control mice. Importantly, with the chemogenetic inhibition of the PVT neurons, we found alleviated the anxiety-like behavior in the AIE mice. The increased neuronal activities in the PVT of AIE mice was, at least partly, via the reduction of GLT1 (an astrocyte dominant glutamate transporter, known as EAAT2, slc1a2). Our non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures also showed an increase in glutamate/GABA ratio in the thalamic area including the PVT of the GLT1 conditional knock-down mice, which exhibited the heightened anxiety-like behavior. In addition, while the selective knock-out of GLT1 in the astrocytes of PVT in the alcohol naive mice induces anxiogenic phenotypes, the selective upregulation of GLT1 in the PVT astrocytes of the mice that were treated with AIE paradigm alleviated the anxiety-like behaviors as well. These findings highlight the significant role of PVT astrocytic GLT1 in the anxiogenic phenotype in adulthood induced by withdrawal from adolescent repeated ethanol exposure, suggesting that GLT1 in the PVT could serve as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder and comorbid emotional disorders.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with lumbar intrathecal catheters and dosed with different NaV 1.7 ASO concentrations (100 to 3000 & [micro]g;10 {micro}L). Pain behavior assays were conducted 0-28 days after ASO injections. Brain, spinal cords (SC) and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were collected.

Recent studies in the zebra finch, a songbird with a complex, naturally learned, movement sequence (song), have suggested that the repeats of short introductory notes (INs) at the start of each song bout, reflect motor preparation. However, whether IN properties correlate with upcoming song features remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by recording and analyzing male zebra finch songs over a 3 year period. We found bout-to-bout correlations in the acoustic features of the last IN and the first song syllable. However, similar correlations were present between the first song syllable and the first IN and the first and second song syllable suggesting that INs are also part of the song sequence. Next, we found an age-related increase in the mean IN number before song and song tempo. If INs reflected preparation of song parameters, we expected age-related song changes to be predicted by IN-song correlations at a younger age. We did not find any such correlations. Finally, we compared INs to other repeated syllables within song and outside song bouts and found that the speeding up of intervals between successive INs is unique to INs. Overall our results showing similarities in the acoustic features of INs and song syllables suggest shared neural control of INs and song syllables, while differences in timing suggest different neural mechanisms controlling IN timing.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

These results suggest that the NAc core, but not the shell or vHPC, is involved in the destabilization of well-learned instrumental memory, potentially through a vHPC-NAc core projection.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

This paradigm narrows the exploration of chemical space and often fails to account for functional convergence, where structurally diverse compounds act through distinct targets to produce similar phenotypic effects. As a result, compounds with therapeutic potential may be overlooked. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a training-free, transfer learning-based method for large scale compound preselection that leverages deep phenotypic profiling of human cells. Notably, this enables robust pairwise comparison of phenotypic signatures across any source of the entire JUMP-CP, the largest publicly available cell painting dataset (112,480 compounds), preserving biological signals while mitigating batch effects. Validated across 65 high-throughput assays, including in vitro and in cellulo systems, our method provides efficient pre-screen enrichment of biologically active compounds, bypassing the blind spots of structure-centric approaches. Interestingly, because it is large scale, it also allows for a comprehensive analysis of structure-phenotypic activity relationships, revealing potentially thousands of compound activity cliffs, where minimal chemical changes in structure may result in profound phenotypic shifts. We show that these cliffs capture subtle, atom-level determinants of bioactivity that cannot be accessed by structure-based models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that structurally diverse compounds targeting different genes in the same biological pathway can induce either convergent or opposite phenotypes, a phenomenon validated across 30 pathways, hundreds of genes, and thousands of compounds. Finally, to support the broader community, we propose Phenoseeker, a web-based tool enabling instant retrieval of JUMP-CP compounds with similar phenotypic profiles. Together, these findings position phenotypic profiling not merely as a complementary tool, but as a transformative and scalable framework for navigating chemical space through a biological lens. By capturing rich morphological signatures that reflect functional outcomes, regardless of structural similarity, this approach enables the discovery of bioactive compounds, novel mechanisms of action, and unexpected target-pathway relationships. Applied at the scale of the JUMP-CP dataset, phenotypic profiling emerges as a powerful strategy for prioritizing compounds, illuminating activity cliffs, and accelerating the identification of therapeutically relevant candidates across diverse biological contexts.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Here we show that continuous changes in hippocampal representations, known as drift, may facilitate this process. We used voluntary head-fixation and calcium imaging to record from CA1 in rats during an odor-guided navigation task that required frequent re-learning. We found systematic representational changes over the course of the multi-hour sessions that were increased following errors. A simple neural network model revealed that such error-driven drift can enable flexible re-learning by allowing new associations to form from new neural patterns. A consequence of this is that previous associations are maintained in latent synaptic weights. These findings reconcile the apparent tension between representational drift and stable memory storage, demonstrating how dynamic neural codes could support both flexible behavior and lasting memories.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion, and suggests two distinct, injury-specific mechanisms of recovery. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate mid-line contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. These observations suggest that symmetrical (contusion) and asymmetrical (lateral hemisection) injuries induce distinct types of plasticity in different regions of the spinal cord, indicating that effective therapeutic strategies may benefit from targeting specific circuits according to injury symmetry.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Despite the development of various behavioral tests to measure evoked pain in animal models, measuring spontaneous pain remains challenging. To address this unmet need, we developed a novel imaging approach to detect spontaneous nociception in animal pain models. To do this, we generated a Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes transgenic mouse that expresses Redquorin under the murine synapsin 1 promoter. Redquorin is a fusion protein consisting of chimera and a 2x tandem dimer Tomato Aequorin (tdTA), which emits long wavelength bioluminescence from activated neurons in the presence of coelenterazine. This luminescence can penetrate tissues and form a projected image on the body surface that can be detected with a spectrum In Vivo Imaging System, thus creating a Nociceptive Neuronal Activity Imaging mouse. We used the tdTA mice to image bioluminescence in the spinal regions as a surrogate of spontaneous pain induced by capsaicin, the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120, and spinal nerve ligation. Results show that Redquorin-emitted bioluminescence is a sensitive optical surrogate to measure spontaneous pain. This approach offers a new method to measure spontaneous pain in animal models for basic and translational research.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

M.; van der Heijden, M. E.", "abstract": "Cerebellar dysfunction causes various movement disorders, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in vivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no -- and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Using a dataset of all axons in an IBEAM-mSEM volume of mouse cortex, we show that PATHFINDER reduces the error rate in axon reconstruction by an order of magnitude over previous state of the art, leading to an improvement in proofreading throughput of up to 84x relative to prior estimates in the context of a whole mouse brain.

M.", "abstract": "Importance: Anti-amyloid immunotherapy is used to treat Alzheimer disease (AD) with moderate benefits and potentially serious side effects due to amyloid related imaging abnormality with effusions/edema (ARIA-E). Different anti-amyloid antibodies have different in vitro binding characteristics to different synthetic A{beta} aggregates, leading to the assumption that they bind different species in the human brain. Lecanemab is hypothesized to bind \"protofibrils,\" but these are not well-characterized in human brain. It is also unknown how binding differences correlate with ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele increases ARIA-E risk, but how it affects antibody binding characteristics is unknown. Objectives: To determine whether anti-amyloid antibodies bind different species of human brain A{beta} and whether these binding properties to human brain A{beta} explains ARIA-E rates. Design: Cross-sectional study of 18 postmortem human brains. Setting: Single tertiary care hospital. Participants: Deceased patients with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Main Outcomes and Measures: Equilibrium binding constants (KD) and total A{beta} binding (Bmax) of recombinant aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab equivalents to human brain soluble and insoluble amyloid plaque-enriched and CAA-enriched A{beta} aggregates. Results: Lecanemab did not bind with greater affinity to the soluble fraction of A{beta} compared to aducanumab. All three antibodies were bound essentially identical quantities of A{beta} across the 18 cases and fractions (Pearson's r 0.84 -- 0.97). Antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} did not differ in soluble fractions but differed slightly in insoluble extracts. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele led to a more soluble antibody-accessible A{beta} pool in a dose-dependent manner for all three antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: The lecanemab binding target in human brain is unlikely to be distinctly \"protofibrillar\" compared to other antibodies. Differences in antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} are unlikely to fully explain differences in ARIA-E rates. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele may plausibly increase ARIA-E risk by making antibody-accessible A{beta} more soluble.

Using super-resolution microscopy, we characterized their unique molecular composition and dynamics in dissociated neurons, enabling Ca2+ propagation over distances. Utilizing imaging and machine-learning-based analysis, we confirmed the in situ presence of DNTs connecting dendrites to other dendrites whose anatomical features are distinguished from synaptic dendritic spines. DNTs mediate the active transport of small molecules or human amyloid-beta (A{beta}), implicating the role of DNT network in AD pathology. Notably, DNT levels increased prior to the onset of amyloid plaque deposits in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice.

Exposure(s): Eight layers of omics (DNA methylation and histone acetylation from DLPFC; RNA seq from AC, DLPFC, and PCG, single-nucleus RNA, TMT proteomics and metabolomics from DLPFC) and Neuroticism using the 12-item version from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Person-specific multi-omic molecular pseudotime representing molecular progression from low to high phenotypic expression of neuroticism, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of neuroticism which represent distinct omic pathways from no/low neuroticism to high neuroticism that differ by their omic constituents.

The insular cortex, a multifunctional hub buried within the Sylvian fissure, has been implicated in motor control through clinical observations and neuroimaging, yet its precise contribution to movement processing remains one of the least understood aspects of motor neurophysiology. To address this gap, we quantified electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes in patients performing simple movement tasks combined with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) to map functional connectivity. We observe regions of distinct somatotopic separation bilaterally, as well as cross-modal regions that are active for different movement types. Hand representation is centered along the ventral aspect of the middle and posterior short gyri bilaterally, while tongue/mouth tuned sites cluster in the dorsal posterior short gyrus and the dorsal long gyri. Insular activity temporally follows the primary motor cortex (M1) and precedes movement onset. SPES revealed somatotopically-specific connectivity between corresponding sites in M1 and insula (hand-to-hand, tongue-to-tongue) and between bilateral insulae.

We report that exposure to Ag, Hg, MeHg, Cu, Mn, and Pb significantly alters electrotaxis speed. Notably, Cu required higher concentrations to induce phenotypes, whereas Ag and Hg disrupted behavior at lower doses. Three other metals (Ni, Fe, and Cd) did not elicit marked electrotaxis defects. Bioaccumulation analysis of Cu, Ag, Hg, and MeHg via ICP-MS revealed that MeHg was present in highest amount in worms. Consistent with this, MeHg showed the highest toxicity.

Metabolizable energy (ME) was calculated to estimate energy content per kilogram of feed. The crude protein content of housefly maggots (57.8%) was comparable to that of fish meal (58.5%), which was the highest among the evaluated feeds, while mealworms had a slightly lower protein content (51.02%).

Here, we show that neuronal pentraxin1 (NPTX1) facilitates Kv7.2-mediated inhibition of Fos+ ensemble hyperexcitability, thereby restricting its response to excitatory inputs from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and promoting memory expression in the fear context. Meanwhile, NPTX2 facilitates the perisomatic inhibition of the Npas4+ ensemble by parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, thus preventing fear memory overgeneralization. Pharmacological activation of Kv7.2 or chemogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons repaired memory deficits caused by engram specific NPTXs depletion. Contextual fear memory precision and NPTXs expression in dentate gyrus (DG) engram cells are decreased in aged mice. Overexpression of NPTX1 in Fos+ ensemble or AMPAR binding domain of NPTX2 in Npas4+ ensemble rescued memory imprecision.

Central nervous system infections can provoke seizures in the short term and increase the risk of spontaneous, recurrent seizures post-infection. However, the neural mechanisms underlying seizures during acute infection are unknown. These neuronal changes can be studied in C57BL6/J mice infected with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). TMEV-infected mice experience seizures 3-8 days post-injection (DPI), clear the virus by DPI 14, and may develop chronic, acquired temporal lobe epilepsy. TMEV may incite seizures during the acute infection period through inflammation, reactive gliosis, and cell death in hippocampal area CA1. Here, we explore the neuronal circuits underlying acute seizures in TMEV-injected mice using c-Fos driven TRAP (targeted recombination in active populations). TRAP mice (c-Fos-CreERT2 x CAG-tdTomato) were injected with PBS or TMEV and gently handled on DPI 5 to induce seizures. 4-OHT was administered to mice either 1.5 or 3 hr after seizures to tag the active cells expressing c-Fos with tdTomato. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and whole mouse brains were sectioned and immunostained for tdTomato expression. Percent area of fluorescence was quantified, and comparisons were made between TMEV-injected mice and PBS controls, sites ipsilateral vs contralateral to TMEV injection site, and between sexes. TdTomato expression was elevated in the TMEV-injected mice in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, thalamus, lateral septal nucleus, basal ganglia, triangular septal nucleus, fornix, and corpus callosum. Critically, the expression pattern suggests that seizures induced on DPI 5 arise from the hilus, dentate gyrus, and CA3 hippocampal subregions. Generalized seizures during acute TMEV infection may have propagated to the contralateral hemisphere via CA3 and the hippocampal commissure.

Leveraging two EEG datasets of images presented at different durations, we assessed whether this correspondence reflects general architectural principles or model-specific computations. Our analysis revealed a robust mapping: early EEG components correlated with activations from initial network layers and low-level visual features, whereas later components aligned with deeper layers and semantic content. Moreover, for images presented during longer times, the extent of correspondence correlated with the semantic contribution to the EEG response.

In this study, we assess the long-term ecological impact of hydrological changes, primarily induced by drainage, on ombrotrophic peatlands across Europe. Our analysis is based on novel palaeoecological data from seven peat cores collected from sites that have experienced varying degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. We reconstructed historical DWT fluctuations using plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses at high resolution. By applying Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), we identified species-specific and community-level response thresholds to changes in water level. This approach revealed two distinct change points: the first, at approximately 7 cm DWT, corresponds to hydrological conditions favourable for moisture-dependent Sphagnum species, while the second, near 22 cm DWT, is associated with more drought-adapted taxa and signals ecosystem degradation. The interval between these points represents a transition zone between optimal and suboptimal conditions for peatland functioning. An additional TITAN analysis aimed at identifying the timing of the most significant ecological changes indicates that peatland degradation intensified over the past two centuries and has accelerated in recent decades. Our findings also show that even after hydrological restoration, microbial and plant communities often remain distinct from those in undisturbed peatlands. This underscores the importance of preserving sites that still retain near-natural conditions. Based on our results (and consistent with previous studies) we recommend maintaining a DWT of approximately 10 cm below the surface as an optimal target for both peatland conservation and restoration. Such conditions not only support ecological integrity but are also associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and higher peat accumulation rates, reinforcing the role of ombrotrophic peatlands as long-term carbon sinks.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We find a non-monotonic trend between species richness and resistance, shaped by environmental characteristics. Our results show that colonization resistance is negatively correlated with both resource supply and resource diversity except when resource supply is limited.

We show that gene have been lost gradually during ~263 my of host-symbiont co-diversification, with more dramatic changes promoted by co-infecting additional microbes and host ecological switches. This has resulted in the convergent evolution, in two planthopper superfamilies, of bacterial genomes at barely 50-52 kb, strikingly similar in gene contents and the ability to produce a single essential amino acid, phenylalanine.

The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier (CLIC)-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wildtype and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, HBGA-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to non-clustering strains and outcompete non-clustering strains in replication assays as shown by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and a HBGA non-binding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in post-attachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and non-clustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Its ability to persist within host tissues without inducing strong immune responses was suggested to contribute to poor clinical outcomes. The cellular mechanisms underlying A. terreus interactions with host cells remain largely unexplored. In this study, we have used a micropattern-based infection model to investigate the early interactions between A. terreus conidia and alveolar epithelial cells, focusing on the role of Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling. This system allows quantitative analysis of conidia-cell interactions under defined spatial conditions. We show that A. terreus conidia rapidly bind to micropatterned A549 cell islands, with conidial numbers increasing over time. Conidia were found in actin- and Lamp1-positive vesicles already after one hour of infection. Inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex significantly impaired conidial binding and disrupted the formation of actin-positive vesicles, confirming the essential role of Arp2/3-mediated actin remodeling in early stages of conidial uptake. A subset of internalized conidia was localized to Lamp1-positive phagolysosomes and accumulated over time. Interestingly, we have identified a small but consistent population of phagolysosomes decorated with actin patches, potentially resembling actin flashes. These structures were entirely abolished upon Arp2/3 inhibition, indicating active cytoskeletal remodeling at the phagolysosomal interface. Our findings provide the first mechanistic insights into A. terreus internalization by alveolar epithelial cells and establish Arp2/3-mediated actin dynamics as a key process in early host-pathogen interactions.

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes of two Alviniconcha species (A. adamantis and A. marisindica) to investigate the adaptations of this holobiont. Significant expansion of solute carrier families enhances nutrient transport between the two parties. Alviniconcha lacks complete methionine biosynthesis pathways, compensated by symbiont provisioning, highlighting host-symbiont metabolic complementarity. High myoglobin expression in gills, contradicting prior reports of hemoglobin, suggests myoglobin-mediated oxygen storage to mitigate fluctuating environmental oxygen. Spatial transcriptomics further delineated gill's functional zones on the gill filament responsible for symbiont digestion via phagocytosis in bacteriocytes, oxygen transport in secretory zones, and ciliary water flow regulation.

Because the tick microbiota represents a major factor that can potentially modulate the pathogen acquisition and transmission and might become a new control tool against ticks and tick-borne diseases, it is more than essential to identify the composition of the H. marginatum microbiota, its temporal dynamics and interactions (statistical association) between members of the tick microbiota. Methods: From monthly tick samplings performed in the same site between February to September 2022, 281 adult ticks H. marginatum were collected from horses. The microbiota composition was characterised using a high throughput sequencing approach. Different statistical analyses allowed us to assess the influence of several factors (month, season, tick sex) on the H. marginatum microbial communities and reveal potential interactions among members of these communities. Results: Apart of known obligate endosymbionts Francisella and Midichloria, and the hypothesised facultative endosymbiont (Rickettsia) that dominated the microbiota of H. marginatum, we detected Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Williamsia and Mycobacterium, usually described as commensal and/or environmental bacteria. The microbiota composition and bacterial networks differed between males and females, with males being more diverse and composed of more environmental bacteria. We reported several temporal shifts for both males and females into the microbiota composition and bacterial networks. The temporal shifts observed for females were more chaotic in terms of movements among nodes, compared to the male microbial communities that exhibited a more organised and stable dynamics. Conclusions: The influence of tick sex and time on the holobiont H. marginatum underlines the importance of the scale at which the study is conducted.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Although the components involved in T4P assembly and dynamics are largely conserved across divergent clades of bacteria, the mechanisms underlying T4P function and regulation differ significantly and remain poorly characterized outside of a select few model organisms. One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species Acinetobacter baylyi localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway. We show FimX directly interacts with the Pil-Chp histidine kinase ChpA which likely influences Pil-Chp signaling and the subsequent positioning of T4P machines.

However, while both enzymes are members of the flavoprotein amine oxidoreductase (FAO) family, they share only 26% sequence identity and are evolutionarily distant. Furthermore, nearly all FAOs (including LHNO) have a conserved lysine proximal to N5 of the flavin that is known to promote the reaction with O2 in the oxidative half-reaction, yet NctB, unusually, has a glutamate (Glu292) at this position. We report here using transient kinetics that NctB reacts rapidly with dioxygen in the oxidative half-reaction despite lacking the conserved lysine associated with promoting the reaction with O2 in FAO family enzymes. Mutagenesis reveals that a lysine derived from a different sequence position (Lys331) likely accelerates the reaction with dioxygen in NctB, as the K331M mutation results in a 1400-fold decrease in rate constant for reaction with O2. Glu292 forms a salt bridge with Lys331 in the structure of NctB, and a E292T mutation results in a ~80-fold decrease in rate constant for reaction with O2, suggesting that Glu292 optimizes the positioning and/or properties of Lys331 to promote dioxygen activation. Analysis of pH-rate effects in NctB shows similar pH profiles as in LHNO despite having differences in active site structure.

In particular, models based on Hi-C and its single-cell variants, such as scHi-C, have gained widespread popularity. Current approaches for reconstructing the chromatin structure from scHi-C data typically operate by processing one scHi-C map at a time, generating a corresponding 3D chromatin structure as output. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to the whole genome 3D chromatin structure reconstruction that builds upon existing methods while incorporating the broader context of dynamic cellular processes, such as the cell cycle or cell maturation. Our approach integrates scHi-C contact data with single-cell trajectory information and is based on applying simultaneous modeling of a number of cells ordered along the progression of a given cellular process. The approach is able to successfully recreate known nuclear structures while simultaneously achieving smooth, continuous changes in chromatin structure throughout the cell cycle trajectory. Although both Hi-C-based chromatin reconstruction and cellular trajectory inference are well-developed fields, little effort has been made to bridge the gap between them. To address this, we present ChromMovie, a comprehensive molecular dynamics framework for modeling 3D chromatin structure changes in the context of cellular trajectories. To our knowledge, no existing method effectively leverages both the variability of single-cell Hi-C data and explicit information from estimated cellular trajectories, such as cell cycle progression, to improve chromatin structure reconstruction.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Most studies have focused on rigid, well-folded motifs, leaving the structurally heteregeneous, and biologically ubiquitous, flexible RNAs underexplored. To address this gap, we performed molecular dynamics simulation of three RNAs spanning the structural continuum: an unstructured poly-uridylic tract (rU30), a semiflexible cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat, and the tightly folded Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV) pseudoknot. Despite carrying nearly identical net charge, their ion atmospheres diverge strikingly. rU30 envelops itself in a diffuse Mg2+ environment retained through two or more hydration shells, whereas the CAG repeat and pseudoknot favor more localized outer-sphere Mg2+ binding. In contrast, Ca2+ tends to form inner-sphere contacts with all three RNAs, regardless of their folds. Remarkably, the diffuse ion clouds around unstructured RNAs extend farther into solution than that of the folded RNAs, significantly broadening their electrostatic sphere of influence. Nonetheless, the ion exchange kinetics remain virtually unchanged, demonstrating a surprising decoupling between spatial distribution and dynamical turnover.

Our data and a simple model suggest that maximizing marker detection is key to achieving the limits set by chemical labeling efficiency. A factor limiting the marker detection probability when using conventional DNA-PAINT markers is docking strand site-loss, observed over the duration required to build up the image data of MINFLUX acquisitions, which also limits the achievable number of labeling site visits to values around 1-3. Using repeat DNA-PAINT, i.e. employing oligonucleotide sequences with repeated docking sites, we observed greatly reduced site-loss and could increase the number of individual visits to site locations by more than threefold over the same period.

For reasons that are not well understood, females are roughly 60% as likely as males to develop GBM, and female patients consistently respond better to treatment than do males. Understanding the molecular etiology of these sex differences in tumor progression and resiliency to treatment could reveal potent new therapeutic targets, ultimately improving survival of both male and female GBM patients. Here we show that the transcription factor Egr1 is a primary mediator of sex differences in multiple GBM tumorigenic phenotypes. In multivariate analysis, high levels of EGR1 expression are correlated with shortened survival for male GBM patients only. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this sex difference, we performed a genomic analysis in our established ex vivo murine model of sex differences, which showed that the transcription factors Egr1 and Klf5 preferentially recruit the transcriptional activator Brd4 to enhancers in male cells relative to female cells, explaining a previously made observation that Brd4 inhibitors reverse sex differences in GBM. Next, using murine and human primary GBM cells, we demonstrated that the small molecule compound SR18662, which downregulates Egr1 and its downstream target Klf5, abrogates GBM growth, migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and response to radiation in a sex-biased fashion. Finally, we knocked down Egr1 and Klf5 via CRISPRi in both untreated and SR18662-treated GBM cells to reveal the sex-biased anti-tumorigenic effects of SR18662 were largely due to Egr1 downregulation, independent of Klf5 downregulation. This result was replicated in vivo. Our results strongly indicate that an Egr1 regulon is a key determinant of sex differences in GBM.

Chromatin profiling revealed extensive genome-wide overlap in sites occupied by RUNX1 and PTBP1, with significant enrichment at promoters of actively transcribed genes. Loss of PTBP1 in AML cells led to widespread alterations in RNA splicing and decreased expression of genes whose promoters are bound by both factors, including metabolic genes. In agreement with these findings, we found that loss of PTBP1 reduced glycolysis and glucose uptake and ultimately caused cell death. Based on our data, we propose that the interaction between RUNX1 and PTBP1 facilitates expression of metabolic proteins essential for leukemia cell growth and survival.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "QuPath, an open-source digital pathology platform, has gained widespread use for image analysis in biomedical research since its release in 2016. However, its reproducibility and reliability compared to commercial software, such as HALO, requires further validation, particularly for multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) analysis. In this study, we performed a direct comparison of QuPath and HALO using a mIF-stained prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) inclusive of 192 unique cores. We evaluated performance across three key analytical modules: immune cell phenotyping, tumor infiltration with immune cells, and nearest neighbor analysis. Furthermore, we integrated QuPath with CytoMap, an open-source spatial analysis tool, to perform unsupervised clustering of immune cell infiltration-a feature not available in HALO. Our results demonstrated high concordance between two platforms, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.89 for immune cell density, distance and pattern of cell organization in tumor microenvironment (TME). A neighborhood analysis using CytoMap was further performed and provided a more detailed spatial analysis of immune cell distribution across different prostate cancer grades. A significant increase of CD103+ T cell infiltration into TME was observed in prostate cancer, which might be associated with the expression level of its ligand (E-cadherin) in the tumor region. In conclusion, our findings validate QuPath as a robust and reproducible alternative to commercial platforms for fluorescence-based digital pathology. By demonstrating QuPath capability to perform high-quality quantitative analysis with additional flexibility for integration with external tools, our study underscores its potential for advancing tumor microenvironment research in translational oncology.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii has been engineered to use CO2 as the sole carbon source by integration of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, based on its native methanol assimilating xylulose monophosphate pathway (XuMP) cycle. Initial growth rates were low, but could be doubled by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Beneficial mutations led to a decrease of CBB cycle reactions, indicating further limitations. During this study, temperature was identified as one of the key process parameters to improve autotrophic growth. For this reason, a new round of adaptive laboratory evolution was performed at the identified optimal cultivation temperature of 25{degrees}C, resulting in isolates growing up to 50 % faster compared to the control strain. Whole genome resequencing followed by reverse engineering helped to identify first key mutations of the evolved strains. In addition, targeted engineering was performed by increasing the copy number of the key gene of the CBB cycle RuBisCO, which is the bottleneck of carbon fixation. Combining this with the optimal cultivation temperature boosted maximum specific growth rates of the autotrophic K. phaffii strain. In comparison to ALE, the targeted engineering still is lagging behind a bit. Starting from the initial condition, growth was boosted more than 2.5-fold in this study to a maximum of 0.025 h-1.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

We previously established a murine model of sepsis survival induced by cecal ligation and puncture which results in enhanced lung injury responses to lipopolysaccharide. In this model, classical monocytes from post-sepsis mice display persistently enhanced cytokine expression after lipopolysaccharide. To test the hypothesis that inflammatory reprogramming of monocytes mediates enhanced lung injury in post-sepsis mice, depletion and/or adoptive transfer was performed three weeks and three months after sepsis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic pathways associated with monocyte reprogramming and shifts in novel monocyte subsets were determined after sepsis in mice and humans. Monocytes from post-sepsis mice mediated enhanced LPS-induced lung injury and promoted neutrophil degranulation. Prior sepsis enhanced JAK-STAT signaling and AP-1 binding in monocytes, shifting toward the neutrophil-like monocyte subset and their progenitors. Similar neutrophil-like monocyte shifts were observed in adult sepsis patients and monocyte counts were predictive of 90-day mortality. We conclude that sepsis induces inflammatory memory affecting bone marrow progenitors and monocyte subsets predisposing to lung injury. These observations serve as a foundation for future investigations on neutrophil-like monocytes and inflammatory program interaction in tissue injury responses.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), an essential enzyme in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, has emerged as a promising antimicrobial target. However, no structural information has been available for the gonococcal enzyme (NgUPPS), and known ligand scaffolds remain limited, hindering structure-based drug discovery efforts. Here, we present a combined weak affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry (WAC-MS) and crystallographic pipeline to identify and structurally characterize fragment binders of NgUPPS. WAC-MS screening of a diverse fragment library identified 23 putative binders, 16 of which were successfully co-crystallized with NgUPPS, primarily via soaking into preformed apo crystals. The resulting high-resolution structures mapped fragment binding across four distinct regions of the enzyme's hydrophobic tunnel, encompassing the pyrophosphate-binding pockets and the distal product-binding site. Additionally, we determined the co-crystal structure of NgUPPS with BPH-1100, a known phthalic acid-based UPPS inhibitor, revealing that the enzyme adopts an open, ligand-competent conformation without significant rearrangement. Our results validate NgUPPS as a structurally tractable antibacterial target and provide a strong foundation for fragment-based optimization and the future development of novel inhibitors to combat drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

MgdE undergoes nuclear translocation via two nuclear localization signals, KRIR108-111 and RLRRPR300-305, and interacts with ASH2L and WDR5, two subunits of the host histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex. This interaction suppresses histone H3 lysine 4(H3K4) methylation-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, including il6 and il1{beta}, thereby promoting mycobacterial survival in both macrophages and mice. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that a bacterial nucleomodulin facilitates intracellular survival by directly targeting the host COMPASS complex.

HCV infection often causes the accumulation of large LDs in hepatocytes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HCV-induced large LD formation is poorly understood. It has been reported that the SPG20/Spartin protein associates with the LD surface and plays a crucial role in LD turnover by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase Itch to promote the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of adipophilin (ADRP), which protects LDs from lipase-mediated degradation. To elucidate the mechanism underlying HCV-induced large LD formation, we investigated the SPG20 protein's role in LD formation in HCV J6/JFH1-infected Huh-7.5 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that HCV infection promoted SPG20 protein cleavage. Transfection of increasing amounts of NS3/4A, but not the inactive NS3/4A mutant, resulted in SPG20 cleavage, implicating the NS3/4A protease in this cleavage. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that the NS3/4A protease cleaves SPG20 at Cys504 and Cys562. The SPG20 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the LD-attached protein TIP47. Increasing amounts of NS3/4A protease, but not inactive NS3/4A, decreased the co-precipitation of SPG20 with TIP47. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Itch in Huh-7.5 cells restored ADRP levels, suggesting that Itch mediates ubiquitylation-dependent ADRP degradation. Immunofluorescence staining of HCV-infected cells revealed that ADRP was localized mainly around LDs in HCV-infected cells, whereas cytosolic ADRP was decreased. We propose that the HCV NS3/4A protease specifically cleaves SPG20 and inhibits Itch-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of LD-associated ADRP, thereby promoting the formation of large LDs.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

The Gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii and protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus are unique in being able to replicate within the mature phagolysosomal compartment of host cells, though the exact mechanisms utilised to withstand this hostile environment are not clearly defined. We recently reported that C. burnetii removes the lysosomal protease cathepsin B during infection of mammalian cells. Here, we aimed to determine if this virulence strategy was also employed by the intralysosomal pathogen, Leishmania mexicana. In contrast to C. burnetii, decreases in the activity of specific cathepsins were not detected in L. mexicana-infected host cells as determined using immunoblotting and protease activity-based probes. Co-infection of THP-1 macrophage-like cells with both pathogens resulted in a proteolytic and secretory phenotype consistent with C. burnetii infection, suggesting that C. burnetii-induced remodelling of the lysosome is not influenced by L. mexicana. The host cell proteome and secretome of L. mexicana infected cells was defined using mass spectrometry. This confirmed that, unlike C. burnetii, L. mexicana does not induce increased abundance of lysosomal proteins either intracellularly or in the extracellular milieu. Collectively, this study reveals that although C. burnetii and L. mexicana reside in a phagolysosomal intracellular niche, they employ divergent mechanisms to survive within this hostile compartment.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

UVC proves more potent than UVB, with Pestalotiopsis sp. showing significantly higher resistance than C. gloeosporioides isolates. Crucially, hyperspectral signatures correlated with resistance, revealing UVC-induced photopigment changes, biochemical disruption, and oxidative stress markers in sensitive isolates, contrasting with minimal perturbation in the resistant isolate. Machine learning accurately decoded these complex phenotypes for classification. This understanding enabled enhanced inactivation via optimized pulsed UVC and synergistic sonication.

Recombination plays an additional role in evolution by creating new allelic combinations. Organisms display species-specific crossover patterns, but how these patterns are established is poorly understood. Drosophila mauritana displays a differing recombination pattern compared to Drosophila melanogaster, with D. mauritiana experiencing a reduced centromere effect, the suppression of recombination emanating from the centromeres. To evaluate the contribution of the synaptonemal complex (SC) C(3)G protein to these recombination rate differences, the D. melanogaster allele was replaced with D. mauritiana c(3)G coding sequence. We found that the D. mauritiana C(3)G could interact with the D. melanogaster SC machinery to build full length tripartite SC and chromosomes segregated accurately, indicating sufficient crossovers were generated. However, the placement of crossovers was altered, displaying an increase in frequency of the centromere-proximal euchromatin indicating a decrease in the centromere effect similar to that observed in D. mauritiana. Recovery of chromatids with more than one crossover was also increased, likely due to the larger chromosome span now available for crossovers. As replacement of a single gene mediated a strong shift of one species crossover pattern towards another species, it indicates a small number of discrete factors may have major influence on species-specific crossover patterning. Additionally, it demonstrates the SC, a structure known to be required for crossover formation in many species, is likely one of these discrete factors.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Recent studies confirm its widespread presence at local spatial scales, however it remains unclear whether these local-scale dynamics are sufficient to maintain biodiversity across larger, landscape-level scales. While prior theoretical work has found that local NFD selection can indeed promote global coexistence, these studies only analyzed contiguous landscapes. In contrast, many ecosystems are not contiguous, but rather spatially fragmented or exhibit spatial variation in the local carrying capacity. Using a theoretical model based on the classic island framework, we show that in fragmented populations, NFD selection can paradoxically reduce coexistence and shorten fixation times, relative to neutrality. Fragmentation also produces a non-monotonic relationship between fixation time and population size, with diversity lowest at intermediate scales, in contrast to the classical species-area relationship. We show that these results persist in a multispecies modeling framework. We also develop a statistical test to detect whether NFD selection suppresses coexistence in fragmented systems, and apply it to a presence-absence dataset of avian species in the Ryukyu Islands, finding evidence that NFD selection indeed reduces biodiversity in this case. Together, our findings suggest that fragmentation can undermine the stabilizing effects of NFD selection, calling into question its generality as a mechanism for maintaining biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}

Although these methods are convenient for estimation and computational purposes, as it keeps the estimation tractable, they present a simplified version of a highly integrated and dynamic phenomenon. Change point dynamic functional connectivity (cpDFC) methods, which are far less commonly used, offer an alternative to swDFC approaches. In this study, we consider a classification task between controls and patients with eMCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, ADNI2 and ADNIGO. Our results indicate that the DFC methods are generally superior to the SFC methods when used as inputs into the classification model. Most importantly, we find that the cpDFC methods are generally superior to the widely used swDFC methods. We discuss how cpDFC methods offer many distinct advantages over swDFC methods, namely, the parsimony of network features and ease of interpretability. We validate the robustness and consistency of our results by testing the methods on an additional resting-state fMRI dataset of mild cognitive impairment patients. These findings call into question the validity of numerous fMRI studies that have utilized inferior approaches, such as SFC and swDFC, as inputs to classification models to predict various brain disorders. Finally, we present an ensemble model of the best models, which achieves an accuracy of 91.17% from leave-one-out cross-validation of subjects with eMCI.

While previous work systematically analyzed translational buffering in yeast, it remains unknown whether this is an intrinsic property of genes in mouse and human across cell types. To identify this phenomenon on a global scale and across different experimental conditions, we uniformly analyzed 1515 matched ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets from human and mouse tissues or cell lines. This resource enabled us to assess the potential of genes to exhibit translational buffering by comparative analysis of variation at ribosome occupancy and the RNA levels across cell types as well as by examining the relationship between mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. We demonstrate that translational buffering is a conserved property of genes using homologous gene pairs from humans and mice. Although the identified buffered genes show association with some intrinsic sequence features, our modeling results suggest that these alone are insufficient to predict translational buffering, highlighting the importance of cellular context in determining buffering. Further, genes exhibiting translational buffering have lower variation in protein abundance in cancer cell lines, primary human tissues and mouse samples. We also observed that translationally buffered genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient and triplosensitive suggesting a demand for stringent dosage limits in these genes. We hypothesize two models of translational buffering, namely \"differential accessibility model\" and \"change in translation initiation rate model\". Our experiment suggests that some transcripts conform to the former and others align with the alternate model. Overall, our work broadens the catalog of genes subjected to translational buffering, underscores the characteristics of genes that demonstrate this phenomenon and additionally provides an insight into the rationale driving this effect.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": ""}
