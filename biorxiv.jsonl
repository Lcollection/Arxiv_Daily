Here we show that exonuclease-resistant RNA structures (xrRNAs) from Flaviviruses can be used to protect heterologous messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from 5'[-&gt;]3' degradation in budding yeast. Installation of xrRNAs ahead of a downstream internal ribosome entry site (IRES) leads to the accumulation of partially-degraded mRNAs that are substrates for cap-independent translation of a LacZ reporter, yielding a 30-fold increase in measured {beta}-galactosidase activity. Additionally, by monitoring the translation of dual-luciferase reporters we show that xrRNA sequences do not interfere with the progression of an elongating ribosome. Combined these data indicate that xrRNA elements can be used in creative ways to stabilize RNAs with potentially useful applications.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

This principle is thought to guide human decision-making, but the nature of this guidance is not known. Here we used preregistered behavioral experiments to show that people tend to prefer the simpler of two alternative explanations for uncertain data. These preferences match predictions of formal theories of model selection that penalize excessive flexibility. These penalties emerge when considering not just the best explanation but the integral over all possible, relevant explanations. We further show that these simplicity preferences persist in humans, but not in certain artificial neural networks, even when they are maladaptive. Our results imply that principled notions of statistical model selection, including integrating over possible, latent causes to avoid overfitting to noisy observations, may play a central role in human decision-making.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

E.; Nasr, S.; Weiskopf, N.; Trampel, R.", "abstract": "Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods are a versatile tool to retrieve information from neurophysiological data obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Since fMRI is based on measuring the hemodynamic response following neural activation, the spatial specificity of the fMRI signal is inherently limited by contributions of macrovascular compartments that drain the signal from the actual location of neural activation, making it challenging to image cortical structures at the spatial scale of cortical columns and layers. By relying on information from multiple voxels, MVPA has shown promising results in retrieving information encoded in fine-grained spatial patterns. We examined the spatial specificity of the signal exploited by MVPA. Over multiple sessions, we measured ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in human primary visual cortex (V1) with different acquisition techniques at 7 T. For measurements with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast, we included both gradient echo- (GE-BOLD) and spin echo-based (SE-BOLD) sequences. Furthermore, we acquired data using the vascular-space-occupancy (VASO) fMRI technique, which is sensitive to cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes. We used the data to decode eye-of-origin from signals across cortical layers. While ocularity information can be decoded with all imaging techniques, laminar profiles reveal that macrovascular contributions affect all acquisition methods, limiting their specificity across cortical depth. Therefore, although MVPA is a promising approach for investigating the mesoscopic circuitry of the human cerebral cortex, careful consideration of macrovascular contributions is needed that render the spatial specificity of the extracted signal.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Although G4s have been extensively studied in eukaryotes, their presence and function in archaea remain poorly characterized. In this study, a genome-wide analysis of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii identified over 5,800 potential G4-forming sequences.

However, most of this sequence data is unassembled, or where assembled was done so with no consistent assembler or quality control. Although this data has great potential, these inconsistencies make it unsuitable for large-scale analyses, and inaccessible for most researchers to reuse. Therefore in our previous effort, we released a uniformly assembled set of 661,405 genomes, consisting of all publicly available whole genome sequenced bacterial isolate data up to a cutoff of November 2018, enriched with various search indexes to make the data easier to sort and use. In this study, we first extend the dataset up to August 2024 with the same consistent assembly pipeline, more than tripling the number of genomes available. We also expand the scope of the dataset beyond genomes, as we begin a global collaborative project to generate annotations, species-specific analyses, evolutionary data, new search indices, and protein structural data. Our collaboration is therefore grass-roots, driven by the needs of different research communities within microbiology. In this paper, we describe the project as of release 2024-08, comprising 2,440,377 assemblies. All 2.4 million genomes have been uniformly reprocessed for quality criteria and to give taxonomic abundance estimates with respect to the GTDB phylogeny. We further enrich the dataset with sequence annotations from Bakta, antimicrobial resistance predictions from AMRFinderPlus, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions for the 17.7M hypothetical proteins. By applying an evolution-informed compression approach, the full set of genomes is just 130Gb: a reduction of about 23x compared to compressing individual assemblies. To make the resource as accessible as possible, we also provide multiple search indexes, a method for alignment to the full dataset, and cloud-based access to all the genomes.

Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, finger versus hand movements, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

This challenge can be tackled from two angles: by directed evolution, based on labor-intensive experimental testing of enzyme variant libraries, or by computational methods, where sequence-function data are used to predict biocatalyst improvements. Here, we combine both approaches into a two-week workflow, where ultra-high throughput screening of a library of imine reductases (IREDs) in microfluidic devices provides not only selected hits, but also long-read sequence data linked to fitness scores of >17 thousand enzyme variants. We demonstrate engineering of an IRED for chiral amine synthesis by mapping functional information in one go, ready to be used for interpretation and extrapolation by protein engineers with the help of machine learning (ML). We calculate position-dependent mutability and combinability scores of mutations and comprehensively illuminate a complex interplay of mutations driven by synergistic, often positively epistatic effects. Interpreted by easy-to-use regression and tree-based ML algorithms designed to suit the evaluation of random whole-gene mutagenesis data, 3-fold improved hits obtained from experimental screening are extrapolated further to give up to 23-fold improvements in catalytic rate after testing only a handful of designed mutants. Our campaign is paradigmatic for future enzyme engineering that will rely on access to large sequence-function maps as profiles of the way a biocatalyst responds to mutation. These maps will chart the way to improved function by exploiting the synergy of rapid experimental screening combined with ML evaluation and extrapolation.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

We discovered that the cytoplasmic PPTase aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase phosphopantetheinyl transferase (AASDHPPT) is required for mitochondrial respiration and oxidative metabolism. Loss of AASDHPPT results in failed 4'PP modification of the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein and blunted activity of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. We found that in addition to its cytoplasmic localization, AASDHPPT localizes to the mitochondrial matrix via an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence contained within the first 20 amino acids of the protein. Our data show that this novel mitochondrial localization of AASDHPPT is required to support mtFAS activity and oxidative function. We further identify five variants of uncertain significance in AASDHPPT that are likely pathogenic in humans due to loss of mtFAS activity.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to thalamus via CT neurons does not arrange tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear what prevents them from acquiring more information. Past work argued that E. coli's chemosensing is limited by the physics of molecules stochastically arriving at cells' receptors, without direct evidence. Here, we show instead that E. coli are far from this physical limit. To show this, we develop a theoretical approach that uses information rates to quantify how accurately behaviorally-relevant signals can be estimated from available observations: molecule arrivals for the physical limit; chemotaxis signaling activity for E. coli. Measuring these information rates in single-cell experiments across multiple background concentrations, we find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than the physical limit. Thus, E. coli chemosensing is limited by internal noise in signal processing rather than the physics of molecule diffusion, motivating investigation of what specific physical and biological constraints shaped the evolution of this prototypical sensory system.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we developed \"SuccessRatePower\" a free and user-friendly power calculator based on Monte Carlo simulations that takes into account the particular parameters of these experimental designs. Using \"SuccessRatePower\", we demonstrated that statistical power can be increased by modifying the experimental protocol in three ways: 1) reducing the probability of succeeding by chance (chance level), 2) increasing the number of trials used to calculate subject success rates, and in some circumstance, 3) employing statistical analyses suited for discrete values. These adjustments enable even studies with small sample sizes to achieve high statistical power.

The message is that brain activity is what differentiates subjects, or what makes a neural fingerprint \"unique\". In EEG- and MEG-derived FC fingerprinting, the activity recorded at the sensors is usually projected back into cortical sources by means of an inverse model depending on head and brain shapes, sensor locations, and tissue conductivity, and further reduced in dimension to obtain time series of regional activity, used to compute FC. We think that the role of the head model in fingerprinting has been so far dismissed by means of suboptimal or incomplete tests.

We hypothesized that the frequent, user-driven content shifts inherent to short-video watching impair event segmentation-a cognitive process critical for organizing continuous experience into discrete, episodic memory. To investigate this hypothesis, we combined behavioral memory tasks, eye-tracking, and self-report questionnaires. Study 1 (N=113) revealed that exposure to randomly selected short videos impaired subsequent memory for continuous movies. This impairment was not observed following exposure to personalized short videos, nor was it present in trial-based static image encoding tasks (Study2, N=60), suggesting a selective disruption of continuous memory encoding. Intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis of eye movements revealed decreased synchronization at event boundaries during movie watching after exposure to random short videos. Furthermore, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis indicated that this exposure led to more fragmented event segmentation during continuous memory encoding. In contrast, while pupil size and gaze moving speed were sensitive to event boundaries, these metrics were not modulated by prior short video watching, indicating the disruption is specific to the segmentation process itself and not to lower-level boundary detection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a negative impact of certain short video watching habits on event segmentation and subsequent memory, underscoring the powerful role of platform algorithms in shaping human cognition.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

The myosin chaperone UNC-45 and its binding partners, Hsp90 and Hsp70, are required for the initial folding of the myosin head domain and the assembly of myosin into thick filaments. There is increasing evidence that the UNC-45 system has an important role during aging to preserve sarcomere organization. Its decline may be a key factor in sarcopenia. Unlike skeletal muscle, the UNC-45 system in cardiac muscle in aging heart has not been examined extensively. Here we show that Unc45b and Hsp70 are localized to sarcomeric Z-discs in the mouse heart. We further show that during aging, there is a decline in the levels of myosin heavy chain, Unc-45b and Hsp70, but not Hsp90. While the decrease in Unc45b appears to be at the mRNA level, the decrease in the levels of myosin and Hsp70 were not at the mRNA but at the protein level. We have reported that in skeletal muscle, there is a decline in both Unc45b and Hsp90, and here we show that there is no such decline of Hsp70 in skeletal muscle. Hsp70 levels also did not decline with age in the brain or the liver. This heart-specific decrease of Hsp70 through its function as an Unc45b/Hsp70 complex might account for the age-dependent worsening of cardiomyopathies, and through Hsp70s multiple Unc-45b-independent functions, affect the folding and assembly of many other proteins in the aging heart.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

After entering the nucleus, the HIV genome accumulates in nuclear niches where it undergoes reverse transcription and integrates into neighboring chromatin, promoting high transcription rates and new virus progeny. Despite antiretroviral treatment, viral genomes can persist in these nuclear niches and reactivate upon treatment interruption, raising the possibility that they could play a role in the establishment of viral reservoirs. The post-nuclear entry dynamics of HIV remain unclear, and understanding these steps is critical for revealing how viral reservoirs are established. In this study, we elucidate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and the domains of CPSF6 essential for this process. We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging nuclear speckles in the presence of the HIV capsid. We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions (LCRs) modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains (MCDs) of CPSF6. Interestingly, the FG peptide facilitates viral replication. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host. Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

We then introduce humanized transgenic mouse lines harboring the full non-coding sequence of the human PrP gene as tools for identifying human sequence-targeted drugs. We identify a highly potent siRNA sequence against the human PrP gene and determine that a chemical scaffold incorporating extended nucleic acid and a 3' antisense tail unmatched to the RNA target yields desirable potency. Finally, we undertake manufacturing and toxicology studies to support regulatory clearance to initiate clinical trials, thus nominating PrP-lowering divalent siRNA 2439-s4 as a clinical development candidate for the treatment of human prion disease.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Molecular and functional characterization of M protein variants and their interactions with host components is crucial for understanding streptococcal pathogenesis and vaccine development. The M3 protein is produced by the prevalent emm3 GAS serotype, which is frequently associated with severe invasive diseases. Here we characterize the interaction of M3 with human collagens through detailed structural and biochemical binding analysis. High-resolution structures of the N-terminal M3 domain in the free state as well as bound to a collagen peptide derived from the Collagen Ligands Collection reveal a novel T-shaped protein fold that presents binding sites complementing the characteristic topology of collagen triple helices. The structure of the M3/collagen peptide complex explains how emm3 GAS and related streptococci, such as the emerging human pathogen Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, can target collagens to enable colonization of various tissues. In line with this, we demonstrate that the M3/collagen interaction promotes enhanced biofilm formation of emm3 GAS in an emm type specific manner, which can be inhibited with the recombinant M3 N-terminal domain fragment. Further, emm3 GAS are shown to colocalize with collagen in tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, where GAS biofilms are common. This observation is reproduced in infected organotypic skin models. Together, these data provide detailed molecular insights into an important streptococcal virulence mechanism with implications for the understanding of invasive infections, strategies for treating biofilm and M-protein based vaccine design.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) harboring JAK2WT or the MPN-driver JAK2V617F (heterozygous, JAK2V617FHET, or homozygous, JAK2V617FHOM), we identified zygosity-dependent transcriptional profiles in iPSC-derived EC (iEC) at baseline and following interferon-alpha (IFN) treatment. JAK2V617FHET iEC exhibited an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) signature, while JAK2V617FHOM iEC showed suppression of translation and ribosome biogenesis. Leveraging iPSC-based 3D assembloids that mimic the bone marrow (BM) niche, we showed that JAK2V617F-driven EndMT is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and IFN. In both JAK2V617F-driven polycythemia vera and TPO-driven myelofibrosis murine models, scRNA-seq analysis of the BM vascular niche consistently revealed inflammatory and EndMT-associated signatures in arterial and arteriolar EC. Notably, dysregulation of ribosome- and translation-related pathways emerged in the myelofibrosis model and at advanced disease stages in JAK2V617F-driven polycythemia vera, indicating progressive vascular remodeling with disease evolution. Chronic pegylated IFN treatment in vivo effectively reversed these pathological changes. IFN's anti-EndMT activity was further validated in BM biopsies from MPN patients undergoing IFN therapy. This is the first study to define MPN stage-dependent vascular remodeling and zygosity-specific endothelial effects of JAK2V617F, and to directly link IFN-mediated EndMT inhibition as a novel antifibrotic mechanism.

Here we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission.

This study investigates the visual abilities of the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), a European mountain bird highly vulnerable to collisions. Using an integrative approach, we assessed key visual components including visual field configuration, spatial resolution, contrast sensitivity, and spectral sensitivity. Behavioral assays revealed that black grouse have an extensive visual field with a wide binocular overlap and minimal blind spots, allowing for efficient predator detection and foraging. However, their spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity are relatively low, consistent with other prey species. Molecular analyses identified four cone opsins (SWS1, SWS2, Rh2, and LW) with spectral sensitivities spanning ultraviolet to long wavelengths (393 to 546 nm). These findings highlight the black grouse's ability to detect UV light, likely aiding in food detection.

MinD has also been shown to bind DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner and to tether plasmid DNA to liposomes. A role for the Min system in chromosome segregation has been proposed, whereby repeated, transient membrane-tethering events mediated by MinD could help prevent backward movements of the duplicated chromosomes once entropic forces weaken. However, the contribution of the other Min proteins to DNA binding has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DNA binding is strongly enhanced when MinD and MinC form a complex, while MinE and FtsZ (at high concentrations) interfere with this binding. We reveal a critical role for the linker connecting MinC N- and C-terminal domains in both DNA binding and inhibition of FtsZ polymerization. E. coli strains expressing MinC linker variants from the native locus, in combination with the alpha subunit of HU tagged with GFP, display chromosomes that appear more spread throughout the cell. This phenotype could reflect reduced compaction, chromosome segregation defects, or a combination of both.

The roles of Sxi1 and Sxi2a in unisexual reproduction are not fully understood. To elucidate the functions of Sxi1 and Sxi2a in unisexual reproduction and downstream transcriptional regulation, we first applied AlphaFold3 to predict their structures, which revealed the potential for both heterodimeric and homodimeric complexes. We subsequently deleted SXI1 and SXI2a in the hyper-filamentous self-fertile C. deneoformans strains XL280 and XL280a. Disruption of these genes did not result in noticeable defects in vegetative growth, virulence-associated traits, colony morphology, sporulation, or competitiveness during unisexual crosses. Interestingly, both bilateral (mutant x mutant) and unilateral (mutant x wildtype) crosses involving the sxi1{Delta} mutant significantly increased - cell fusion efficiency, suggesting a previously unrecognized inhibitory role for Sxi1 in regulating same-sex cell fusion. Transcriptomic analysis of sxi1{Delta} and sxi2a{Delta} mutants led to the identification of unique subsets of genes negatively regulated by each transcription factor during unisexual reproduction.

NUT carcinoma is caused by bromodomain-containing NUTM1 fusion oncogenes, most commonly BRD4::NUTM1. BRD4::NUTM1 recruits p300 to acetylate H3K27 forming expansive stretches of hyperacetylated chromatin called megadomains with the overexpression of encapsulated oncogenes, including MYC. We hypothesized that transcriptional dysregulation caused by BRD4::NUTM1 would lead to the generation of cancer-specific antigens that could be therapeutically actionable. Methods: We integrated genomics, immunopeptidomics, computational antigen prediction software, and gain/loss-of-function genetic experiments on a panel of cell lines (N=5), a patient derived xenograft, a tissue microarray (N=77), and on patient samples from the Tempus AI Sequencing Database harboring evidence of NUTM1 fusions (N=165). We also created an anti-PRAME425 T-cell receptor x SP34 anti-CD3 bispecific molecule modeled after the clinically tested IMC-F106C anti-PRAME425 T-cell receptor bispecific T-cell engager, and we applied this to NUT carcinoma cells in vitro. Results: We identified PRAME as the most commonly expressed cancer/testis antigen in patient samples harboring the three canonical NUT carcinoma fusions (BRD4::NUTM1, BRD3::NUTM1, and NSD3::NUTM1). Additionally, 56% (43/77) of NUT carcinoma tissue microarray samples stained positive for PRAME. Immunopeptidomics detected more PRAME-derived HLA ligands (N=9) than all other cancer/testis antigens combined (N=5). BRD4::NUTM1 expression in HEK 293T cells enhanced PRAME levels and BRD4::NUTM1 knockout in NUT carcinoma cells reduced PRAME levels. The anti-PRAME425 T-cell receptor x SP34 anti-CD3 bispecific molecule exhibited potent, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity against PRAME+ but not PRAME- NUT carcinoma cells in vitro. Conclusions: PRAME is highly expressed in NUT carcinoma and the most common oncoprotein causing NUT carcinoma, BRD4::NUTM1, contributes to these high PRAME levels. PRAME epitopes presented by HLA Class I are a previously unrecognized therapeutic vulnerability for NUT carcinoma that warrant clinical trials testing PRAME targeted immunotherapies in this neglected patient population.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

However, the empirical evidence for expectation suppression, as well as its underlying neural mechanism, is contentious. A further aspect of predictive coding that remains untested is how predictions are integrated across sensorimotor domains. To investigate these two questions, we employed a novel cross-domain probabilistic cueing paradigm, where participants were presented with both visual and motor cues within a single trial. These cues manipulated the orientation and temporal expectancy of target stimuli with 75% validity. Participants completed a reproduction task where they rotated a bar to match the orientation of the target stimulus while their neural and pupil responses were respectively measured via electroencephalography and eye tracking. Our results showed a consistent, feature-unspecific effect of motor expectancy across multiple measures, while evidence for visual expectancy was limited. However, neither motor nor visual expectancy modulated the fidelity of sensory representations. These results indicate that violations of temporal expectancy in the current study may reveal the brain's intrinsic sensitivity to temporal regularities in the natural settings, rather than feature-specific predictions. In contrast, the absence of visual expectancy effects in both neural and pupillometry results adds to a growing body of evidence questioning the effectiveness of probabilistic cueing paradigms for establishing expectations capable of altering sensory representations. Due to null findings in the visual and sensory representation analyses, we did not further investigate cross-domain prediction integration.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

To investigate shared and disorder-specific neurobiological impact of highly penetrant rare mutations in ASD and SCZ, we analyzed human single-nucleus whole-brain sequencing data to identify strongly affected brain cell types. Our analysis revealed Caudal Ganglionic Eminence (CGE)-derived GABAergic interneurons as a critical nexus for cognitive deficits across these disorders. Notably, genes within 22q11.2 deletions, known to confer a high risk of SCZ, ASD, and cognitive impairment, showed a strong expression bias toward vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing cells (VIP+) among CGE subtypes. To explore VIP+ GABAergic interneuron perturbations in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in vivo, we examined their activity in the Df(16)A+/- mouse model during a spatial navigation task and observed reduced activity along with altered responses to random rewards. At the population level, VIP+ interneurons exhibited impaired spatial encoding and diminished subtype-specific activity suggesting deficient disinhibition in CA1 microcircuits in the hippocampus, a region essential for learning and memory.

V.; Kursun, O.", "abstract": "Neurons throughout the neocortex exhibit selective sensitivity to particular features of sensory input patterns. According to the prevailing views, cortical strategy is to choose features that exhibit predictable relationship to their spatial and/or temporal context. Such contextually predictable features likely make explicit the causal factors operating in the environment and thus they are likely to have perceptual/behavioral utility. The known details of functional architecture of cortical columns suggest that cortical extraction of such features is a modular nonlinear operation, in which the input layer, layer 4, performs initial nonlinear input transform generating proto-features, followed by their linear integration into output features by the basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the upper layers. Tuning of pyramidal cells to contextually predictable features is guided by the contextual inputs their apical dendrites receive from other cortical columns via long-range horizontal or feedback connections. Our implementation of this strategy in a model of prototypical V1 cortical column, trained on natural images, reveals the presence of a limited number of contextually predictable orthogonal basis features in the image patterns appearing in the column's receptive field. Upper-layer cells generate an overcomplete Hadamard-like representation of these basis features: i.e., each cell carries information about all basis features, but with each basis feature contributing either positively or negatively in the pattern unique to that cell. In tuning selectively to contextually predictable features, upper layers perform selective filtering of the information they receive from layer 4, emphasizing information about orderly aspects of the sensed environment and downplaying local, likely to be insignificant or distracting, information. Altogether, the upper-layer output preserves fine discrimination capabilities while acquiring novel higher-order categorization abilities to cluster together input patterns that are different but, in some way, environmentally related. We find that to be fully effective, our feature tuning operation requires collective participation of cells across 7 minicolumns, together making up a functionally defined 150um diameter \"mesocolumn.\" Similarly to real V1 cortex, 80% of model upper-layer cells acquire complex-cell receptive field properties while 20% acquire simple-cell properties. Overall, the design of the model and its emergent properties are fully consistent with the known properties of cortical organization. Thus, in conclusion, our feature-extracting circuit might capture the core operation performed by cortical columns in their feedforward extraction of perceptually and behaviorally significant information.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Applying our model, JODIE, to 30,000 child-mother-father trios with phased DNA information from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and the Norwegian Mother, Father, Child Cohort (MoBa), we jointly estimate the phenotypic variance attributable to these four effects unbiased of assortative mating (AM) for height, body mass index (BMI) and childhood educational test score (EA). For all three traits, direct effects make the largest contribution to the genetic effect variance. But we find that parental indirect genetic effects make an equivalent combined contribution, and that there is a non-zero PofO effect variance for all traits. We calculate the heritability that would be obtained at the population-level in the absence of AM for common DNA loci, and show that the proportional contribution of direct effects to these heritability values can be calculated as 64.0% for EA in MoBa, 77.1% and 63.4% for height in MoBa and EstBB, and 81.2% and 88.0% for BMI in MoBa and EstBB. Additionally, using within-family genome-wide association testing, we identify 276 independently associated DNA regions that replicate across two additional biobanks, which all show a genotype-phenotype relationship that reflects an interplay of direct, indirect and PofO effects. Determining how direct, parental and PofO genetic effects combine across loci genome-wide to influence human phenotypic variation requires joint modeling of parental and child genotypes alongside the parental origin of loci and here, we make the first attempt to do this in the human population.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Early life forms, including prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, mostly display random configurations. Through the evolution of plants, global folding became the prominent architecture with eudicots and remained dominant. Animals, however, progressively developed stronger checkerboard throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution, and even during early embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved gene co-regulation mechanism.

Common techniques for microbial mutation rate estimation fall into 2 camps; rapid, locus specific, generally liquid-culture based fluctuation assays; and slow, genome-wide, generally solid-culture based mutation accumulation experiments. This constrains the hypotheses which can be tested, notably the mutagenic effects of liquid environments cannot be rapidly quantified at a genome-wide scale. One example of such effect is the negative association previously observed between population density and mutation rates at many marker loci using the fluctuation assay. Because homogeneous population density is specifically relevant in liquid culture, this association has not been tested at a truly genome-wide scale. We fill this methodological gap by developing a novel pipeline that relies on population sequencing to capture how mutation rates are affected by population density in liquid cultures. We simulate expected mutation counts in a growing population along with random sampling during sequencing to estimate the necessary sequencing coverage as [&ge;]1,000-fold. We then carry out PCR-free sequencing of 95 wildtype E. coli populations at this coverage, calling rare variants with both reference-based and reference-free methods. These variant-calling methods are prone to different sources of error which can be minimised by considering only mutations called by both pipelines. This approach identifies 119 mutations across all cultures, with (non)coding/(non)synonymous and mutational spectrum profiles consistent with being samples of spontaneous mutation unbiased by selection. The distribution of these mutations also supports the motivating hypothesis, finding that mutation counts across the genome are strongly negatively associated with population density. This demonstrates the utility of population sequencing for the rapid testing of many previously inaccessible evolutionary biology hypotheses.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

While 3D printing artificial substrates has been explored to mimic the physical structure of soil, it remains unclear which design parameters are critical for supporting full plant development. Here, we present a synthetic, soilless substrate based on 3D-printed hydrogels incorporating triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) patterns to create internal air-filled channels. These channels remain in contact with the atmosphere, enabling passive gas exchange throughout the substrate. We tested five TPMS geometries (Lidinoid, Split-P, Schwarz-D, Schwarz-P, and Schoen), each with an identical hydrogel volume but with different surface-to-volume ratios. Arabidopsis thaliana seeds germinated directly on the substrates and were monitored for vegetative and reproductive growth over five weeks. Among the designs, the Lidinoid substrate consistently led to the highest number and size of leaves and the earliest and most complete flowering, outperforming both hydroponics and unpatterned hydrogel controls. Our results indicate that the surface-to-volume ratio is a key parameter influencing substrate performance, likely due to its impact on oxygen availability at the root interface. Plants grown on substrates with higher surface areas transitioned to flowering more reliably and rapidly, with flowering efficiency showing a strong positive correlation with surface area. These findings suggest that vascular-like internal architectures can overcome the oxygen limitations of traditional hydroponic systems without requiring active aeration. This work supports the use of additive manufacturing as a powerful tool for engineering soil analogues tailored for indoor agriculture.

This study provides the first comprehensive review of DNA-based methods used globally to identify seafood species from the Eastern South Pacific Ocean. Historical and current techniques were systematically examined, with a focus on emerging technologies that offer promising applications in the field. Nearly three decades of research have enabled the successful identification of over 200 commercially valuable species using more than ten distinct DNA-based methods. Fish and mollusks constituted the most extensively studied seafood groups, with DNA sequencing emerging as the predominant technique. Furthermore, a global mislabeling meta-analysis, encompassing 1,806 seafood products from the Eastern South Pacific Ocean, revealed an estimated mislabeling rate of 24.8% (95% CI [22.9-26.9]). Notably, a substantial proportion of mislabeled and substituted products corresponds to highly threatened shark species. This raises serious conservation concerns, particularly given that nations bordering the Eastern South Pacific Ocean are major players in the global shark trade.

This process relies on an error-prone reverse transcriptase that specifically misincorporates bases opposite adenines in the RNA template. The resulting mutagenized complementary DNA then integrates into a homologous target gene to introduce mutations at adenine residues. Although the functions of core DGR components are well-defined, we still don't know how other cellular factors influence their activity. To address this, we reconstituted the DGR from the Bordetella phage BPP-1 in Escherichia coli. Our systematic analysis uncovered several cellular factors that influence its activity. By sequencing the cDNA, we discovered the reverse transcriptase is particularly mutagenic in the 5'-AAC-3' and 5'-ACC-3' contexts, which explains their abundance in natural DGR templates. A transposon sequencing screen identified both positive and negative regulators, including the single-stranded DNA exonuclease ExoI, which unexpectedly inhibits DGR activity through a nuclease-independent mechanism. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we found that DGR preferentially edits targets located near the replication origin and co-directionally oriented with replication. In the preferred orientation, the target sequence is located on the lagging-strand template, where the extended single-stranded DNA gap likely facilitates base pairing with the incoming complementary DNA. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of how DGRs function within the cellular context and enabled a 1000-fold improvement in editing efficiency, establishing a foundation for future targeted-mutagenesis applications.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

CBD-mediated decrease in high-frequency activity was mimicked by GPR55 antagonism and prevented by GPR55 deletion and blockade of GABAergic transmission. Dampening high-frequency activity was accompanied by increased recruitment of parvalbumin+ (PV)-INs and reduced recruitment of somatostatin+ (SST)-INs, leveraging the inhibitory subcircuit to limit propagation of hyperactivity. CBD-induced attenuation of high frequency spike propagation was mimicked by pharmacological enhancement and optogenetic engagement of PV-INs.

Despite the challenges of establishing reliable behavioral paradigms in macaques, we developed a robust discrimination task spanning six emotional categories, yielding strong, image-by-image behavioral correspondence between macaques and humans. By systematically comparing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to macaque behavior and IT neural data, we found that traditional action unit-xbased models fail to capture image-level behavioral structure, while ANNs with IT-like internal representations outperform all others. Neural recordings showed that the specific IT population responses (70-100 ms) carried the strongest predictive power for facial expression discrimination, underscoring the primacy of feedforward codes in guiding behavior. Expression coding in IT was significantly shaped by face-selective neurons that also encoded identity. This convergence points to a shared functional subspace in IT, where stable (identity) and dynamic (expression) information coexist along overlapping dimensions. Such an architecture moves beyond the classical view of segregated pathways, revealing a general coding principle by which IT flexibly supports multiple socially relevant functions within a common representational geometry.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Subregions of the auditory cortex process are thought to process harmonic stimuli differently, and secondary ACtx (A2) layer (L) 2/3 is believed to be the most selective. Selective responses to sound features in ACtx are thought to emerge hierarchically starting from A1 L4. Since the spectral complexity of harmonic stacks can range from two to more than ten components, harmonic selectivity and sensitivity might also arise hierarchically across layers and areas. We studied responses to simple and complex harmonic stacks across A1 L4, A1 L2/3, and A2 L2/3 in adult mice using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We found harmonic-sensitive neurons (HN) responding only to harmonic stacks but not to their pure-tone components in all areas at similar proportions. HNs showed non-linear processing of component tones with onset-responsive HNs showing greater nonlinearity, which decreased with harmonic complexity. Co-tuned HNs in A1 L4 exhibited the highest signal correlation, regardless of harmonic complexity. A1 L4 HNs also showed the lowest noise correlation with other neurons. Moreover, A1 L4 HNs achieve robust spectral integration and harmonic sensitivity by receiving diverse inputs and maintaining high signal correlation, ensuring independent, strong responses to harmonic stimuli. Therefore, harmonic sensitivity is present in A1 L4 and is not a unique feature of A2. Thus, tuning to complex spectral sounds is a fundamental property of ACtx and is already established in A1 L4.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Yet the neural strategies supporting this experience remain unclear. One fundamental component of this process is the formation of melody, a core structural element of music. Previous work on monophonic listening has provided strong evidence for the neurophysiological basis of melody processing, for example indicating predictive processing as a foundational mechanism underlying melody encoding. However, considerable uncertainty remains about how melodies are formed during polyphonic music listening, as existing theories (e.g., divided attention, figure-ground model, stream integration) fail to unify the full range of empirical findings. Here, we combined behavioral measures with non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) to probe spontaneous attentional bias and melodic expectation while participants listened to two-voice classical excerpts. Our uninstructed listening paradigm eliminated a major experimental constraint, creating a more ecologically-valid setting. We found that attention bias was significantly influenced by both the high-voice superiority effect and intrinsic melodic statistics. We then employed transformer-based models to generate next-note expectation profiles and test competing theories of polyphonic perception. Drawing on our findings, we propose a weighted-integration framework in which attentional bias dynamically calibrates the degree of integration of the competing streams. In doing so, the proposed framework reconciles previous divergent accounts by showing that, even under free-listening conditions, melodies emerge through an attention-guided statistical integration mechanism.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine how individual stochasticity in the production and social acquisition of knowledge influences the evolution of learning behaviors and cumulative knowledge. Using a mathematical model where learning is a stochastic process, we show that stochasticity in learning enhances cumulative knowledge by generating variability in knowledge levels: individuals who acquire more knowledge by chance are more likely to survive and reproduce, and therefore more likely to transmit their knowledge to the next generation. As knowledge accumulates, social learning exemplars tend to possess more of it, favoring greater investment of time in social learning. Because social learning provides access to substantial amounts of knowledge, selection favors the evolution of more effective learning, at the expense of a fecundity cost. Moreover, when knowledge enhances fecundity but not survival, we find that selection favors learning from parents rather than unrelated adults. This is because parenthood signals reproductive success and, therefore, a higher likelihood of possessing fecundity-enhancing knowledge, unlike random adults.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel as models of vision, they are typically static and fail to capture such dynamic, history-dependent effects. Here, we introduce SDNet, a model that explains how serial dependence arises from the mechanics of decision-making. SDNet integrates a standard CNN with a recurrent network that functions as a sequential evidence accumulator. We hypothesize that this bias is not a flaw or a feature for optimality, but a natural byproduct of the accumulator retaining a residual memory trace of past decisions. Without being directly fit to behavioral data, SDNet spontaneously reproduces the characteristic patterns of serial dependence from human orientation and numerosity judgment tasks. The model even captures a key feature of human perception: that the bias grows stronger as task difficulty increases. This work provides a concrete, neurally plausible mechanism for serial dependence, challenging theories that frame it as a purely optimal strategy. By showing how a fundamental perceptual bias emerges from an intrinsic property of a dynamic system, SDNet represents a significant advance in building more biologically realistic models of human vision.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Four public RNA-Seq datasets from GEO (GSE186063, GSE117769, GSE205748, and GSE221786) were used. Using an integrative strategy involving scientific text mining, functional enrichment, and biological curation, 433 genes with potential relevance to both conditions were selected. Based on this set, differential gene expression (DEG) analyses were performed, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene regulatory networks (GRN) were constructed, and hubs and master regulators (MRs) were identified. The integration of these approaches allowed the identification of shared inflammatory pathways, especially related to the IL-23/IL-17 axis, as well as disease-specific signatures. Functional analysis revealed enrichment in Th17 cell differentiation processes, lipopolysaccharide response, and activation of classical inflammatory pathways.

They can be derived from natural sources or designed de novo, with synthetic peptides offering distinct advantages in rational design unconstrained by natural sequences. While native PFPs have been targeted to specific organelles to modulate their functions, the potential of synthetic PFPs for organelle engineering remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the 28-amino acid synthetic peptides, SVG28 and its variant SVG28D2, can be selectively targeted to mitochondria for functional alteration. More specifically, molecular dynamics simulations first confirmed the structural stability of the SVG28 nanopore even when fused to the TOM20 transmembrane domain, a mitochondrial targeting sequence. In isolated lipid bilayers, TOM20-SVG28 formed pores with a 0.3-nS, conductance, or 1.0-nm pore. The expression efficiency was further enhanced by two amino acid substitutions (SVG28D2). In cells, both TOM20-SVG28 and TOM20-SVG28D2 localized to the mitochondria, induced morphological alterations, and reduced both membrane potential and ATP production. These observations in silico, in vitro and in cellulo collectively indicate that the synthetic SVG28 peptides self-assemble into pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, likely permitting proton permeation. Importantly, the matrix protein Su9 remained confined within mitochondria, suggesting preserved inner membrane integrity, and thus specific effect on the target.

Although grid codes effectively represent a current environment's geometry, their capacity to generalize across topologically analogous environments with different reward and state structures remains poorly understood. We introduce topology-aware grid coding (TAG), a computational theory that leverages topological invariance to generalize to new environments with the same topological structure but with different geometry. Drawing on the Euler characteristic from algebraic topology, TAG integrates complementary neural codes built on foundational grid bases: place codes serving as 0D vertices for self-localization, boundary codes acting as 1D edges to learn policy-independent grid codes through state prediction errors, and corner codes functioning as 2D faces for identifying topologically significant states. TAG grid codes remain stable under topology-preserving deformations yet discriminate among non-isomorphic structures. TAG develops policy-independent grid codes for novel structures more rapidly and robustly than existing approaches, balancing structure and policy encoding for multi-subgoal navigation without extensive planning.

Synaptic and circuit-level abnormalities are well documented in FXS and extensively studied in the Fmr1 KO mouse model. In CA1 hippocampal neurons functional, molecular and structural synaptic changes have been described yet the canonical form of Hebbian CA1 long term potentiation (LTP) remains intact in Fmr1 KO mice. Here we examined whether state-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1, in which prior priming activity modulates subsequent synaptic plasticity, was affected in Fmr1 KO mice. We found that NMDA receptor activation prior to LTP induction produced metaplastic inhibition of LTP, which was exaggerated in Fmr1 KO mice. This effect was mediated by the activity of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels which was enhanced after NMDA priming, and dampened dendritic excitability. Blocking SK channels during NMDA-primed LTP induction eliminated the abnormal metaplasticity in Fmr1 KO slices, implicating altered SK activity in the exaggerated LTP inhibition in Fmr1 KO mice. These finding reveal a disrupted coupling between NMDA receptors and SK channels in Fmr1 KO mice, which alters the impact of priming on LTP expression in the CA1.

Tryptophan (TRY) pathways are involved in pleiotropic physiological functions at the interface of brain-body connections. Preclinical evidence suggests that amphetamines may modulate these pathways and, thus, indirectly influence brain functions via persistent alterations of peripheral metabolites. However, little is known about alterations of TRY-related metabolites in the blood and their clinical implications in chronic users of MDMA and METH. Hence, we characterized serum levels of TRY-related metabolites in a comparative cross-sectional study including n=36 chronic MDMA users, n=33 chronic METH users, and n=71 sex-matched, stimulant-naive healthy controls (Ntotal=140). An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used to determine TRY metabolites. Combining metabolite levels, metabolic ratios, and network analysis we found robust evidence of divergent pathway alterations between METH and MDMA users. Chronic METH use was particularly associated with a depletion of serum TRY and serotonin levels, and a general activation of kynurenine pathways, while chronic MDMA use was linked to a selective activation of the OH-kynurenine metabolic branch. Metabolite changes were associated with the severity of psychopathology in the depression and psychosis domains across groups. Altogether, our findings demonstrate differential changes of serum TRY pathways in chronic MDMA and METH users. Persistent alterations of these pathways might contribute to the contrasting clinical profile of the substances and constitute a peripheral dimension of neurochemical plasticity with relevant implications for therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Monocyte subsets are known to expand in individuals with HIV, TB, or CAD. However, the precise mechanisms by which these cells contribute to inflammation and immune responses in the context of these conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed high dimensional mass cytometry to characterize monocyte heterogeneity in 61 Ugandan adults with varying combinations of HIV, latent TB, and subclinical or overt CAD. Through an integrative approach combining manual gating, unsupervised clustering, and elastic net penalization, we identified distinct monocyte phenotypes associated with CAD and TB. Importantly, individuals with CAD, especially those with more extensive disease (Segment Involvement Score >2), showed reduced surface expression of the anti-inflammatory scavenger receptor CD163 on non-classical monocytes. Notably, unsupervised clustering further revealed two distinct non-classical monocyte subsets associated with disease states: A CD86dim CX3CR1dim CD45RA+ GPR56+ CXCR3+ subset significantly depleted in individuals with CAD, and a CD86+ CX3CR1++ CD45RA++ GPR56- CD38- CXCR3- subset enriched in individuals with TB.

SNF identified two transdiagnostic subtypes in psychosis (subtype 1: n=158 SSD, n=75 BD; subtype 2: n=122 SSD, n=26 BD) that exhibited divergent patterns of abnormal cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Compared to controls (n=243), subtype 1 showed moderate enlargement of surface area in frontal and parietal areas and larger dorsal striatal volumes, whereas subtype 2 demonstrated markedly smaller surface areas in frontal and temporal areas and subcortical volumes, including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and ventral striatum. When comparing subtypes on clinical characteristics, subtype 2 had more severe negative symptoms, greater neuropsychological impairment, and lower estimated premorbid intellectual functioning compared to subtype 1. Integrating cell-type data imputed from gene expression in the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed an association between interregional reductions in surface area and layer 5 glutamatergic neuron abundance, critical for corticostriatal network connectivity and cognitive function, whereas reductions in cortical thickness spatially coupled with glia cell and interneuron abundance, in subtype 2.

Haploinsufficiency is considered the central disease-driving mechanism, but it remains unclear why vascular lesions are tissue-restricted. To investigate whether ACVRL1 gene dosage in human ECs plays a role in organ-specific susceptibility, we developed a tunable human in vitro model by deleting ACVRL1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and then reintroduced wild-type ACVRL1 under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. This enabled temporal, dose-dependent induction of ALK1 expression in ECs, allowing definition of threshold levels required to restore endothelial function and support vascular homeostasis. ALK1-deficient hiPSC-ECs displayed disrupted SMAD1/5 signaling, hyperproliferation, altered tip/stalk cell specification, and dysregulated transcriptional programs. Even low-level reinduction of ALK1 was sufficient to restore endothelial function, indicating threshold-dependence for ALK1 in vascular homeostasis. These data indicated that one mechanism underlying tissue-restricted prevalence of AVMs in vascular beds with low basal ACVRL1 expression, such as the liver, is a minimal requirement for ALK1 in sustaining EC functionality.

Discrepancies may indicate variations in electrode montage, stimulation site, measured fluency type, and individual cognitive profiles. In this preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study, 72 younger and 72 older adults received anodal tDCS to either the left inferior frontal gyrus (left IFG) or the left temporoparietal junction (left TPJ) while completing phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. Anodal stimulation of the left TPJ significantly improved phonemic fluency compared to sham (F(1,71) = 4.49, p = .038, with no effects observed for semantic fluency or left IFG stimulation. Additionally, stimulation response in the TPJ group was predicted by fluid intelligence, with lower scores associated with greater benefit (F(1,70) = 7.80, p = .007). Finally, stimulation to the left IFG improved response initiation but impaired sustained energization over the entire minute. These results suggest that the efficacy of focal tDCS for enhancing verbal fluency depends on both stimulation site and task demands, with the left TPJ showing selective benefits for phonemic fluency. Importantly, individual differences in fluid intelligence, but not age, moderated stimulation response, highlighting the role of cognitive capacity in neuromodulation outcomes.

Here, we identify a non-canonical role for the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex in safeguarding DNA replication during neurodevelopment. The NSL complex, which acetylates histone 4 at gene promoters and is mutated in Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS), prevents unscheduled R-loop accumulation at weakly transcribed promoters that are typically devoid of R-loops. Single-cell sequencing reveals that loss of NSL causes replisome stalling and delayed S-phase progression. Neural organoids derived from KdVS patients exhibit impaired DNA replication, developmental abnormalities, and reduced synapse formation, driven entirely by unscheduled R-loop accumulation. These findings reveal that faithful DNA replication is critical for early neurodevelopment.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Analyzing such data requires visualization and analysis tools that faithfully represent the deep, tree-like structures formed by developmental lineages. Popular Euclidean embedding methods, such as UMAP and t-SNE, as well as domain-specific approaches like PHATE, distort hierarchical relationships in low dimensions, leading to a decrease in performance with growing tree depth. Hyperbolic geometry, which can represent trees with high accuracy in low dimensions, provides a natural remedy. However, existing hyperbolic methods, such as Poincare Maps (PM), lose accuracy in deeper trees and require extensive feature engineering and memory. We present Contrastive Poincare Maps (CPM), a self-supervised hyperbolic encoder that leverages contrastive learning in hyperbolic space to efficiently learn robust low-dimensional representations from scRNA-seq data. On synthetic trees with up to 5 generations and 34,000 individuals, CPM cuts distortion by > 99% and requires 13-fold less memory relative to PM. We further demonstrate CPM's utility on three biological case studies. CPM uncovers accurate hierarchies across 9 developmental stages in the mouse gastrulation dataset comprising 116,312 cells, disentangles global multi-lineage hierarchies in the chicken cardiogenesis dataset while preserving intra-lineage developmental trends, and enables sampling-density-invariant hierarchical analysis in the mouse hematopoiesis dataset. By leveraging hyperbolic geometry in combination with contrastive learning, CPM delivers a scalable framework that preserves hierarchical dependencies in developmental lineages, accelerates exploratory data analysis and opens new avenues for biological insights into developmental processes using scRNA-seq data.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Across 61 models representing diverse targets, we find that short simulations (10-50 ns) can provide modest improvements for high-quality starting models, particularly by stabilizing stacking and non-canonical base pairs. In contrast, poorly predicted models rarely benefit and often deteriorate, regardless of their CASP difficulty class. Longer simulations (>50 ns) typically induced structural drift and reduced fidelity. Based on these findings, we provide practical guidelines for selecting suitable input models, defining optimal simulation lengths, and diagnosing early whether refinement is viable.

It is a critical component of the tumor microenvironment that plays an active role in tumor progression and modulation of tumor response to treatment. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer type characterized by one of the worst prognoses, as it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. It is also characterized by a very dense ECM, which hinders efficient drug delivery. In addition, PDACs are considered cold tumors as they fail to elicit a strong immune response, challenging the use of immunotherapy for PDAC cancer patients. Yet, the interplay between the ECM and immune cells within the PDAC tumor microenvironment remains poorly understood. Here, we employed ECM-focused proteomics to profile the ECM compositions of PDAC mouse models characterized by different levels of CD8+ T-cell infiltration. We found that CD8lo, or cold tumors, and CD8hi, or hot tumors, exhibited different ECM compositions. Interrogation of publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of human PDACs further revealed that the ECM proteins distinguishing hot and cold PDACs are secreted by multiple stromal cell populations, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, stellate cells, and macrophages. Last, we found that the expression of a subset of the genes encoding ECM proteins characteristic of the CD8lo phenotype correlated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in human PDAC samples and patient survival.

While gemcitabine-based regimes offer survival benefits, the acquired gemcitabine resistance leads to reoccurrence, metastasis and the long-term survival rate remains dismal. Although there is substantial clinical evidence for gemcitabine resistance, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving gemcitabine resistance remain largely unappreciated. Here, we reveal that Orai3, a Ca2+ selective channel, is a crucial driver of gemcitabine resistance. We demonstrate that Orai3 is upregulated in gemcitabine-resistant PC cells. Orai3 silencing in these cells decreases proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, enhances apoptosis, and moderates stemness characteristics. Notably, studies in zebrafish model corroborate the significance of Orai3 in gemcitabine resistance in vivo. Mechanistically, our unbiased RNA-seq analysis coupled with robust functional studies show that SLIT3 works downstream of Orai3 to drive gemcitabine resistance. Finally, we report that NFATc1 transcription factor bridges Orai3 to SLIT3 transcription. Taken together, this study identifies Orai3 as a key orchestrator of gemcitabine resistance and uncovers a unique Orai3-NFATc1-SLIT3 signaling module that drives chemoresistance.

While BBIs have been preserved in the legume (Fabaceae) and cereal (Poaceae), they have been lost in many other divergent lineages. However, their underlying molecular evolution and regulation of BBI remain largely uncharacterized. Our study shows that BBIs in legumes and cereals are encoded by two large and divergent gene families, with BBI genes in legumes have further diversified into two subfamilies with distinct gene expression patterns. Genes in one legume BBI subfamily are specifically expressed in seeds while BBI genes in the other legume subfamily and cereal do not have significant expressions in any examined tissues including seed, root, leaf and flower. The soybean BBI gene family shows evidence of expansion via whole genome, segmental and tandem duplication. Protein sequence and structural analysis predicts that functional domains for double-headed inhibitory loops and binding abilities to trypsin and chymotrypsin are largely preserved within the soybean BBI family. The seed-specific subfamily genes are specifically expressed at maturation stages and not at embryogenesis stages. The other, non-seed BBI subfamily genes are highly responsive to a distinct spectrum of signals related to abiotic and biotic stresses. Their specific expression under non-essential biological processes for plant growth and development suggests that, although BBIs have been retained in both cereals and legumes, likely due to their role in enhancing plant fitness under natural selection pressures, they are not involved in core developmental processes. This may explain why BBIs were lost in many divergent plant lineages and support their well-established roles in plant adaptation to environmental stress. Having knocked out the seed-specific BBIs through a CRISPR/Cas9 approach, we have successfully generated soybeans which exhibited 69.4 - 73.7% reduction of trypsin inhibitor activity and 76.4 - 79.4% reduced chymotrypsin inhibitor activity. The edited soybean did not show significant changes in key agronomic traits, supporting that the functions of BBIs are not essential. While BBIs in soybean seeds may have a desirable function in natural selection, they are antinutrients from an applied perspective for their use in feed and food. It provides an opportunity to reduce BBIs in seeds for quality improvement. Our findings provide insights into molecular evolution, regulation, and function of BBI in plants, and successfully demonstrate engineering BBI in seeds to result in production of food and feed of higher nutritional value with minimal impacts on the agronomic performance of the plant.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

While multiscale models have the potential to capture these interactions more accurately, they are often hindered by increased complexity and limited data availability. In this study, we develop a multiscale epidemic model linking host-vector population-level transmission dynamics to within-host and within-vector pathogen dynamics. Our model captures key features of within-vector viral progression and allows bidirectional coupling between within-host and between-host processes. The scales are linked under the assumption of dose-dependent transmission, with the functional form informed by empirical viremia-infectiousness data from arbovirus transmission. Focusing on Dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses as case studies, we assess how different functional forms of the coupling affect the number of equilibria of the epidemic model. We find that when the transmission is modeled using linear coupling functions, the multiscale model yields the same bifurcation structure of the simpler, uncoupled model, indicating that the linking of scales does not alter the range of possible long-term epidemiological states in such cases. However, nonlinear coupling can induce complex behaviors such as multiple endemic equilibria and backward bifurcations, which the uncoupled model does not capture. These results underscore the importance of carefully selecting coupling functions and provide guidance on when multiscale modeling is essential for understanding and managing vector-borne diseases.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Temporally, zebrafish respond robustly to stimuli with lifetimes as short as 100 ms, while medaka require lifetimes exceeding one second and retain motion information for several seconds after stimulus offset.

Aggregation of the Bb depends on the Bucky ball (Buc) protein, an intrinsically disordered protein with a prion-like self-aggregation domain. In zebrafish buc null mutants, the Bb fails to form and oocytes lack polarity. Here, we established buc hypomorphic mutants that fail to form the Bb, but remarkably Buc protein and vegetal mRNAs localized normally at the vegetal cortex of the oocyte.

Using this framework, we highlight the dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis as an etiological driver of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further supporting these results, we find that a critical component of this molecular system, the P-type calcium ATPase ATP2B2, exhibits marked expression deficits in both nuclear transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of individuals with schizophrenia. We then developed a method that uses missense variants in case-control cohorts together with protein structures (inferred from AlphaFold3) to systematically prioritize mutational hotspots of biological significance for downstream mechanistic interrogation. This approach identified an enrichment of deleterious missense variants - implicated across multiple neuropsychiatric disorders - that changed protein residues in close spatial proximity to both the Ca 2+ permeation tunnel and the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site of ATP2B2. Cellular and biochemical analyses of variants in both the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site and the canonical Ca2+ binding site revealed clear loss-of-function effects, establishing two distinct molecular mechanisms that converge on impaired calcium extrusion, likely perturbing pre- and post-synaptic Ca2+ homeostatic equilibrium.

Amino acids present in root exudates play important roles in bacterial chemotaxis, bacterial metabolism, and root colonization, contributing to plant nutrition and health. Notwithstanding the importance of amino acids in shaping the rhizosphere microbiome, the identities of the plant amino acid transporters that mediate their root exudation have remained elusive. Results: Here, we report that the Arabidopsis UMAMIT30 transporter, robustly expressed in root and shoot tissues, significantly contributes to amino acid root exudation. umamit30 loss-of-function mutants were compromised for amino acid root exudation as shown by the low concentration of amino acids, particularly glutamine, recovered from root exudates compared to wild-type plants. Amino acid quantification, as well as uptake and secretion assessments using radiolabelled glutamine, revealed that the shoots of umamit30 accumulate amino acids and have a reduced capacity to secrete glutamine, impacting root exudation. Conclusions: Our results identify UMAMIT30 as a broadly specific amino acid exporter strongly expressed in Arabidopsis vasculature. Loss-of-function mutants displayed reduced amino acid levels in root exudates, with significant drops in glutamine and asparagine among others, yet exhibited no detectable growth defects. UMAMIT30 disruption led to elevated shoot amino acid content and reduced glutamine efflux from shoots, suggesting a role in phloem uploading rather than root exudation alone. Despite decreased levels of root exuded amino acids, beneficial Pseudomonas interactions and plant-growth-promotion remained unaffected.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Seven distinct QTL associated with oat crown rust resistance were identified, with KASP markers developed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tightly linked to the four most significant QTL on chromosomes 4A and 7A. A major QTL named QPc_GS7_4A.2 with a resistance allele derived from oat line GS7 was mapped to chromosome 4A and found to overlap with genomic regions previously associated with both the all-stage resistance gene Pc61 and adult plant resistance. Genetic mapping for rust resistance at seedling stage using a subset of Provena x GS7 lines with contrasting alleles at QPc_GS7_4A.2 confirmed the role of this locus on seedling resistance, likely by Pc61. Furthermore, we found similar resistance profiles between GS7 and the Pc61 differential line against 20 Pca isolates at the seedling stage. Haplotype analysis of QPc_GS7_4A.2 in the oat crown rust differential set and an oat collection revealed the resistance haplotype in lines previously postulated to carry resistance gene Pc61, including Coker234, Quoll, Warrego, Wizard, and Barcoo.

In plants, the G10-type coiled-coil (CCG10)-NLRs form a distinct phylogenetic clade that remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified a gain-of-function (GOF) mutant of Wheat Autoimmunity 3 (WAI3), designated WAI3GOF, which encodes a constitutively activated CCG10-NLR due to an amino acid substitution. Cryo-EM structural analysis revealed that activated WAI3 assembles into a distinctive octameric resistosome. Arabidopsis RPS2, another CCG10-NLR, also forms an octamer, indicating a conserved structural property across monocot and dicot plants. The WAI3 resistosome mediates a prolonged and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium influx, facilitated by a unique channel architecture arising from its divergent CC domain configuration. Notably, this domain arrangement may be shared by many plant NLRs that lack the conserved EDVID motif in their CC domains. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized resistosome structure and provide insights into plant immune receptor plasticity.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

In humans, this parasite is the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis. Recently, its range has been expanding across the Northern Hemisphere, and it is increasingly detected in wild canids, domestic dogs, and humans across Canada and the United States. While this expansion has been documented in isolated studies across the continent, a lack of routine sampling in wildlife hinders our ability to anticipate and mitigate further spread of E. multilocularis. We confirmed the presence of E. multilocularis in Washington State, USA, using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques across carcasses and field-collected scats of coyotes (Canis latrans), this regions most common wild canid. Morphological identification of adult worms was confirmed by next-generation sequencing. Over a third of all samples tested positive for E. multilocularis when all methodologies were combined. Sequencing revealed a haplotype of E. multilocularis matching a documented haplotype originally of European origin in British Columbia, Canada. Our study provides the first confirmation of E. multilocularis in a wild host on the west coast of the U.S and provides additional haplotype information crucial to tracking the geographical expansion of the parasite. We also provide a new next-generation sequencing primer targeting cestodes of canids. The difference in amplification between intestinal and fecal samples suggests that non-invasive fecal sampling using DNA metabarcoding--a popular method of helminth surveillance --may lead to underestimation of prevalence, hindering control measures. The global significance of these findings extends beyond North America; E. multilocularis is a major public health concern in Europe and Asia, where alveolar echinococcosis is increasingly diagnosed in humans. Our study highlights the urgent need for increased surveillance and improved diagnostic strategies worldwide, particularly in regions with significant human-wildlife contact.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

The plant cell wall serves as the primary barrier against the invasion of fungal pathogens. To facilitate successful infection, many pathogens encode plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) to degrade cell wall components. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of PCWDE gene families in two V.dahliae strains, VdSHZ-4 and VdSHZ-9, with different pathogenicity. VdSHZ-4 and VdSHZ-9 genomes were found to contain 415 and 396 PCWDE genes, respectively. We successfully isolated two key enzymes from V. dahliae: the cutinase VdCut1 and the pectin lyase VdPL16. To investigate the functions of these two genes, we constructed VdCut1 and VdPL16 deletion and complementation mutants and examined their roles in hyphal growth, conidiation, and pathogenicity toward cotton Verticillium wilt. Results showed that deletion of VdCut1 or VdPL16 suppressed colony growth and reduced conidial production, and it also impaired the utilization of sucrose and galactose and markedly increased sensitivity to abiotic stresses such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sorbitol. The VdCut1 deletion mutant completely lost the ability to penetrate cellophane membranes, whereas the VdPL16 deletion mutant exhibited significantly reduced penetration capacity. Both deletions markedly attenuated virulence, with the loss of VdCut1 having the more pronounced effect. In planta colonization assays revealed that the VdCut1 mutant accumulated much less biomass in host tissues than the wild-type strain and the VdPL16 mutant. These findings demonstrate that VdCut1 and VdPL16 play critical roles in V.dahliae pathogenicity by regulating hyphal growth and conidiation. The results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this pathogen degrades plant cell walls and provide a theoretical basis for antifungal strategies that target plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs).", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

One of these pivotal pathways is the oxidative stress response activated by NRF2 under control of sensor KEAP1. Soft electrophiles are known to bind with KEAP1 and consequently activate NRF2. However, the understanding of the NRF2 activation dynamics and influence on cellular fate during prolonged repeated exposure conditions is still lacking. Therefore, we accurately mapped the NRF2 activation dynamics upon single or repeated exposures using HepG2 BAC GFP reporters combined with live cell confocal imaging. In a 2D set-up, a concentration-dependent NRF2 activation and subsequent SRXN1 induction upon exposure to sulforaphane or CDDO-Me was observed. The level of NRF2 activation upon sulforaphane exposure highly correlated with cytotoxicity induction. Reactivation of NRF2 upon a second exposure without a recovery period was lower compared to initial exposure, yet resulted in a strong and sustained upregulation of SRXN1. In contrast, inclusion of recovery periods did allow for strong NRF2 and SRXN1 upregulation. In 3D, increased SRXN1 upregulation was observed upon a second exposure with sulforaphane after recovery up to 6 days compared to the first exposure, while similar or lower SRXN1 induction was observed after secondary CDDO-Me treatment. In conclusion, NRF2 activation dynamics and subsequently SRXN1 induction is highly chemical, concentration and exposure duration dependent. Recovery periods allow cells to adapt and initiate a secondary NRF2 response. Together this allowed for further understanding of NRF2 dynamics and cellular fate upon repeated exposures contributing to improving chemical safety testing.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "There is a high need for accepted test methods for chemicals that affect the hormonal system, also known as endocrine disruptors (EDCs). The H295R adrenal cell line is considered the gold standard for investigating chemicals that can disrupt steroidogenesis. This method is described in test guideline 456, established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and currently focuses only on changes in testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2). However, the culture media from H295R cells contains a wide range of steroid hormones. To validate a more comprehensive H295R assay, we tested 15 blinded test substances in H295R cells and measured changes in the levels of 15 steroid hormones, as part of a ringtrial. The results showed that changes in the levels of the measured steroid hormones were robust and reproducible. The classification as disruptors of steroidogenesis for 14 test substances was the same based on changes in T or E2 alone, as it was based on changes in multiple steroid hormones. One test substance was negative based on changes in T and E2, but also showed changes in the alternative steroidogenesis pathway and would therefore be classified as positive. However, the relevance of this finding is difficult to determine, given the limited knowledge of the biological role of the alternative steroidogenesis pathway. While expanding the number of endpoint measurements in the H295R test method, thus measuring changes in multiple steroid hormones, does not appear to change the conclusion if a substance is (not) a steroidogenic disruptor, it may provide additional information that could help explain adverse health effects resulting from disrupted steroid hormone production. To investigate this further, an extensive literature review was conducted to evaluate the predictive value of the H295R test method for effects on female reproduction. This evaluation focused primarily on bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, BPF, and the plasticizer DEHP, as these were the areas where the most data were available for both the H295R test method and effects on female reproduction in animal studies. Although the evidence for disruption of steroidogenesis in the H295R test and the occurrence of some effects in animal studies (follicular and estrous cycle disruption) was overwhelming, establishing a direct link requires a detailed analysis. This could include examining altered levels of steroid hormones in the blood and using OECD-endorsed descriptions of mechanisms leading to adverse effects (so-called Adverse Outcome Pathways, AOPs). Based on our results, expanding the H295R assay does not appear to change the classification of steroidogenic disruptors, but could yield more mechanistic information. Combined with information from computer models, other cell-based tests, and/or animal experimental data, and supported by OECD-endorsed AOPs and AOP networks, this could contribute to clearer evidence for the link between endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals and female reproductive effects within European legislation.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose that epidermal cells at the organ surface have unique requirements for growth control due to high mechanical tension, while covered epidermal cells are mechanically shielded by the root cap. We present in silico and in vivo evidence that plants use surface mechanical cues to activate a cell-type specific growth control programme involving the small GTPase RAB-A5c, allowing them to maintain directional growth at the organ surface. Positional mechanical cues may thus be used to control expression of a sub-population of epidermal genes, linking gene regulation to surface-specific functional requirements.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined the histological structure of juvenile gonads in the harlequin sandsmelt (Parapercis pulchella), a female-to-male sex-change fish in which mature females possess ovotestes. Juveniles measuring up to 32.2 mm in total length exhibited gonads containing cyst-formed developing oogonia and a small number of oocytes. In contrast, larger juveniles possessed more developed ovaries but showed no detectable spermatogenic germ cells.

Recent research demonstrates that electroencephalography signals are composed of periodic and aperiodic components reflecting distinct physiological substrates. This dissociation raises the possibility that they follow different developmental tendencies. Here, we delineate the lifespan trajectories of aperiodic and periodic neural oscillations using a large international cohort (N=1,563, ages 5 to 95, resting state, eyes closed). We reveal two fundamental developmental patterns: a Monotonic decrease in aperiodic activity and a Growth-and-Decline pattern for periodic activity. Both components have inflections around age 20 and transition to a stable senescent phase around age 40. Spatially, anterior regions mainly exhibit aperiodic activity, while periodic activity concentrate on posterior regions and these patterns remain stable throughout life. Crucially, multimodal analysis shows these trajectories map onto distinct biological substrates. The periodic component's Growth and Decline trajectory aligns with GABAergic function and myelination. In contrast, the monotonically decreasing trajectory of aperiodic activity mirrors fundamental biomarkers of biological aging, such as DNA methylation and telomere length. Transforming age to a logarithmic scale simplifies these nonlinear trajectories into a linear decreasing and a piecewise concave linear model for aperiodic and periodic components.

Quantifying and minimising impacts of wind projects on seabirds is necessary for ensuring compliance with environmental legislation and safeguarding populations. However, the timescales and complexity involved in assessment processes can limit the extent to which estimates can be leveraged towards balancing environmental impact and energy generation. OCcAM is a simple, user-friendly and transparent industry-developed tool allowing rapid assessment of impacts on seabirds from offshore wind developments. Mortality rates of five seabird species are estimated using two UK industry-standard models: the Band collision risk model which predicts fatal collisions with turbine blades, and the matrix-based displacement approach that predicts mortalities associated with distributional responses to the presence of a wind farm. The tool supports simultaneous analysis of up to three input parameter sets and predictions can be expressed as a percentage of a focal population. OCcAM allows auditable analyses to be run quickly and easily with no requirement for specific technical expertise, making it accessible to all stakeholders. It presents a variety of opportunities to facilitate ornithological assessment at strategic to project-specific scales. Here we demonstrate three potential applications of OCcAM: (1) predicting the cumulative impact of Scottish offshore wind farms upon protected seabird populations, (2) updating fatality estimates calculated for worst-case consented values using as-built input parameters and (3) optioneering of project design parameters relative to seabird risk.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Quantification of -satellite repeat length revealed deletions and insertions, paralleling alterations observed in diffuse and limited SSc.

GPT-3.5 provided correct answers for 59/104 (58%) questions, while Llama-3-70B and GPT-4o answered 49/104 (47%) correctly. GPT-3.5 was the best performing in most categories, followed by Llama-3-70B and then GPT-4o. 71% of the questions were correctly answered by at least one LLM. The best performing categories included DNA analysis, while the worst performing were sequence alignment/comparative genomics and genome assembly. Overall, LLMs performance mirrored that of humans with lower performance in tasks in which humans had low performance and vice versa. However, LLMs also failed in some instances where most humans were correct and, in a few cases, LLMs excelled where most humans failed. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first assessment of general purpose LLMs on basic bioinformatics tasks in distinct areas relative to the performance of hundreds to thousands of humans. LLMs provide correct answers to several questions that require use of biological knowledge, reasoning, statistical analysis and computer code.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Using a thermodynamic formalism and Bayesian inference, we show that even a single-inducer version of the circuit can display diverse multifunctional dynamics, including the coexistence of oscillations and multistability. In addition we explore robustness, classify emergent behaviours, and analyse critical slowing down and regime transitions. Remarkably, the AC-DC circuit can produce more than 30 topologically distinct bifurcation diagrams, challenging the classical view that network topology rigidly constrains dynamical outcomes. This flexibility enables synthetic capabilities that couple hysteresis with oscillations, critical slowing down, and reversibility. By uncovering the hidden potential of minimal genetic circuits and outlining design principles for their implementation, this work opens new directions for harnessing emergent complexity using the basic building blocks of life.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Older mice showed more variable response times, reproducing a common finding in human ageing studies. Ageing globally increased firing rates, post-stimulus neural variability (quantified using the Fano Factor), and decreased 'variability quenching' (the reduction in neural variability upon stimulus presentation).

Age-related attenuation in stimulus-induced variability quenching was most prominent in visual and motor cortex, striatum, and thalamic area.

M.", "abstract": "Camera trap-based abundance estimators are increasingly used for population size estimation in the absence of marked individuals. One approach is to relate animal detections to the space sampled by each camera's viewable area, which results in viewshed density estimates that can be extrapolated to the broader sampling area to obtain abundance. The assumption is that spatial variation in local abundance corresponds to the collective viewsheds of cameras. Therefore, these design-based viewshed density estimators require that camera locations be representative of the study area. This assumption can be met with spatially balanced probability sampling, such as a generalized random tessellation stratified design. However, the random placement of cameras can be restrictive in practice. Using simulations and an empirical study, we evaluated an extension of the instantaneous sampling estimator to account for unmodeled spatial variation in local abundance using independent predictions of relative habitat use from GPS telemetry data. We applied this approach to a fenced population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), some of which were GPS collared, where timelapse photography data were collected using random and nonrandom camera placements simultaneously during two consecutive winter seasons. Our simulations showed that this approach neither reduces bias nor improves the precision of abundance estimates considerably. Specifically, we found little support that calibrating estimates based on habitat selection analysis would produce unbiased results when sampling is spatially unbalanced and focused on areas of high animal use instead of being representative of the study area. Our findings underscore the need for randomized sampling when the goal is to provide unbiased population size estimates for unmarked wildlife populations using design-based viewshed density estimators. Attempts to relax the model assumptions must be both theoretically sound and practically feasible, otherwise there would be a risk of misleading management decisions by using unreliable estimates of population size.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

As such, seed dormancy can be a form of seasonal environmental tracking. In addition, seed dormancy can act as a bet-hedging strategy by spreading the germination risk across time, within or between years. Through both environmental tracking and bet-hedging, seed dormancy can stabilize population demography, potentially enhancing long-term population persistence. Methods: To test whether populations that express seed dormancy are more likely to persist than populations not capable of dormancy, we established genetically variable, experimental field populations of Arabidopsis thaliana that differ in their capacity to control the seasonal timing of germination through seed dormancy. Four environmental treatments were imposed to test for demographic differences across environments and to test whether dormancy mitigates the effects of environmental variation. Key Results: Seasonal seed dormancy influenced demography and population persistence primarily via early seedling or rosette mortality. Dormant populations had larger seedling populations and higher population persistence over the three years in the most permissive environmental treatments. However, stressful environments diminished the demographic effects of dormancy. These dynamics, in turn, resulted in dormant populations unexpectedly exhibiting more variation across environmental treatments than non-dormant populations. Therefore, dormancy's enhancement of demographic performance may be caused more by allowing populations to take advantage of favorable conditions than by helping them to escape poor conditions. Conclusions: This study shows that seasonal seed dormancy may help populations persist over time, but not under all environmental conditions. In more permissive environments, dormancy can reduce population bottlenecks and maintain larger populations. Some conditions, however, may be too adverse for seed dormancy to overcome.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

E.; Yee, W. K.; Dowling, D. K.", "abstract": "The discovery that mitochondrial genomes can harbor functional mutations despite the evolutionarily conserved role of mitochondria has spurred interest in better understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such mitochondrial genetic variation. Because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes products that must function in concert with products of the nuclear genome, and because mitochondria are largely maternally inherited, outstanding questions remain as to how, when, and why variation in mtDNA may affect phenotype. In this study, we developed a set of intraspecific \"mitonuclear strains\" of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies that vary across 13 mtDNA haplotypes and 3 nuclear genetic backgrounds. We created a new apparatus called the Drop Tower to test the performance of these strains in negative geotaxis, a locomotory trait we predicted to be sensitive to variation at the level of mitochondria, across both sexes and two age classes. We found that both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variation significantly altered how negative geotaxis performance changed with age and across the sexes, though interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear strains did not affect performance. Across most strains, male flies performed more poorly and suffered a steeper decline with age than did females, and young males appeared to vary more in performance across mitochondrial strains. In addition, we discovered a strong effect of small differences of parental age on negative geotaxis--and this effect also varied by mitochondrial strain. Collectively, the results of our study reveal that intraspecific variation in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA can affect age- and sex-related differences in fruit fly locomotory performance. Further exploring the mechanisms linking these subtle genetic differences to locomotory phenotype and creating differences in response between the sexes will be important to understanding the evolutionary forces shaping the patterns we detected.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

To find cell-intrinsic TK signaling patterns which might be predictive of poor response to TKI exposure, we used high-sensitivity multiplexed mass spectrometry to quantify endogenous levels of 1,222 phosphotyrosine (pY) sites across the proteomes of TK-driven human cancer cell lines with variable response to genotype-matched TKIs. In direct comparisons between TKI-tolerant and TKI-sensitive lines with a common driver TK, we found that TKI treatment was equally effective at blocking driver TK signaling, and higher basal activity of the driver TK did not always predict higher sensitivity to TKI. All tolerant lines showed a dampened proteome-wide pY response to TKI exposure compared to sensitive lines, suggesting tumor cells with more robust TK signaling are less vulnerable to driver TK blockade. We found that each tolerant line depends on a unique set of compensatory TKs and signaling axes, but are unified by hyperactivity of at least one of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) or the related ABL1/2 kinases, both at rest and under TKI treatment, despite absence of SFK/ABL genetic mutations.

Plants respond to water deficit by adjusting growth and metabolism to enhance survival; these adjustments impact the soil microorganisms interacting with plant roots. Plants establish symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which supply soil nutrients in exchange for carbon metabolites via an intricate dual-species interface within roots. These fungi are dependent upon host-derived photosynthates and are thus potentially vulnerable to plant perturbations during drought. Here, we demonstrate that the plant-mycorrhizal relationship is dynamic when water becomes limiting. During water deficit, rice de-prioritizes nutrient acquisition gene regulatory networks, including its AM symbiotic program, in a strategy conserved with tomato. The fungal symbiont correspondingly represses its growth, undergoing metabolic quiescence, coupled with decommissioning of hyphae within the host's root. Following re-watering, the host re-engages with its partner fungus, re-invigorating fungal growth and arbuscule establishment. This coordinate, reversible and enduring inter-organismal association may aid host survival under transient stress, but suggests that mutualisms in native and crop plants are potentially fragile in increasingly erratic climates.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Both target and distractor evoked stronger initial RIFT responses than nontargets, reflecting top-down and bottom-up attentional effects on early visual processing. Importantly, the presence of a distractor attenuated the initial RIFT response to the target, reflecting competition during the initial stages of visual processing and predicting subsequent behavioral performance. RIFT responses to the distractor eventually even decreased below responses to the target and nontarget, representing active suppression of task-irrelevant but salient stimuli.

While its chemotactic response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been extensively studied, experiments are usually carried out in a high oxygen environment (21% O2, also called normoxia) that might not reflect the natural condition for a soil amoeba as hypoxia is common underground. Our recent research has unveiled a novel phenomenon termed aerotaxis, wherein Dd cells migrate towards oxygen-rich environments under low oxygen (hypoxia). Results: We tested Dd response when submitted to two different stress sources: starvation and hypoxia. While both stresses induce a motile response, namely chemotaxis and aerotaxis, we were able to decoupled both type of responses to explore potential shared mechanisms. Importantly, aerotaxis appears to be operated independently of known chemotactic pathways, demonstrating unique signaling pathways and cellular responses. Aerotaxis contributes to Dd developmental processes by letting cells escape from acute hypoxia. Even though chemotactic response can occur at less than 2% O2, it does not lead to well organized or stable streaming. Furthermore, in an oxygen gradient, aggregation center for chemotactic response appears preferentially at higher O2 level. RT-qPCR analysis show that hypoxia only slightly reduces the expression of genes required for chemotactic response, suggesting that the bias toward high O2 might occur at another level. Reoxygenation of cells that have been starved in hypoxic condition for 18h allow rapid aggregation but require de novo protein synthesis. Conclusion: Aerotaxis and chemotaxis mechanisms do not interact directly. However, when cells are exposed to both hypoxia and starvation, both mechanisms can be combined to direct the migration of cells toward place with higher oxygen level. As hypoxia is frequent in the soil where Dd usually grow, formation of aggregation centers at, or close to the soil surface, where oxygen is abundant, will be advantageous. Low O2 level does not preclude cells to participate to streaming but seems to reduce or delay their ability to produce stable aggregation centers, resulting into bias favoring centers that form at higher oxygen level.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, is a major component of insect corneal lenses1-3. Delayed chitin deposition in dusky-like mutants and altered levels of chitin processing enzymes in Blimp-1 mutants correlate with changes in the shape of Drosophila corneal lenses4,5, prompting us to investigate the role of chitin in determining corneal lens shape. We found that chitin synthesis in the retina begins at mid-pupal stages, when radial chitin microfibrils appear over the primary pigment cells and cone cells. The chitin synthase enzyme Krotzkopf verkehrt (Kkv)6 is expressed in all non-neuronal cells in the retina. Loss of chitin induced by knocking down kkv resulted in thin corneal lenses with reduced curvature. Conversely, overexpressing Rebuf (Reb), which enhances chitin export7, produced expanded and deformed corneal lenses. We investigated the relative contributions to corneal lens shape of central cone and primary pigment cells, and peripheral lattice cells. Knocking down kkv specifically in central cells was sufficient to deplete most of the chitin from the corneal lens and significantly reduce its thickness. Overexpressing Reb only in central cells increased the thickness of the central corneal lens, while overexpressing it in lattice cells made the edges thicker. The shape of the corneal lens thus depends on the relative amounts of chitin produced by central and peripheral cells, indicating that localized chitin secretion and trapping is an important determinant of corneal lens curvature.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

The model was parameterized using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database (GBIF) and temperature and bioclimatic variables from the CHELSA data set. Dispersal rates were assigned to each species using a trait-based approach and were used to predict future habitat with a distance-based probability over time. Results: Plant species are predicted to occupy on average only 12.3% (1.5 - 53.9 95% CI) of their emerging climate niches, with half of the species unable to colonize new habitat by 2100 due to limited dispersal distances. In dispersal limited predictions, migration to higher altitudes played a greater role than northward shifts, and decolonization of cells by species (extirpation) due to decreasing climate suitability changed species composition more than dispersal. Boreal tree species were predicted to expand into the tundra reducing the area without trees. Main conclusions: Future plant species distributions and resulting large-scale compositions are affected by species-specific dispersal rates. Even though new suitable niches emerge prominently towards the north, higher altitudes might be more relevant given their accessibility by dispersal over the next century. Although climate niche dynamics could support higher plant species richness across the Arctic, overall richness is expected to decline with climate warming due to dispersal limitations. The colonization of new habitats via dispersal in combination with the decolonization of former habitats due to declining climatic suitability on species level are predicted to cause large-scale changes in species composition especially at the boundary between the boreal forest and the tundra biome.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

In this work we use an optogenetic tool, opto-PKR, to specifically trigger ISR-activation with light with high spatiotemporal control via the PKR-kinase, avoiding potential upstream damage or side effects from drugs. Using immunofluorescence and RNA-sequencing we show that targeted ISR-activation reaches levels where both adaptive (ATF4) and terminal response (CHOP) of the ISR are activated, which show downregulation of genes associated with extracellular environment and glial cell migration, further supported by ECM-stain and scratch assays. Further, we show inhibition of aggressive spread for ISR-activated GBM spheroids in collagen 3D culture.

Despite advances in super-resolution microscopy and single particle tracking, the small size and temporal instability of nanodomains make them difficult to study in living cells. To overcome these challenges, we built fluorescent DNA origami probes that insert into the PM via lipid anchors displayed on the cell. The number and spatial distribution of anchors between the origami and the cell surface were precisely defined by the origami, enabling nanometer-scale sampling of the cell surface. Inserting these DNA origami particles into the membrane with lipid anchors allowed them to passively diffuse across the membrane, and we tracked their movement using single particle tracking to survey the PM landscape. By varying the number and spatial arrangement of lipid anchors connecting the DNA origami to the cell surface, we showed that stable immobilization of DNA origami particles requires simultaneous interactions with multiple nanodomains. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton reduced immobilization, confirming its role in supporting nanodomain stability. Moreover, transient mechanical stretching of cells led to reversible increases in DNA origami mobility, indicating that mechanical force can reversibly regulate PM nanodomain organization. Altogether, we present a novel membrane-integrated DNA origami approach that provides mechanistic insights into PM nanodomain architecture and dynamics in living cells.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Using in vitro reconstitution and TIRF microscopy we show that, unlike canonical severing enzymes such as katanin, spastin and fidgetin, which hydrolyze ATP to remove tubulin dimers and promote lattice repair, UNC-45A selectively binds to pre-existing microtubule defects and inhibits GTP-tubulin incorporation. This mechanism prevents the formation of stabilized hot spots that typically protect microtubule from disassembly, resulting in persistent lattice damage and net microtubule loss, even in the presence of physiological levels of free GTP-tubulin. We further demonstrate that UNC-45A localizes near amyloid deposits in both mouse models and human cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In cultured neurons, UNC-45A accumulates in axonal swellings, regions of pronounced microtubule disruption and surrogates for dystrophic neurites in AD, and exacerbated their size and number particularly under conditions mimicking microtubule damage. Notably, this is the first report of a microtubule severing protein that both localizes near amyloid plaques in tissue and accumulates in neurite swellings in cultured neurons, where it modulates their pathology. Together, our findings establish the mechanism of a novel ATP-independent, damage-responsive severing pathway that couple defect recognition to repair inhibition, defining a new paradigm in microtubule quality control with broad implications for the cytoskeletal integrity and remodeling in health and disease", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

We show that the disordered termini of {beta}-catenin drive the formation of condensates that incorporate other components of the cadherin complex in vitro. Using {beta}-catenin mutants with hampered condensation, we demonstrate that {beta}-catenin condensation nucleates the formation of submicron cadherin/catenin clusters that further develop into stable sites of adhesion. Furthermore, we show that {beta}-catenin-dependent clustering ensures the efficient formation of de novo cell-cell adhesions.

A.; Schindler, K.; Lacefield, S.", "abstract": "Mammalian female meiosis is uniquely regulated to produce a developmentally competent egg capable of supporting embryogenesis. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate, with half extruded into the first polar body. The egg then arrests at metaphase II and only resumes meiosis and extrudes the second polar body following fertilization. The MOS/MAPK signaling pathway is important for maintaining the metaphase II arrest; in mos-/- mutants, a subset of eggs undergo spontaneous parthenogenetic activation and exhibit additional abnormal cell divisions. To further understand the cell cycle mis-regulation in activated mos-/- eggs, we used time-lapse microscopy to monitor the abnormal divisions. We discovered that, following parthenogenetic activation, the first polar body can assemble a spindle, segregate chromosomes, and divide with timings similar to anaphase II onset in the egg. This behavior contrasts with wildtype polar bodies, which do not divide and are typically degenerated. We demonstrate that mos-/- eggs and polar bodies can exchange cytoplasm at the time of meiosis II spindle assembly, likely allowing the transfer of cell cycle regulators between the two compartments. Further inspection revealed that mos-/- eggs have defective meiotic midbody assembly with most eggs lacking a cap structure, which is needed to separate the two compartments. We report that polar bodies of mos-/- eggs can re-enter the cell cycle and undergo additional aberrant divisions. These findings identify MOS as a critical regulator of meiotic midbody formation and uncover a novel consequence of disrupted MOS/MAPK signaling: the potential for polar bodies to become mitotically active and contribute to tumor formation.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

M.; Sewell-Loftin, M. K.; Mattheyses, A. L.", "abstract": "Desmosomes (DSMs) are intercellular junctions essential for providing mechanical resilience to tissues, particularly the epidermis. Desmoplakin (DP) is a key DSM protein which anchors plaque proteins to keratins, thereby ensuring tissue integrity under mechanical stress. Clinically, DP mutations impair keratinocyte adhesion and structural integrity, leading to skin fragility disorders. However, how mechanical forces influence DSM architecture is poorly understood. We hypothesized that physiological stretch could alter DP architecture in DSMs. To test this, we subjected normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and DP-knockout human keratinocytes expressing either DPI-mEGFP, DP1a-mEGFP, or DP2-mEGFP to mechanical stretch using the Flexcell system (13% uniaxial strain for 30 minutes). Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) was used to visualize DP architecture with 20 nm resolution. We found mechanical stretch significantly increased the distance between DP cytoplasmic tails compared to static controls across all cell lines. In contrast, there was no significant change in the N-terminal head domain under stretch, highlighting the tail domain as the primary site of mechanical adaptation. This work enhances our understanding of how DSMs and DP isoforms respond to biomechanical forces, revealing that the C-term of DP undergoes a strain-induced conformational shift, reorganizing the DSM architecture in response to physiological stress. Ultimately, elucidating the spatial and biomechanical behavior of DP will deepen our understanding of its contribution to dermatological health and disease.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Fecundity measurements play a crucial role in life history research, providing insights into reproductive fitness, population dynamics, and environmental responses. In the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fecundity assays are widely used to study development, aging, and genetic or environmental influences on reproduction. C. elegans hermaphrodites have large numbers of offspring (>100), so manual counting of viable offspring is time-consuming and susceptible to human error. Automated counting methods have the potential to enhance throughput, accuracy, and precision in data collection. 2. We applied computer vision to 9,972 images of broods from individual C. elegans hermaphrodites from several strains under multiple treatments to capture variation in fecundity. We trained models using YOLO versions v8 to v11 (large and extra-large variants) to detect and count viable offspring, then compared the model results to estimates from manual counting. 3. The best model was trained by YOLO v11-L. After fine-tuning, this model correctly detected 92% of all offspring visible in the images (recall) and was correct about 94.6% of the offspring it marked (precision). Manual counts differed from verified ground-truth counts by an average of 2.65 offspring per image, compared to 0.95 for the trained computer vision model. In addition, we detected significant effects of counter identity, experimental block, and their interaction on manual counts. Computer vision counts were not affected by these biases and outperformed manual counting in both speed and consistency. 4. We demonstrate that computer vision can be a powerful tool for fecundity assays in C. elegans and provide a pipeline for applying this approach to new image sets.

How microglia process the engulfed neuronal material, especially lipids, remains poorly understood, despite its central role in neurodegeneration. Thus, we developed HuZIBRA, a scalable in vivo xenotransplantation model in which human iPSC-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) are introduced into the developing zebrafish brain (zf-hiMG), a system characterized by high levels of neuronal cell death and amenable to precise genetic and pharmacological manipulation. We show that human microglia-like cells recognize and engulf apoptotic zebrafish neurons, indicating conserved efferocytic mechanisms. In these cells, engulfed neuronal material accumulates into a distinct, lipid-rich intracellular compartment, the gastrosome, which we also observed in iMGLs placed in a human brain-like environment. The size of the human gastrosome dynamically reflects neuronal cell death levels and is regulated by key genes, including TREM2 and SLC37A2. Pharmacological inhibition of the cholesterol transporter NPC1 induces gastrosome expansion and lipid accumulation, recapitulating pathological features of Niemann-Pick disease type C. Thus, HuZIBRA provides a powerful in vivo platform to uncover cell-autonomous adaptive responses of human microglia to apoptotic and metabolic stress, with the gastrosome emerging as a key integrator of neuronal debris processing and disease-relevant lipid metabolism.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the molecular basis for LIMD1 binding and recruitment of LATS1/2 to AJs. We show that while the LIM domains of LIMD1 are sufficient for AJ localization and binding to LATS1/2, recruitment of LATS1 to AJ requires both the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the N-terminus as well as the LIM domains. We further dissected the LIM domains and found that LIM1 and LIM2, but not LIM3, are necessary for LATS1 AJ localization. Point mutations that disrupt strain sensitivity in either the first or second LIM domain disrupt both binding and recruitment of LATS1/2 to AJs. Mechanistically, LIMD1 binds LATS1/2 through a conserved linear motif, the LATS-LATCH, which we identified by AlphaFold modeling and confirmed by biochemical and localization assays. The LATS-LATCH is both necessary and sufficient for strain-dependent recruitment of LATS1/2 to AJs. Mutation of predicted contact residues within the LATS-LATCH both disrupts its binding to LIMD1 and localization to AJs.

S.; Dohr, S. R.; Trotter, J.; Reese, M. L.", "abstract": "Background A hallmark of the eukaryotic cell is the regulated transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is mediated by a multi-subunit protein assembly called the nuclear pore complex (NPC). While its overall architecture has been preserved across eukaryotes, variations in NPC structure appear to have tuned its function in different organisms. Outside of a handful of model systems, the NPC has not been comprehensively studied. This is particularly true of species that are not closely related to well-studied models, such as apicomplexan parasites. Indeed, the evolutionary divergence of Apicomplexa has complicated facile prediction of these proteins in these organisms. Because of this, the NPC components remain largely unidentified, and therefore NPC cellular function in Apicomplexa is poorly understood. Principal Findings Here we identified, experimentally validated, and functionally characterized protein components of the NPC in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. By combining proximity biotinylation with careful bioinformatic analysis we identified 15 previously uncharacterized proteins that localize to the Toxoplasma NPC. We demonstrated 7 of these proteins are essential to parasite replication. Importantly, we defined components of the mRNA export machinery, as well as subunits required for the stability and/or assembly of specific NPC subcomplexes. Consistent with the evolutionary distance between Toxoplasma and well-studied models, the majority of our newly validated NPC components show no clear homology to NPC proteins in yeast, animals, or plants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Toxoplasma mRNA export machinery has a distinct composition from other well-established systems. Intriguingly, several well-defined domains the TREX-2 complex that are essential in other systems are missing from the Toxoplasma genome. In contrast, others, such as Centrin-3, have been conserved in Toxoplasma, but are not required for mRNA export in the parasite. Conclusion Our work highlights the distinct composition of multiple subcomplexes of the Toxoplasma NPC and paves the way for future studies to provide high-resolution structural information on the parasites unusual NPC architecture.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells offer a promising approach because they can be genetically modified using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and differentiated into disease-relevant cell types. As it is difficult to obtain aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from patients, iPS cells differentiated into VSMCs provide an ideal model to study cellular aneurysmal phenotypes. In this study, we generated iPS cell models carrying (P/LP) SMAD3 variants. These cell models were generated either by using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated introduction of indels and deletions to introduce SMAD3 variants, or by reprogramming of fibroblasts derived from SMAD3 patients. These iPS cell lines were characterized for SMAD3 expression by Western blotting and validated for pluripotency through immunofluorescence and qPCR. Moreover, the patient-derived iPS cell lines were shown to differentiate into smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which are relevant to study the molecular mechanisms underlying aneurysm formation in LDS3 patients.

Using focussed ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography to image dormant microsporidian spores, we have gained new structural insights into this hibernation mechanism.

METHODS: The potential of a single type of systemic, targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) was investigated for addressing the above challenges of TNBC tumors implanted at different anatomic sites in mice. Actinium-225 dendrimer-radioconjugates alone, and/or after pretreatment with low-dose standard-of-care cisplatin, were assessed in vitro and on immune-competent 4T1-Balb/c mouse models with tumors implanted intracranially, orthotopically or subcutaneously. RESULTS: In vitro, TAT's efficacy was enhanced by cisplatin. In vivo, treatment was initiated well after tumors had grown (Vto = 39 {+/-} 14 mm3 in the intracranial model, and Vto=100mm3 in the orthotopic and subcutaneous models). Across all tumor implantation sites, a unified correlation was observed between animal mean survival and the dendrimer-delivered tumor absorbed doses, which were selectively increased by low-dose cisplatin pretreatment. Importantly, in all animal models, the mean survival following systemic treatment with both modalities was significantly longer vs. each modality alone and/or vs. no treatment, at injected doses that did not cause long-term (10-month) toxicities in tumor-free mice. CONCLUSION: Systemically-injected dendrimer-delivered TAT, combined with low-dose cisplatin pretreatment, can safely extend survival independent of mTNBC tumors' anatomic site, potentially presenting a single type of therapy to simultaneously treat multi-site mTNBC.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

First, we pre-trained separate transformer-based language models on large corpora of unpaired heavy and light chain sequences to capture patterns of gene usage and somatic hypermutation. These models were then integrated via lightweight adapters into a sequence-to-sequence model trained in a machine translation setting, enabling light chain generation conditioned on heavy chain input. Although native light chain recovery was moderate, the model consistently captured functionally meaningful constraints: generated sequences exhibited high germline identity, improved structural quality of predicted folds, and broader coverage of framework and CDR regions. Immunologically, heavy chains from memory B cells preferentially generated light chains with more restricted V gene usage, reflecting maturation-dependent selection. Additionally, generated kappa light chains displayed a trimodal similarity distribution, suggesting distinct functional pairing modes ranging from promiscuous to highly specific.

In this study, we present a graph-theoretic approach that reinterprets missing values not as gaps to be filled, but as informative signals. By representing nominal variables as nodes and encoding observed or missing associations as edges, we construct both weighted and unweighted bipartite graphs to analyze modularity, nestedness, and projection-based similarities. This framework enables downstream clustering, edge prediction through multiple imputation strategies, and validation using domain-specific prior knowledge. Across a series of biological, ecological, and social case studies, including proteomics data, the BeatAML drug screening dataset, ecological pollination networks, and HR analytics, we demonstrate that the structure of missing values can be highly informative. These configurations often reflect meaningful constraints and latent substructures, providing signals that help distinguish between data missing at random and not at random. When analyzed with appropriate graph-based tools, these patterns can be leveraged to improve the structural understanding of data and provide complementary signals for downstream tasks such as clustering and similarity analysis.

Specific tension was unchanged with size at 37{degrees}C in both fiber types, showing that force increases proportionally with CSA, which may be due to the increased number or stiffness of strongly-bound cross-bridges at this temperature.

It is currently unknown how microglial reactivity progresses and contributes to seizure development following Theilers Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) infection. Previously, our group has demonstrated that purinergic signaling in microglia is disrupted in the hippocampus of TMEV-infected mice. However, whether reactive cortical microglia also exhibit changes in purinergic signaling, cytokine levels, and purinergic receptors are unknown. Thus, we seek to evaluate region-based differences in microglial reactivity in the TMEV model. We employed a custom triple transgenic mouse line expressing tdTomato and GCaMP6f under a CX3CR1 Cre promoter and exogenously applied ATP/ADP to acute brain slice preparations from TMEV-infected mice and controls. Interestingly and in contrast to what is observed in hippocampus, we found that despite microglial reactivity in the cortex, microglia can respond to purinergic damage signals and engage calcium signaling pathways, comparable to PBS controls. Using a cytokine panel, we also found that pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-{gamma}) are brain-region dependent in mice infected with TMEV.

These spontaneous blinks are strategically timed to prioritize the processing of important visual input, balancing both stimulus characteristics and personal goals. Until now, the learning process underlying optimal blink timing has not been investigated in detail. Here, we present video-based eye-tracking data from 703 healthy participants (aged 5-91 years, 470 female) performing a structured interleaved pro-/anti-saccade task, in which we previously found that blink suppression occurs in anticipation of visual stimulus appearance (Pitigoi et al., 2024). Our goals are to understand (1) how participants modify their blink timing according to the temporal contingencies of the task; (2) whether the capacity to optimize blink timing impacts performance; and (3) whether this pattern varies with age. We found that participants quickly and strategically modified their blink distribution to optimize task performance. Blink probability decreased in periods that would compromise anti-saccade execution and increased when visual input was less critical. We also found significant differences in blink patterns and adaptive ability based on cognitive control capacity (indicated by participants' anti-saccade error rates). Furthermore, we demonstrated that blink optimization improves gradually from childhood to early adulthood, before declining with advanced age. This supports a possible link between regulation of blink behavior and age-related changes in learning capacity and inhibitory control across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Loss of PTEN causes hyperactivation of both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.

However, the molecular effectors that integrate these synergistic signals remain unknown. Here, we identify the actin-regulating ARP2/3 complex as a critical point of convergence downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We show that concurrent hyperactivation of both complexes drives increased filamentous actin and elevated levels of the ARP2/3 complex subunits in PTEN-deficient human neural precursors and neurons. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ARP2/3 is sufficient to rescue multiple disease-relevant phenotypes, including neural precursor hyperproliferation, neuronal hypertrophy, and electrical hyperactivity, without affecting the upstream mTORC1 or mTORC2 hyperactivation.

We have found that the F-Spondin domain of Mindin is the minimal region required for integrin engagement and downstream signalling.

The sigma-2 receptor (S2R, TMEM97) interacts with proteins involved in lipid trafficking, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is the primary receptor for LDL-cholesterol uptake in the retina. Preclinical studies demonstrate the necessity of S2R in protecting the retina and other nervous system tissues, and loss of either S2R or LDLR has been shown to exacerbate RPE cell death and visual dysfunction. Targeting the regulatory receptors of lipid and protein trafficking functions in RPE cells represents a tractable therapeutic strategy for dry AMD. We previously demonstrated that small molecule modulators of S2R can rescue RPE POS trafficking deficits induced by exogenous stressors. Given that disruption in lipid homeostasis is a key factor in dry AMD pathogenesis and S2R interacts with LDLR, we hypothesized that LDLR-mediated lipid trafficking in RPE could be altered using S2R-targeting small molecules. In this study, RPE cells treated with S2R modulators increased LDL uptake, assessed using fluorescently-labeled LDL, compared to vehicle-treatment. Lentiviral shRNAs to reduce TMEM97 or LDLR expression, or a neutralizing blocking antibody against LDLR, reduced S2R modulator-mediated LDL uptake, confirming the requirement of TMEM97 and LDLR for S2R modulator effects. Together, these data elaborate on a potential mechanism that may underlie the favorable reduction in geographic atrophy lesion size found in participants treated with the S2R modulator zervimensine in the Ph2 clinical trial MAGNIFY in patients with geographic atrophy (COG2201, NCT05893537).", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

However, most studies focusing on assembly, niche packing and diversification have considered solely niche positions within a community. We study how the co-evolution of niche position and degree of specialization affects packing, coexistence, and properties of the resulting communities under different modes of community assembly. We observe that evolution can lead to diversification and spontaneous emergence of asymmetric configurations of generalist and specialist phenotypes. Moreover, there exist multiple alternative evolutionarily stable states, with either many specialists or fewer generalists, some of which are only locally uninvadable. Contingency on assembly history shows that both local evolutionary adaptation and dispersal processes influence community-level eco-evolutionary dynamics and the structure of communities. By comparing communities along a continuum of assembly modes going from pure coevolution to pure dispersal, we find that high rates of evolution constrain richness while promoting generalism, partly because pure evolutionary communities become trapped at local evolutionary optima. In contrast, communities shaped by strong immigration tend to be rich in specialist species. Finally, high rates of evolution decrease invasion success in mixed assembly scenarios, a pattern consistent with the phenomenon of community monopolization.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

To our knowledge, a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the physical determinants of lake primary production from a conceptual, process-based perspective has not been performed. To address this knowledge gap, we developed and analyzed 'Lake2D', a process-based, reaction-advection-diffusion model that adopts a 2-dimensional modeling approach by reducing lake bathymetry to its hypsographic depth distribution under the simplifying assumption of radial symmetry of the lake basin. In simpler terms, the model assumes the lake basin is perfectly circular and uses a cross-section to represent its depth and shape. We used Lake2D to explore and analyze the dynamics of pelagic and benthic algae on a whole-lake scale in response to six environmental drivers (lake area and depth, horizontal and vertical turbulent mixing, water transparency and nutrient status), which we varied over ranges that are representative of the vast majority of the world's lakes. Numerical analyses reveal three distinct patterns across environmental parameter space. (1) Benthic algae dominate total biomass in shallow, clear lakes with low nutrient content. In these lakes, low horizontal and vertical mixing is beneficial to benthic but detrimental to pelagic algae, which experience high sinking losses, thus liberating nutrients and minimizing shading of benthic algae. (2) Increasing mean lake depth, abiotic turbidity and/or nutrient content strongly benefits pelagic algae, which increasingly shade out benthic algae and dominate total biomass. In these lakes, increased mixing affects both algal types positively due to increased nutrient transport to shallow, well-lit areas. (3) Finally, at high lake mean depth and/or abiotic turbidity, a large fraction of the lake volume is aphotic. In such lakes, high horizontal and vertical mixing is detrimental to pelagic algae but beneficial to benthic algae, because pelagic algae are mixed to aphotic depths, liberating nutrients and minimizing shading. Moving from shallow, clear lakes via deeper and/or nutrient-rich lakes to very deep and/or turbid lakes, benthic and pelagic algae therefore show opposite gradual biomass shifts in response to vertical and horizontal mixing. Specifically, benthic biomass is highest at low and lowest at high overall mixing in shallow, nutrient-poor lakes, but shows the opposite trend in all other lakes. Conversely, pelagic biomass is highest at low and lowest at high overall mixing in very deep and/or turbid lakes, but shows the opposite trend in all other lakes.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Parameters in these stochastic models are typically inferred using likelihood-based methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Bayesian Inference. However, these approaches exhibit computational tractability issues in the case of models of moderate to high complexity. One approach to increase model complexity while remaining computationally tractable in the context of birth-death modelling is machine learning. So far, these techniques have been explored in the context of serially-sampled phylogenies (phylodynamics) and trait-dependent birth-death models. Here, we explore the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning (DL) method, to solve classification and regression (parameter estimation) tasks under time-varying birth-death models. In particular, we compared six diversification scenarios: Constant Birth-Death, High-Extinction, Mass-Extinction, Diversity-Dependent, Stasis-and-Radiate, and Waxing-and-Waning. We simulated 10,000 phylogenetic trees under each diversification scenario, which were encoded using a vectorization procedure that captures the topology and branch length information. The encoded trees were used to train or test a set of CNNs models that were designed to tailor three empirical case studies differing in the number of tips. We compared CNNs performance with MLE inference. Our results show that CNNs exhibited classification accuracy levels of 93-78%, whereas maximum likelihood estimation achieved levels of 74-70%, using AIC as model selection criterion. The most difficult scenarios to predict for the CNNs were the high-extinction and mass-extinction scenarios, which were often misidentified as one another. For the regression tasks, mean average errors were comparable between CNNs models and MLE inference, and they also coincided in their difficulties to estimate ratio parameters such as mass extinction survival and turnover. Finally, we applied our CNNs to three empirical studies (eucalypts, conifers, and cetaceans) and discussed potential shortcomings and future avenues for improvement in the application of deep-learning birth-death modelling approaches.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

However, the physiological and evolutionary mechanisms driving ELA-mediated developmental plasticity and their consequences for fitness remain unclear. Here, treating young mice with high- or low-dose ampicillin altered the gut microbiome and elicited reduced lean mass and energy expenditure in males to promote increased adult visceral adiposity. High-dose ELA constrained energy availability during treatment, evidenced by reduced growth and cecal short-chain fatty acids, raising the possibility that developmental plasticity under ELA could be adaptive in energy-limited environments. Adult ELA-treated males had reduced fitness under free-fed conditions--driven by smaller body size, fat stores, and impaired immunity--but were buffered against fitness reductions under caloric restriction, consistent with predictive adaptive response models of development. Strikingly, ELA-treated females exhibited none of the proximate metabolic responses observed in males, with adult body size and composition indistinguishable from controls. In the absence of similar developmental plasticity, ELA-treated females exhibited exacerbated fitness reductions under caloric restriction, including lower energetic investments in reproduction and immunity. Our results suggest that ELA exposure elicits sexually dimorphic developmental responses that engender long-term health and fitness consequences dependent on adult nutritional conditions.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

GAUDI is a recently proposed PGS method which overcomes this gap by leveraging local ancestry to estimate ancestry-specific effects, penalizing but allowing ancestry-differential effects. However, the modified fused LASSO approach used by GAUDI is computationally expensive and does not readily accommodate more than two-way admixture. To address these limitations, we introduce HAUDI, an efficient LASSO framework for admixed PGS construction. HAUDI re-parameterizes the GAUDI model as a standard LASSO problem, allowing for extension to multi-way admixture settings and far superior computational speed than GAUDI. In extensive simulations, HAUDI compares favorably to GAUDI while dramatically reducing computation time. In real data applications, HAUDI uniformly out-performs GAUDI across 18 clinical phenotypes, including total triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and shows substantial benefits over an ancestry-agnostic PGS for white blood cell count (WBC) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

It also shows little overlap between CpGs differing in means versus variability. We investigated the role of DNA methylation in aging heterogeneity by performing epigenome-wide differential methylation and variance association analysis in blood samples from 1,445 Canadians aged 45 to 85. We identified 448 differentially methylated (DMRs) and 488 differentially variable regions associated with health decline across health deficit accumulation (i.e. the Frailty Index), cognitive, and physical function. We observed minimal overlap between these types of regions, with distinct gene coverage, highlighting a unique and potentially additional contribution of variability to age-related epigenetic changes. Gene ontology analyses of DMRs revealed enrichment in immune and inflammation-related pathways pointing to immune function as a key driver of aging heterogeneity.

Parasitism rates by Gonatopus wasps (Dryinidae), averaged ~3% but peaked in late summer at over 20%, primarily in M. quadrilineatus. Warmer temperatures and seasonal progression increased both parasitism probability and rates. Genomic analyses revealed at least three Gonatopus lineages, including the first complete mitochondrial genome for the genus from the New World, and confirmed multiple host species. We also recorded the first Canadian occurrence of G. clavipes. Our results demonstrate that parasitoids are active, climate-responsive, and capable of targeting dominant pest species. Together, these findings provide the first ecological and genomic baseline for leafhopper-parasitoid interactions in Canada. They point to the potential of conserving and enhancing native parasitoid populations as a foundation for climate-resilient, pesticide-free pest management strategies.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Using 30 years of sampling data from a well-studied river system in Aotearoa New Zealand, we applied empirically-parameterized Lotka-Volterra competition models across a gradient of flood disturbance regimes to assess the potential for coexistence between threatened native galaxiids and invasive trout. Our models suggest trout dominate under low disturbance regimes, leading to galaxiid extinction. Coexistence peaks at intermediate disturbance regimes, though native fish densities are highly suppressed. Only at high disturbance regimes do native fish prevail, but priority effects are likely. Thus, restoration and conservation efforts focused solely on high disturbance habitats without accompanying biological interventions may not ensure native fish persistence. Further, prioritizing such habitats at the expense of others risks misdirecting resources towards sub-optimal conditions, particularly under climate change.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

L.; Nedved, B. T.; Hadfield, M.

Microbial biofilms induce larval settlement and metamorphosis in marine invertebrates, including corals, but specific molecular cues for corals remain unclear. Glycosylated lipids and polysaccharides from crustose coralline algae (CCA), along with bacterial small molecules, are proposed inducers, but their effects vary by coral species, bacterial strain, and environment, highlighting the need to clarify their molecular basis and specificity. Here, we identify bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), specifically its O-antigen polysaccharide component, as a potent settlement cue for larvae of the coral Pocillopora acuta. Using purified LPS from diverse marine bacteria, we show that inductive activity is bacterial species and strain specific and correlates with the structure of O-antigen. These findings support a glycan-centred mechanism of coral recruitment, implicating microbial surface chemistry as a key determinant of larval settlement. By demonstrating a specific and functional role for O-antigen, we expand the ecological relevance of bacterial glycans beyond immunity and pathogenesis, highlighting their role in key developmental and ecological transitions in marine invertebrates. As coral reefs face escalating environmental pressures, employing such signals offers a promising strategy to enhance larval settlement and support reef restoration.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon of cellular sensitization, termed negative hysteresis, is modulated by the Cpx envelope stress response system and linked to membrane stress during growth. The increase in efficacy is achieved through a beta-lactam induced elevated cellular uptake of the subsequently administered aminoglycoside.

These structures are enriched at regulatory regions such as promoters, CpG islands, untranslated regions (UTRs), enhancers, and replication origins, where they play key roles in transcription and replication. Although prior studies have demonstrated that G4s exhibit higher mutation rates than canonical DNA, little is known about the substitution patterns and selection acting specifically on G4 stems and loops. In this study, we utilized Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome assemblies from human and two non-human great apes (chimpanzee and Bornean orangutan) to analyze substitution spectra and selective constraints within G4s, focusing on differences between stems and loops. We observed that fixed nucleotide substitutions leading to the gain or loss of G4 structures are more frequently located at stems, while those in G4s conserved across species are more often found at loops. On the other hand, single nucleotide polymorphisms had higher frequencies at stems than loops for all G4s, with a particularly high difference for singleton polymorphisms, suggesting higher mutation rates at stems than loops. To evaluate selection, we employed two approaches: we computed the ratio of substitution to polymorphism frequencies at stems vs. loops and performed phylogenetic modeling using PhyloFit. Both methods consistently revealed that stems of shared G4s experience stronger purifying selection than loops, particularly at promoters, enhancers, and UTRs. Our results provide novel insights into the sequence variation and selection of G4s, informing our understanding of their contributions to genome evolution and function.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Its dysregulation plays a role in diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and metabolic conditions. Despite its importance, accurately identifying AS events remains challenging, especially in large-scale studies relying on publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. State-of-the-art AS event detection typically requires deep sequencing with over 100 million reads; however, much of the publicly accessible data is of lower sequencing depth. Recent advances, particularly deep learning models working with genomic sequences, offer new avenues for predicting AS without reliance on high sequencing depth data. Our study addresses the question: Can we utilize the vast repository of publicly available RNA-seq data for AS detection, despite often lacking the sequencing depth typically required? We show that sequence-based tools such as DeepSplice and SpliceAI show promising performance in retrieving novel and unannotated splice junctions, even when RNA-seq data are limited, but are not suitable for de novo splice junction detection. Our results demonstrate the potential of sequence-based tools for initial hypothesis development and as additional filters in standard RNA-seq pipelines, especially when sequencing depth is limited.

The saurosphargid is represented by a single vertebra, whose relatively tall neural spine indicates that it might belong to a new species. This is one of the oldest Sauropterygomorpha records worldwide and the first unambiguous occurrence of Saurosphargidae in the western Paleo-Tethys during the Early Triassic. These new findings suggest fishes were more diverse in this paleo-tropical shallow shelf community of the western Paleo-Tethys in the latest Permian than during the Early Triassic. The evolution of the new apex predator niche (Saurosphargidae) relatively shortly after the mass extinction event coincides with the reappearance of predatory cephalopods and precedes the full ecological and taxonomic recovery of benthic groups in the Dolomites community. This contrasts with previous hypotheses about the delayed recovery of higher trophic groups. Furthermore, we dated a surface sample with actinopterygian scales found at a Permian-Triassic boundary outcrop. The U-Pb indicates 248+/-1 Ma as a maximum depositional age, and radiolarian biostratigraphy indicates an Anisian age. This suggests age assignments to surface samples require caution.

We illuminated a Bryopsidales macroalga (Bryopsis sp.) and a morphologically similar Dasycladales alga (Acetabularia acetabulum), capable of qE, with high light. No differences in the rate of Photosystem II (PSII) damage, probed by the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter FV/FM in the absence and presence of lincomycin, were observed between constant and fluctuating light in Bryopsis sp., nor between the two algae. In Bryopsis sp., however, photoinhibition lead to decreased rates of electron transfer (estimated by fluorescence and oxygen evolution), while a stimulation was observed in A. acetabulum. Compared to A. acetabulum, Bryopsis sp. showed slow PSII repair, but as the rate of repair increased with increasing rates of the damage, the slow repair may not indicate increased oxidative stress but be a regulatory response. We observed, in A. acetabulum, a post-illumination dip in PSII activity and a concurring bump in NPQ, which were removed by an inhibitor of the NDA2-dependent cyclic electron transfer route and enhanced in the presence of inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that these pathways reduce and oxidise, respectively, the plastoquinone pool in the dark in this alga. Nigericin, which prevents the formation of proton gradient and thus qE, increased photoinhibition in A. acetabulum but not in Bryopsis sp..

Their soma is located sub-ependymally and they have a dendritic-like process that ends as a bulb (the so-called apical process; ApPr) inside the CC. It remains unclear how this unique anatomical organization, with the soma and the ApPr located in different extracellular environments, relates to their function as a multimodal sensor of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. One of the main physiological features of CSFcNs is a prominent spontaneous electrical activity mediated by PKD2L1 (or TRPP2) channels, a non-selective cation channel of the TRP family. PKD2L1 channels have a high single-channel conductance (around 200 pS) and can be modulated by protons and mechanical forces. In this work we investigate PKD2L1 channel sensitivity to pH and its effects on CSFcNs excitability. We demonstrate that PKD2L1 spontaneous activity generates not only phasic inward currents, but also a tonic current, both of which are modulated bidirectionally by pH with a high sensitivity around physiological values. By combining electrophysiology (direct recordings from intact and isolated ApPrs) with optical methods (laser-photolysis of protons) we further show that functional PKD2L1 channels are specifically localized in the ApPr. The spatial segregation of PKD2L1 channels, along with their biophysical properties (high single-channel conductance and pH sensitivity) and the ApPr's unique membrane properties (very high input resistance) renders CSFcN excitability exquisitely sensitive to PKD2L1 modulation. Altogether, our findings illustrate how the ApPr's properties are finely tuned to support its sensory role.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission. Higher viral load and broader tropism of EV-A71 did not result in enhanced impairment of neural function. Our results demonstrate that neurotropic non-polio enteroviruses lead to disruption of spontaneous neural activity in a virus-specific manner, which does not correlate with their replication efficiency.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

J.; Fleiszig, S. M. J.", "abstract": "Contact lens wear in humans and mice is consistently associated with asymptomatic corneal parainflammation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the corneal response to lens wear alone can function to protect it against bacterial adhesion enabled by superficial injury. One eye only of mT/mG-LysMcre mice (cell membranes red; Lyz2+ cells green) wore a contact lens for 4-6 days. After lens removal, mice were anesthetized and both corneas superficially-injured before bacterial inoculation with either a mouse eyelid commensal (Macrococcus epidermidis) or a corneal pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Inoculation was repeated hourly for 4 hours under anesthesia before euthanasia. Enucleated eyes were fixed overnight, and adherent bacteria visualized using a universal 16S rRNA-targeted FISH probe (M. epidermidis) or Blue Fluorescent Protein (P. aeruginosa). Confocal imaging and Imaris software were used to quantify bacterial adhesion and location in the epithelium, and also the number, location and morphology of Lyz2+ cells. For both commensal and P. aeruginosa, prior lens wear resulted in reduced adhesion to the superficially injured corneas (~ 55% and ~ 45% respectively). In both instances this correlated with increased numbers of corneal Lyz2+ cells. Other details differed for the two bacterial types. For the commensal, prior lens wear resulted in bacteria penetrating deeper into the epithelium versus contralateral eyes, with Lyz2+ cells extending their processes further into the epithelium and localizing closer to the cornea surface. For P. aeruginosa, prior lens wear resulted in adherent bacteria closer to the cornea surface, and Lyz2+ cells moving further away from it. Moreover, while overall Lyz2+ cell sphericity increased for P. aeruginosa with prior lens wear versus contralateral eyes, it showed no overall change for the commensal. Lyz2+ cell volume in the central cornea was decreased for P. aeruginosa with prior lens wear but increased for the commensal. Thus, corneal responses to prior lens wear can quantitively reduce bacterial adhesion to superficially-injured corneas correlating with a Lyz2+ cell response for both a commensal and a pathogen, with differences in details for the two bacterial types. How continued lens wear supersedes this protective response to promote P. aeruginosa infection pathogenesis remains to be determined, as does the relationship to the Lyz2+ cell response.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Our study investigated the systemic and region-specific responses to Bacteroides colonization in the gut, including sex-related differences, in mice. Utilizing C57BL/6 mice, we administered Bacteroides to conventional, antibiotic-treated mice, then assessed this microbes influence on the gut microbiota composition and inflammatory responses following an airway lipopolysaccharide challenge to assess effects on the gut-lung axis. We found that Bacteroides successfully colonizes the intestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice, particularly the colon lumen of the large intestine as evidenced by 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing and culturing. Differential gene expression analysis using NanoString technology revealed significant immune response variations across the gut regions, with notable differences in adaptive immune response genes. A striking sex-dependent outcome was noted in the regulation of atg12 in the cecum, potentially enhancing autophagic function, particularly in female mice. Additionally, Bacteroides intestinal colonization was associated with altered expression of macrophage markers such as cd163, cd84, and ms4a4a, which may reflect shifts in the macrophage profile within the cecum. These findings pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches that leverage microbial impacts on gut and systemic health, offering a deeper understanding of Bacteroides' role in human health and disease.

PR is translated as part of the Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein, which undergoes autoproteolysis to liberate active, dimeric PR during virus particle maturation. Gag-Pro-Pol is produced via an infrequent -1 frameshifting event in ribosomes translating full length genomic RNA as Gag mRNA. Here, we study the cotranslational folding and autoproteolytic processing of frameshifted transframe-protease-reverse transcriptase (TF-PR-RT) constructs by in vitro translation. We demonstrate partial cotranslational folding of ribosome-bound PR at its conserved -helix near the C terminus. Unexpectedly, we find that the initial dimerization of TF-PR-RT involves ribosome-bound nascent chains that are then not further cleaved. Moreover, only ribosome-bound nascent chains are substrates for PR-catalyzed processing. These observations are consistent with a model for virion assembly in which dimerization of a subset of Pro-Pol precursors leads to cleavage of PR monomers that then carry out the bulk of the proteolytic processing needed for virion maturation and infectivity.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

For example, several ant clades have adapted to nutrient-poor diets through symbiosis with a specific clade of bacteria in the family Bartonellaceae (Hyphomicrobiales), notorious for also including virulent vertebrate pathogens. Here we show that Bartonellaceae phylogenetically placed within the clade that has only encompassed ant symbionts to date -- Candidatus genus Tokpelaia -- have established as symbionts in four different clades of planthoppers (Insecta: Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha). Genome size and contents indicate different levels of integration of these strains into the planthopper host biology, and their diverse roles. Symbionts infecting one of the clades have some of the largest genomes among Bartonellaceae, at ca. 2 Mb, two others are under 700 kb, and the fourth is reduced to barely 158 kb. The planthopper-associated Tokpelaia strains with larger genomes, similarly to ant symbionts, encode multiple amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis genes, complementing the degraded nutritional capabilities of their planthoppers' ancient heritable endosymbionts. Strikingly, the smallest Tokpelaia genome lacks any genes linked to essential amino acid biosynthesis, in contrast to all other known insect-associated bacteria with genomes of comparable size. We identified a single vitamin biosynthesis gene and Fe-S cluster assembly genes as its only putative contributions to the host biology. Our results broaden the host spectrum of non-pathogenic Bartonellaceae, indicating that they have contributed to nutrition and symbiotic consortium function in diverse diet-restricted host clades.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium, has been implicated in oral carcinogenesis through the action of its virulence factor, pyocyanin, a redox-active phenazine that induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and inflammation. Despite evidence linking pyocyanin to ROS-related pathways, its molecular interaction with key host proteins like NADPH oxidase and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) remains unexplored. The present study aims to investigate the molecular interactions of pyocyanin with NADPH oxidase and TLR4 through molecular docking, aiming to elucidate its role in oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms associated with oral cancer pathogenesis. The structures of pyocyanin and the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) and TLR4 target proteins were retrieved from PubChem and RCSB PDB, respectively. CASTp was used to identify potential binding pockets. Molecular docking was performed using the HADDOCK server. The docked complexes were analyzed based on HADDOCK scores, binding energies, root mean square deviation (RMSD), and buried surface area. Interaction profiles were visualized using BIOVIA Discovery Studio. Among the docking clusters, Cluster 6 for the NOX2-pyocyanin complex showed a favorable HADDOCK score of 84.4 plus or minus 2.9, low RMSD of 0.2 plus or minus 0.0, and substantial buried surface area of 456.1 plus or minus 13.2 square angstroms. For the TLR4-pyocyanin complex, Cluster 1 exhibited the most favorable interaction profile with a HADDOCK score of 25.0 plus or minus 5.5 and a Z-score of minus 2.3. Binding site prediction and hydropathy analysis supported the structural feasibility of pyocyanin interaction with both targets. This study provides structural insights into the potential interaction of pyocyanin with NADPH oxidase and TLR4, supporting its role in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling pathways.

We present a minimal phenomenological model that captures these patterns by reducing complex physiology to three variables: a dynamic factor characterizing reversible physiological responses to stress, an entropic damage variable reflecting irreversible information loss, and a regulatory noise term. This framework reveals two fundamental aging regimes. In stable species, including humans, aging is driven by linear damage accumulation that gradually erodes resilience, producing a hyperbolic trajectory toward a maximum lifespan. In unstable species, such as mice and flies, intrinsic instability drives exponential divergence of biomarkers and mortality. Model predictions agree with DNA methylation dynamics, biomarker autocorrelation, and survival curves across taxa. Crucially, this regime-based view informs intervention strategies at three levels: (i) targeting dynamic hallmarks, (ii) reducing physiological noise, and (iii) slowing or reversing entropic damage - offering a roadmap from near-term healthspan gains to potential extension of human lifespan beyond current limits.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Advancing seed microbiome research requires standardized experimental systems for controlled plant-microbe interaction studies, which are currently lacking in seagrass research. Here, we tested fabricated ecosystem devices (EcoFAB 2.0) as a standardized system for growing seedlings of Zostera marina (eelgrass), enabling a controlled study of aquatic plant-microbe interactions. Using these chambers, we addressed three key questions: (i) Can we reliably grow eelgrass in a controlled laboratory setting? (ii) Can we manipulate eelgrass microbiome assembly and its long-term trajectory? and (iii) Can we detect shifts in the microbiome during plant development (host filtering)? Host morphology measurements and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were used to track microbiome assembly across three early developmental stages of the host. We identified 143 ASVs that differed between plants from surface-sterilized versus intact seeds, highlighting the strong influence of epiphytic bacteria on microbiome assembly. We also identified 26 stage-specific indicator ASVs across eelgrass development, suggesting stage-specific microbial associations during seedling establishment. This work demonstrates the potential for targeted manipulation of the microbiome in seagrass for restoration efforts.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

As a cheap and effective drug therapy for all human disease-causing Schistosoma species, usage of PZQ underpins mass drug administration strategies aimed at eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. Concern over the potential emergence of resistance to PZQ is therefore warranted, as it would constitute a major threat to this approach. In terms of molecular adaptations conferring PZQ resistance, variation in the sequence and/or expression of the drug target is an obvious mechanism and should be a priority for surveillance efforts. The target of PZQ is a transient receptor potential ion channel, TRPMPZQ, which is established as a locus that regulates schistosome sensitivity to PZQ. Here, we describe the establishment of a community resource, TRPtracker, which coalesces data on TRPMPZQ natural variants together with measurements of individual variant sensitivity to PZQ. A compendium of laboratory-generated mutants in TRPMPZQ is also compiled in TRPtracker to map regions within TRPMPZQ critical for PZQ sensitivity. Aggregation of data from multiple research groups into TRPtracker permits rapid community-wide exchange of data, cataloguing which TRPMPZQ variants have been functionally profiled, where geographically these variants have been found, their frequency within populations and their potential impact on PZQ sensitivity.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Since its discovery in 1955, OROV has caused multiple outbreaks in South and Central America, with a new introduction in Cuba since May 2024. Recent travel-related cases in Europe and the Americas underscore its potential for global dissemination. Assessing vector competence outside endemic regions is critical in the context of global travel and climate change. We evaluated the vector competence of three mosquito species commonly found in Europe, Culex (Cx.) pipiens, Aedes (Ae.) albopictus, and Anopheles (An.) atroparvus, using two OROV strains: the prototype TRVL9760 (1955, Trinidad and Tobago) and a recent isolate OROV-IRCCS-SCDC_1/2024 (2024, imported from Cuba to Italy). Mosquitoes were orally infected and examined at 7- and 14-days post-infection. We assessed infection (body), dissemination (peripheral tissues), and transmission potential (saliva) by measuring infectious virus particles using the gold standard focus-forming assays. Our findings show that Cx. pipiens and An. atroparvus were not susceptible to infection or did not allow transmission with OROV. In Ae. albopictus, low infection rates were observed: 6.7% of mosquitoes showed infection at day 7 with the prototype strain, and 3.1% at day 14 with OROV-IRCCS-SCDC_1/2024. All infected mosquitoes showed viral dissemination, but none had infectious virus in their saliva, indicating low risk for transmission. These results confirm limited vector competence of European mosquito species for OROV and emphasize the importance of continued entomological surveillance to inform future risk assessments.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Oxford Nanopore Technologys nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS), an approach that selectively enriches or depletes for target genomes or genetic loci, provides an opportunity to generate real-time genomic insights into tick-borne pathogens. In the current study, we performed PCR and NAS on pooled Borrelia burgdorferi-infected and -uninfected ticks to evaluate the diagnostic capability of NAS. We found that NAS generates extensive datasets on tick-borne pathogens from individual ticks that aid in distinguishing true and false positive samples. Using a pooled approach consisting of whole genomic DNA from 168 total ticks multiplexed over seven sequencing experiments, our results indicated that NAS is extremely specific (0.97 [95% CI: 0.93, 1.00]) with moderate sensitivity (0.48 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.55]), suggesting a strong capacity to confirm B. burgdorferi when present at the expense of an elevated false-negative rate.

We asked whether the yellow mistletoe Loranthus europaeus shifts the timing or reduces the magnitude of radial growth in Quercus robur, and whether any penalty is strongest near climatic optima for host growth. We instrumented 34 mature oaks across age (young, old), canopy position (solitary, closed-canopy), and infection (infected, non-infected) with point dendrometers at 15-minute intervals for four growing seasons (2020-2023). Air and soil temperatures and soil moisture were logged concurrently. We derived growth phenology, difference curves (non-infected minus infected), monthly climate-growth correlations, and response surfaces in temperature-moisture space. Growth phenology was consistent among years: onset around day-of-year 120-140, peak 150-220, cessation 250-270. Mistletoe did not shift onset or cessation but reduced growth amplitude, especially in high-growth years and solitary, well lit trees. Suppression was greatest near climatic optima (approximately 10-18 degrees C with adequate soil moisture) and diminished when conditions were suboptimal (hot and dry or cold and wet), so infected and non-infected converged. Short-term climate-growth relationships were similar across infection status: temperature effects were negative during the main season, whereas soil moisture effects were positive. Young, solitary, non-infected trees responded more to mid-summer moisture than infected trees, consistent with infection shifting hosts from resource-tracking to stress-limited growth under exposure. Joint temperature-moisture response surfaces for infected versus non-infected trees were highly similar, indicating that mistletoe reduces growth magnitude, not niche. Our results identify the environmental window in which host-parasite competition bites hardest and provide a baseline for forecasting parasite impacts under shifting temperature and moisture regimes. Because the largest penalties arise near growth optima, the frequency of cool, moist periods may modulate impacts at the stand scale, particularly for solitary oaks at woodland-grassland ecotones. Integrating fine-scale growth with microclimate clarifies when hemiparasites depress performance and why effects vary across years, sites and canopy contexts.

Here, we assayed the promoter activity of 17,129 random, synthetic DNA sequences and 91,866 E. coli genomic DNA sequences. Genomic DNA encodes ~1.3 times more promoters than random DNA. We then studied 584,573 point mutations in 225 random and 60 genomic sequences, and asked how they cause the emergence of de-novo promoters. We find that de-novo promoters emerge ~3 times more readily from random DNA than from genomic DNA.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), persists as a major global health threat, partly due to its capacity to neutralize host-derived ROS toxicity. While DNA methylation deficiency is known to attenuate Mtb virulence, the specific role of DNA methyltransferases in mycobacterial survival under oxidative stress remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the mycobacterial protein Rv3204 functions as an N4-methylcytosine (m4C) DNA methyltransferase. Deletion of the Rv3204 homolog (Ms_1939) in Mycobacterium smegmatis significantly impaired bacterial survival upon rifampicin exposure. This phenotype was associated with heightened intracellular ROS accumulation and a failure to upregulate transcription of ROS detoxification genes. Furthermore, the mutant exhibited downregulated expression of DNA repair genes and increased susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, ofloxacin). Crucially, the Ms_1939 deletion strain displayed elevated levels of DNA damage. To our knowledge, this is the first study establishing a direct link between an m4C DNA methyltransferase and ROS homeostasis in mycobacteria.

While DNA methylation has dominated the literature on epigenetic control of gene expression in ecological systems, alternative epigenetic layers may provide additional insight into mechanisms of gene expression regulation. This study investigates the role of chromatin accessibility in influencing gene expression in the reef-building coral Acropora millepora, especially in response to thermal stress. We find that highly accessible regions of chromatin, or open chromatin, are predominantly located in distal intergenic regions, promoters, and introns. Genes with open promoters exhibit increased expression and reduced variability, suggesting that chromatin accessibility may influence gene expression plasticity. The baseline state of promoter accessibility is weakly correlated with the expression response to heat stress, suggesting chromatin state can influence organismal response to environmental stress. This study contributes new insights into regulatory mechanisms important for responding to acute environmental stressors. This work also establishes a foundation to investigate the interactions between chromatin accessibility, additional epigenetic layers, and how the dynamics of these interacting epigenetic layers contribute to adaptive molecular and cellular responses, which will be critical for understanding organismal resilience to ongoing environmental change.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

In vivo cell-based lipid uptake assays further support the transport of these lipids. To understand the basis of this substrate promiscuity, we analyzed cryo-EM structures of the complex with occluded lipids. These structures revealed that the water network surrounding the lipid headgroup plays a critical role in enabling Drs2-Cdc50 to recognize different lipids.

The relevant Notch1-DLL-4 and 4{beta}1-integrin-VCAM-1 interactions are known to respond to mechanical forces that regulate their bond dissociation behaviors and downstream signal transduction, yet manipulating the mechanosensitive features of these key receptor-ligand interactions in thymopoiesis has been largely ignored in current ETN designs. Here, we demonstrate that human T-cell development from cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs is regulated via molecular cooperativity in notch1 and integrin-mediated mechanotransduction. Mechanically confining interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel-based 3D cell culture comprised of collagen type I and alginate polysaccharides functionalized with DLL-4 and VCAM-1 is used as a model viscoelastic 3D ETN to manipulate human progenitor (pro)T-cell differentiation. This ETN enables orthogonal control of the mechanical and biomolecular features of the thymic niche, including thymopoietic ligand density, modulus, and viscoelastic properties (e.g., stress relaxation kinetics). We identify that soft, viscous matrices that enhance activation of the notch1-pathway, and subsequently notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) nuclear import sustain the T-cell development gene regulatory network during proT-cell differentiation. Conversely, stiff, elastic matrices inhibit HSC commitment to the T-lineage, and rather promotes Myeloid-cell differentiation.

The EmC model, designed originally for inflammatory breast cancer, is characterized by media viscosity and mechanical rocking of the culture vessel. Notably, cells in EmC showed a distinct and durable reduction in cell proliferation while demonstrating increased capacity to establish experimental lung metastases. Ultrastructural quantitative analysis of electron microscopy images suggested that cells in EmC acquire nuclear and mitochondrial features that resemble those of tumor tissue. Proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and metabolic flux analyses showed that cells in EmC and SphC favor mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, respectively. EmC rendered cells hypersensitive to OXPHOS inhibition, yet more resistant to oxidative stress. Several genes associated with lung metastasis, including ID1, were specifically enriched in EmC.

However, despite an aggressive treatment regimen, drug refractoriness is a major hindrance to successful therapy. We previously identified key transcriptomic alterations essential for the survival of OS cells following CDDP exposure. In the present study, we further demonstrate that CDDP treatment resulted in a ROS-dependent enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the upstream promoter regions of growth-promoting genes such as CCNA2, and on the promoter of the negative regulator of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP)- LATS1, thereby contributing to their transcriptional repression. This was associated with a growth arrest, and quenching of ROS with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reversed it. Importantly, repression of LATS1 led to an increased nuclear localization of YAP, while pharmacological or genetic ablation of YAP reduced CDDP-mediated induction of repressive marks. YAP was further found to co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalytic member- the histone methyl transferase-EZH2, indicating its putative role in mediating transcriptional repression. In lieu of the above, inhibition of YAP or reversal of the repressive chromatin state using a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sensitized OS cells to a low-dose CDDP treatment as well.

Under the current presidential administration, however, grant terminations have been common, with thousands of grants terminated across federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation. Although there have been scattered reports of the impact of these terminations on individual researchers, there has not yet been a systematic investigation of the impact on the overall scientific community. Methods: As part of a survey for a larger study, we asked researchers involved in T32 training programs how likely they would be to go into science if they were a graduate student now (Likert-type item) and how federal funding changes have affected them and their labs (open-ended). We report mean and standard deviation for the Likert-type item (1=Not at all likely, 5=Extremely likely), and we performed inductive thematic analysis to analyze the open-ended responses. Two independent raters coded responses, developed a codebook, and applied the codebook to all responses. The interrater reliability was high, 0.84. Results: Of the 490 researchers invited to participate in the survey, 277 (response rate 56.5%) completed it in full. Participants were relatively unlikely to choose to pursue science again, with only about one-third being somewhat or more likely to do so. Two hundred twenty-three people responded to the open-ended item about how federal funding changes have affected them. Coding resulted in 48 unique codes which fell into four themes: Impact on Finances, Impact on Trainees, Impact on Science, and Well-being. Participants described instability in their labs, concern for trainees' well-being and careers, concern about the future of the entire scientific enterprise, and negative impacts on their and others' well-being. Discussion: Our data demonstrates the significant, overwhelmingly negative impact of the changes in federal funding on researchers involved in training the next generation of scientists. Not only are they concerned about how they can continue to do the work they have dedicated their lives to, but they are also worried about the future of science in the United States. This latter concern stems not only from the decreasing availability and reliability of federal funding but also due to the impact all this is having on trainees' ability to do their research and find jobs where they can do science. These data are a call to action to our federal agencies, institutions, other agencies, and donors who understand the value of science to support researchers through these uncertain times.

Epithelial cells exhibited subtype diversity and plasticity, with distinct gene expression programs and chromatin accessibility profiles emerging over time.

Its environmental and biological effects have been investigated in the past, however, few studies have focused on its crystal structure-specific effects. In our experiments, the toxicity of two types of nanoparticles was examined on primary neural cultures with different cell-compositions, using MTT and LDH assays. Primary murine cell cultures containing only astroglia cells originated from two brain regions, as well as mixed neurons and glia cells or microglia cells exclusively, were treated with anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles at varying concentrations for 24 or 48 hours. Our results show that neither anatase nor rutile nanoparticles reduced viability in cell cultures containing a mixture of neurons and glial cells, independently of the applied concentration and treatment time. Rutile but not anatase form induced cell death in cortical astroglia cultures already at 24 hours of treatment above 10 g/mL, while hippocampus-derived glial cultures were much less sensitive to rutile. The rutile form also damaged microglia. These findings suggest that products containing rutile-form nano-titanium particles may pose a targeted risk to astroglia and microglial cells in the central nervous system.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

LAMA2 mutations leading to complete laminin-211 absence result in an invariably severe clinical phenotype, with profound muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. Milder phenotypes are often associated with mutations allowing the production of a partially functional protein. While several dysregulated genes/pathways linked to LAMA2-RD muscle loss are known, an in-depth characterization of LAMA2-RD muscle gene expression profile in patients with mutations differentially affecting LAMA2 expression is lacking. We generated muscle transcriptomic data from patients with either complete or partial laminin-211 deficiency, and identified pathways linked to the most dysregulated processes. Genes related to fibrosis, inflammation and metabolism were similarly expressed in both patient cohorts. However, a subset of novel pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes were exclusively expressed in patients (and mice) completely lacking laminin-211, indicating aspects exacerbated in this cohort.

Objective: To test my hypothesis that pan-TREM-1 and macrophage-restricted TREM-1 blockades may differ in their efficacy in cancer and other inflammatory diseases. Methods: Ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides GF9 and GA31 (the latter in a form of macrophage-targeted lipopeptide complexes, GA31-LPC) were used as pan-TREM-1 and macrophage-restricted TREM-1 inhibitors, respectively, to test the hypothesis in multiple animal models of cancer, sepsis, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Results: In fully immunocompetent mice, GA31-LPC but not GF9 overcomes pancreatic cancer resistance to PD-L1 blockade and synergizes with immunotherapy. In PANC-1 xenograft-bearing athymic nude mice, GF9 and GA31-LPC both increase complete response rate and survival when combined with chemotherapy but exhibit opposing dependence on timing of treatment initiation. GF9 is effective only when given with but not after chemotherapy. In contrast, GA31-LPC is effective only when given after but not together with chemotherapy. Critical dependence of the therapeutic efficacy of TREM-1 blockade on the type of blocker and treatment timing was also observed in animal models of sepsis and acute lung injury but not fibrosis. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that pan-TREM-1 and macrophage-restricted TREM-1 blockades may strikingly differ in their therapeutic efficacy depending on the disease, timing of treatment initiation and the type and stage of inflammatory response. This opens new avenues for development of TREM-1-targeting strategies and leads to a new framework for the treatment of cancer and other inflammation-associated diseases.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

These infections are caused by antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens such as the emerging pathogen, Mycobacterium abscessus, a nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which causes recalcitrant infections with high resistance to antibiotics. M. abscessus adapts over time of colonisation to the conditions in the CF lung, hampering effective treatment. The mechanisms underlying this pathoadaptation are poorly understood and are critical for the development of future therapies. Sequential isolate pairs of M. abscessus from three people with CF were examined for adaptive changes over time of infection. Genomic analysis confirmed that these isolate pairs were clonal. The late infection isolates showed increased host cell attachment to CF bronchial epithelial cells and increased intracellular survival in macrophages, indicative of adaptation to the CF lung environment. Late isolates also showed changes in their proteomes, including changes in abundance of proteins with roles in intracellular survival and antibiotic resistance. Overall, it is clear that M. abscessus can adapt to the CF lung environment and improve its ability to interact with host cells.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Viruses can rapidly adapt and evolve to new, unfavorable environments due to their decreased replication fidelity, large reproductive index, and short life cycle. Often these adaptations that enable increased fitness in a new, specialized environment comes with a trade-off of decreased fitness in a standard, general environment. Understanding the tradeoffs of generalist and specialist viruses has provided important insight into vaccine development, mechanism of action of antivirals, and function of viral proteins. Here, we sought to identify how a specialist murine norovirus (MNV) could be converted to a generalist without a simple reversion of a genetic mutation. Previously, we found that a mutation in MNV (NS6F182C) overcame restriction by host protein Trim7 but decreased the efficiency of viral polyprotein NS6-7 cleavage and resulted in attenuation of this specialist virus. Here, we find that a single valine-to-isoleucine mutation in MNV non-structural protein NS4 (NS4V11I) is sufficient to rescue the attenuated replication of specialist NS6F182C over multiple cycles of replication. However, NS4V11I did not affect the defective polyprotein cleavage but instead the NS4V11I mutation facilitates faster viral spread in vitro independent of interferon signaling. The emergence of this mutation in NS4V11I suggests an unappreciated connection between NS4 and NS6 during norovirus replication and provides a system to define the unknown role of norovirus NS4 during infection.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Although the roles of the GTPase and stalk domains during infection are increasingly elucidated, the function of the different NTDs is not fully understood. Using cell lines stably expressing Mx proteins, we show that MxB(1-715) but not MxA inhibited infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). Quantitative mass spectrometry and subviral fractionation experiments indicate that MxB(1-715) was packaged into the tegument of HSV-1 and PrV virions, but not MxB(26-715) or MxA(1-662). Moreover, we generated recombinant proteins N-terminally fused to different NTD peptides and showed that MxB(1-91), MxB(1-35), and to a lesser extent MxB(26-91) bound to isolated HSV-1 capsids, while MxA(1-43) did not. Our findings indicate that the NTD of MxB is crucial to restrict HSV-1 and PrV infections, that newly assembled virions package MxB into the tegument around the capsid, and that the N-terminal and the C-terminal part of the MxB-NTD contribute to its binding to herpesviral capsids.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

These nuclear roles of MCL1, however, remain poorly characterized. Using a newly validated monoclonal antibody across several cell lines and treatments, we find no evidence that MCL1 enhances chemoresistance or preferentially accumulates in the nucleus after drug exposure. Proximity biotinylation identified novel nuclear MCL1 interactors but did not recover previously reported DNA repair or cell cycle partners.

We show that while lung fibroblast YAP signaling declines with senescence induction, senescent fibroblasts maintain their mechanosensing capabilities with increased YAP nuclear localization on higher stiffness hydrogels. Most notably, we find a unique role for hydrogel viscoelasticity in senescence induction with soft (2 kPa) viscoelastic substrates promoting both the onset and amplification of senescence, even in the absence of genotoxic stress. These changes are not associated with a decline in YAP activity, but instead with a decline in nuclear DAPI intensity, suggesting a role of nuclear organization in driving this phenotype.

Here we propose a framework for context-aware enrichment of single-cell RNA sequencing data by aligning data-derived and literature-derived representations in a shared embedding space.

Lightweight encoder-only language models are trained jointly on both sources to learn a common embedding space, thus integrating additional layers of information from biomedical literature. Analyzing the joint embedding space, we show that biomedical literature can be meaningfully aligned with single-cell profiles to enrich standard analysis workflows. The trained models achieve robust annotation, capture functional states such as cytotoxicity, and reveal disease associations from literature-aligned embeddings.

Linking genotypes and phenotypes using machine learning (ML) offers great promise, but its use is limited by poor accessibility, overestimated performance, and a 'data-cliff' - a gap between abundant sequences and scarce functional measurements. To develop more robust methods for genotype-phenotype prediction, an outstanding model system is opsin genes, visual pigments with extensive phenotypic information that strongly influence animal spectral sensitivity. Here we advance ML characterization of the opsin genotype-phenotype map through four main contributions. First, we introduce the Opsin Phenotype Tool for Inference of Color Sensitivity (OPTICS), a user-friendly platform for predicting maximum wavelength sensitivity (lambda-max) from amino-acid sequences. Second, we show that encoding sequences with amino-acid physicochemical properties improves predictive performance and reveals mechanistic relationships. Third, we develop Phylogenetically Weighted Cross-Validation (PW-CV), a method that accounts for non-independence among related sequences, providing more realistic assessments of model generalizability. Finally, we present the Mine-N-Match (MNM) pipeline, which systematically links published opsin sequences to compiled in-vivo {lambda}max data, expanding genotype-phenotype coverage and improving prediction, especially for invertebrate opsins with undersampled heterologous data. By integrating accessible software, biologically informed encoding, phylogeny-aware evaluation, and data harmonization, our framework improves confidence, accuracy, and interpretability of genotype-phenotype prediction.

Beyond its cardiac consequences, CAD significantly impacts brain health, causing grey matter atrophy, reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and cognitive decline. Recent evidence also highlights altered cerebral metabolism in CAD, characterized by reduced cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Notably, impaired cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by reduced peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), is a hallmark of CAD progression and a strong prognostic marker of cardiovascular and neurological outcomes. Although VO2peak is associated with brain structural integrity and cognitive function, its relationship to cerebral vascular and metabolic function in CAD patients remains poorly understood. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy individuals (age=65.35 {+/-} 8.31) and thirty-five patients with CAD (age=66.42 {+/-} 9.29) participated in this study. The objective was to determine whether higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with markers of cerebral health known to be impaired in CAD, in order to assess the potential of exercise as a strategy to mitigate CAD-related brain alterations. Cerebral vascular and metabolic biomarkers, including CBF, CVR, CMRO2, and OEF, were quantified using calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants also completed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Results: Across all participants, VO2peak was positively associated with CBF ({beta}=0.32, p=0.02), and CVR ({beta}=0.002, p=0.04), in grey matter, confirming a link between aerobic fitness and vascular health across the cardiovascular health spectrum. However, metabolic markers exhibited group-specific patterns. Specifically, in CAD patients, VO2peak was positively associated with CMRO2 ({beta}= 0.08, p = 0.02), suggesting that reduced CMRO2 in CAD may be partially preserved by greater cardiorespiratory fitness. In contrast, a negative association between VO2peak and OEF was observed exclusively in healthy controls ({beta} = -3.6, p = 0.02), consistent with adaptations in healthy aging being primarily driven by improved CBF without changes in CMRO2. Conclusion: This study shows that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with improved cerebral vascular and metabolic function, with distinct patterns observed between healthy individuals and those with CAD. In patients with CAD, greater fitness appears to preserve cerebral oxygen metabolism, while in healthy individuals, fitness is primarily linked to enhanced perfusion. These findings support the role of aerobic exercise as a promising strategy to counteract CAD-related brain alterations, emphasizing the importance of targeting cardiorespiratory fitness in both prevention and rehabilitation settings.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

TET2 mutation is a frequent driver of CH that progresses in a positive feedback loop in response to microbial signals suggesting that B12 may influence CH via the gut microbiome. We evaluated the microenvironmental effects of B12 supplementation in a Tet2-deficient model of CH and found that B12 enhances myelopoiesis, heightens the responses of myeloid cells to bacterial stimuli, and increases the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. B12 supplementation also induced gut dysbiosis and reduced the levels of SCFA-producing bacteria in both wild-type and Tet2-deficient mice. Importantly, the effects of excess B12 were reversible upon oral supplementation with the SCFA butyrate.

We performed unilateral renal denervation on six rabbits and instrumented these rabbits with bilateral renal flow probes and arterial pressure telemeters to allow for measurement of sympathetic vasomotion. After a two-week recovery period, the rabbits then underwent controlled blood withdrawal via an auricular arterial catheter to simulate hemorrhage. Differences between innervated and denervated kidneys in admittance gain, phase shift, and coherence increased significantly prior to increases in heart rate or decreases in blood pressure.

Here, we developed and characterized a panel of stable neuronal cell lines in two human cellular models (SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and ReNcell VM neural progenitors) overexpressing GFP-tagged wild-type (WT) or A53T mutant -syn at low and high overexpression levels. Utilizing this framework, we demonstrated that A53T consistently induces cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in both cell types. In contrast, WT -syn had divergent effects depending on the cellular context. In SH-SY5Y cells, it enhanced mitochondrial function and viability, whereas in ReNcell VM cells, the same protein triggered mitochondrial impairment and elevated oxidative stress. This opposing metabolic response was reflected in increased respiratory activity in SH-SY5Y cells and a marked decline across WT -syn overexpressing ReNcell VM. Importantly, post-translational modification (PTM) landscape of overexpressed WT -syn varied dramatically by cell type. ReNcell VM cells exhibited more robust modifications signatures, even in the absence of overt aggregation, which highlights a cell-type-specific PTM landscape that may contribute to differential vulnerability. Our findings underscore a complex interplay between -syn dosage, mutational status, cellular environment, and PTM profiles highlighting that neuronal vulnerability in PD is context-dependent.

Our findings demonstrate that antibody repertoire profiling captures distinct microbial exposure histories across both geographic regions and rural-urban gradients and correlates with variation in immune signatures. This work establishes PhIP-seq as a powerful tool for linking environmental exposure histories to population-level immune landscapes and provides insights into immune adaptation across diverse environments.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

We demonstrated the protective ability of certain ferric salts typical for Archean waters, notably iron trichloride and ferric ammonium citrate, against liposome destruction by short-wavelength UV by shielding the liposomes with cuvettes filled with ferric salts. In the present study, we investigate the interaction with UV for the liposomes with negative buoyancy that sink naturally in ferric salt solutions. We examined two scenarios: 1) liposomes submerged in the FeCl3 solution prior to the UV exposure, a scenario mimicking the nighttime submergence; and 2) submergence under UV exposure, a relevant daytime scenario. We use custom-designed micron-sized, negative-buoyant (heavy), UV-sensitive liposomes. The results showed that for the nighttime scenario, all liposomes were free from UV damage when given sufficient time to submerge in a protective ferric salt solution. Given that larger and heavier liposomes submerge faster, we hypothesize that simple sugar molecules, such as ribose, which is a vital component of RNA, can serve as the proposed heavy molecules in Origin of Life scenarios. Conversely, the daytime scenario results indicate that liposomes slowly submerging under UV exposure sustain some damage. The results of these experiments, which aim to simulate natural events, showed that negative buoyancy and short-wavelength UV radiation could serve as natural drivers in the novel scenario of Darwinian liposome evolution.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

However, the genetic and environmental factors influencing protein and amino acid composition, particularly the role of genotype - environment interaction (GEI), remain partially uncovered. This study evaluated 15 diverse lentil genotypes across seven agronomic trials spanning multiple years, sowing seasons, and locations to assess the effects of genotype, environment, and GEI on crude protein (CP), crude protein yield (CPY), total amino acids (TAA), and total amino acid yield (TAAY). Advanced statistical models such as AMMI, GGE, and WAASB were employed to dissect the contributions of genetic and environmental components and to identify stable, high-performing genotypes. Results revealed significant phenotypic variation for CP, Amino Acids (AA), and TAA among genotypes. Seasonal variation, especially between autumn and spring sowings, was the primary environmental driver of GEI for both CP and CPY. Notably, some landraces (PI_431710_LSP, PI_431739_LSP, PI_431753_LSP, IG_1959) demonstrated both high productivity and stability across environments, while others excelled in specific mega-environments identified through GGE analysis. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating into lentil breeding programs, stability and adaptability, and a more comprehensive approach to measure the yield (e.g., CPY, MegaJoule, ammino acid composition and TAAY), which takes into account the quality and the effective energetic production of a crop. From this perspective, we highlight landraces as valuable sources of genetic diversity for improving yield. This work provides a foundation for targeted breeding strategies aimed at developing lentil varieties with enhanced protein content, balanced amino acid profiles, and resilience to environmental variability.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the impact of FAIMS resolution tuning via electrode temperature modulation to improve peptide identification sensitivity. We demonstrate that lowering FAIMS resolution broadens the compensation voltage window, thereby increasing ion transmission. This low-resolution mode significantly improves peptide identifications from a concentration range of HeLa digests by up to 18%. A weaker but still beneficial effect in peptide identifications and enhanced sensitivity could also be reproduced for single-cell samples. This leads to proteomic fingerprint shifts, resulting in distinct populations in principal component analysis from the very same cell-type in dependence on FAIMS resolution. Moreover, the increased ion counts of runs employing low-resolution FAIMS improve the quantitative precision of low-load measurements. These findings offer a practical optimization strategy for FAIMS-based low-input proteomics workflows, that allow for improved results by changing a single setting within the MS method without the need of any change in hardware adoption or data analysis pipelines.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Biohybrid neurotechnologies aim to overcome this limitation by integrating living tissue components that can promote long-term performance and functional integration with the nervous system. However, existing biomaterial coatings often lack the physiological complexity, cellular heterogeneity, and neurotrophic support required to sustain neural network formation. Here, we present a modular strategy which leverages astrocyte-guided mechanisms of neural network development. A biosynthetic hydrogel was developed using norbornene-functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin (PVA-GEL), crosslinked via visible light- triggered thiol-ene chemistry, to yield bioactive and highly tuneable scaffolds. A systematic characterization varying gelatin content and polymer weight enabled the identification an optimal formulation to promote astrocytic growth, while maintaining mechanical stability and degradation profiles that are compatible with brain implants. Co-encapsulation with neural progenitors promoted neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and the formation of synaptically competent networks. The construct developed into functional interfaces when in contact with brain tissue ex vivo, highlighting its potential as a biohybrid electrode coating.

We evaluate performance under five realistic annotation scenarios, including missing, erroneous, boundary-missing and mixed, batch-specific, and auto-generated labels, using nine established integration metrics. While semi-supervised methods show gains with perfect annotations, their robustness declines sharply under practical imperfections. Only scANVI and ssSTACAS maintain stable but modest improvements relative to their unsupervised counterparts, while none consistently outperform the strongest unsupervised method, scCRAFT.

While Aldo is believed to predominantly originate from the adrenal glands, this study provides evidence to support the involvement of intrarenal Aldo biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of ischemic nephropathy and hypertension in a two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) model. Methods: We generated inducible renal tubule-specific deletion of C11B2 (RT C11B2 KO) and characterized the phenotype during the 2K1C procedure. We investigated the underlying mechanisms involving the use of mice with collecting duct-specific (pro)renin receptor (CD PRR KO) or renin (CD renin KO). Results: RT C11B2 KO induced a partial blockade of the hypertensive response but a much greater improvement in renal fibrosis and inflammation four weeks post-2K1C. This phenotype was associated with an effective blockade of intrarenal generation of Aldo contrasting to unchanged circulating Aldo concentrations. Furthermore, clipping-induced acute kidney injury was also attenuated 24 hours post-2K1C, at which point blood pressure (BP) did not increase. Similarly, sodium nitroprusside effectively lowered BP in C57BL/6j/2K1C mice but failed to improve renal injury. Additionally, we identified CD) PRR and renin as key upstream regulators of intrarenal Aldo biosynthesis following the 2K1C procedure. Conclusions: Together, these results support the idea that CD PRR/renin-dependent generation of intrarenal Aldo may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of ischemic nephropathy and a secondary role in hypertension development during renovascular constriction. Therefore, targeting intrarenal Aldo biosynthesis may represent a more effective and safer intervention than existing Aldo-targeted therapy to manage ischemic nephropathy as well as hypertension.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

This mechanism imposes enormous and prolonged energetic demands at synapses, yet it is unclear how these needs are met in a sustained manner. Mitochondria serve as a local energy supply for dendritic spines, providing instant and sustained energy during synaptic plasticity. However, it remains unclear whether dendritic mitochondria restructure their energy production unit to meet the sustained energy demands. We developed a correlative light and electron microscopy pipeline with deep-learning-based segmentations and 3D reconstructions to quantify mitochondrial remodeling at 2 nm pixel resolution during homeostatic plasticity. Using light microscopy, we observe global increases in dendritic mitochondrial length, as well as local increases in mitochondrial area near spines. Examining the mitochondria near spines using electron microscopy, we reveal increases in mitochondrial cristae surface area, cristae curvature, endoplasmic reticulum contacts, and ribosomal cluster recruitment, accompanied by increased ATP synthase clustering within mitochondria using single-molecule localization microscopy. Using mitochondria- and spine-targeted ATP reporters, we demonstrate that the local structural remodeling of mitochondria corresponds to increased mitochondrial ATP production and spine ATP levels. These findings suggest that mitochondrial structural remodeling is a key underlying mechanism for meeting the energy requirements of synaptic and network function.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Two groups of participants (gamers and controls) completed a Probabilistic Selection Task assessing learning from positive and negative feedback across three phases: learning, test, and transfer. Mixed-effects modeling revealed that gamers showed enhanced learning trajectories, particularly under high-uncertainty conditions, greater sensitivity to accumulated rewards, and a more exploitative decision pattern compared to controls. In the test phase, gamers demonstrated higher accuracy, especially on difficult stimulus pairs, suggesting superior consolidation of probabilistic value representations. However, no group differences emerged in transfer-phase approach/avoidance biases or decision consistency. These findings suggest that habitual video game experience enhances dynamic feedback integration and value updating in uncertain contexts, but does not alter stable reinforcement learning biases.

Here, we identify a network of coordinated immune cell types, which exhibit differential disruption across progression groups. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile 2.2 million immune cells from 35 ALS patients stratified by progression rate and 9 healthy controls, we find that the extent of immune dysfunction cannot be reflected by examining differences in individual cell type frequencies. In contrast, analyses of correlation patterns between cell types revealed distinct immune organization patterns, where coordination complexity varied with disease progression. Across all progression groups, we observed striking immune reorganization in natural killer (NK) cells and a major shift from B cell/basophil coordination hubs in healthy controls to neutrophil/T cell-dominated patterns in ALS. Having established coordinated immune patterns, we developed machine learning models to further improve our ability to stratify between disease and non-disease cohorts, achieving superior performance compared to models using cell frequencies alone. Central and effector memory (CM/EM) CD4+ T cell interactions emerged as top discriminative features for disease status, while plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) relationships, especially their ratio with regulatory T cells (T-regs), distinguished progression rates, supporting T-reg-based therapeutic approaches. These findings reframe ALS as a disease of immune coordination breakdown, pointing towards cell-type specific therapeutics and biomarkers that may extend beyond ALS to other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by immune dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

Participants were presented with an ever-changing array of multiple overlapping, semi-transparent five-letter words, in a stimulus we dubbed a 'palimpsest'. These letter arrays mostly consisted of nonsense strings, but every two seconds, two actual words briefly appeared consecutively (and typically subliminally), superimposed upon the nonsense letter array. Participants were asked to name all words that they recognized. One group of participants observed only visual stimuli, while a second group additionally received an acoustic stimulus: a drum beat that was timed to co-occur with some, but not all, of the words in the array. Participants provided with this additional synchronized auditory information were able to detect more words from the array, and the words that they recognized were typically those that coincided with the dominant acoustic beat. This shows that when visually presented words are difficult to detect, acoustic cues can improve word recognition by dynamically focusing participants' attention upon specific moments in time. We also found that the auditory rhythm continued to affect visual perception after the sound fade fades away. A third group heard the drum beat only for the first four seconds, after which it faded away for the remaining 76 seconds of a trial. Like the continuous beat in condition two, the transient acoustic rhythm continued to influence participants' perception of the written words, even after its cessation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that dynamic, temporal aspects of visual perception can be strongly influenced by periodic auditory input, and that this results from the entrainment of an endogenous multi-modal attentive process. The implications for neural models of dynamic attention are discussed.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}

A. B.; Brown, S.", "abstract": "Estimating deamidation from MALDI-TOF MS spectra of bones has most frequently been achieved using the q2e method due to its high-throughput capacity and ease of use. Despite this accessibility, q2e is only capable of estimating deamidation at the peptide level on a fixed peptide list and does not generate a sample-wide summary. The introduction of the Parchment Glutamine Index (PQI) presented an alternative method for deamidation estimation. Initially designed for a large ZooMS dataset of parchment, it utilises weighted least squares and a linear mixed-effects model (LME) to generate deamidation estimation on both the peptide and sample level. To address the limitations of q2e and expand the applicability of PQI to a wider range of archaeological tissues and MALDI-derived data (such as ZooMS data on bone collagen), we developed the MALDI Deamidation Score (MDS), an iteration of the PQI method optimized for handling large-scale datasets. Compared to PQI, MDS is more streamlined for the analysis of multi-species data with customisable peptide lists, offering a dramatically decreased processing time while being able to normalise the peak intensity for higher accuracy. Through a case study on the published Denisova Cave ZooMS assemblage, we demonstrate that different peptides exhibit varying deamidation patterns over time, making the use of a single peptide to represent overall deamidation potentially biased. Such information is invaluable for investigating key questions such as protein preservation and site formation processes, especially when contextualized with other lines of archaeological evidence.", "date": "2025-08-27", "journal": ""}
