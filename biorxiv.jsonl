I.", "abstract": "During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists' articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of this influential work.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Agarwal, K.", "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is often diagnosed only after irreversible damage, limiting early treatment. The kidney mesangium, a structure highly sensitive to mechanical forces, plays a key role in early fibrosis development, yet its response to early disease cues like stiffness and biochemical changes is poorly understood. This is due to limitations in current in vitro models, poor in vivo accessibility, and static biopsy samples. To address this, we developed a 3D in vitro model of the mesangial microenvironment using stiffness-tunable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels that mimic healthy and fibrotic kidney tissue. Exposing mesangial cells to glucose and TGF-b1 led to altered cell shape, increased dry mass, and elevated expression of fibrotic markers (ASMA and collagen IV), especially under stiffer conditions, indicating a synergistic effect of biochemical and mechanical stress. These responses were integrated using Gaussian process regression to create a 3D severity cube that maps DKD progression across mechanical and chemical inputs. This system quantifies early mesangial transitions and reveals key fibrosis-related mechanisms. By combining organotypic modeling with interpretable inference, our platform offers a predictive tool for early disease stratification and a basis for studying subclinical fibrosis progression in DKD.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Collagen type I serves as the primary structural component in these tissues. The viscoelastic characteristics of such tissues, stemming from diverse energy dissipation mechanisms across various length scales, remains poorly characterized at the nanoscale. Prior experimental investigations have predominantly centered on analyzing tissue responses largely attributed to interactions between cells and fibers. Despite many studies on tissue viscoelasticity from scaffolds to single collagen fibrils, the time-dependent mechanics of collagen fibrils at the sub-fibrillar level remain poorly understood. This pioneering study employs atomic force microscopy (AFM) nano-rheometry and indentation testing to examine the viscoelastic characteristics of individual collagen type I fibrils at the ultrastructural level within distinct topographical zones, specifically focusing on gap and overlap regions. Our investigation has unveiled that collagen fibrils display a viscoelastic response that replicates the mechanical behavior of the tissue at the macroscale. Further, our findings suggest a distinct viscoelastic behavior between the gap and overlap regions, likely stemming from variances in molecular organization and cross-linking modalities within these specific sites. The results of our investigation provide unequivocal proof of the temporal dependence of mechanical properties and provides unique data to be compared to atomistic models, laying a foundation for refining the precision of macroscale models that strive to capture tissue viscoelasticity across varying length scales.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a preclinical model of TRD in which mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress were sequentially treated with fluoxetine (FLX) and ketamine (KET), allowing behavioral stratification into antidepressant responsive and non-responsive mice. RNA sequencing of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) revealed transcriptional signatures associated with treatment outcomes. Prior exposure to FLX exerted a priming effect that facilitated molecular and behavioral responsiveness to KET in a subset of animals in both the NAc and PFC. However, this priming effect was absent in non-responders, despite identical treatment regimes, suggesting a transcriptional divergence underlying differential outcomes. Gene co-expression network analysis identified modules enriched for differentially expressed genes unique to stress-susceptible and FLX-KET nonresponsive mice, as well as modules overlapping with both stress susceptibility and antidepressant resistance. These findings suggest that failed antidepressant treatment can shape the brain's molecular landscape in a way that influences subsequent treatment outcomes, and that resistance arises not simply from treatment failure but from an absence of adaptive molecular priming. This work provides insight into the gene networks contributing to antidepressant non-response and highlights a mechanistic framework for modeling TRD in preclinical systems.

Under physiological conditions, their interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maintains metabolic homeostasis. Disruption of this interaction, such as through CDS2 knockdown or loss of function, triggers an adaptive response wherein MBOAT7 translocates to ER-LD contact sites in a RAB1-dependent manner. This redistribution reduces LD size and activates the AMPK signaling, thereby promoting cholesterol excretion. Conversely, impairment of this compensatory axis results in hepatic cholesterol accumulation, a key driver of MASLD progression.

Phase slip rates are discontinuities in instantaneous phase that represent cortical phase transitions, indicating a significant change in the overall brain state. We employed 128-channel EEG data from eight NMC and eight NVP subjects, collected during a gamified protocol, to investigate object identification within a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was continuously acquired during the 50 trials for each subject. We retained 44 artifact-free trials per subject (the minimum common across all subjects) and computed within-subject averages. The EEGs were then averaged separately for NMC and NVP subjects. The EEG was filtered in the alpha band, and the phase was extracted using the Hilbert transform, unwrapped, and the phase slip rates were computed. A montage layout of electrodes was used to make the spatiotemporal plots of biomarkers. Our findings revealed that the spatiotemporal profiles of all four biomarkers differed significantly between the two groups of subjects.

While plant-associated microbiomes can ameliorate stress, the role of Bacillus subtilis under alkaline stress remains unclear in garden pea. In this study, alkaline stress reduced Fe, Mn, and N content, photosystem efficiency, and biomass accumulation. Inoculation with B. subtilis restored micronutrient balance and improved photosynthetic parameters across genetically diverse pea cultivars. The split-root assay demonstrated that BS inoculation induces systemic signaling, which underlies alkaline tolerance in pea. Furthermore, co-culture experiments showed increased growth of both Rhizobium leguminosarum and B. subtilis, pointing to their complementary interactions that promote mutual fitness under alkaline stress. RNA-seq analysis identified 958 and 1134 differentially expressed genes upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the roots inoculated with B. subtilis under alkaline conditions. The upregulated genes were mostly involved in the sugar-mediated symbiotic association (SWEET, GLUT), pH homeostasis (cation/H+ exchanger, ATPase), and nutrient assimilation (Ammonium transporter, Zn/Fe permease). Alkalinity mitigation was further assisted by increased expression of oxidoreductases, ferritin-like protein, and other redox-related genes, reflecting improved antioxidant defense and Fe storage under high pH conditions. Amplicon sequencing revealed lower richness and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities under alkaline stress. However, B. subtilis inoculation led to enrichment of beneficial taxa, such as Pseudomonas, Pseudorhizobium, Pseudallescheria, and Chaetomium, which may act as helper microbes to support nutrient cycling and enhance pea survival under alkalinity.

L.; Zarnetske, P.", "abstract": "Excess nutrient deposition is a major driver of plant diversity loss, but the mechanisms of this loss remain unclear. Diversity loss has been interpreted through the niche dimension hypothesis, yet the mechanistic link via competitive effects remains unresolved. Establishing this link demands a global synthesis of how nutrients alter competitive effects, defined as a species ability to perform better or worse with heterospecific competitors than with conspecifics. Strong competitive effects from heterospecifics relative to conspecifics can lead to decline or exclusion of the focal species, whereas weaker competitive effects indicate niche differentiation that promotes coexistence. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 71 plant competition experiments to quantify how nutrient addition alters competitive effects, using biomass as the performance metric. Nutrient addition intensified competitive effects with heterospecifics by 1.5-fold, as focal species biomass was higher with conspecifics. Responses depended on the initial competitive effect under low nutrients: when effects were weak, nutrient addition increased biomass with conspecifics; when effects were strong, nutrient addition increased biomass with heterospecifics, alleviating competition and potentially countering species loss. Competitive effects were amplified most when higher temperatures occurred in dry quarters, suggesting nutrient additions may exacerbate competition under extreme climate conditions. Understanding these interactive effects of nutrient addition, changing climate, and competition is critical for predicting plant responses to global change in both managed and natural ecosystems.\n\nSignificance StatementNutrient enrichment from agricultural runoff is a driver of plant diversity loss. While patterns of diversity loss from nutrient additions are clear, the processes driving competitive effects that lead to diversity loss remain uncertain. Our global meta-analysis reveals that multiple nutrient addition intensifies competitive effects favouring monocultures i.e, species accumulating more biomass with conspecifics than heterospecifics. Depending on the initial strength of competitive effects, nutrient addition amplified or alleviated them. Temperature and water availability interact with nutrient addition to amplify competitive asymmetries, likely further shaping species dominance under changing climate. These insights provide the first global-scale evidence of nutrient enrichment effects on plant communities and highlight the need to mitigate compounding impacts of fertilization and climate change on diversity.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven highly successful for various protein design applications, but many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for current models under typical in silico success criteria. We hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both native and de novo backbones. Finally, we train a variant of Caliby on only soluble proteins and demonstrate in silico that Protpardelle-1c binder designs that were previously deemed undesignable by SolubleMPNN are actually designable under SolubleCaliby, highlighting limitations of existing filtering pipelines.

Current conceptualizations of episodic and semantic memory interactions emphasize a one-way consolidation from episodic traces in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to semantic knowledge in neocortex (CTX). However, this tradition has left largely unexplored how semantic memory may affect episodic encoding of new memories. Here we introduce a cognitive model in which the code used in episodic memories shifts from purely sensorial to including explicit semantic representations of stored events. Simultaneously, we propose a computational circuit model of how such a cognitive strategy could be implemented in the brain using biologically-plausible learning rules. We show that increased sparsity during replay enables neocortex to extract compositional structure from overlapping episodes, which creates a dictionary of inter-connected concepts in semantic memory. Furthermore, we show that spontaneous activity in neocortical areas can imprint the abstracted representations into the medial temporal lobe, giving rise to concept-like cells. This bidirectional interaction improves episodic recall and replay fidelity, and facilitates the consolidation of higher-order representations based on previous semantic knowledge. The model accounts for behavioural advantages of schema-congruent learning, the emergence of concept neurons, and enhanced memory performance for semantically familiar stimuli. Together, our results provide a mechanistic account of how episodes and concepts reinforce each other, extending standard consolidation theories and suggesting a cooperative framework where semantic knowledge scaffolds episodic encoding, which in turn favours compositional abstraction.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

First, we formalize an Episode Generation Protocol (EGP) that creates compositional episodes with controllable overlap and noise, and define a corresponding semantic structure as conditional probabilities between concepts. We then show analytically and through simulations that recurrent synapses converge to conditional firing probabilities, thereby encoding asymmetric semantic relationships across concepts. These recurrent dynamics enable reliable recall and replay of overlapping episodes without representational collapse. Finally, by incorporating feed-forward plasticity with a neuronal maturity mechanism, output neurons form selective receptive fields in a one-shot manner and refine them through replay, yielding robust unsupervised classification of overlapping episodes.

It plays a crucial role in the body's immune defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, an imbalance in IL-17 production can contribute to the development of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Therapeutic strategies targeting IL-17, such as blocking antibodies like secukinumab (Cosentyx), have been successfully developed. These antibodies are currently employed in the treatment of various conditions, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. More recently, a small molecule inhibitor of IL-17, LY3509754, progressed to clinical trials but was halted during Phase 1 due to unfavorable hepatotoxicity. Two derivatives, compounds 7 and 8, did not advance to clinical trials due to safety concerns. These three compounds (7, 8, and the original lead compound, presumably implied) share a common difluoro substituent, which was hypothesized to be the cause of the observed safety issues. In subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, replacing the difluoro substituent with a single methyl group (resulting in compound 9) unexpectedly led to a significant improvement in cellular activity. Furthermore, compound 9 exhibited a very low unbound fraction and reduced liver distribution, ultimately translating to high in vivo efficacy with a sufficient safety margin. This seemingly minor methyl substitution transformed the compound into a highly promising preclinical candidate (compound 9), now slated for further development.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

To test this hypothesis, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells. We treated mature, hiPSC-derived RPE cells with selumetinib and measured impacts on RPE-specific function, structure, and gene expression. Selumetinib increases the ability of hiPSC-derived RPE to internalize bovine rod outer segments (1.9 vs 3.0, p=0.0024). It also decreases expression of aquaporin 1 during the first 10 days of treatment (2.7 vs 1.1, p=0.0015). It has no effect on the ability of hiPSC-derived RPE to maintain membrane integrity. Selumetinib alters gene expression of hiPSC-derived RPE, with significant changes in genes involved in transport of ions and small molecules regulating cell volume and lysosomal acidification.

PAK4 recruitment required the scaffolding protein Afadin. Afdn-KO cells exhibited severe junctional defects and reduced barrier function. Artificial targeting of PAK4 in Afdn-KO cells partially restored junctional continuity and barrier function. In Xenopus embryos, live imaging showed dynamic PAK4 accumulation at remodeling vertices, and PAK4 inhibition hindered resolution of multicellular vertices. Expression of an amino-terminal fragment (PAK4-NT) impaired remodeling and induced cytokinetic failure.

In developmental disorders such as autism, abnormalities in sensory processing, social cognition, and motor behavior are thought to arise from disruptions in these processes. Here, we investigated early-life molecular changes following prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an environmentally induced model of autism. We integrated cortical gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing/qPCR, alternative splicing profiling, in situ myelin quantification, plasma serotonin determination, and machine learning-assisted classification of blood serum molecular profiles using infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) data. Our findings revealed downregulation of myelin-associated genes and upregulation of synapse-related genes in the frontal cortex of young VPA-exposed rats. qPCR confirmed reduced cortical expression of Mobp and PLP1 along with increased Penk and C1ql3 expression. Alternative splicing analysis identified numerous novel transcript variants, enriched in synaptic-related genes, indicating widespread post-transcriptional remodeling in VPA animals. These molecular alterations were accompanied by a significant reduction in myelin content within the cingulate and motor cortex of adult animals. Peripheral molecular profiling showed elevated plasma serotonin in VPA-treated animals and demonstrated that a support vector machine trained on serum FTIR spectra classified VPA-exposed animals with 85% accuracy. Collectively, our findings suggest that prenatal VPA exposure induces early dysregulation of myelin organization, synaptic gene networks, and RNA splicing programs, potentially leading to long-term impairments in neuronal communication and processing efficiency.

Methods: We applied neuron-specific proteomic biotinylation in vivo, differential centrifugation of brain for crude synaptosome enrichment (P2 fraction) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of biotinylated proteins to derive native-state proteomes of Camk2a-positive neurons and their corresponding P2 synaptic compartments. Next, in an in vivo model of systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dosing, we examined the effects of neuroinflammation on whole neuron and synaptic compartments using a combination of MS, network analysis, confirmatory biochemical and ultrastructural assays and integrative approaches across our mouse-derived and existing human datasets. Results: Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses of P2 fractions verified enrichment in synaptic elements, including synaptic vesicles and mitochondria. MS of biotinylated proteins from Camk2a-specific bulk brain homogenates (whole neuron) and P2 fractions (synaptosome) showed enrichment of >1000 proteins, consistent with neuron-specific biotinylation, also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Camk2a-specific synaptic proteome revealed molecular signatures related to mitochondrial function, synaptic transmission, protein translation. LPS-treated mice displayed body weight loss and neuroinflammation, characterized by glial activation, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and upregulated expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related microglial genes. LPS-induced neuroinflammation exerted distinct effects on the synaptic proteome, including increased mitochondrial and reduced cytoskeletal-synaptic proteins, while suppressed synaptic MAPK signaling. Importantly, these changes were not observed at the whole neuron level, indicating unique vulnerability of the synapse to neuroinflammation. In line with synapse proteomic and signaling changes, LPS altered the ultrastructure of asymmetric synapses, suggesting dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission. Co-expression network analysis of Camk2a neuronal proteins further resolved mitochondria- and synapse-specific protein modules, some of which were neuroinflammation-dependent. Neuroinflammation increased levels of a mitochondria-enriched module, and decreased levels of a pre-synaptic vesicle module, without impacting a post-synaptic membrane module. LPS-dependent mitochondrial and LPS-independent post-synaptic modules in mouse neurons mapped to post-mortem human AD brain proteomic modules which were decreased in cases with AD dementia and positively correlated to cognitive function, including pro-resilience markers for AD. Conclusion: Our findings using native-state proteomics of Camk2a neurons combined with synaptosome enrichment identify proteome-level mechanisms of early synaptic vulnerability to neuroinflammation relevant to AD.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

However, it is now clear that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

To address this, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to compare gene expression, cell types, and laminar architecture in the primary visual cortex of a metatherian (Monodelphis domestica) and a eutherian mammal (Mus musculus). We find distinctions between supragranular (layer 2/3) and infragranular (layers 5 and 6) intratelencephalic (IT) neurons to be more pronounced in mice, with layer 2/3 neurons enriched for transcripts involved in synaptic transmission, adhesion, and dendritic development. Mouse cortex also exhibits expanded populations of disinhibitory interneurons, redistribution of perineuronal nets, and reduced oligodendrocyte density--features known to enhance cortical plasticity.

The skin, as both a visible marker and contributor to age-related inflammation (inflammaging), offers a potential non-invasive window into this health metric. Here, we developed Healthy Selfie, a digital predictor of iAge, from simple 2D frontal face photographs. We leveraged data from the Edifice Health Pre-Market trial, a clinical study of 750 participants aged 20 to 90 years, using a subset with available iAge measurements paired to facial images, demographic, clinical, and functional data. Facial embeddings from a pre-trained deep learning image model were combined with chronological age, sex and other easily obtainable metadata, and mapped to blood-derived iAge using regression within a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Photo-predicted iAge values were significantly correlated with blood iAge values (r = 0.536) and were used to identify increased iAge acceleration (accuracy 66.39%, sensitivity 65.61%, specificity 67.24%). Validation on an external dataset containing ~100,000 images showed no significant demographic bias across ethnicities, including Asian, Black, Indian, Middle Eastern, and Latino populations. Beyond iAge, we also showed that facial features could predict blood levels of individual inflammaging proteins (CXCL9, CXCL1, CCL11, TNFSF10, and IFNG).

In this work, we use a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia model in zebrafish to identify novel mediators of LPS toxicity. We performed transcriptomic studies on LPS-treated larvae, followed by in silico analysis, which revealed associations between the signatures of LPS-treated embryos and those of drugs involving diverse pathways. In parallel, we performed an in vivo screen using >1,500 FDA-approved compounds and identified multiple novel small molecules that reduced inflammation and prevented LPS toxicity. We focused on the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, which was identified through both the in vivo and in silico analyses. We found that dabigatran co-administration significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and completely protected zebrafish from endotoxemic death due to LPS. Surprisingly, we found that this protection occurs in prothrombin mutant fish, proving that protection from endotoxemia occurs independently of the anticoagulant function of dabigatran. We additionally found that dabigatran administration significantly decreased nitric oxide production and apoptosis compared to LPS treatment alone, suggesting possible mechanisms by which protection from endotoxemia is achieved. In summary, we identify several novel small molecules that prevent LPS-induced endotoxemia and show that one such small molecule, dabigatran, exerts a thrombin-independent effect on nitric oxide production and apoptosis.

B.; Gunn, H.; Wenzell, K. E.; Byers, K. J. R. P.", "abstract": "Background & Aims: Pollinators play a crucial role in the evolution and diversification of flowering plants. Intraspecific variation in floral traits occurs frequently and likely reflects variable biotic and abiotic selection pressures. The hummingbird-pollinated monkeyflower Mimulus cardinalis occurs across western North America, where geographic mosaics of selection have likely influenced its natural history, due to this wide species range. Processes driving early stages of divergence and speciation remain poorly understood, though theory predicts that trait divergence will be most likely at range edges. Within M. cardinalis, which is usually red-flowered and hummingbird-pollinated, two independent shifts to yellow flowers have occurred at the northern and southern range edges, including a population found on Cedros Island, off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. Methods: This study characterises the local climatic variables of five accessions of M. cardinalis derived from locations across a latitudinal geographic gradient. Highly integrative methods in metabolomics and morphological analyses were used to characterise a suite of pollinator-relevant floral traits across the range of M. cardinalis species variation. We use transcriptomics and whole genome sequencing to study underlying genetic variation in two yellow-coloured, range-edge accessions. Key Results: This study uncovers high levels of variation in morphology, nectar properties, pigmentation and scent profile across geographically diverse Mimulus cardinalis accessions, in addition to profiling how these accessions are perceived by potential pollinators. We find high levels of phenotypic variation across M. cardinalis, particularly in the biochemistry of pigment and scent, where inflorescences that appear to be the same shade of red have completely different anthocyanin profiles. Floral trait-underlying genetic differences between different M. cardinalis lines were also investigated, revealing potential mechanisms underlying floral diversification. Conclusions: This work highlights the importance of interplay between floral trait diversification, pollinator perception and climate. This work also highlights the importance of considering suites of floral traits in a quantitative fashion when studying intraspecific variation in relation to species range. This study also provides genetic insight into changes in these traits and provides many future directions to study the early stages of pollinator-mediated trait differentiation across a species range.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 years. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 years to renew 50% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports.

Here, we examined the functionality of T cells under MR and pharmaceutical inhibition of the methionine cycle (MAT2Ai), using primary T cells and a murine adoptive T cell therapy model. In vitro, transient MR or MAT2Ai treatment increased interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) expression in CD8 T cells, whereas sustained MR led to the upregulation of T cell exhaustion-associated markers. Mechanistically, transient MR suppressed the polyamine synthesis pathway, and supplementation with polyamines reversed MR-induced IFN{gamma} expression. Genetic ablation of s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, an enzyme in the polyamine synthesis pathway, recapitulated the effect of MR, indicating that transient MR enhances T cell function by inhibiting polyamine synthesis. Despite this, transient MR treatment of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific (OT-I) CD8 T cells prior to adoptive transfer did not improve antitumor efficacy against EG7-OVA tumors in vivo. In contrast, sustained dietary MR accelerated EG7-OVA tumor growth in mice treated with OT-I T cells, demonstrating that methionine availability is essential for the activity of adoptively transferred T cells.

PDE1 hydrolyzes cyclic nucleotide cAMP in a soluble but not microsomal fraction of the human myocardium. PDE1 may exert domain-specific effects, but the mechanism whereby PDE1 compartmentalization induces an inotropic change remains unknown. We sought to elucidate PDE1 regulation of cAMP and contractility. METHODS: Pharmacologic modulators of PDEs or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) were used to study PDE1 signaling mechanisms in healthy and failing guinea pig hearts. Tissue fractionation examined the localization of different PDE types. Live cell imaging experiments assessed cytosolic and sarcolemmal membrane cAMP level ([cAMP]) and protein kinase A (PKA) activity changes in cells transduced with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. Sarcomere length and intracellular calcium changes monitored contractile changes in electrically paced cells. Coronary flow and left ventricular (LV) developed pressure were measured in ex vivo Langendorff perfusion heart studies. RESULTS: PDE1 isoforms were found not only in the soluble, but also in the microsomal fractions of the guinea pig heart. PDE1 hydrolysis of cAMP was greater at the sarcolemma compared to the cytosol. PDE1 specifically regulated a pool of cAMP associated with the G?s protein coupled receptor adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) at the sarcolemma, without activating PKA. A2AR/PDE1 regulation induced positive inotropic and lusitropic changes in healthy and failing guinea pig cardiomyocytes and in the myocardium ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS: PDE1 is the major regulator of cAMP pools generated by A2AR activation at the sarcolemma. Functionally, this regulation induces inotropic and lusitropic effects in cardiomyocytes and at the whole organ level. Thus, PDE1 is compartmentalized at the membrane with A2AR, and this regulation determines cardiomyocyte contractility in healthy and failing hearts.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Potential pandemic outbreaks are underpinned by the ability of the virus to jump from one species to another. Host virus interactions can dictate the success of such events and while systematic studies have successfully mapped host virus interactions in human cells, few studies have been performed in relevant animal host cell lines. Here, we conducted two independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens in chicken lung epithelial cells infected with either the human-adapted PR8 vaccine strain or the avian UDL 3:5 reassortant virus encoding PR8 HA, NA and M segments. Rather than selecting solely for cell survival, we used anti-M2 antibody staining and fluorescence activated cell sorting to capture host factors influencing multiple stages of the IAV life cycle. Across both screens, we identified 104 genes required for efficient replication in chicken cells, including 16 with strong effects (log2 fold change > 2). Comparative analysis with published human screens revealed 17 conserved host factors, 19 human-specific factors, and 42 chicken-specific factors, highlighting potential species-specific interactions. Top hits included genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis and N-linked glycosylation: SLC35A1, SLC35A2, and the avian-specific influenza polymerase cofactor ANP32A. Functional validation demonstrated that MOGS, MGAT1, DENR, DMXL1, ENO1, IPO9, KLF6, PTAR1, and TSG101 contribute to multiple stages of the IAV life cycle. In particular, MOGS and MGAT1 were essential for N-glycan processing and modulated cell-surface sialic acid abundance, with strain- and species-specific effects. These findings define a genetic landscape of IAV dependency factors in chicken cells and suggest shared and species-specific host requirements that could impact cross-species transmission.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

P.; Dennis, M.", "abstract": "Human-specific segmental duplications (HSDs) contain millions of base pairs of sequence unique to the human genome, including genes that shape neurodevelopment. Despite their young age (<6 million years), HSD genes exhibit widespread regulatory divergence, with paralog-specific expression patterns documented across a variety of tissues and cell types. Using long-read expression and epigenomic data, we show that human-specific paralogs tend to have lower activity than the shared, ancestral ones. To systematically characterize the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within HSDs and understand patterns of regulatory change in recently evolved gene families, we conducted a massively parallel reporter assay of 7,160 human duplicated and chimpanzee orthologous sequences in lymphoblastoid (GM12878) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines. A large proportion (14&ndash24%) of sequences exhibited differential activity relative to the chimpanzee ortholog (or between human paralogs), mostly with small fold-differences. Combining measured activity levels across all assayed sequences, predicted differences in cis-regulatory activity correlated with mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y. Differentially active CREs were validated for CHRFAM7A, HYDIN2, and SRGAP2C that may contribute to paralog-specific expression patterns and thereby to human-specific traits. While we find some changes in CRE activity shared between duplicate paralogs likely driving regulatory divergence in gene expression, consideration of non-shared adjacent sequences to duplications suggests a larger role for altered genome positional effects. In all, this work suggests that functional divergence of duplicated CREs contributes moderately to regulatory divergence of HSD genes and uncovers enhancers that are candidate drivers of human-specific regulatory patterns.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

It functions by enabling the proton-consuming decarboxylation of arginine catalyzed by AdiA, and the uptake of arginine and excretion of the more alkaline agmatine catalyzed by the antiporter AdiC. The corresponding genes adiA and adiC are induced in E. coli under acidic conditions (pH < 5.5), a process that is tightly regulated by the AraC/XylS transcriptional activator AdiY. Here, we show that the pH-sensing mechanism of AdiY functions through the protonation of two histidines (His34 and His60) in the N-terminal domain. Replacing these histidine residues with alanine, glutamine or aspartate abolishes the pH-dependent activation of AdiY, both in vivo, as demonstrated by promoter reporter assays, and in vitro, as indicated by the loss of DNA-binding activity detected by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Biochemical analyses of purified wild-type AdiY using size-exclusion chromatography and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed a pronounced and reversible pH-dependent conformational change that does not occur in the pH-sensing-deficient AdiY variant. A model is proposed in which AdiY forms a monomer at physiological pH. At a lower intracellular pH, the protonation of histidine in AdiY causes a conformational change that leads to the binding of AdiY as a tetramer to the DNA. This work elucidates the molecular mechanism of a one-component signal transduction system that combines both sensory and responsive functions.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Across multiple large-scale datasets, GARM consistently outperforms leading approaches, including GEARS, scGPT, and GenePert, in predicting responses to unseen perturbations within and across contexts. Complementing this, we show that widely used evaluation metrics substantially overestimate performance, allowing trivial models to appear predictive. To address this, we introduce perturbation-ranking criteria (PrtR) that better reflect model utility for experimental design. Finally, we provide insight into gene-specific predictability, revealing pathways and gene classes systematically easier or harder to predict, with implications for model development and biological interpretation.

We confirm the known neurodegeneration-promoting effects of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), including mitochondrial dysfunction, and further discover its disruptive impact on the pathways of glycolysis, GABAergic signaling, and RNA splicing. Additionally, we identify glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), a microbiome-derived secondary bile acid, as a potent regulator of chromatin accessibility and suppressor of genes that protect the brain from age-related, neurodegeneration-promoting insults.

Here, we investigate this synergy for Dengue serotypes of greatest medical relevance, DENV-2 and DENV-3. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the microsecond scale at 28{degrees}C, 37{degrees}C, and 40{degrees}C under pH 5-7 using the CHARMM36m force field. The increase in temperature from 28{degrees}C to 37{degrees}C doubled the conformational space explored at neutral pH and weakened both dimers through reduction or loss of the interaction network along the dimeric interface. Acidification amplified this effect in a serotype-specific manner: DENV-2 required pH 5, while DENV-3 responded at pH 6. Distance and principal component analyses revealed an asymmetric dissociation route, termed the \"compensatory embrace\", in which retraction of Domains I and III in one monomer is balanced by advancement of its partner on the opposite side, temporarily preserving the number of inter-subunit contacts. Structural analyses highlighted the difference in histidine distribution between the serotypes. These results outline hierarchical physicochemical triggers that convert the dimer into fusion-competent monomers.

Inhibiting ADGRL4 is a potential therapeutic treatment for currently intractable cancers such as glioblastoma. Previous work suggested that ADGRL4 does not signal through G protein coupled pathways. However, using a sensitive bioluminescent assay, we demonstrate here that ADGRL4 couples weakly to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, whilst there was no robust coupling to other G proteins (Gs, G12, Go) or {beta}-arrestin 1 or 2. We determined the cryo-EM structure of ADGRL4 coupled to a heterotrimeric Gq complex to a resolution of 3.1 [A]. The overall fold of ADGRL4 is similar to that of other aGPCRs, but the coupling to Gq is distinct with fewer interactions between the receptor and G protein. The structure is consistent with ADGRL4 being activated by its tethered agonist and represents an important step towards the development of potential inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumour types.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a comprehensive investigation into TRIB2 degradation mechanisms using multimodal approaches, including CRISPR knockout, mutational protein stability, small molecule TRIB2 engagement and evaluation of a novel targeted protein degrader (TRIB2-PROTAC). We identify Afatinib, a multi-ERBB covalent inhibitor, as a rapid inducer of TRIB2 degradation, triggering AML cell death via an ERBB-independent pathway. Importantly, TRIB2 degradation synergized with cytarabine, the frontline AML chemotherapy, amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Mapping of TRIB2 ubiquitination sites revealed Lys-63 as critical for its own proteolytic turnover, and a Lys to Arg degradation-resistant mutant (KallR) conferred enhanced chemoresistance and increased leukaemic engraftment in vivo. CRISPR-mediated TRIB2 knockout validated an essential role in AML cell survival. Consistently, the novel TRIB2-PROTAC (compound 5K) achieved robust TRIB2 degradation and AML cell killing at low micromolar concentrations.

Unlike typical TNLs, Rcr1 engages non-NLR partners in two separable modules: a CP1 (cysteine protease)-WRKY-based recognition module, likely monitoring a pathogen virulence target, and an AP (ankyrin-repeat protein)-ERF-based signaling module, driving jasmonic acid/ethylene-mediated defense. This architecture functions without detectable EDS1/NDR1 involvement, challenging salicylic acid-dominant models of biotrophic immunity and expanding current views of how TNLs can be wired in plant defense. Using high-throughput interactor screening and CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts, we validate these modules, while heat-inducible gene excision reveals the critical early role of Rcr1 (0-14 days post-inoculation).

Therefore, in this study we evaluated the impact of reducing photoreceptor light signaling on RP progression. This was done by genetically ablating or downregulating transducin in rods or cones in a preclinical RP model carrying a single P23H mutant rhodopsin allele (P23H mice). Ablating rod transducin significantly improved photoreceptor survival in the P23H retina. Additionally, downregulating rod transducin promoted photoreceptor survival and improved rod light response in P23H mice. Remarkably, male P23H mice retained robust cone function until old age in the absence of rod transducin whereas female P23H carriers experienced significantly faster loss of cone function. In these females, reducing cone transducin improved cone function whereas the same treatment was not effective in male P23H carriers.

Loss of TCF4 impaired AM proliferation, shifted their identity toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, and exacerbated host morbidity following influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, enforced TCF4 expression promoted the expansion of mature AMs, and supported lung recovery, thereby protecting against severe acute viral disease. Mechanistically, TCF4 antagonized {beta}-catenin-driven inflammatory transcription while preserving oxidative phosphorylation, defining a reciprocal regulatory axis essential for AM function. Notably, respiratory viral infections and exuberant interferon signaling suppressed TCF4 expression, which remains chronically reduced in murine and human lungs with post-COVID fibrosis. This downregulation is associated with persistent KRT8hi dysplastic epithelium and collagen deposition. Moreover, aging diminished TCF4 levels and enforced TCF4 expression dampened age-associated decline of AM self-renewal. Furthermore, in vivo TCF4 overexpression after viral clearance enhanced mature AM accumulation, promoted lung epithelium regeneration, attenuated chronic tissue fibrosis and restored pulmonary physiologial function in aged lungs in a model of persistent pulmonary fibrosis post-acute viral infection.

Over the last five decades, however, Churince underwent a catastrophic ~99% water loss, primarily driven by intensive agricultural extraction. We showed that this desiccation not only caused hydrological collapse but also reshaped microbial physiology. Longitudinal records from 2007 to 2019, combining satellite imagery, piezometer data, and field observations, documented progressive declines beginning in 2011 and culminating in the complete desiccation of the Intermediate Lagoon by 2019. To track microbial responses, we employed a cultivation-based approach distinguishing vegetative cells from dormant spores, enabling direct physiological assessment of metabolic activity versus dormancy. As water diminished, spore abundance increased relative to vegetative forms, revealing a shift toward dormancy as a survival strategy under extreme desiccation. Complementary mesocosm experiments showed that reduced diversity further enriched for spores, illustrating how loss of community complexity accelerated dormancy and erosion of active assemblages. Together, these results demonstrated that habitat loss triggered microbial community change, which we frame as a microbial extension of the ecological concept of community disassembly.

In the environment the spores (arthroconidia) develop into hyphae, yet when they are inhaled by a mammalian host, they develop into a unique form called the spherule. The transition to spherule can be triggered in vitro with elevated temperatures and high CO2 levels, but the signals and host cells that might trigger Coccidioides spherulation in vivo are not known. We used live imaging to investigate how macrophages affect the fate of Coccidioides arthroconidia. Under tissue culture conditions, arthroconidia quickly developed into hyphae. The addition of macrophages promoted spherule development and delayed hyphal formation, indicating that innate immune cells can influence Coccidioides development into the pathogenic form. Exposure of arthroconidia to macrophage supernatants was not sufficient to stimulate spherulation, which was dependent on phagocytosis of arthroconidia by macrophages. Transcriptomics analysis of Coccidioides co-cultured with macrophages revealed a signature concordant with spherules grown in vitro and allowed the identification of a core set of spherule-specific transcripts. In addition, we identified Coccidioides transcripts with significantly higher abundance in the presence of macrophages compared to in vitro spherules, suggesting these factors may be needed to survive and thrive in the presence of innate immune cells. This work lays a foundation for uncovering host-pathogen signaling as well as Coccidioides factors that are critical for pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

We previously analyzed 21 plaques by mass spectrometry and reported that the proteomes of morphologically unstable (rupture-prone) and stable plaques are different. This dataset extends and includes non-atherosclerotic (thyroid) arteries to allow comparison with control tissue, and to investigate plaque stability using ex vivo plaques cultured. Methods: Plaques (n=76) and non-atherosclerotic superior thyroid artery segments (n=8) were retrieved from carotid endarterectomies. Additionally, 22 plaques were cultured ex vivo for 22 days to examine the role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signalling. Proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Mass spectrometric proteome analysis identified three protein clusters associated with morpho-logically unstable (type A) and stable (type B) plaques, as well as non-atherosclerotic arteries. 2,876 proteins were differentially abundant in plaques compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries. 1,415 proteins were differentially abundant between plaque types A and B. Proteins linked to IGF transport and binding, particularly IGF-binding proteins, were more abundant in plaques compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries, and in type B compared to type A plaques. IGF-1, IGF-2 and the IGF-1 receptor were more abundant in type B plaques, whereas the IGF-2 re-ceptor was more abundant in type A. IGF-1 treatment of ex vivo plaques decreased matrix met-alloprotein 9 and increased collagen type XXI, consistent with a increased plaque stability. Conclusions: Proteomic analyses of atherosclerotic plaques, and ex vivo plaques cultured with IGF-1, reveals the IGF axis as a potential regulator of human atherosclerotic plaque stability.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

We carried out a study of a collection of breast tumors paired with lymph-node metastases and analyzed using advanced computational methods, to determine how much information can be obtained from mid-depth whole-exome bulk DNA sequencing. We gathered 15 paired (primary and an involved lymph node) excised breast tumors of different molecular subtypes (HER2+, triple negative, luminal A and luminal B HER2-), from the National Research Institute of Oncology, Krakow (Poland) Branch. FFPE specimens contained typical artifacts, manifesting themselves in spurious DNA variant calls. We used several bioinformatics tools to remove the artifacts and analyzed the exomic data, using both commercial and original in-house computational techniques. We used several of recent bioinformatics tools to remove the FFPE artifacts and found a serious dispersal of outcomes. After calibration, a series of analyses was performed, including copy number study, resulting in ploidy levels ranging from 1 to 5 (average of 2.5). Positive association was found between the frequency of oncogenes relative to tumor suppressor genes and DNA copy number. In addition, we carried out analyses of the clonal structure of the data using original computational methods based on evolutionary modeling. Interesting results concerning clonal structure, early tumor expansion, and interdependence of the primary tumor and lymph node metastases have been obtained.

We find that nucleosome retention is probabilistic, with no locus universally occupied. Although promoters of spermatogenic genes preferentially harbor retained nucleosomes, the predominant carrier of paternal epigenetic information is protamine lacunae, accessible discontinuities in the protamine coat that preferentially mark critical regulatory elements. By contrast, centromere kinetochore binding regions robustly retain CENP-A mono-nucleosomes, providing a mechanism for the focal transmission of paternal centromeres.

Our study provides a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ORF1p using CPTAC proteogenomic data, revealing a dichotomous role in modulating immune responses. Integrated analyses and supervised learning models divide ORF1p-high tumors into two groups: (1) high ORF1p associates with immunosuppression, reduced interferon signaling and diminished immune cell infiltration (HNSCC and LSCC), and (2) ORF1p-high tumors associate with immune activation (UCEC).

Here, we studied T cell migration in confining collagen-rich matrices with a range of stiffness, viscoelasticity, mechanical plasticity, and shear strength, or the stress at which the material fails. Strikingly, only shear strength, the stress at which a material fails, not stiffness or viscoelasticity, correlates with migration.

While the activation of mechanotransduction has been extensively studied in single cells, it remains unclear whether similar mechanisms extend to mechanotransduction in multicellular collectives. Here, by focusing on Yes-associated protein (YAP), known as the master regulator of mechanotransduction, we reveal that the local packing fraction of cells acts as the primary determinant of YAP activation in cell collectives. \\added[id=R]{We further show that local packing fraction modulates the isotropic stress landscape, with sparse regions experiencing large stress fluctuations and dense regions displaying stress equilibration.} Remarkably, this packing fraction-dependent regulation persists even under conditions of disrupted force transmission through cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, suggesting a robust and conserved relation between YAP activation and local packing fraction in cell collectives. In particular, we show that local packing fraction-dependent activation of YAP in cell collectives is independent of substrate stiffness, E-cadherin expression, and myosin contractility, in stark contrast to YAP activation in single cells. Our results thus offer a new perspective on mechanotransduction, highlighting the critical role of local packing fraction of cells in dictating YAP dynamics within multicellular contexts.

We evaluated leaf photosynthetic and respiratory traits in ten Australian wheat cultivars released between 1901 and 2012 to warm nights under temperature-controlled environments. When exposed to warmer nights, rates of leaf net CO2 assimilation measured at 25 {degrees}C (Anet25) remained stable across cultivar release date despite declines in photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax and J1500) in newer cultivars. In most cultivars leaf respiratory CO2 release in the dark (Rdark) exhibited divergent thermal responses: warm nights suppressed temperature-normalised night Rdark (Rnight) but stimulated or maintained Rdark in the daytime (Rday). The results suggest that century-long, yield-focused selection may have inadvertently maintained Anet25 under warmer nights in modern cultivars through selection for more night-temperature sensitive but efficient photosynthetic capacity (i.e. greater return per protein investment) and overall reduced respiratory demand for maintenance of processes such as Rubisco protein turnover and synthesis.

However, current approaches often require substantial screening from which hits require further affinity maturation. Methods for experimentally improving designed proteins and exploring their sequence-affinity landscapes could therefore streamline the development of high-affinity binders and inform future design strategies. Here, we use OrthoRep, a system for continuous hypermutation in vivo, to drive the evolution of computationally designed mini protein binders (\"minibinders\") that target a mammalian receptor. Despite their small sizes (59-72 amino acids), we successfully affinity matured multiple minibinders through strong selection for improved binding and also sampled new regions of minibinder fitness landscapes through extensive neutral drift. One evolved minibinder variant was used to construct a combinatorially complete sequence-affinity map for its six affinity increasing mutations, which revealed nearly full additivity in their contributions to binding. Another minibinder was subjected to both deep mutational scanning and extensive evolution under weak selection, resulting in an evolutionarily diverged collection of binder sequences that revealed non-additive relationships among mutations. Our results highlight that the affinity of computationally designed binders can be rapidly increased through evolution and provide a scalable approach for the evolutionary exploration and subsequent mapping of sequence-affinity landscapes. We suggest that this work will complement protein binder design both as a reliable experimental optimization process and as a vehicle for generating new training data.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

In experimental models, short-lived Th2 effector cells and type 2 innate lymphocytes (ILC2) contribute to acute type 2 inflammation, yet the cellular architecture that drives chronic type 2 inflammation and prevents exhaustion remains poorly understood. To define the Th2 landscape in chronic type 2 inflammation, we established a mouse model of long-term pulmonary allergen exposure and found that type 2 inflammation was broadly sustained over at least 4 months despite chronic stimulation. Th2 cells in the lung parenchyma during chronic inflammation were distinct from acute inflammation and resting memory phases, and included an expanded T cell factor-1 (TCF1)-expressing progenitor-like Th2 population. Tissue Th2 progenitors were absent in the nose and in helminth infections, suggesting that type 2 immunopathology is context-specific. Transcriptomic deconstruction of acute and chronic pulmonary Th2 responses defined divergent effector programs as well as the transcriptional signature of a tissue Th2 memory population that resembled human Th2 progenitors. Integrated transcriptomic analysis comparing type 2 inflammation to chronic viral infection revealed a distinct stemness module underlying chronic Th2 inflammation that was separable from a common core memory module. In vivo, lung Th2 progenitors coupled self-renewal with effector cell differentiation and could be sustained for weeks without antigen persistence or contribution from the lymph node. Maintenance of Th2 progenitors was partially dependent on lung parenchymal B cells and associated with bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue formation. Moreover, Th2 progenitors, in contrast to Th2 effectors and ILC2s, were sufficient to both initiate and sustain type 2 inflammation. Thus, we define tissue Th2 progenitors as a distinct cellular state that arises during chronic type 2 inflammation and establish the central role of these cells in maintaining the architecture of Th2 responses over time.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

However, a bottleneck hindering the full use of Z. mobilis in biorefinery is its sensitivity to environmental stresses, including sodium chloride (NaCl), a common component present in biomass from various sources. To address this limitation, we need to deepen our understanding of the cell envelope, the crucial barrier between bacteria and external stressors. To date, the cell envelope of Z. mobilis has remained largely uncharacterized. Here we show that the deletion of ctpA, which encodes a periplasmic protease, increases the salt resilience. Salt resilience is mediated by an increased level of the peptidoglycan endopeptidase MepM, which we identified as a substrate of CtpA through comparative proteomics. Supporting this, the overexpression of MepM in the wild-type enhanced salt resilience. We also discovered that the peptidoglycan of Z. mobilis is O-acetylated at MurNAc residues, a modification usually associated with virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Interestingly, O-acetylation was crucial for salt resilience, supporting a role in PG growth regulation under the stress condition.

Phage resistance mutations arise in natural microbial communities and during the treatment of diseases with phages (phage therapy), making it important to understand the dynamics of resistance acquisition. It is well-established that when bacteria are challenged with phages in dense liquid cultures, bacterial populations quickly become dominated by phage-resistant variants. However, these conditions (well-mixed liquid cultures with high phage concentrations) are not necessarily common in microbial ecosystems. We developed a simplified mathematical model of phage resistance evolution to explore how phage and host concentration impact the dynamics of resistance evolution. The model was parameterized with microbial growth data from two pathogens and their phages: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Paenibacillus larvae. Our analyses revealed two fundamental discoveries about resistance evolution. First, phage resistance evolution is predictably governed by a core set of parameters that exhibited high resolution across all bacterial strains: intrinsic growth rate of susceptible bacteria, resistance acquisition rate, fitness cost of resistance, and phage adsorption rate. Second, competitive interactions and fitness costs are the primary drivers of resistance patterns rather than intrinsic mutation rates. We observed three distinct growth patterns (delayed growth, two-phase growth, and complete suppression) corresponding to specific parameter regimes as initial phage concentration increased.Two-phase growth patterns emerged when competitive dynamics remained balanced, enabling coexistence of susceptible and resistant populations. Complete suppression patterns occurred when low proliferation thresholds combined with extreme competitive asymmetries created unsustainable conditions for resistant bacteria. These findings demonstrate that phage resistance evolution is fundamentally an ecological process where competitive context determines outcomes independently of mutation capacity, with important implications for phage therapy design.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Cell therapy has been shown promising in pre-clinical trials to regenerate the damaged tissue, but delivered cells may beat spontaneously and produce arrhythmias in the ventricles, particularly in the first weeks after delivery, which hinders clinical application. Previous studies have proposed ionic targets to suppress the cells' automaticity but, so far, the effects of such treatments on the cells' calcium dynamics, as a key driver of contractile function, have been insufficiently evaluated. Furthermore, effective strategies are needed that can alleviate the injected cells' pro-arrhythmic action potential phenotypes. The goal of our study was to identify mechanisms to mitigate arrhythmic pathways following cell delivery in the chronically infarcted human ventricles using multiscale modelling and simulation. First, we demonstrate credibility by simulating experimentally observed transient automaticity-induced ventricular tachycardia arrhythmias with a frequency of up to 140 beats per minute at two weeks post cell injection in three different infarct geometries. Next, our simulations show how the timeframe during which re-entry was inducible increases 1) from before to after cell delivery at day 0 from 0 to 640 ms, 60 to 100 ms, and 60 to 760 ms in the small, medium, and large scar, respectively, and 2) from day 0 to day 14 after virtual cell injection in the large scar by 175%. Finally, we show that a combination of blocking the funny current and upregulating the inward rectifier potassium current, the sodium potassium pump, and the rapid delayed outward rectifier potassium current can reduce both automaticity-induced and re-entrant arrhythmias while maximising calcium amplitudes. In conclusion, our simulations show that not only automaticity-induced but also re-entrant arrhythmias increase as injected cells mature in the ventricles and depend on the scar size. Furthermore, through modelling and simulation, we identify anti-arrhythmic strategies to improve therapy safety while maximising efficacy.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": ""}

Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors are the mostly used herbicides for combating major weeds associated to rice, such as Echinochloa crus-galli. In separate locations from the Philippines, rice farmers expressed concerns that the application of ALS inhibitor bispyribac-sodium has been showing poor control of E. crus-galli. Here, we confirmed and quantified the level of bispyribac-sodium resistance in the putative resistant biotypes. Resistance was confirmed in R4 and R12 biotypes collected from the northern and central parts of the Philippines, respectively. The estimated GR50 (dose resulting in 50% growth reduction) revealed a 36.7- and 60.3-fold resistance in R4 and R12 biotypes (106.8 g a.i. ha-1 and 175.4 g a.i. ha-1) compared to the S biotype (2.91 g a.i. ha-1). The R4 biotype carries a single nucleotide mutation in the ALS2 gene translating to Trp-574-Leu amino acid substitution, while there was no mutation detected in any of the ALS conserved regions of R12. Pre-treatment of malathion increased the sensitivity of R12 to bispyribac-sodium, suggesting the involvement of cytochrome P450s. Sensitivity assays to alternative post-emergence herbicides showed that both R4 and R12 can be effectively controlled by metamifop [acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor].
