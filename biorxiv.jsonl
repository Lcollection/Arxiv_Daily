We found that H3K4me2 extensively occurs as a non-canonical pattern in mouse GV oocytes and early embryos, and parental H3K4me2 was erased by maternal LSD2 during forming the pronucleus in the zygote. The H3K4me2 was erased from GV to MII oocyte and was re-established in the late two-cell stage, removing this epigenetic burden is crucial for ZGA. We then revealed the H3K4me2 locates widespread in the CpG-rich and hypomethylated regulatory regions in the four-cell stage, and the eight-cell stage, but dramatic changes occurred in the inner cell mass (ICM) in mouse embryos. Then, these CpG-rich H3K4me2 regulatory regions became either activated or repressed.

Its cavities represent an essential microhabitat for many other forest species and the knowledge on landscape factors linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker is needed to support the conservation of this species and associated species. Such relationships should thus be quantified at different scales ranging from the stand to the extended home range.\n\nWe used cavity maps established by foresters and naturalists to build a large (2689 cavity bearing trees) database distributed over several sites in France. Based on this and on a set of background points, i.e. randomly selected points devoid of cavity in the vicinity, we analysed the effects of stand composition and landscape features (forest cover, forest connectivity and fragmentation) at three different scales around each cavity and background point corresponding to a forest management unit (10ha), the core (100ha) and extended (250ha) home range scales.\n\nWe showed that indices describing forest continuity (cohesion, landscape shape index) and forest tree species composition (especially the presence of mixed forests) had significant positive effects but that the magnitude varied across the three scales. We notably observed the strongest effects at the core home range scale (100ha), indicating that Black Woodpecker requirements for cavity excavation are more pronounced at this scale. The Black Woodpecker tends to avoid pure conifer-dominated stands to excavate cavities, but benefits from mixed forests, that couple favourable foraging and cavity excavation sites. The bird also prefers continuous forest landscapes with high cohesion and low edge densities. We also showed that the positive effects of forest landscape were generally at higher elevation, indicating context-dependence.\n\nForest planning rarely integrates the landscape patterns. A better understanding of the features linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker may hence help to better integrate their conservation in forest management planning. Our results also show the importance to maintain mixed broadleaf-conifer forests as well as continuous and well-connected forest landscapes to favour features that benefit primary and secondary cavity nesters.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A.; Shadmehr, R.; Krakauer, J. W.", "abstract": "Moving and holding-still (holding) have been posited to be under separate control regimes for both eye and arm movements. The paretic arm after stroke exhibits different abnormalities during rest vs. movement, providing an opportunity to ask whether control of these behaviors is independently affected in stroke. Here, we quantified resting postural abnormalities in stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace, and then assessed the influence of these resting force biases on reaching in the same workspace. We found that patients had marked resting force biases at each location, even when the arm was supported. However, these biases did not transfer to arm-supported planar reaching movements: not during initial acceleration, not in response to mid-trajectory perturbations, and not during deceleration to a stop. Rather, the abnormal resting forces only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings suggest that moving and holding are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, we found that the resting biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal synergies during movement: they markedly decreased when arm support was provided; they were higher in more distant positions that require breaking out of flexion; and they scaled with the Fugl-Meyer score for the upper extremity (a measure of intrusion of abnormal synergies during active movement). These three shared features suggest a common mechanism for resting biases and abnormal synergies, which appears to be a contradiction given the functional separation of moving and holding observed in the same patients. To resolve this paradox, we propose a conceptual model that predicts a breakdown in the functional separation between reaching and holding when patients move in the absence of weight support. This conceptual model posits that synergies are the behavioral manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

The assay relies on one fragment (GFP1-10) encoded in the mitochondrial DNA enabling specific visualization of only the proteins tagged with a smaller fragment, GFP11, and localized to the mitochondrial matrix or the inner membrane. We used the SWAp-Tag (SWAT) strategy to tag every protein with GFP11 and mated them with the BiG GFP strain. Imaging the collection in six different conditions allowed us to visualize almost 400 mitochondrial proteins, 50 of which were never visualized in mitochondria before, and many are poorly studied dually localized proteins. We use structure-function analysis to characterize the dually localized protein Gpp1, revealing an upstream start codon that generates a mitochondrial targeting signal and explore its unique function. We also show how this data can be applied to study mitochondrial inner membrane protein topology and sorting.

Yet, the mechanisms ensuring their faithful segregation remain unclear. Here, we show that polar chromosomes require a unique step involving spindle elongation, which repositions chromosome-bound astral microtubules by pivoting them around the centrosome toward the spindle surface. By modulating Eg5/KIF11 activity, we demonstrate that spindle elongation determines the direction and extent of pivoting, with microtubules from the opposite spindle half facilitating final movement. Kinetochores on polar chromosomes form mixed lateral and immature monotelic attachments, recruiting corona components and partially Mad2, but lacking Astrin. In several cancer cell lines, limited spindle elongation delays polar chromosome resolution, whereas enhanced elongation accelerates it. These findings highlight the role of spindle elongation in the timely rescue of polar chromosomes from the 'danger zone' behind the pole, and provide mechanistic insight into how chromosome congression errors can arise in cancer.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

As P. aeruginosa is well-known for its growth phase dependent phenotypes and gene regulation, our goal was to determine how temperature altered global gene expression at exponential versus stationary phase and to characterize how growth phase affects thermoregulation. To do this, we grew PAO1 in parallel at 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C and sampled the same populations first at exponential phase and then again at stationary phase and assessed gene expression by RNA-sequencing. We found that temperature regulated hundreds of genes at, and unique to, exponential and stationary phase.

The present research aimed to identify cognitive tests in which performance is associated with objective sleep quality or quantity, focusing on cognitive tests designed to evaluate the earliest cognitive changes in dementia. Methods: We recruited older adults (50 years of age or older) and remotely monitored their sleep patterns for 7 consecutive days using wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries. On day 7, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, which included the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Prodromal Alzheimer's and Mild Cognitive Impairment battery from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), designed to tax pattern separation. The participants were also assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results: The final sample included 34 participants (mean age: 65.56, SD: 9.57). There were significant correlations between objective total sleep time and PVT and MST performance. MoCA scores were correlated with performance on CANTAB and MST. Objective total sleep time also predicted MST performance when controlling for age and gender. Conclusions: Performance on cognitive tests designed to assess pattern separation are sensitive to older adults' objective sleep duration and the early cognitive changes associated with dementia.

We found that longer-lived species tend to accumulate fewer CpGs exhibiting increased methylation noise over time, irrespective of whether these changes arise from hyper- or hypomethylation mechanisms. Importantly, the rate of epigenetic entropy gain declines in a linear fashion with species' maximum lifespan, pointing to the existence of a universal constraint on mammalian longevity, estimated to lie in the vicinity of 220 years. We further demonstrated that this relationship and its associated limit were independent of species and sample selection, as well as phylogenetic relatedness, and remained robust across different scenarios of lifespan estimation uncertainty.

Honeybees, with their specialized gut microbiota and well-known ecology, offer an ideal system to study this evolution. Using shotgun metagenomics on 200 worker bees from five honeybee species, we recover thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes and identify several novel bacterial species. While microbial communities were mostly host-specific, we found both specialists and generalists, even among closely related bacterial species, with notable variation between honeybee hosts. Some bacterial generalists emerged host-specific only at the strain level, suggesting recent host switches. While we found some signal of co-diversification between hosts and symbionts, this was not more than expected by chance and was much less pronounced than what has been observed for gut bacteria of hominids and small mammals. Instead, symbiont gains, losses, and replacements emerged as the predominant process for honeybees. This highly dynamic evolution of the specialized honey bee gut microbiota has led to taxonomic and functional differences across hosts, such as the ability to degrade pollen-derived pectin.

Here, we demonstrate that IFN-{lambda} acts through mechanisms that are beyond its ability to induce JAK/STAT signaling and promotes fast cell death in epithelial cells stimulated with poly(I:C). Studying influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in vitro we notice that type I interferons, when provided prior to infection, induce higher STAT1/2 activation and a stronger accumulation of proteins coded by interferon-stimulated genes, and correspondingly suppress both IAV and RSV spread more effectively than type III interferons. The knockout of the IFN-{lambda} receptor (subunit IFNLR1), compared to the knockout of the IFN-{lambda} receptor (subunit IFNAR1), only slightly influences levels of STAT1/2 phosphorylation during infection with any of the viruses; However, IFNLR1 knockout results in a greater proportion of IAV-infected cells and higher viral RNA and protein levels. We showed that the ratio of dying to infected cells is lower in IFNLR1-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells, suggesting thatIFN-{lambda} promotes the rapid death of IAV-infected cells and thereby limits viral spread. This effect was not observed in RSV-infected cultures, possibly due to the RSV' ability to suppress host cell death through its nonstructural proteins. Overall, our results reveal a distinct role for IFN-{lambda} in restricting viral infections by triggering rapid death of infected epithelial cells, in contrast to type I interferons, which are the main inducers of JAK/STAT-mediated expression of ISGs, that may be used by IFN-{lambda} to trigger cell death.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Beyond their roles in physiological regulation and emotional states, each of these visceral rhythms has been shown to influence brain activity and cognition, prompting for the development of various interpretative functional frameworks. However, both experimental data and functional hypothesis leave it unclear whether and how each visceral rhythm acts simultaneously and independently on brain activity. Here we address this question by measuring in human participants how the corticospinal excitability of the motor system varies with the phase of each of the three visceral rhythms. We applied single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over the hand region in primary motor cortex to elicit Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP), whose amplitude reflects corticospinal excitability, and tested whether MEP amplitude depends on the phase of the simultaneously measured cardiac, respiratory and gastric rhythms. All three visceral rhythms were coupled to motor excitability with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths: participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs. These results indicate that independent mechanisms could underly the coupling between the cardiac, respiratory and gastric rhythm and motor excitability. We further introduce the concept of individual interoceptive profiles, and show that such interoceptive profiles obtained from objective coupling strength measures were not explained by self-reported awareness of the organ. Altogether our results call for refined specifications of the frameworks offering a functional or clinical interpretation of viscera-brain coupling taking into account both independent mechanisms and individual interoceptive profiles.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

These difficulties are thought to stem from atypical brain development and abnormal network interactions, yet an integrative network-level model accounting for such impairments remains lacking. Methods: To bridge this gap, we applied the dynamic meta-networking framework of language, a theoretical model capturing domain-segregation dynamics during rest, to examine age-related changes (5-60 years) in cortical language networks in individuals with ASD. To further probe the biological underpinnings of these dynamics, we quantified spatial correspondences between network state hubs and gene co-expression modules as well as neurotransmitter receptor distributions. Results: We identified distinct language meta-states characterized by domain-segregation connectivity patterns, which exhibited spatial alignment with gene co-expression modules and neurotransmitter systems. Individuals with ASD showed state-dependent developmental trajectories marked by age-related hypo- and hyper-connectivity. Critically, these network alterations strongly predicted verbal IQ and communicative difficulties, but were unrelated to social functioning or stereotyped behaviors.

Recent reports suggest that severe post-infection syndromes can partially accelerate aging. However, the underlying gene-encoded regulatory interplay, whether being shared or distinct between aging and infection biology are poorly understood. Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics to establish a multi-organ atlas (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) across the mouse lifespan (4, 17, and 26 months). Dissecting high-quality fresh-frozen tissue samples at unbiased molecular resolution, we found both organ-specific and cross-organ gene dysregulation upon aging. We identified age-related trajectories in gene expression and cell state, some only detectable within their spatial context, and provide validation at subcellular resolution. The most prominent effect was organ-wide immune system activation with spatially variable severity. We therefore evaluated how aging mimics the expression signatures observed in systemic infection, using spatial transcriptomics slices from young mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. While on the gene level the effect sizes caused by the infection outweighed those of aging, we reveal a shared activation of the early complement pathway (C4b) and serine protease inhibitors (Serpin gene family) within by phenotype distinct spatial niches. We show that this common RNA signature is driven by tissue-specific cell types and eventually affects protein levels in the aged brain, rendering them a target for future mechanistic and drug discovery studies.

While large language models (LLMs) can accelerate the discovery, their reasoning improves when grounded in structured, auditable and comprehensive biomedical prior knowledge.

By bridging prior knowledge with user-specific data, TNG is a novel and ideal data-structure for the development of graph foundation models, with the potential to improve prediction performance and interpretability, while also augmenting LLMs by supplying graph-structured mechanistic context to strengthen reasoning.

The brain must rely on population representations to distinguish changes in one dimension from changes in another. To understand how the visual system might extract separable stimulus representations, we recorded multiunit neuronal responses to texture images varying along two dimensions: contrast, a property represented as early as the retina, and naturalistic statistical structure, a property that modulates neuronal responses in V2 and V4, but not in V1. We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity. Tuning for naturalistic structure was strongest in V4; tuning in both dimensions was most heterogeneous in V4. We measured how well populations in each area could support the linear readout of both dimensions. Populations in V2 and V4 could support the linear readout of naturalistic structure, but in V4, this readout was more robust to variations in contrast.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be studied using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm involves the repeated pairing of two innocuous stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase in which one stimulus is associated with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild foot-shock. The result is a conditioned response (e.g., freezing) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we successfully established a light-tone sensory preconditioning task specifically in male mice, as sex differences were observed in both control experimental groups and in sensory preconditioning responses. We employed in vivo, freely moving fiber photometry to monitor neural activity in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus in male mice during the formation of associations between innocuous stimuli and reinforcers. Additionally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to investigate the roles of these hippocampal subregions in sensory preconditioning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive neurons are involved in encoding innocuous stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we developed a novel light-tone sensory preconditioning protocol in male mice, enabling the detection of sex differences and furthering our understanding of how specific hippocampal subregions and cell types regulate complex cognitive processes.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, protein modifications including deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, and conversion of glutamine or glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, can change the sequence of peptides, leading to spurious taxonomic detections and potentially inaccurate archaeological interpretations. While a handful of examples of this phenomenon have been reported in the literature, the issue is potentially much wider reaching than currently realised. In reality, any time a peptide containing a deamidated glutamine or asparagine residue, an unmodified glutamic acid or aspartic acid residue, or a pyroglutamic acid modification is detected by proteomic search software, the sequence, and therefore potentially its taxonomy, may be incorrect, which could potentially lead to unsound archaeological interpretations. The Demodifier is a fast, open source tool which solves this issue by screening for modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomy, enabling archaeologists to make informed interpretations of the taxonomies of peptides detected in ancient samples. To assess its utility, the Demodifier is tested against an archaeological dataset containing all unique peptides reported in palaeoproteomic studies of dental calculus and vessels. The results reveal that modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomies are severely under-reported, occurring 15% more frequently than previously understood. Modifications were found to produce three different types of inaccurate taxonomic matches: those which yielded completely different taxonomic lowest common ancestors to the input peptide, those which were more taxonomically specific than the input peptide, and those which were less taxonomically specific than the input peptide. The Demodifier therefore enables the rapid detection of potentially inaccurate peptide taxonomies, avoiding spurious archaeological interpretations in future studies.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

K.; Winawer, J.", "abstract": "In a step toward developing a model of human primary visual cortex, a recent study introduced a model of spatial frequency tuning in V1 (Broderick, Simoncelli, & Winawer, 2022). The model is compact, using just 9 parameters to predict BOLD response amplitude for locations across all of V1 as a function of stimulus orientation and spatial frequency. Here we replicated this analysis in a new dataset, the \"nsdsynthetic\" supplement to the Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022), to assess generalization of model parameters. Furthermore, we extended the analyses to extrastriate maps V2 and V3. For each retinotopic map in the 8 NSD subjects, we fit the 9-parameter model. Despite many experimental differences between NSD and the original study, including stimulus size, experimental design, and MR field strength, there was good agreement in most model parameters. The dependence of preferred spatial frequency on eccentricity in V1 was similar between NSD and Broderick et al. Moreover, the effect of absolute stimulus orientation on spatial frequency maps was similar: higher preferred spatial frequency for horizontal and cardinal orientations compared to vertical and oblique orientations in both studies. The extension to extrastriate maps revealed that the biggest change in tuning between maps was in bandwidth: the bandwidth in spatial frequency tuning increased by 70% from V1 to V2 and 100% from V1 to V3. This implies that higher visual areas are sensitive to a greater range of stimulus spatial frequencies, paralleling the fact that higher visual areas are sensitive to a greater range in location (i.e., larger receptive fields). Together, the results show robust reproducibility and bring us closer to a systematic characterization of spatial encoding in the human visual system.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we systematically map metaproteomic responses of ex vivo human gut microbiota to 312 compounds, generating 4.6 million microbial protein responses, available as an interactive resource (https://shiny.imetalab.ca/MPR_Viz/). Protein-level analyses identify significant metaproteomic shifts induced by 47 compounds, with neuropharmaceuticals as the sole drug class significantly enriched among these hits. Further analyses on the community level reveal a tri-stability pattern in microbial composition and the emergence of three distinct functional states, based on a functional beta-diversity metric. Notably, neuropharmaceuticals cause particularly strong effects on the microbiomes, lowering the proteome-level functional redundancy and raising the level of antimicrobial resistance proteins, ultimately pushing the microbiome into an alternative functional state. Preliminary validation suggests that enhancing functional redundancy may contribute to maintaining microbiota resilience against neuropharmaceutical-induced antimicrobial resistance. Overall, this work establishes a comprehensive view of how drugs influence gut microbiome function and ecology at the protein level, proposes a landscape-based framework for interpreting community resilience, and highlights the need to consider protein-level and ecological responses in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In bacterial chromosome segregation via the ParABS system, hundreds of ParB proteins are recruited around the centromere-like parS sequence forming the partition complex. Recent studies have shown that ParB binds CTP and undergoes cycles of loading and unloading near parS, however, this accounts for the recruitment of only a small fraction of ParB molecules, leaving its role unclear. Separately, a lattice gas model with fixed interaction energy has been proposed to describe ParB phase separation, but it fails to explain key experimental observations, including the absence of droplets in ParB variants. We reconcile these two perspectives by proposing that the ParB-CTP cycle acts as a molecular switch that enhances ParB-ParB interactions, triggering phase transition from vapor to liquid-like condensates. Our hypothesis is supported by numerical simulations of droplet formation and experiments showing that ParB variants disrupting the CTP cycle fail to undergo phase separation. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for ParB-CTP-mediated phase transitions and may have broader implications for understanding the spatial control of intracellular condensate formation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Ruptoblasts undergo an explosive cell death, 'ruptosis', triggered by activin, a multifunctional hormone that also acts as an inflammatory cytokine. Excessive activin -- induced through protein injection, genetic chimerism, or bacterial infection -- initiates ruptosis, discharging potent diffusible cytotoxic agents capable of eliminating any nearby cells, bacteria, and even mammalian cells within minutes. Ruptoblast ablation suppresses inflammation but compromises bacterial clearance, highlighting their broad-spectrum immune functions. Mechanistically distinct from known cytotoxic mechanisms, the explosive nature of ruptosis relies on intracellular calcium and dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization.

M.; Simard, F.", "abstract": "Background: Greening cities is a nature-based strategy for sustainable urban development that integrates natural elements like plants or water bodies, to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance human well-being. However, urban green infrastructures (UGIs) can influence the distribution of disease vectors, potentially affecting vector-borne diseases (VBDs). UGIs may provide new suitable environments for urban vectors, while also creating opportunities to mitigate VBD risks through predation, competition, and dilution effects. This article examined the relationships between UGIs, vectors, and associated pathogens, impacting both human and animal health, highlighting knowledge gaps and identifying research priorities to support VBD risk mitigation measures and to guide smart urban planning and design. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in three databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science). Selected articles involved (i) any aspect of a urban vector system, (ii) in UGIs, and (iii) statistical analysis of the effects of UGIs on VBD risk. Methods employed to characterize UGIs and VBDs were described and the identified impacts were summarized by vector group. Results: Among the 98 articles reviewed, most addressed mosquito-pathogen systems (66), tick-pathogen systems (29), and few other vector-borne pathogen systems (3), with studies often confined to a single city or several cities within the same country and focused on one vector group. Urban vegetation generally appeared to heighten the risk of tick-borne diseases. In contrast, the influence of UGIs on the risk of mosquito-borne diseases varied depending on the vector system and on the environmental and climatic context. The diversity of indicators used to assess UGIs and VBD risks may affect the observed impact on VBD risk. Conclusion: Given the increasing popularity of urban greening, it is crucial to investigate its potential implications for public health, and thereby urban planning decisions. However, the lack of standardized protocols complicates the accurate assessment of the effects of UGIs on the risk for VBD emergence and transmission and consequently, on potential mitigation measures.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We hypothesised that fructose metabolism in intestinal L-cells triggers GLP-1 secretion, which then potentiates insulin secretion and counteracts fructose-induced hyperglycaemia. To test this hypothesis, we systematically characterised metabolic responses across multiple mouse strains after 24 h ad libitum fructose ingestion. In both lean (NSY.B6-a/a) and obese diabetic (NSY.B6-Ay/a) mice, fructose elevated plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The insulin response was preserved in GIP receptor-deficient mice (Gipr-/-) but was abolished in proglucagon-deficient mice (Gcg-/-) by pharmacological GLP-1 receptor antagonism, indicating a requirement for GLP-1, but not GIP. Across strains, fructose-induced insulin response correlated with attenuation of post-fructose glycaemia, consistent with insulin being essential for suppressing fructose-induced hyperglycaemia. To explore the mechanism underlying fructose-induced GLP-1 secretion, we combined ATP-sensitive potassium channel-deficient mice (Kcnj11-/-), GLUTag L-cell line, and metabolic tracing of 13C-labelled fructose in freshly isolated intestinal crypts. These complementary approaches support a model in which fructolysis increases the ATP/ADP ratio in L-cells, closes KATP channels, and stimulates GLP-1 secretion. In obese diabetic mice, increased fructolytic flux and a higher ATP/ADP ratio were associated with elevated GLP-1 levels, further corroborating this model. Collectively, our findings indicate that intestinal fructose metabolism drives GLP-1 secretion required to potentiate insulin secretion, thereby establishing a gut-pancreas axis that counter-regulates fructose-induced hyperglycaemia.\n\n1. ABSTRACT FIGURE LEGENDThis study investigated the hormonal effects of short-term fructose consumption in mice, allowing them ad-lib access to fructose solution for 24 h. Fructose metabolism in intestinal L-cells increases the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, leading to GLP-1 secretion via KATP channel closure and Ca2+ influx. GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic {beta}-cells. The fructose metabolism/GLP-1/insulin pathway is essential for mitigation of fructose-induced hyperglycaemia.

Differences in epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, can also contribute to phenotypic variations, even among individuals with identical genetic information. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, particularly in vertebrates. The number of fin rays in teleosts, such as medaka, serves as a useful model for studying this variation. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the teleost Hox code plays a crucial role in determining the anterior-posterior identity necessary for the formation of dorsal and anal fins. In this study, we investigated widefins medaka, a spontaneous mutant displaying phenotypic variation in the number of dorsal and anal fin rays. Long-read whole-genome sequencing revealed that an extremely large transposon, Teratorn, containing a herpesvirus genome, was inserted into the hoxc12a 3' UTR. This insertion decreased hoxc12a expression and, in some cases, also affected neighboring hox genes, resulting in variations in fin size and the presence or absence of dorsal fins. Additionally, hoxc6a, located 50 kb away from the insertion, was also downregulated in widefins medaka. These findings suggest that this large transposon insertion leads to a reduction in nearby hox gene expression, contributing to the phenotypic variation observed in widefins medaka.

We investigated the immediate and long-term effects of Cb-tDCS on sensory-evoked responses in the cerebellum and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice. Sensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded in Crus I/II and S1 during and after short (15 s) or long (20 min) sessions of anodal or cathodal Cb-tDCS. In addition, the excitation/inhibition balance was assessed by quantifying vGLUT1 and GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity, and spectral changes in local field potentials were analyzed using FFT-based analysis. Anodal and cathodal Cb-tDCS respectively induced an immediate increase and decrease in the trigeminal component in Crus I/II but no aftereffects were observed 20 minutes post-stimulation. In S1, Cb-tDCS resulted in polarity-dependent modulation of the N1 component during stimulation, which was opposite to the changes induced in Crus I/II and a sustained increase after anodal Cb-tDCS, accompanied by reduced GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity. While power spectrum analysis revealed no changes in Crus I/II, cathodal Cb-tDCS significantly modulated gamma (30-45 Hz) and high-frequency oscillations (255-300 Hz) in S1. These findings show that Cb-tDCS differentially modulates sensory input processing in cerebellar and cortical circuits. While cerebellar effects are transient, stimulation elicits lasting changes in remote cortical areas. This underscores the need to consider both local and distant network effects when applying Cb-tDCS in translational and clinical settings.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Innovative tools for malaria control are being developed, such as a gene drive system to suppress the vectors' populations, requiring knowledge of the population genetics of malaria vectors, including their population structure, size and genetic diversity to ensure effective and targeted implementation. This study collected 2918 Anopheles gambiae and 173 Anopheles arabiensis across six populations from both the islands on Lake Victoria and mainland Uganda for amplicon sequencing. Large pairwise FST values were observed between the two species, indicating their divergence. We observed low but often significant FST values between the 6 An. gambiae populations, while between the An. arabiensis mainland populations, FST values were not significant. Principal Component Analysis also revealed strong genetic structure between the two species but did not provide a clear picture between populations within a each species. We also found that mainland An. gambiae populations had higher within-population genetic diversity than the islands', while An. arabiensis had the lowest nucleotide diversity. Tajima's D values were all negative, suggesting a recent population expansion. The islands An. gambiae populations had very low contemporary effective population sizes in the tens and hundreds, as estimated from linkage disequilibrium, while the mainland population sizes were consistently higher, in the thousands. This study revealed that there is significant genetic differentiation between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, as well as between island and mainland populations of An. gambiae, with mainland populations showing higher connectivity and island populations exhibiting greater isolation. In contrast, An. arabiensis mainland populations displayed no significant differentiation, suggesting panmixia.

Measuring the mechanical interactions of growing plants with surrounding objects is a critical step towards deciphering thigmotropic responses underpinning complex growth strategies. Yet, available force-measurement systems have limited capacity to capture weak (sub-mN) forces in freely moving plant organs - such as the forces applied by a growing shoot pushing at an obstacle. We developed a measurement system based on the deflection of a pendulum by a freely moving shoot. Crucially, unlike many force-measurement systems, the organ is not tethered to the device. Moreover, force is measured along two axes, as opposed to one axis in commonly used methods such as cantilevers. Orthogonal cameras track the 3D position of the rod and shoot, yielding the rod deflection angle and, using a mechanical torque equilibrium equation, allowing to extract the force applied by the plant over time. This system is relevant for measuring weak forces in macro-sized systems (such as growth or turgor pressures), and the force detection range can be tuned by altering rod mass and length. We demonstrate the system with bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) shoots, measuring the forces they apply on a candidate support during inherent circumnutation movements, prior to twining.

J.", "abstract": "Enhancing regulatory T cell (Treg) function offers a compelling therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disease. Engineered IL-2 muteins selectively expand functional Tregs with minimal impact on other immune cells, but their potential to compromise antiviral immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we used a murine model of Influenza A virus (Flu) infection to determine how IL-2 mutein shapes T cell responses to respiratory virus infection. IL-2 mutein administration prior to infection suppressed Flu-specific (Flu-sp) CD8 T cell responses and altered their localization and phenotype within the lungs, without affecting bystander CD8 T cells. This suppression correlated with reduced antigen presentation molecule expression on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) early after infection but did not impact Flu-sp CD8 T cell priming. In contrast, administering IL-2 mutein during infection exacerbated disease and drove CD25-dependent expansion of Flu-sp CD8 T cells. Despite these opposing effects on effector responses, Fc.Mut24-treated mice generated robust antibody responses and protective T cell memory which were maintained for at least 170 days. These findings reveal that Fc.Mut24 has temporally distinct effects on antiviral immunity, dampening early effector responses when given before infection, but enhancing effector expansion and disease severity when delivered during infection. Our results provide critical context for the therapeutic application of IL-2 muteins and highlight the importance of treatment timing in balancing immune modulation with protective immunity.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "A longstanding debate in neuroscience concerns whether macroscale brain signals can be described as purely linear Gaussian processes or they harbor the more complex statistics of nonlinear dynamics. We introduce BiSpectral EEG Component Analysis (BiSCA), a framework unifying power spectral and bispectral analysis to test for nonlinearity by identifying inter-frequency harmonic relationships and disambiguating them from superimposed components. In particular, simulations confirm that it is able to separate valid nonlinearity from non-Gaussianity, which is a common confound. Applying this test to two large human brain recordings datasets (1,771 intracranial channels and 960 individuals' scalp EEG), we find the brain's broadband, aperiodic background behaves as a linear, Gaussian process, while narrowband Rho oscillatory --including the Alpha and Mu rhythms --are the primary source of cortical nonlinearity, exhibiting significant quadratic cross-frequency coupling. Both recordings show significant departures from linear Gaussian behavior. We observe a clear dissociation between signal power and nonlinearity. While the occipital Alpha rhythm dominates the power spectrum, the strongest nonlinear signatures arise from the less dominant parietal Mu rhythm. These findings suggest that nonlinear resonance is pervasive in cortical signals, primarily expressed through resonant oscillations rather than aperiodic activity. Without accounting for these intrinsic nonlinear interactions, a principled understanding of neural activity will be incomplete.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we reanalyzed publicly available datasets using bioinformatic approaches and found evidence that TERRA binds non-telomeric DNA regions in trans through R-loop formation. Notably, the presence of tandem telomeric repeat motifs within non-telomeric regions enhanced TERRA binding, suggesting sequence-dependent R-loop formation. Furthermore, analysis of previously identified TERRA-regulated genes revealed that such distal TERRA-DNA interactions may influence telomere elongation by modulating the expression of telomere maintenance factors.

The most prominent addition to SAGA in metazoans compared to yeast is a 150kDa splicing-factor module (SPL). SPL is also a part of the U2snRNP but its role in SAGA is elusive, partially due to absence of high-resolution structural information regarding its incorporation into the complex. In yeast, subunit TAF5 and TAF6 of SAGA are shared with the general transcription factor TFIID. In metazoans, gene duplication created proteins that occur only in SAGA (TAF5L and TAF6L) or in TFIID (TAF5 and TAF6). What functions of SAGA benefit from this protein specialization is unclear. Here we report the structure of endogenous human SAGA purified via an affinity-ligand from cells that were not disturbed by any genomic engineering tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. Our work reveals the high-resolution structure of SPL and of the TAF6L HEAT repeat domain that provides the SPL with a docking surface. We elucidate how SPL and the HEAT repeats are incorporated into SAGA. We find multiple major differences between TAF6L/TAF5L and the canonical paralogues that are directly implicated in structural re-arrangements required to accommodate SPL. Furthermore, SPL binding to SAGA is very different and occupying much less interaction surface than to U2snRNP. However, the two cases still share similar sequences in a helix that is deeply inserted into the SPL. The seemingly weaker interaction of SPL with SAGA raises the possibility that SAGA serves to relay this module to the splicing machinery. Our structure also suggests mutations that could uncouple SPL from SAGA to further interrogate the role of this module.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal a profound rewiring of NAD+ metabolism as a central driver of metabolic disturbance. Analysis of bulk liver tissue shows increased activity of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, enhancing NAD+ precursor production. Hepatic nicotinamide (NAM) levels decrease due to elevated expression of NAM N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) in HSCs. Despite reduced hepatic NAM, serum NAD+ level rise and is compartmentalized, triggering a disruption in NAD+ homeostasis and activating NF-{kappa}B-mediated oxidative stress pathways. Moreover, lipid dysregulation occurs, with NF-{kappa}B dominating the regulation of SIRT1/SREBP-controlled lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes, leading to imbalances in hepatic and serum lipids.

Likelihood-based methods can identify introgression between sisters but the test exhibits several nonstandard features, including boundary problems, indeterminate parameters, and multiple routes from the alternative to the null hypotheses. In the Bayesian test, those irregularities pose challenges to the use of the Savage-Dickey (S-D) density ratio to calculate the Bayes factor.

In this study, we focused on the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, which is considered one of the most ancient carbon fixation pathways and the reductive glycine (rGly) pathway, which shares several reactions with the WL pathway. The evolutionary scenario of the two carbon fixation pathways was inferred in the phylum Thermodesulfobacteriota, which includes microorganisms that operate either the WL pathway or the rGly pathway for autotrophic growth. The timing of gene gain and loss events was inferred by gene presence/absence analyses for both pathways, together with phylogenetic analyses of their key enzymes. Our results suggested that the common ancestor of Thermodesulfobacteriota possessed all genes encoding key enzymes of both pathways; formate dehydrogenase, the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex and the glycine cleavage system. Furthermore, analyses of complete gene sets for the WL and rGly pathway, together with downstream genes required for amino acid biosynthesis, supported the possibility that the common ancestor of this phylum had been capable of autotrophic growth through these carbon fixation pathways. Then, multiple lineages have lost the WL and rGly pathway genes independently during subsequent evolution. Gene replacements also occurred in the glycine cleavage system by regaining genes by horizontal gene transfer.

Implicit motor adaptation - adaptation that occurs without conscious awareness - is thought to be primarily driven by sensory prediction errors. Here, we investigated how rapidly these unconscious changes in reaching behavior emerge as a function of error magnitude and the availability of task error signals. To this end, we employed a single-trial learning (STL) paradigm within a classical visuomotor rotation task. Participants made center-out reaching movements to either small (dot) or large (arc) targets while experiencing single perturbation trials with cursor rotations ranging from 1 to 90 deg, each followed by an aligned washout trial. By manipulating target size, we systematically modulated the presence of task error while holding sensory prediction error constant. We further compared these early implicit changes with those observed during standard prolonged adaptation to a fixed 20-deg rotation across >100 trials. Our results show that implicit adaptation emerges rapidly, even after a single exposure to small perturbations, and follows a saturating, fixed-rate response profile. Importantly, the magnitude of single-trial adaptation was greater when task error was present (small targets) compared with conditions in which only sensory prediction error was available (large targets). Moreover, STL-derived parameters moderately predicted the initial phase of adaptation during prolonged learning, suggesting that STL captures core dynamics of early implicit processes. These findings provide new insight into the mechanistic principles governing implicit motor adaptation. By identifying the parameters that drive early-stage error-based learning, this work refines current models of sensorimotor learning and highlights potential strategies for designing targeted training or rehabilitation protocols that leverage rapid adaptation processes to enhance motor performance and recovery.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While its role in cancer is established, the involvement of PDLIM2 in viral infection remains unclear. Results: Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-kB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses. Conclusions: These findings highlight PDLIM2 repression as a common mechanism underlying human viral infectious diseases and suggest PDLIM2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for disease prognosis, prevention, and treatment.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Analyses revealed significant IBD in 27 predominant gut bacterial species, including members of the Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae, but limited evidence for co-inheritance of gut bacterial genomes with mitochondria during the diversification of extant mouse populations. Gut bacterial species capable of forming spores exhibited reduced IBD independently of phylogenetic history, indicating that adaptations facilitating bacterial dispersal can mitigate the geographic structuring of strain diversity.

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We use 7T functional MRI (fMRI) to study 1) differences in somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps between FHD individuals and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV), 2) changes in cortical digit maps of FHD individuals after BTX treatment.\n\nMethodsFour FHD patients underwent behavioural measures and 7T fMRI at two timepoints: [~]30 days after BTX treatment at peak efficacy (Post-BTX), immediately prior to their next injection [~]100 days after treatment when therapeutic effects had declined (Pre-BTX). HVs were scanned at a single time point. Behavioural measures included temporal discrimination (TDT), amplitude thresholding (AMP) and spatial acuity grating orientation tasks. A somatosensory travelling wave (TW) digit-mapping fMRI task was performed on dominant/affected and non-dominant/un-affected hands, and a motor TW digit-mapping task on the dominant/affected hand. Fourier analysis derived digit maps which were compared to a probabilistic digit atlas, and population receptive field (pRF) mapping performed.

Somatosensory and motor TW cortical digit maps in FHD and HV showed clear digit ordering. Somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps were more disordered in the dominant/affected hand than the non-dominant hand for FHD Post and Pre-BTX compared to HVs (DICE coefficient/Figure of Merit). Compared to the atlas, HV maps were in-line for both hands, while in FHD central tendency (CT) was lower in the dominant/affected hand than non-dominant hand. pRF sizes were larger in the FHD Pre-BTX group compared to HV and Post-BTX for the dominant hand.\n\nConclusionBehaviourally, FHD patients had lower spatial acuity than HVs.

To elucidate the function of the gM/gN complex in secondary envelopment, we employed a combination of viral mutants, siRNA knockdown, and ultrastructural analyses. Ultrastructural examination of a mutant virus with a cysteine-to-serine mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of gN (TB-gN-C123S) showed a defect in the initiation of secondary envelopment, as most capsids in TB-gN-C123S-infected cells were either not in contact with cytoplasmic membranes or, when near membranes, lacked signs of budding. The defect in secondary envelopment was associated with an accumulation of partially tegumented capsids in the peripheral region of the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment (cVAC). Additionally, large protein aggregates were observed within and near the cVAC, often associated with non-enveloped capsids. A comparable ultrastructural phenotype was observed in wild-type virus-infected cells treated with siRNA against gM. Further evidence underscoring the role of the gM/gN glycoprotein complex in viral morphogenesis was obtained by investigating gM- and gN-null mutants, which displayed the same altered capsid distribution observed in TB-gN-C123S infections and after siRNA knockdown of gM. Finally, the inhibition of palmitoylation in wild-type virus-infected cells resulted in analogous defects, including an accumulation of partially tegumented capsids in the periphery of the cVAC and protein aggregates associated with capsids. In summary, our findings indicate a crucial role for the gM/gN complex in initiating secondary envelopment and highlight the involvement of palmitoylation in this process. AUTHORS SUMMARY Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread herpesvirus that can cause severe illness in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. Like other herpesviruses, HCMV assembles its infectious particles through a complex process where the virus acquires its envelope through secondary envelopment. In this study, we investigated the role of glycoprotein M (gM) and glycoprotein N (gN), which form a conserved complex across herpesviruses. Using genetic mutants, RNA interference, and electron microscopy, we found that the gM/gN complex is crucial for initiating secondary envelopment. Disruption of gM or gN function, or palmitoylation inhibition, prevented capsids from budding into membranes, resulting in partially tegumented capsids that accumulated at the periphery of the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment (cVAC). Our findings highlight the important role of the gM/gN complex and palmitoylation in HCMV assembly and suggest that assembly occurs in a spatially organized manner within the cVAC, providing new insights into how herpesviruses produce infectious particles.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) can contribute to a better understanding of the disease and accelerate (novel) medicinal product development. Methods: A robust production process for C. difficile spores for experimental human administration, was implemented. Direct-release capsules containing viable C. difficile spores were formulated. The manufacturing process aligns with good manufacturing practices (GMP) guidelines, including quality controls and release by a qualified person (QP). Results: Selected non-toxigenic and toxigenic C. difficile strains were used to create a master cell bank and working cell bank from which multiple batches of purified active substance were produced.

The active product and its intermediate products passed all quality controls for identity, potency, purity and safety, and were individually released by the QP. Stability of active substance and product is confirmed up to 12 months. Conclusion: Although there are no clear standardized international guidelines for challenge material production, we demonstrate that it is feasible to produce C. difficile human challenge material for small scale application in CHIM trials.

We sampled thalli at Manawai in 2021 and 2023, at Kuaihelani in 2022 and 2023, and at H[o]lanik[u] in 2023 to characterize the reproductive mode and patterns of gene flow. Tetrasporophytes overwhelmingly dominated at all sites, atolls, and years, although eight cystocarpic female gametophytes (<1%) were documented for the first time. We observed evidence of very high clonal rates, accompanied by an increase in homozygosity. Surprisingly, our temporal analyses suggested site-specific trends in the predominance of selfing, outcrossing, or clonality. A very small haploid proportion combined with high genetic drift likely rendered temporal analyses of genotypic frequencies challenging to implement and interpret whereby point estimates were a better reflection of reproductive mode variation. Genetic differentiation increased with geographic distance, with strong temporal and spatial structure. The patterns of genetic diversity and structure combined with the dominance of tetrasporophytes suggest that C. tumulosa thalli were introduced to this region, possibly via marine debris. Future studies should focus on identifying the native range to document the ecological and evolutionary shifts that have facilitated the rapid increase and spread of C. tumulosa and its potential similarities to other invasive haploid-diploid algae.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Gastric adenocarcinoma is routinely classified by Lauren histology into Intestinal and Diffuse types; however, its prognostic use is limited by molecular heterogeneity within each subtype. We tested whether transcriptomic features refine risk beyond histology and whether biomarker signals generalize across populations. The premise is that when underlying programs diverge across tumors and cohorts, a single biomarker is unlikely to be universally informative; accordingly, integrating molecular signatures with histology may improve risk stratification. We analyzed TCGA-STAD and GTEx gene expression data for discovery and validated the findings in ACRG. Cell-program markers guided unsupervised clustering, and a predictive signature was learned using recursive feature elimination with a random forest and cross-validation. Pathway context was assessed with GSEA, and clinical relevance was evaluated within each Lauren subtype. Clustering of canonical gastric and intestinal programs yielded two molecular clusters that did not explain survival. However, Diffuse tumors with stronger intestinal-like programs tended to experience better outcomes. Consistently, the derived signature was associated closely with Lauren categories and defined two molecular groups. Nevertheless, neither histology nor the signature alone stratified overall survival at conventional thresholds. Moreover, gene-level survival analyses indicated subtype specificity rather than universality. In TCGA, 28 signature genes were associated with overall survival (P < 0.05; HR, 0.79-1.63). ROC analyses for Lauren typing were heterogeneous, with CRLF1 achieving an AUC of 0.92, followed by CYP1B1 and MMRN2. ACRG gene expression revealed an inversion of the TCGA pattern, with prognostic risk shifting toward the Diffuse subtype. Specifically, CRLF1, ERG, and FRZB shifted from Intestinal risk to Diffuse risk, while CDX1 shifted from Intestinal to Diffuse protection. Taken together, these findings suggest that the utility of biomarkers in gastric cancer depends on histology and the population context. Consequently, a contextual strategy that integrates molecular signatures with the Lauren classification has the potential to improve risk stratification beyond either source alone.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While, in most cases, STHs can establish chronic infections, the dynamics of the infection can be altered when other parasites exploit the same host. These changes can have consequences in terms of the health of the host, the epidemiology of the disease (e.g., the duration of the infection and the inter-host transmission success) and the fitness of the parasite. Here, we investigated if the coinfection with Plasmodium yoelii alters the dynamics and the fitness of the murine nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. We found that, compared to single infected mice, coinfection produced an increase in the number of excreted eggs, while the biomass of adult worms in the intestine did not differ between single infected and coinfected mice. Moreover, the increase in egg excretion was also observed when Plasmodium infected hosts that had been harboring the nematode during the past four weeks (i.e., when the population size of adult worms can only decrease due to mortality). Therefore, the enhanced shedding of eggs reflects a plastic adjustment of worm fecundity to the environment provided by a coinfected host. This plastic response was modulated by the host Th2 immunity, as coinfection inhibited IL-4 and IL-13 gene expression, plasma levels of IL-5 and IL-13, and the expansion of GATA-3+ CD4+ T cells in the spleen. In agreement with this, experimentally inhibiting IL-13 with neutralizing antibodies reproduced the results observed in coinfected mice (an increase in egg excretion), while the administration of recombinant IL-13 reduced egg shedding. Interestingly, coinfection had a net positive effect on parasite fitness as shown by a longer persistence within the host and higher cumulative number of eggs excreted up to 99 days post-infection. Although the gene expression of Th2 cytokines was lower at day 99 p.i., coinfected mice still had a downregulated expression compared to single infected hosts. These results show that coinfection with Plasmodium has the potential to affect the epidemiology of STHs by increasing the number of eggs excreted over the whole infectious period and maintaining a larger environmental reservoir of transmissible stages.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we show that a global knock-in CRISPR mouse with the Kir2.1L222I single-point mutation exhibits remarkable resistance to HFD-induced obesity. We identify palmitic acid (PA), a prevalent long-chain fatty acid in obesity, as a novel negative regulator of Kir2.1. Kir2.1L222I previously shown to protect against cholesterol-mediated inhibition of Kir2.1, also confers protection against PA-induced suppression. Moreover, PA-induced suppression of Kir2.1 results in a significant loss of flow-induced vasodilation (FIV), while the L222I mutation exerts a protective effect. Notably, Kir2.1L222I mice display significant protection against HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity independent of caloric intake. Specifically, the mutant mice show increased lean mass and decreased fat mass, specifically in both visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) and intrascapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Importantly, visceral-to-subcutaneous white adipose ratios decrease while BAT/WAT tissue ratios increase, suggesting a metabolically favorable fat distribution. This protection correlates with enhanced physical activity and increased energy expenditure.

Compared to graph-based methods like the Leiden algorithm, GMMs provided comparable classification performance while offering a more nuanced and biologically interpretable view of microglial heterogeneity. We demonstrate that deep learning features from the targeted IF panel are most powerful, achieving high classification accuracy and strong correlation with biological states such as functional NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our model system provides a robust and scalable platform for quantifying microglial heterogeneity, offering a new tool to identify novel disease-associated states and compounds that precisely modulate microglial phenotypes for therapeutic discovery.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, despite detailed investigation of long-range projections to the mPFC in the adult brain, little is known about their maturation. Here, we use retrograde labeling, light-sheet imaging, and automatic cell segmentation to quantify afferent projections to the mPFC from neonatal to adult age. We show that densities of ipsi- and contralateral prefrontal afferents change along development from a widespread bilateral distribution at neonatal age to a precisely tuned, predominantly ipsilateral organization. Furthermore, myelination of interhemispheric prefrontal afferents starts only after the decline of neonatal contralateral projections. We identify specific patterns, e.g. elevated projection density from limbic brain regions during early adolescence, or decreasing projection densities from the mediodorsal thalamus decreasing towards adulthood.

Profound insight exists into how neural computations arise from the precise regulation of ion channels (Armstrong et al., 1998; Lai, Jan, 2006; Nusser et al., 2012), how degenerate channel properties support similar computations (Marder, Prinz, 2002; Marder, Goaillard, 2006), and how channelopathies affect brain function (Kullmann, 2010). However, it remains elusive why neurons express many more channels, and isoforms thereof, than required to tune their specific excitabilities. Here, we employ an experiment-theory approach pairing electrophysiology with Drosophila genetics, and mathematical modelling to show that the variance in membrane properties that results from ion channel diversity promotes the robustness of neuron-type specific functions. Specifically, we show that the robustness of flight motoneuron coding properties to internal and external perturbations is significantly enhanced by the diversity of calcium channel splice isoforms expressed. Importantly, increased excitability robustness to perturbations of outward currents or temperature does not require adjustments in calcium channel mean properties. Instead, increases of the variance of calcium channel gating properties that result from channel isoform diversity broaden the dynamic input range the neuron can compute without reaching depolarization block.

We demonstrate that A{beta} also binds to microtubules with affinity comparable that of tau itself.

Here, we identify a novel spatial map in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that encodes navigational targets with distinct neural representations while preserving their topological order and relative distances by scaling to physical path lengths. Remarkably, OFC maps remained stable when animals performed the same navigation task across rooms and maze geometries, in stark contrast to the pronounced remapping observed in HPC and MEC.

However, how a neuron utilises multiple, simultaneously expressed channel proteins - connexins or innexins -to make meaningful connections with distinct synaptic partners remains largely unknown. Using the posterior mechanosensory circuit in C. elegans, we discovered that individual electrical synapses can be formed by clustering together molecularly distinct gap junction channel-types made of three different innexin proteins, INX-1, UNC-7, and UNC-9. In this previously unknown configuration, which we term as heterochannel synapses, molecularly distinct gap junction channel types functionally collaborate to regulate posterior touch sensory behaviour, enhancing functional robustness. We show that the synaptic trafficking of the different channel types within a heterochannel synapse is independently regulated by discrete and conserved kinesin motor proteins, while distinct molecular pathways involving channel-specific retrograde kinesins regulate their turnover. These independent, channel-specific regulations enable individual synapse-level alterations in the composition of heterochannel synapses under altered environmental conditions, providing a novel mechanism for electrical synapse plasticity. Finally, we present evidence of heterochannel electrical synapses in C. elegans locomotory circuits and in cerebellar Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae, suggesting that heterochannel organization may be a conserved feature of metazoan electrical synapses.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Herein, how AT-hook protein AKNA regulates pluripotency and stemness in neuroblastoma cells is demonstrated by gene knockdown, immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), localization of AKNA, signaling interactions and transcriptional activity. AKNA was abundant and mostly nuclear during induction of pluripotency and its knockdown reduced stemness, even in presence of other pluripotency factors, including OCT4 and SOX2. During the course of induction of differentiation, AKNA remain localized in the cytosol, essential for regulated differentiation. Cytosolic retention of AKNA is possibly driven by FAK signaling. In the nucleus, AKNA promotes KDM6B demethylase for H3K27me3 demethylation to H3K27, and subsequently promotes CBP/p300 to acetylate H3K27 to H3K27ac deposition on promoter region of respective genes to trigger their transcription. Data obtained from knockdown and overexpression of AKNA and KDM6B further reinforce its importance that, they physically interact to drive pluripotency and stemness.

Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion.

However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes.

However, there is a major challenge with the analysis of such data. Since biological changes are inherently small on short time scales, much of the true biological dynamics is hidden under unavoidable measurement noise, but we do not know what functional form the time dynamics may take, and smoothing over neighboring time points simply replaces the true dynamics with a time average.

We show that this assumption can be formalized in a Bayesian model using maximum entropy process priors and that this model can be accurately solved by recursively approximating the non-linear dynamics over short time intervals. Given raw input cell size and fluorescence measurements, RealTrace calculates the estimated true sizes, total GFP contents, instantaneous growth rates, and volumic GFP production rates across all cells and time, together with rigorous error bars on all these quantities. We demonstrate the broad applicability of RealTrace by analyzing time- lapse microscopy datasets from E. coli bacteria, mouse embryonic stem cells, and entire C. elegans embryos. To exemplify the subtle dynamical features RealTrace can uncover, we perform an in-depth study of E. coli cells carrying fluorescent reporters for constitutive and ribosomal promoters, across multiple growth conditions. We find growth rates of single cells substantially fluctuate in time and, as the average growth rated decreases, these fluctuations systematically increase in amplitude and duration. Both growth rate and gene expression vary systematically across the cell cycle, but while the pattern of growth rate variation is condition-independent, the systematic variation in gene expression across the cell cycle is both condition and promoter-dependent. Finally, under a sudden change in nutrients, single cells exhibit highly consistent transient changes in growth rate and gene expression. While gene expression rates settle into a new steady-state surprisingly rapidly, the growth rate shows a dramatic drop followed by an overshoot that takes several cell cycles to settle down. All these observations give fundamental new insights into the single-cell physiology of bacteria. RealTrace is a highly versatile method that accurately removes measurement noise from any fluorescence time-lapse microscopy data, enabling the identification and quantification of subtle features in the biological dynamics that would otherwise be hidden under measurement noise.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Due to its unique position in the phylogenetic tree and distinctive spectral properties, it serves as an important model for elucidating rhodopsin evolution and for engineering optogenetic tools with enhanced performance, but its structure and function remain poorly understood. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.2 and 2.5 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel. Together, these findings illuminate diverse mechanisms of color tuning and functional specification within the rhodopsin family, paving the way for the rational engineering of next-generation optogenetic tools.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Poly-substance use is rarely assessed in rodent models of drug seeking and this study determined if training drug alters the apparent reinforcing properties of methamphetamine (MA) and -pyrrolidinopentiophenone (-PVP). Methods: Female and male Wistar rats (N=8 per group) were trained in the intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of -PVP or MA. The impact of dose substitution (0.0125, 0.0250, 0.100, 0.300 mg/kg/infusion) for each training drug was then assessed in all groups under FR and Progressive Ratio schedules of reinforcement. Results: Male and female rats obtained similar numbers of infusions of MA (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) and of -PVP (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) during acquisition, however more infusions of -PVP than of MA were obtained by each sex. Mean lever discrimination ratios exceeded 80% on the drug-associated lever within 5 training sessions for -PVP groups but were not consistently at this level for either MA group. Drug potency was similar across groups but was less effective in the MA-trained males. Conclusions: Interpretations of sex differences in the acquisition of drug IVSA require caution when dose is not varied across or within group. This study also further confirms that the apparent efficacy of a drug as a reinforcer depends at least partially on the behavioral antecedents, including the identity of the drug used for initial IVSA acquisition.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Background: NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, are widely used to model schizophrenia-related phenotypes in preclinical studies. While zebrafish have emerged as a promising model organism for neuropsychiatric research, few studies have characterized their behavioral responses to repeated ketamine exposure. Methods: Three independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the acute, repeated and sustained behavioral effects of ketamine in adult zebrafish. In Experiment I, fish were exposed to 10, 20, or 40mg/L ketamine once daily for five days, and submitted to the social preference (SPT) and open tank (OTT) tests on days 1 and 5, and re-exposed and re-tested on day 7 after a 48-hour washout. Experiments II and III assessed whether behavioral changes persisted following 5- or 14-day exposure protocols, with testing conducted 48 hours after the final treatment. Results: Ketamine induced robust, concentration-dependent alterations in Experiment I: it reduced social interaction and increased locomotor activity in the SPT on all experimental days, while increased rotational behavior in the OTT on days 1 and 5. These effects did not intensify over repeated exposure and were not sustained after a 48-hour washout in either protocol (Experiments II and III). Conclusions: The results support the utility of zebrafish for modeling acute behavioral responses to NMDA receptor antagonism, capturing features of schizophrenia-like phenotypes. However, no evidence of behavioral sensitization or lasting disruption was observed, diverging from rodent studies. Future studies should incorporate antipsychotic validation, neurochemical analyses, and alternative exposure strategies to further develop zebrafish as a translational model for psychiatric research.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Genome language models have emerged as a promising strategy for designing biological systems, but their ability to generate functional sequences at the scale of whole genomes has remained untested. Here, we report the first generative design of viable bacteriophage genomes. We leveraged frontier genome language models, Evo 1 and Evo 2, to generate whole-genome sequences with realistic genetic architectures and desirable host tropism, using the lytic phage {Phi}X174 as our design template. Experimental testing of AI-generated genomes yielded 16 viable phages with substantial evolutionary novelty.

Multiple phages demonstrate higher fitness than {Phi}X174 in growth competitions and in their lysis kinetics. A cocktail of the generated phages rapidly overcomes {Phi}X174-resistance in three E. coli strains, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for designing phage therapies against rapidly evolving bacterial pathogens.

By leveraging two clinically-relevant murine ischemic stroke models, single-cell transcriptomics, and BBB functional assays, we find that deletion of endothelial IFN1 receptor (Ifnar1) exacerbates post-stroke BBB disruption and expands a BEC population expressing angiogenic and immature BBB markers. Conversely, IFN-beta administration immediately after stroke reduces acute BBB disruption. Activation of IFN1 signaling in mouse BECs in vitro promotes junctional stabilization and reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling to enhance barrier properties, but suppress angiogenic features.

Twenty-eight participants completed the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), a measure of divergent thinking, and the Fusion Innovation Test (FIT), which integrates divergent and convergent thinking. Responses were scored for novelty, feasibility, and goal attainment using validated GPT-based automated evaluation. EEG signals recorded prior to problem onset were used to decode single-trial creativity scores. A decoding model based on coherence features achieved robust performance (r = 0.45, leave-one-trial-out) and generalized across individuals (r = 0.34, leave-one-subject-out). Feature weights revealed a creativity potential network (CPN), characterized by frontal-temporal interactions in beta frequency band. Applying the model to resting-state recordings revealed ~3-minute cycles of creativity potential, suggesting intrinsic brain dynamics shape readiness for creative problem-solving.

N.; Polonenko, M. J.", "abstract": "Purpose The auditory brainstem response (ABR) and middle latency response (MLR) are used to characterize hearing but typically require separate recordings due to differing optimal parameters and setups in clinical systems. Advances such as the parallel ABR (pABR) paradigm now allow simultaneous recording of both responses, enabling more comprehensive assessments. We evaluated this simultaneous recording approach by characterizing responses at near- and suprathreshold levels using parameters optimized for pABR. Methods This study used an open dataset [1] of pABR recordings from 20 normal hearing adults to tone-pip stimuli at five frequencies, six presentation rates, and two intensities. ABR (I, III, and V) and MLR (P0, Na, Pa, Nb, Pb) waves were analyzed for presence, latency, and amplitude using linear mixed effect modeling. Results At both levels, ABR wave V and MLR waves Na and Pa were the most consistently identifiable and largest peaks across frequencies, rates, and participants. Frequency and rate changes affected ABR wave V amplitude more than the MLR peaks, whose amplitudes and latencies remained comparatively stable across the moderate and soft levels used in this study. Conclusion ABR wave V and MLR waves Na and Pa are robust and consistently identifiable with pABR-optimized parameters. A simultaneous recording approach that leverages visualization of all three components could both assess auditory function across more areas of the auditory system using a moderate suprathreshold level, and support detection/interpretation of smaller wave Vs for threshold estimation, particularly for broader low frequency responses.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We aimed to develop and validate CNS-tau-specific monoclonal antibodies and assess their utility in neuropathology and fluid-based biomarker assays across AD and primary tauopathies. Methods: We generated six recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibodies targeting a CNS-tau-specific sequence encoded by exons 4 and 5. Specificity and affinity were evaluated via biolayer interferometry, immunoblotting, and tau-expressing HEK293 models. The lead clone, LL-T-1-1, was tested in postmortem brain sections from AD (n = 23), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 3), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD, n = 3). A second clone, LL-T-1-5, was optimized for use in plasma assays via an ultrasensitive nanoneedle platform, LoD < 1 pg/ml.

We present a new way to decode real-world scenes participants are viewing from the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) evoked while wearing flickering LCD glasses. We discovered that SSVEP responses from real world scenes are surprisingly complex and have distinct waveform shapes: they differ markedly across scenes and participants but are consistent within individuals, even across multiple days. SSVEP shape varies greatly between stimuli, but is reliable, meaning that decoding works even with a single electrode. Decoding is highly accurate with 5-10 seconds of data and was still above chance level with less than a second of data. Decomposing the SSVEPs into frequency bands showed that the information about the visual scene is present across all of the harmonics of the flicker frequency, but with 40 Hz (gamma band) showing the highest amount of information across the different flicker frequencies tested. These findings implicate a broad range of oscillations in encoding real-world scenes, with a particular importance for 40 Hz.

Here, we investigated focal INS in the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized mice using high-density Neuropixels recordings combined with histological analysis. Continuous-wave and pulsed (500 Hz) infrared illumination elicited robust modulation of cortical activity, with approximately half of recorded neurons exhibiting either increased or suppressed firing. The modulatory effects of stimulation were comparable across cortical layers and neuron types. While both stimulation modes were effective, continuous-wave stimulation typically produced stronger changes in firing rates and network dynamics than pulsed illumination. To explore molecular contributions, we compared responses in wild-type and TRPV1 knockout mice. Neuronal responses to INS were significantly reduced in knockout animals, indicating a key role for TRPV1 channels. We also observed layer- and neuron-type-specific differences in firing rate modulation between wild-type and knockout animals. Histological analysis confirmed that TRPV1-expressing neurons are distributed throughout cortical layers, supporting their involvement in the observed responses.

Using a combination of fresh whole blood from ten anonymous donors and a large set of publicly available microarray data, we show, for the first time, that C4 protein is found and expressed primarily in neutrophils and monocytes. Then, we compared the correlation between C4 protein in neutrophils, classical monocytes, plasma and the number of C4A gene copies. We determined the number of C4A genes using digital droplet PCR, C4 protein in neutrophils (15 patients/21 controls) and plasma (30 patients/38 controls) using western blotting, and classical monocytes (30 patients/38 controls) using flow cytometry. We found a moderate positive correlation between the number of C4A gene copies and the amount of C4 protein only in neutrophils and only in the schizophrenia group (Spearmans rho = 0.64, p = 0.01, Cohens d = 1.67).

In this study, we observed that brief exposure (24 h) to human body temperature (37 {degrees}C), in contrast to 30 {degrees}C, significantly enhances the tolerance of Candida albicans to azoles without inducing resistance. Our findings suggest that this increased tolerance is due to a reduction in the degradation of C. albicans Erg11 at 37 {degrees}C compared to 30 {degrees}C, thereby promoting azole tolerance. This phenomenon occurs because Erg11 degradation is mediated by autophagy, which is inhibited in C. albicans at 37 {degrees}C. The suppression of autophagy at this temperature may be associated with elevated mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In response to heat stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy-related proteins such as Atg8 accumulate around the mitochondria, while their levels in the endoplasmic reticulum decrease, consequently inhibiting autophagy in C. albicans. These findings suggest that promoting the degradation of Erg11 in C. albicans may serve as a viable strategy to augment the fungicidal efficacy of azoles in the human host.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While ECM dependent mechanisms mediating transient activation is well studied, how fibroblasts switch from transient to a persistently activated state and drive fibrosis and aberrant tissue repair in diseases such as cancer is less understood. Here, we show that human cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) switch from transient to persistently activated states upon prolonged exposure to stiff ECMs and stiffness-dependent secreted factors. This switch is accompanied by activation of ECM stiffness dependent mechanotransduction pathways and changes in the nuclear architecture and its association with chromatin. Mechanistically, we identify two pathways required for this switch, ECM ligand binding and complete activation of {beta}1 integrins smoothens the nuclear lamina during prolonged exposure, increases nuclear YAP, and reduces lamin chromatin contacts while in parallel, exposure to the stiff ECM activates the formin mDia2 and independent of alterations in the nuclear architecture alters lamin chromatin coupling, likely through its role in assembling nuclear actin. Importantly, we find that blocking either pathway prevents persistent myofibroblast activation, which is rescued by inhibition of histone deacetylases, indicating that dynamic chromatin modifications act downstream of these ECM-dependent pathways to maintain the persistently activated state. These findings link integrin-based ECM sensing to chromatin remodeling and fibroblast memory, with implications for stromal plasticity in the tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Additionally, we employed the FASTM technique to simultaneously record at millisecond time resolution changes in both Vm and intracellular Ca2+. We show that progesterone evokes a rapid pulse-like depolarization and repolarization. The depolarization is caused by Ca2+ influx through CatSper, which pulls Vm away from a resting membrane potential (Vrest) of -65 mV set by the sperm-specific K+ channel Slo3. We further show that Vm- and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms limit the CatSper-mediated Ca2+ influx, thereby promoting repolarization and enabling K+ efflux through Slo3 channels to restore Vrest. Our findings demonstrate that non-genomic progesterone signaling in human sperm is regulated by negative feedback on CatSper and involves a dynamic interplay between CatSper and Slo3 in controlling Vm.

Single-cell RNA sequencing showed Sertoli cell differentiation largely persists without MAP7, whereas germ cells in Map7-deficient testes exhibit delayed meiotic progression, marked by expansion of pachytene subtypes. These findings establish MAP7 as a cytoskeletal integrator linking epithelial polarity to germline progression, providing insight into how tissue organization sustains fertility.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we analyzed 94 tissue samples from 79 patients with OTs and 15 healthy controls to explore their genetic and epigenetic alterations. Whole Exome Sequencing identified the BRAF V600E mutation in 75% of patients. A mutational hotspot analysis of six key genes (NRAS, EGFR, BRAF V600E, SMO L412, SMO W535, KRAS Q22K, PTCH1 R602*, and PTCH1 W129) revealed a high mutational rate, particularly in BRAF (91%), with 90% of BRAF V600E-positive patients being ameloblastomas. DNA methylation in the promoters of nine tumor-related genes (RB1, RASSF1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MLH1, MGMT, TIMP3, BRAF) was assessed in 67 OT patients and 15 controls. Five CpG sites showed significant hypermethylation (p<0.05; FDR q<0.05), notably in RASSF1A (cg50378469, cg50378539) and TIMP3 (cg33197381, cg33197394, cg33197400). Somatic hypermethylation of the full promoter was detected in RASSF1A (8 patients, mean methylation: 17.5%), BRCA1 (3 patients, mean methylation: 11.7%), and MLH1 (1 patient, mean methylation: 2%). Interestingly, 76.5% of BRAF V600E-positive patients had RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation. A strong correlation between BRAF V600E mutation and RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected. Our results might imply a synergistic effect of the BRAF V600E mutation and RASSF1A hypermethylation as determinants in the RAS pathway.

Although the central pattern generator function of the intermediate reticular formation has been recently clarified, the roles of the other whisker pre-motor nuclei remain unclear. Here, we set out to compare the whisker movement kinematics of the main pre-motor whisker nuclei connecting the cerebellum and the facial nucleus. We optogenetically stimulated neurons located in the cerebellar cortex Purkinje cells (PCs), the cerebellar nuclei (CN), the red nucleus (RN), the superior colliculus (SC), the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SV), and the reticular formation (RF); in head-fixed awake mice while monitoring the bilateral whisker movement. Here, we find that optogenetic stimulation of the RN, SC, and SV resulted in a predominant midpoint change, whereas optogenetic stimulation of the PCs, CN, and RF resulted in faster whisker movements. In addition, the excitation of PCs, the RN, and SC resulted in symmetric bilateral whisking. In contrast, the excitation of CN, the RF, and SV resulted in initial asymmetric movement, followed by a more dominantly symmetrical bilateral whisking.

Although chronic opioid exposure induces widespread neuroadaptations, the role of brain-derived EVs (BDEVs) in these processes remains poorly understood. We isolated BDEVs from the prefrontal cortex of rats subjected to chronic morphine exposure and performed integrative analyses of their RNA and protein cargo. Total RNA sequencing with ribosomal RNA depletion was combined with unbiased proteomics to define morphine-induced alterations. Functional validation was conducted by exposing primary cortical neurons to BDEVs from morphine- or vehicle-treated donors, followed by transcriptomic profiling. Morphine significantly reprogrammed the transcriptome and proteome of BDEVs, with enrichment of pathways related to synaptic plasticity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Among the most robust changes, the synaptic regulator ARC and the ER stress marker Hspa5 were consistently modulated at both mRNA and protein levels. In functional assays, morphine-derived BDEVs altered neuronal expression of genes associated with synaptic remodeling and excitability, including Ncam1 and Kcnn1. These findings provide the first evidence that chronic opioid exposure reprograms BDEV cargo in a brain region critical for addiction, and that these vesicles are sufficient to induce transcriptional changes in recipient neurons. BDEVs emerge as active mediators of morphine-induced neuroadaptations and hold promise as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in opioid-related neuropathologies.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed \"WAChR\". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins.

This has created a diagnostic bottleneck for genetic counselors tasked with sifting through these variants and determining those most likely to be causative for a patient's clinical presentation. Machine learning (ML) tools can aid in identifying pathogenic variants from VUS, but there is a need for gene-specific algorithms that predict pathogenic variants with high accuracy. To address this need, we present a workflow for developing gene-specific, ensemble-learning ML tools, that leverage outputs from other algorithms, locations of variants within the gene, and evolutionary conservation data to make a prediction of pathogenicity. Variants in SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 that are associated with rare neurodevelopmental diseases were used to screen 15 ML algorithms. A random forest learner was tuned to yield a final accuracy of 0.93 on holdout data. Generalizing this predictor to other BAF complex proteins resulted in a sharp decline in performance. We trained a final predictor for all genes in the study to create a predictor that identifies pathogenic variants in these BAF subunits with an accuracy of 0.91 on holdout data. This predictor specific to BAF complex proteins performs with higher accuracy and AUROC than any other predictor. The decline in performance when generalized to other proteins emphasizes the need for the gene-specific calibration of predictors. Our workflow for the development of such models provides a quick, computationally inexpensive route for improving the ML tools available to genetic counselors.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer (gp120/gp41)3 forms the key functional envelope spike and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. The glycoprotein gp41 component mediates the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In addition to its ectodomain, the membrane-interacting C terminal domain of gp41 plays a crucial role in maintaining the fusogenicity and antigenic characteristics of Env. The membrane-interacting domain of gp41 consists of the highly conserved membrane proximal external region (MPER), which contains epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies, the transmembrane domain (TMD), which anchors Env in the membrane and mediates trimer formation, and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain, which plays an important role in Env trafficking to HIV-1 assembly sites. Previous experimental studies have extensively characterized the structure of the C-terminal domain of gp41; however, they reported different conformational states of the MPER and TMD. In this study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and function of the membrane-interacting domain of gp41 in an HIV-1 mimetic membrane bilayer. The basic residues in the CT domain were found to interact favorably with PIP2, leading to lateral demixing of lipids and the accumulation of PIP2 in the cytofacial leaflet around the CT baseplate. Additionally, analysis based on an artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning based protocol revealed a diverse conformational ensemble of MPER-TMD, consistent with previous experimental observations. The MPER-TMD adopts both helix-turn-helix and extended helical conformations. We propose that the inherent flexibility of the MPER and the N-terminal region of TMD can play an important role in facilitating the late stages of membrane fusion.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Ormiston, M. L.", "abstract": "Background: Chronic respiratory diseases represent a large group of non-communicable diseases that are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Many of the methods utilized to assess airway simplification in experimental models of the conditions are overly time-consuming and are sensitive to inter-operator biases, necessitating the need for unbiased and efficient tools to supplement analyses. Methods: We propose a semi-automated method to quantitate the characteristics of large terminal respiratory airways and alveoli that uses free image-processing software (Fiji). We aimed to develop and test this method in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of blunted airway and pulmonary vascular development that remains a leading cause of mortality among preterm infants. Optimal macro parameters were determined with a test set of images from postnatal day 14 (P14) mice exposed to acute postnatal hyperoxia by determining which area and circularity values best correlated with mean linear intercept (LM). Validation was performed on a separate set of images from P7 mice subjected to the same hyperoxic model of BPD. Results: Both alveolar duct (r: 0.7866, p = 0.0359) and alveolar (r: 0.9475, p = 0.0012) area correlated with LM measurements from the test set. Using our method on a validation dataset, we demonstrate that hyperoxia-exposed mice possess fewer, enlarged alveoli that occupy less total area, as well as enlarged alveolar ducts that occupy a greater proportion of the parenchyma. Conclusions: We report a semi-automated method of quantitating the characteristics of large and small terminal respiratory airways. This tool expedites analysis and removes operator bias relative to existing methods. We also demonstrate that LM changes in the acute hyperoxia-induced BPD model result from both alveolar simplification and inadequate primary septation at the level of the alveolar ducts.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Given that contraction type and intensity influence systemic cardiorespiratory variables that affect cerebral blood flow regulation, this study examined the acute systemic hemodynamic and cerebrovascular responses to static and rhythmic HGE protocols at varying intensities. Thirty-three healthy young adults (17 males; 16 females age 22(1) years) performed four separate 5-minute HGE protocols in a randomized order: static HGE at 15% (S15) of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), static HGE at 30% MVC, rhythmic HGE at 30% MVC, rhythmic HGE at 60% (R60) MVC. We hypothesized that rhythmic HGE at higher intensities would produce the greatest cerebrovascular responses due to enhanced venous return and cardiac output, while static HGE at higher intensities would elicit the greatest systemic (i.e., blood pressure, HR, ventilation) responses. Cerebral (middle cerebral artery blood velocity [MCAv] and cerebrovascular conductance index [MCACVCi], internal carotid artery [ICA] diameter, velocity, blood flow, and shear rate) and systemic hemodynamics (systolic [SBP], diastolic [DBP], mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate [HR], cardiac output [CO]), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) levels were averaged over the final 30s of each minute of exercise. There was a significant time and protocol interaction effect on HR (p<0.001). We found significant main effects of exercise protocol for MCAv (p<0.001), MCACVCi(p<0.001), ICA diameter (p=0.01) and blood flow (p=0.001), and PETCO2 (p=0.002). Greatest increases in MCAv alongside the largest reduction in ICA blood flow occurred in R60. The greatest increase in MCACVCi and ICA blood flow (from baseline) occurred in R30 compared to other protocols. In addition to the greater cerebrovascular responses, we also observed more modest systemic responses (lower HR, MAP, CO) and lower self-reported ratings of perceived exertion (p<0.001) in R30 compared to other protocols. Acute increases in MCACVCi and ICA blood flow observed in R30 (despite the lower perceived effort) may suggest that rhythmic HGE at low-moderate intensities can be a tolerable prescription for inducing exercise-related cerebrovascular adaptations (i.e., improved cerebral perfusion) in populations that may require adapted physical activity.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Our simulations of plant cellular metabolism under the changing atmospheric conditions of ancient time observe C3-to-CAM transition, capture possible temporal alterations of active metabolic pathways and further confirm that both the reduced [CO2]a and increased water scarcity associated with higher aridity, can act as evolutionary agents, driving the C3-to-CAM transition.

Leveraging the publication of multiple angiosperm genomes, we systematically analysed known Cys-NDP components in 55 angiosperms spanning aquatic, epiphytic, xerophytic, and mesophytic lineages. We also complemented this survey with hypoxia profiling and transcriptomic analyses in a selected panel of plants. This comparative effort revealed variation in Cys-NDP components, with Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs) and group VII Ethylene Response Factors (ERFVIIs) emerging as major sources of diversification. Aquatic monocots displayed complete loss of A-type PCOs and dramatic expansion of a novel clade of ERFVIIs (HREaqua), frequently accompanied by loss or modification of the Cys-degron, uncoupling them from oxygen-dependent turnover. By contrast, xerophytes and epiphytes retained core Cys-NDP elements but showed shared hypoxia-induced gene expression, suggesting endogenous developmental or metabolic pressures for pathway conservation in habitats with limited flooding risk. Across all species, we identified a conserved transcriptional core of 11 orthogroups, including fermentation enzymes and regulatory factors, highlighting the early recruitment of these genes to hypoxia responses. Functional assays confirmed contributions of conserved MYB and LBD transcription factors to hypoxia tolerance in Arabidopsis. Together, our results demonstrate that both habitat and anatomy influence the evolution and deployment of oxygen-sensing networks in angiosperms.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), including Rhizophagus irregularis, establish symbioses with barley roots and have been implicated in the modulation of host immunity via mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR). In this study, we investigated whether R. irregularis AMF colonisation primes barley immune responses to P. hordei. Although AMF did not alter disease severity or growth in infected plants, co-infected tissues exhibited enhanced expression of defence-associated genes, including PR1, PR2, PR3 and WRKY28. AMF alone did not induce these genes, consistent with a priming mechanism. Transcriptome profiling revealed AMF-induced reprogramming of the leaf transcriptome, with enrichment of genes related to defence, protein modification, and metabolism. AMF also modulated host protein ubiquitination during infection.

Here, we present a chromosome-scale reference genome of Kronos with high-confidence annotations, including manual curation of over 1,000 complex disease resistance (NLR) loci. This reference revealed previously hidden NLR diversity and clarified their genomic organization at chromosomal ends. Re-analysis of exome- and promoter-capture datasets enabled high-resolution mutation discovery in genes and regulatory regions that were previously inaccessible, uncovering the full standing variation present in Kronos mutant lines. We also re-curated transcriptomic and small RNA datasets, generating improved, genome-wide maps of microRNAs and phasiRNAs important for wheat development. Collectively, these resources elevate Kronos to reference quality and establish it as a versatile platform for functional and translational wheat research.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This causes cellular water loss, decreases turgor pressure, and reduces cell volume. Osmotic stress affects plasma membrane tension, a property which must be maintained to enable cell signalling and growth. How plants maintain plasma membrane tension as the cell volume shrinks during hyperosmotic stress remains unclear. Here, we identified an autophagy pathway which degrades plasma membrane derived clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during osmotic stress. Time-lapse imaging following osmotic shock shows a reduction in cell volume that correlates with an acute induction of autophagy. Using correlative-light and electron microscopy (CLEM) combined with electron tomography (ET), we visualised CCVs physically attached to autophagosome membranes. High resolution fluorescent microscopy showed that these CCVs are labelled with the endocytic TSET/TPLATE complex, which co-localize with autophagosomes specifically upon osmotic stress. The TPLATE complex subunits, AtEH1/Pan1 and AtEH2/Pan1 contain conserved ATG8 interaction motifs, which we demonstrate to directly interact with ATG8. We therefore propose that AtEH/Pan1 proteins act as selective autophagy receptors for plasma membrane-derived CCVs. We postulate that this pathway removes excess membrane during hyperosmotic stress to maintain plasma membrane tension and integrity. These findings contribute to our physiological understanding of how plants adapt to drought and salt stress.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "The loss of photoperiod sensitivity was a key prerequisite for the adaptation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and scarlet runner bean (P. coccineus) to European environments. While the genetic architecture of this trait has been studied for decades, primarily through QTL mapping in RILs and NILs, its molecular basis remains incompletely resolved. Here, we combine whole-genome resequencing of over 200 P. vulgaris accessions spanning Mesoamerican, Andean, and European origins with 130 P. coccineus cultivars from Mesoamerica and Europe. Phenotyping under controlled long-day conditions revealed distinct distributions of photoperiod sensitivity across species and gene pools. Genome-wide association and haplotype analyses identified single nucleotide variants strongly linked to flowering under long days. Consistent with prior studies, signals of selection reflect independent domestication events in the Americas. Importantly, we detect species-specific selection on core photoperiod regulators, demonstrating that both species achieved similar adaptive outcomes via functionally convergent genetic routes. By explicitly accounting for major loci shaping growth habit in our analyses, we were able to unmask additional genomic regions contributing to flowering responses in European cultivars. Together, these results show that adaptation to long-day environments occurred through stepwise, species-specific genomic innovations, first during domestication in the Americas and later under European cultivation. Our findings highlight the role of pathway-level convergent evolution in shaping complex domestication traits and underscore the potential of parallel genomic strategies for crop adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

H.; Thapa, A.; Hasan, M. R.; Mostofa, M. G.", "abstract": "Soil alkalinity severely impairs legume growth. While plant-associated microbiomes can ameliorate stress, the role of Bacillus subtilis under alkaline stress remains unclear in garden pea. In this study, alkaline stress reduced Fe, Mn, and N content, photosystem efficiency, and biomass accumulation. Inoculation with B. subtilis restored micronutrient balance and improved photosynthetic parameters across genetically diverse pea cultivars. The split-root assay demonstrated that BS inoculation induces systemic signaling, which underlies alkaline tolerance in pea. Furthermore, co-culture experiments showed increased growth of both Rhizobium leguminosarum and B. subtilis, pointing to their complementary interactions that promote mutual fitness under alkaline stress. RNA-seq analysis identified 958 and 1134 differentially expressed genes upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the roots inoculated with B. subtilis under alkaline conditions. The upregulated genes were mostly involved in the sugar-mediated symbiotic association (SWEET, GLUT), pH homeostasis (cation/H+ exchanger, ATPase), and nutrient assimilation (Ammonium transporter, Zn/Fe permease). Alkalinity mitigation was further assisted by increased expression of oxidoreductases, ferritin-like protein, and other redox-related genes, reflecting improved antioxidant defense and Fe storage under high pH conditions. Amplicon sequencing revealed lower richness and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities under alkaline stress. However, B. subtilis inoculation led to enrichment of beneficial taxa, such as Pseudomonas, Pseudorhizobium, Pseudallescheria, and Chaetomium, which may act as helper microbes to support nutrient cycling and enhance pea survival under alkalinity. These findings suggest that B. subtilis functions as a microbiome inducer, working synergistically with helper microbes to promote resilience in garden peas under alkaline stress.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This plant pathogen naturally infects tree tomato (Solanum betaceum) but has not been reported on tomatoes and potatoes, the primary hosts of P. infestans. The aim of this study was to characterize the infection cycle of P. betacei using microscopy and molecular approaches. Several strains were inoculated in susceptible tree tomato plants and disease progression was monitored via six epidemiological parameters. Although different P. betacei strains displayed a highly variable disease phenotype, the most aggressive one was chosen for further plant inoculations. Samples at different time points of the infection cycle were analyzed at the cellular level via light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and at the molecular level via qRT-PCR of infection-stage-specific markers. The infection cycle of P. betacei differed from that of P. infestans in having a longer biotrophic stage, larger lesions, and higher sporulation capacity. Additionally, P. betacei transcriptomic profiles were monitored along the infection cycle via RNAseq and evidenced a changing expression landscape that supports an elongated hemibiotrophic transition and a clear distinction from what is being expressed in the mycelium or the sporangia.

Whether restoring gut microbial homeostasis mitigates TBI-exacerbated AD features remains unclear, particularly with respect to sex differences. Objective: The goal of our study was to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) modifies amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, gut microbial composition, metabolites, and motor outcomes in male and female 5xFAD mice subjected to TBI. Methods: Male and female 5xFAD mice received sham treatments or controlled cortical impact, followed 24 hours later by vehicle (VH) or sex-matched FMT from C57BL/6 donors. Assessments at baseline, 1, and 3 days post-injury included Thioflavin-S and 6E10 immunostaining for Abeta, Iba-1 and GFAP for glial activation, lesion volume, rotarod performance, 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome profiling, serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut histology. Results: TBI increased cortical and dentate gyrus Abeta burden, with females showing greater vulnerability. FMT reduced Abeta deposition in sham animals and shifted plaque morphology but did not attenuate TBI-induced amyloid escalation. FMT differentially modulated glial responses by sex and region (reduced microgliosis in males) without altering lesion volume. Rotarod performance was better in sham females compared to males and declined in FMT-treated TBI females. Fecal microbiome alpha diversity and richness were unchanged, while beta diversity revealed marked, time-dependent community shifts after TBI that were slightly altered by FMT. Gut morphology remained broadly intact, but crypt width increased after TBI, particularly in males. Conclusion: In 5xFAD mice, TBI drives sex-dependent worsening of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis. Acute FMT partially restores microbial composition and plaque features in sham animals but fails to reverse TBI-induced neuroinflammation or motor deficits. These findings underscore the context- and sex-dependence of microbiome interventions and support longer-term, sex-specific strategies for AD with comorbid TBI.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A key step in validation and adoption of CEZIAs is to allow for widespread shared development and validation of code and data. We describe a set of three R packages to achieve this goal. Our ecosystem of seizure localization methods involves a straightforward analysis pipeline, standardized data formatting and storage, and completely documented and open-source code. The TableContainer package allows for easy storage and manipulation of table data, serving as groundwork for the Epoch package, which is specifically geared towards iEEG data. The Epoch package allows for cropping, resampling, and visualization of iEEG data and provides publicly downloadable iEEG data for reproducibility. Finally, the EZFragility package uses these two foundational packages to analyze iEEGs for SOZ localization using the Neural Fragility method described by Li et al. EZFragility was built using the same core principles as the original method but included several enhancements in computational efficiency and user experience. It accurately reproduces neural fragility results for both sample patients used in the original paper. This project serves as the first step towards building an open-source, reproducible ecosystem of seizure localization methods in R.

Within this heterotetramer there is a weak interaction between SLP-76 and PLC-{gamma}1, and the relevant binding sites of SLP-76 and PLC-{gamma}1 are highly conserved in vertebrates. To address the biological relevance of this weak interaction, we introduced a mutation in the SLP-76 that enhanced its affinity for PLC-{gamma}1 and found that this mutation increased PLC-{gamma}1 activity and altered thymocyte development and peripheral T cell responses due to enhanced TCR signal strength.

While brain sexual differentiation has traditionally been attributed to the sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and steroid sex hormones, the downstream effector mechanisms controlled by these factors remain elusive. To elucidate the role of Dmrts in the mammalian brain sexual differentiation, we generated a comprehensive expression atlas for all family members (Dmrt1-7) in the mouse brain. We used in situ hybridization to examine both sexes across various developmental stages. Our findings revealed that all Dmrts, except Dmrt7, are expressed in the brain. This study expands our understanding of the DMA-Dmrt subfamily beyond pallial structures and identifies their expression maintenance in adult neurogenic sites. For the first time, we described the neuronal expression of Dmrt2 and Dmrt6. Mouse Dmrts did not exhibit clear sexually dimorphic patterns but showed quantitative differences in expression levels between the sexes. We demonstrated that most Dmrts are maintained in postmitotic neurons during both embryonic and postnatal stages, suggesting potential interactions with steroid hormones during organizational and activational phases. As proof of concept, our comprehensive analysis of Dmrt5 expression revealed its prominent presence in the mouse olfactory system, which is fundamental for controlling sex-specific innate behaviors. The absence of Dmrt5 affects the main olfactory epithelium, where sensory neurons are located; however, mis-patterning phenotypes observed in the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex distinctly affect male and female embryos, revealing the interaction of Dmrt5 with sex in deeper integrative layers of innate neural circuits. Our results provide a valuable resource for uncovering novel sites and mechanisms of sexual differentiation in the mammalian nervous system, potentially contributing to the sex bias observed in the prevalence and symptomatology of psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A lab-on-chip platform was used to expose the clots to ultrasound at 150, 300, and 500 kHz. Quantitative analysis revealed that ultrasound alone significantly disrupted clot structures, particularly at 150 kHz, where mean clot diameter was reduced by over 60% and large-clot count dropped by more than 80% compared to controls. The addition of fibrinolytic enzymes, however, did not produce statistically significant effects at 150 or 300 kHz which indicates that mechanical forces were the dominant contributors to clot disruption. At 500 kHz, where ultrasound alone was less effective, enzymatic treatment moderately enhanced the reduction in large-clot burden.

We trained our model using example images of live and dead cells from a single cell line exposed to four cytotoxic conditions (ethanol, andrographolide, daunorubicin, and serum starvation). Despite this narrow training dataset, the resulting model accurately identified live and dead cells after treatment by previously unseen compounds, successfully replicating dose-response curves comparable to fluorescence live/dead assays. Importantly, this model effectively generalized across diverse cell types, including both adherent and suspension cells. Additionally, microscopy-based cell viability analysis is non-destructive, enabling repeated measurements to perform kinetic studies to distinguish between fast- and slow-acting compounds.

Methods: We applied an integrative systems biology framework combining network pharmacology, machine learning, and transcriptomic validation to identify candidate targets of Xiaobi Plaster in LDD. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and immune infiltration analysis further elucidated the underlying mechanisms, which were experimentally validated in a rat puncture-induced degeneration model. Results: Three key targets--AHR, PTPN2, and SOAT1--were identified, with AHR emerging as the central regulator. Differential expression and enrichment analyses highlighted inflammatory and ECM-remodeling pathways, which overlapped with AHR-specific GSEA, underscoring its hub role in integrating immune and redox signaling with matrix turnover. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamics confirmed rutaecarpine (MOL002662) as the most stable AHR ligand.

METHODS: We conducted in vivo studies using a CKD rat model, including both wild-type (WT) and NGAL knockout (KO-NGAL) animals, for subsequent ex vivo analysis of aortic valves. In parallel, primary rat VICs were used in vitro to assess osteogenic, fibrotic, and inflammatory responses to aldosterone, as well as to identify the key signaling pathways involved. qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA were employed to characterize these pathways. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that MR signaling plays a central role in AS progression during CKD, as well as in VIC differentiation, inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification, mediated via the TLR4?MyD88 innate immunity pathway in aldosterone-induced responses. Furthermore, NGAL was shown to act downstream of MR to activate TLR4, promoting additional remodeling and calcification in aortic valves and VICs. These results were further validated in human samples from CKD patients.

To systematically evaluate these performance trade-offs, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of five FMs, stratified from small to huge scales, across a diverse suite of whole slide image (WSI) and region of interest (ROI) tasks. Our findings demonstrate that model superiority is strongly task-specific, challenging the assumption that a larger scale universally offers an advantage. For instance, while the huge-scale Virchow2 model excelled at WSI metastasis detection, the small-scale Lunit model was superior for fine-grained lung subtype classification. This trend was even more pronounced in survival analysis, where smaller models outperformed their massive-scale counterparts, a phenomenon we hypothesize is linked to potential information bottlenecks within downstream aggregation models. Notably, the base-scale Kaiko model consistently provided a compelling balance, delivering competitive accuracy, superior stability in prognostic tasks, and higher computational efficiency.

Here, we report the discovery and optimization of small molecule TREM2 agonists through an AI-assisted virtual screening strategy. Deep Docking of over five million purchasable compounds identified a structurally novel hit, T2K-014, which engaged TREM2 with modest affinity. A SAR-by-catalog campaign led to the identification of T2M-010 as a potent binder. T2M-010 demonstrated favorable in vitro PK properties, including high solubility, passive BBB permeability, moderate metabolic stability, and minimal safety liabilities. Functionally, T2M-010 activated receptor-proximal signaling, inducing SYK phosphorylation in TREM2-expressing cells, and promoted microglial phagocytosis. Together, these findings establish T2M-010 as the most potent small molecule TREM2 binder reported to date capable of driving protective microglial responses relevant to AD.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Y.; Lopez, S. G.; Barclay, E.; Hernandez-Pinzon, I.; Moscou, M. J.; Seung, D.", "abstract": "The morphology of starch granules is a major determinant of the functional and nutritional properties of starch and is highly variable among cereal species. Much of this morphological variation stems from differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of starch granule initiation in amyloplasts during grain development. Simple granules are thought to arise from a single initiation per amyloplast (e.g., in Brachypodium distachyon), whereas compound granules develop from multiple initiations per amyloplast (e.g., in rice). Using live-cell imaging in transgenic Brachypodium lines expressing a fluorescent amyloplast reporter construct, we discovered that simple-type starch granules in Brachypodium can arise from multiple initiations per amyloplast. The amyloplasts showed dynamic changes in their structure, the formation of stromules, and the movement of both the amyloplast within the cell and the starch granules within the amyloplasts. Our results suggest complex and pleiomorphic amyloplast organisation and mobility that can influence starch granule formation and morphology. This goes beyond the existing 'one granule, one amyloplast' model for simple-type granules, and advances our understanding of both amyloplast biogenesis and granule formation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

The integration of advanced phenotyping technologies, including imaging sensors and data analytics, facilitates the non-destructive and longitudinal acquisition of high-throughput data. Nevertheless, the sheer volume of such phenotyping data introduces significant challenges for researchers, particularly related to data processing. To overcome these challenges, researchers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI), a tool that can autonomously process and learn from large amounts of data. Despite this advantage, accurate image segmentation remains a key hurdle due to the complexity of plant morphology and environmental noise. In this study, we present the Botanical Spectrum Analyser (BSA), a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates a modified U-Net deep neural network for plant image segmentation. Designed for accessibility, BSA enables non-technical users to apply advanced AI segmentation to RGB and hyperspectral (VNIR and SWIR) imagery. We evaluated BSA's performance across three case studies involving wheat, barley, and Arabidopsis, demonstrating its robustness across species and imaging modalities. Our results show that BSA achieves an average accuracy of 99.7%, with F1-scores consistently exceeding 98% and strong Jaccard and recall performance across datasets. For challenging root segmentation tasks, BSA outperformed commercial algorithms, achieving a 76% F1-score compared to 24%, representing a 50% improvement.

In plants, OMVs induce an immune response. Also, OMVs have been utilised to prime plants against the pathogen. However, a thorough understanding of plant-bacterial interaction via OMVs is still less explored. Our research aims to comprehend the underlying events during the perception of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo)-OMVs by the host plant, rice (Oryza sativa subsp. indica). We have identified that Xoo-OMVs contain virulence-associated proteins, MAMPs, cell wall-degrading enzymes, nutrient-acquisition proteins, and proteins to defend the bacteria against the host immune response. We establish that Xoo-OMVs can elevate cellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration in rice. We report that this early Ca2+ signal is essential for nanodomain enrichment in the rice plasma membrane after exposure to Xoo-OMVs. We have observed that Xoo-OMVs get incorporated into the plasma membrane of rice. Our results assert that the insertion of Xoo-OMVs into the plasma membrane of rice is also a Ca2+-dependent process. Moreover, we establish that with the chelation of Ca2+, the resistant rice seedlings exhibit a weakened immune response against Xoo-OMVs. Taken together, our study reveals the early events of Xoo-OMV perception by rice via the Ca2+ signal.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Our aim for this study was to provide a molecular assay to identify and select resistant individuals and seed lots for restoration. We conducted artificial inoculation of a panel of seedlings and measured their immune responses to myrtle rust.

Breeding and selection of resistant host cultivars represent a promising complement to chemical control, but widespread adoption is limited primarily due to the labor-intensive nature of conventional in vitro phenotyping methods. Here, we present a high-throughput, semi-automated image analysis pipeline integrating the Blackbird CNC Microscopy Imaging Robot with computer vision models for mite life stage identification. We developed a publicly available dataset of over 1,500 annotated images (nearly 32,000 labeled instances) spanning five biologically relevant classes across ten host species and >25 cultivars. Three YOLOv11-based object detection models (three-, four-, and five-class configurations) were trained and evaluated using real and synthetic data. The three-class model achieved the highest overall performance on the hold out test set (precision = 0.875, recall = 0.871, mAP50 = 0.883), with detection accuracy robust to host background and moderate object densities. Application to miticidal assays demonstrated reliable fecundity estimation but reduced accuracy for mortality assessment due to misclassification of dead mites. In hop cultivar assays, the pipeline detected significant differences in fecundity, aligning with manual counts (R2 [&ge;] 0.98). Performance declined on hosts absent from training data and at densities exceeding 80 objects per image, underscoring the need for host-specific fine-tuning and density-aware assay experimental design. By enabling rapid, standardized, and reproducible quantification of mite life stages, this system offers a scalable alternative to manual scoring, particularly for resistance breeding programs targeting antibiosis traits.

Validated against optogenetically tagged datasets, this approach enables robust and generalizable subtype inference with minimal supervision. Building on this capability, we developed the BCI AI Agent (BCI-Agent), an autonomous AI framework that integrates vision-based cell-type inference, stable neuron tracking, and automated molecular atlas validation with real-time literature synthesis. BCI-Agent addresses three critical challenges for in vivo electrophysiology: (1) accurate, training-free cell-type classification; (2) automated cross-validation of predictions using molecular atlas references and peer-reviewed literature; and (3) embedding molecular identities within stable, low-dimensional neural manifolds for dynamic decoding. In rodent motor-learning tasks, BCI-Agent revealed stable, cell-type-specific neural trajectories across time that uncover previously inaccessible dimensions of neural computation. Additionally, when applied to human Neuropixels recordings - where direct ground-truth labeling is inherently unavailable - BCI-Agent inferred neuronal subtypes and validated them through integration with human single-cell atlases and literature.

We evaluated a direct alignment approach for 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) images to a simulated PET standard-space template, which would eliminate the need for an anatomical scan. The performance of this method was compared against the conventional T1-weighted image-based alignment using data from 40 participants with Alzheimer's disease and 47 healthy controls. Our results show that the direct alignment method performed as well as the conventional method in terms of image-template similarity.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of automatic LC segmentation using multi-atlas nonlinear warping applied to high-resolution T1/T2-weighted images and to compare LC intensity characteristics across NM-MRI, T1w, and T2w images. Additionally, we examined developmental changes in LC signal from childhood through adulthood. We analyzed MRI data from 134 participants (ages 8~64) with NM-MRI, T1w, and T2w scans, alongside 652 participants (ages 6~22) from the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D). LC intensity measures were compared across imaging modalities and analyzed for age-related trends. Automatic LC segmentation achieved high spatial overlap with manual tracings (up to 95% after one voxel 2D-dilation). Statistically estimated high (or low)-intensity values (mean {+/-} 2 {sigma}) from automated LC masks provided a more stable and noise-resilient alternative to local peak intensity measures. Age-related LC signal changes are most clearly observed in NM-MRI and T2w imaging, with significant developmental shifts emerging during adolescence. These findings support the conventional T2w imaging as an indirect marker of neuromelanin accumulation and highlight the possibility of age-specific analyses in LC imaging studies.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "During progressive nigrostriatal neuron loss in Parkinson disease (PD), compensatory mechanisms are thought to maintain dopamine (DA) signaling at levels sufficient to mitigate locomotor impairment prior to substantial neuron loss. Whereas increased DA turnover in striatum has been considered a keystone compensatory mechanism indicative of augmented DA signaling, recent work indicates that increased DA biosynthesis in substantia nigra (SN), not striatum, compensates for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein and neuronal loss. To extend interrogation of compensatory mechanisms that augment DA signaling during nigrostriatal neuron loss, we contemporaneously evaluated extracellular DA against tissue DA levels and quantified TH protein in the striatum and SN. Our unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion approach produces progressive neuronal loss between 7 and 28 days, enabling evaluation of multiple DA signaling components in striatum vs SN. Loss of TH was ~90% in striatum and ~70% in the SN by 7 days after lesion induction. However, whereas loss of tissue DA matched TH loss in striatum (>90%) on both days after lesion, tissue DA loss in SN occurred only at day 28 (36%), despite major TH loss by day 7. This preservation of nigral DA tissue levels during lesion progression was associated with increased extracellular DA in SN after K+-dependent depolarization in striatum, which was not evident in a sham-operation group at the same time, early after lesion induction, signifying a DA lesion-specific adaptation in SN. In contrast in the striatum, lesion abolished the robust increase in extracellular DA, as seen in the sham-operation group. Together, these results indicate compensatory mechanisms that augment nigrostriatal DA signaling are engaged in the SN, not striatum, during progressive nigrostriatal neuron loss.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In older adults with varying physical and cognitive decline, optimising exercise interventions is crucial to maximise benefits. A promising approach to achieve this goal is by adjusting task demands to individual abilities in turn preventing over- or underloading their abilities. In the field of motor learning, it is currently unclear whether such an optimised training improves not only performance on the trained task but also transfers to untrained motor and cognitive tasks. We conducted a randomised, single-blinded, 6-week dynamic balance training (DBT) with healthy older adults (n=30). Training was tailored to individual balance ability. Participants were assigned to either suboptimal (high or low difficulty) or optimal (moderate difficulty) training groups. Transfer effects were assessed via cognitive tasks (memory and executive) and motor tasks (untrained DBT variations and other balance tasks) measured pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Multivariate longitudinal statistical analysis showed higher performance gains in the optimal training group in three out of six sessions compared to the suboptimal groups, especially under testing conditions with high task demands. The optimal group also showed greater improvements in near motor transfer tasks mid- and post-intervention, while no significant differences were observed in the cognitive tasks. Within-group DBT learning positively correlated with transfer gains, highlighting the role of training response in achieving transfer.

Growing evidence indicates a two-way relationship between circadian rhythm and fibrogenesis, although the specific molecular signaling pathways involved are still not well understood. The molecular clock, which governs circadian rhythms, regulates metabolic and cellular functions, and its pharmacological manipulation has shown potential as a therapy for organ fibrosis. Although the liver's molecular clock appeared resilient to the progression of chronic liver disease in humans from steatosis to fibrosis, detectable changes in the daily amplitude of clock genes were observed in a cohort of people living with obesity. We discovered a clock-controlled signaling pathway that drives hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, a key event in fibrosis progression. Interfering with this pathway, either by disrupting the core regulator CLOCK:BMAL1 or activating the nuclear receptors REV-ERBs, significantly reduced HSC activation. We also identified transgelin as the downstream effector of clock-regulated HSC contractility, a characteristic of HSC activation. Transgelin is regulated indirectly by a BMAL1-CK1{varepsilon} signaling pathway and directly by REV-ERB. Our findings identify a previously unknown circadian-controlled mechanism that links the molecular clock to HSC activation and cell contractile function, which is relevant to human diseases. This pathway provides several entry points for drugs to target and disrupt fibrogenic signaling.

Leveraging recent advances in MSI visualization, such as MSI-VISUAL, we mapped the annotations to anatomically and molecularly defined brain regions directly from the MSI data alone, without relying on external imaging modalities. To address challenges posed by annotation ambiguities and the inherent complexity of MSI data, we developed the Computational Brain Lipid Atlas (CBLA) - a novel graph-based visual explainability method that provides virtual landscapes of molecular lipid compositions across brain regions and functional subdivisions. CBLA serves a broader role beyond annotation refinement: it utilizes dimensionality reduction and ensembles of supervised machine learning models to enable interpretable exploration of the molecular data, clarifies relationships between annotations, explains the behavior of trained machine learning models, and facilitates the generation of biological hypotheses about functional organization and molecular linkages. Using CBLA, we uncovered new patterns of lipid distribution, functional integration, anatomical connectivity, and location-specific disease-associated molecular signatures. Through novel computational decomposition of annotated regions into m/z features, we performed large-scale, high-resolution mapping of the brain lipidome, further enhanced by a novel method for resolving full-precision m/z values from binned MSI data.

To address this, we propose SpatialESD, a Spatial EnSemble Domain detection method that integrates results from different spatial domain detection methods to improve spatial domain detection. SpatialESD captures both direct co-occurrence patterns and multiscale indirect relationships between clusters, improving the robustness and accuracy of spatial domain detection. We evaluated SpatialESD on simulated datasets and multiple 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics datasets, including human brain, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer samples. The results show that SpatialESD consistently outperforms individual methods and the existing EnSDD ensemble method in terms of clustering accuracy and stability. Based on the identified domains, we further detected region-specific differentially expressed genes and performed trajectory and cell-cell interaction analyses. These results reveal spatial patterns of gene expression and cellular communication, offering insights into tissue organization and disease mechanisms. Overall, SpatialESD provides a reliable and effective solution for spatial domain detection in ST data and facilitates downstream biological discovery.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This gap is especially pronounced in the current Generative AI era, which demands a paradigm shift in how researchers interact with computational tools. There is a pressing need to bridge well-established biological infrastructures and databases with the capabilities of Generative AI to democratize access to bioinformatics insights. In this study, we present an integrated framework that connects the robust bioinformatics resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with Generative AI through a novel Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Model for Biological Knowledge Retrieval and Biomacromolecule Design, AIChatBio. This operational model positions Generative AI as an intelligent information hub. User interactions with the chatbot are enriched by real-time data retrieval from web portal of the biological databases hosted at NCBI, which are then translated into structured inquiries toward the web applications of NCBI and bioinformatics analysis tools. These inquiries are directed toward bioinformatics analysis tools to perform tasks such as sequence alignment and primer design. Additionally, the outputs generated by these tools are interpreted by the chatbot, allowing users to gain meaningful insights without requiring deep technical expertise in bioinformatics. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we developed a prototype implementation that integrates PCR primer design using Primer-BLAST [1], literature interpretation via PubMed for general topics, and the LitVar2 for SNPs associated topics [23]. This system was built using TypeScript and the ChatGPT API combining the bioinformatics web applications from NCBI, and its source code is publicly available via GitHub and the Chrome extension is available at Chrome Web Store.

While transcriptional responses have been characterized, protein-level changes remain largely unexplored. Here, we used a system reproducing the interaction of TILs with cancer cells occurring in the TME, by co-culturing patient-derived cancer cells with matched autologous TILs at sub-lethal ratios. Using this system, we profiled the early response that cancer (melanoma) cells and TILs activate following autologous T cell attack. To distinguish melanoma from TIL proteomes, we applied stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) combined with Orbitrap Astral-based data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, enabling cell type-specific profiling of protein and phosphorylation dynamics without FACS sorting. This approach also captured the global newly synthesized proteome of the mixed cultures. Our analyses resolved interferon-gamma-dependent proteome changes occurring in melanoma cells, identified the cytotoxic and regulatory T-cell molecule (CRTAM) as a selective marker of reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and revealed tumor-intrinsic kinase activation signatures. Among these, multiple DNA damage response-associated kinases were activated during immune attack, suggesting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Overall, this framework enables proteomic dissection of tumor-immune interactions and provides a resource for guiding biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies to improve immunotherapy outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized immunoregulatory pathway whereby platelet-derived P-selectin engages P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on T cells, triggering immunosuppressive signaling and promoting T-cell exhaustion. This interaction, identified using in vitro co-culture systems and validated in in vivo mouse models of TNBC, reveals a targetable form of platelet-mediated immune suppression that contributes to ICI resistance. PSGL-1, traditionally known for mediating leukocyte trafficking, functions here as an immune checkpoint receptor, further underscoring the therapeutic relevance of this axis.

The incorporation of acidic functionalities into the carbazole framework enhanced physicochemical properties and biological interactions, yielding distinct strain-specific antibacterial activities. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies demonstrated that 3-methyl-1,4-dioxo-4,9-dihydro-1H-carbazole-6-carboxylic acid (2) exhibited broad-spectrum potency, particularly against S. aureus and E. coli, while 6-methyl-9H-carbazole-3-carboxylic acid (3) showed selectivity against B. cereus and (E)-3-methyl-1-(2-tosylhydrazono)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-6-carboxylic acid (1) displayed strong activity toward S. typhimurium. Molecular docking studies revealed favourable binding affinities of all derivatives toward bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), with compound 1 showing the highest docking scores. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the broad conformational adaptability of compound 1, the target-specific stability of compound 3, and protein-dependent binding behaviour of compound 2. Complementary ADMET predictions indicated that all compounds adhered to Lipinski's rules, with compound 3 displaying the most favourable pharmacokinetic profile, including high oral bioavailability and low toxicity risk.

While the impact of DES on the mammary epithelium has been thoroughly investigated, its effect on the other cell types of the mammary gland remains understudied. Here, given that the mammary gland development is strongly associated with its microenvironment, we aimed to investigate how in utero DES exposure alters the mammary gland stromal and immune function across key developmental stages. To achieve this aim, timed-pregnant rats were gavaged daily with DES or vehicle from gestation days 16-21, and female offspring mammary glands were analyzed at pre-puberty (postnatal day 21 (PDN21)), puberty (PND46), and adulthood (PND90). We assessed morphological and extracellular matrix changes, performed transcriptomic cell-type enrichment analysis, measured cytokine expression, and quantified immune cell populations. DES-exposed mammary glands exhibited pronounced stromal remodeling, including increased collagen deposition and orientation by adulthood. Gene expression profiling indicated DES-induced stage-specific immune alterations: immune cell signatures were enriched at PND21 and PND90 but diminished at PND46. Correspondingly, DES increased macrophage populations at PND21 while reducing T-lymphocyte numbers at PND46 and PND90. DES exposure also dysregulated inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in adult glands, suggesting a persistent inflammatory environment. In conclusion, in utero exposure to an estrogenic compound can reprogram mammary development, inducing long-term changes in the extracellular matrix and immune landscape. These disruptions to stromal-immune homeostasis may impair normal mammary morphogenesis and increase susceptibility to breast pathologies later in life.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Moore, D. R.; Emberly, E.; Church, D. D.; Clarke, D. C.", "abstract": "Background: Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function with age, driven by dysregulation in the rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown (MPB). Although MPB contributes to net protein balance (NB), a primary contributor of sarcopenia is anabolic resistance, defined as the blunted MPS response to anabolic stimuli such as feeding. While candidate mechanisms of anabolic resistance have been identified, none singularly explains the reduction in MPS. Instead, multiple mechanisms likely act simultaneously and interactively to suppress MPS. Studying these interactions experimentally is challenging. Alternatively, mathematical modeling is well suited to analyzing complex biological phenomena such as anabolic resistance. Methods: We analyzed a previously developed kinetic model of leucine-mediated signaling and protein metabolism in human skeletal muscle to systematically investigate potential mechanisms contributing to anabolic resistance. A global sensitivity analysis identified key controllers of MPS, MPB, and NB. We then simulated an essential amino acid feeding intervention in older adults, classified the responses as either anabolic sensitive or resistant, and compared the resulting parameter distributions of the two groups. A targeted analysis evaluated the effects of individual and combined dysregulated putative mechanisms of anabolic resistance on muscle metabolism. Finally, we simulated therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring muscle metabolism. Results: Sensitivity analysis revealed that MPS and MPB are primarily controlled by their proximal signaling controllers, while NB is largely driven by MPS dynamics. Exploratory simulations showed that several parameters and signaling protein concentrations, particularly those controlling MPS, differed significantly between anabolic sensitive and resistant groups. Targeted simulations indicated that multiple dysregulated mechanisms were required to account for the experimentally observed reductions in MPS in older adults. Therapeutic simulations showed that while single-target interventions could largely restore MPS when isolated mechanisms were perturbed (e.g., enhancing p70S6K levels, increasing mTORC1 sensitivity), a multifactorial approach was required to recover muscle metabolism when all anabolic resistance mechanisms were present. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the multifactorial nature of anabolic resistance. We provide a framework for the experimental manipulation of independent and related factors that could underpin age-related anabolic resistance. The results motivate new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms most likely to be impaired and support the development of multi-target therapeutic strategies to help restore muscle protein metabolism in aging.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This emphasis reflects a historical view of gout as a disease of excess and diet, reinforced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that consistently detect urate transport and metabolism loci, while immune-related loci have failed to reach genome-wide significance. Growing clinical and experimental evidence, however, points to a central role for immune pathways in gout pathogenesis. We set out isolate the immune genetic component of gout. Using a conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) framework, we integrated gout GWAS data with those from eight immune-mediated disorders rheumatoid arthritis, Crohns disease, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We observed robust pleiotropic enrichment across all comparisons and mapped the resulting loci through FUMA to 85 unique credible genes broadly distributed across the genome, with no classical urate transporters present. Additionally, we identified 16 novel genes for gout, many of which are of obvious immune nature. We performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, which at a stringent q-value threshold identified adaptive and innate immune pathways, including T and B cell receptor signaling, antigen processing and presentation, NFkB signaling, and JakSTAT signaling. At a nominal p-value threshold, we uncovered additional cytokine-driven processes such as IL6 and IL7 signaling. We confirmed disease relevance with DisGeNET and established causality for 14 genes through Mendelian randomization, including IL1RN, MAP3K11, and SH2B3 genes with existing pharmacological inhibitors. We are the first to genetically isolate the genetic immune component of gout. Our findings show that these immune pathways can be specifically targeted, and immune medication should be incorporated into therapeutic strategies to complement urate-lowering approaches.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

A central debate in current research concerns whether the underlying mechanism operates proactively or reactively. Here, we propose a Temporal Dynamics of Attentional Suppression (TDAS) hypothesis, successfully reconciling these seemingly contradictory views. Across four visual search experiments, participants faced a probabilistic electric shock when a neutral distractor (Experiments 1a, 1b) or a threat-associated distractor (Experiments 2a, 2b) appeared at a threat-related high-probability location. Trial-averaged results showed faster responses and reduced fixations on distractors, but slower responses and fewer fixations on targets at these locations, consistent with learned distractor suppression. SMART analyses for eye-tracking data further revealed that learned suppression emerged from temporal state transitions: from distractor dominance via attentional limbo states to proactive suppression. Critically, spatial probability gates suppression pathways. At low-probability locations, suppression transitions to limbo states, while at high-probability locations, suppression either unfolds through the full three-state sequence or shifts directly from attentional limbo states to proactive suppression. Furthermore, threat signals accelerated these transitions compared to neutral contexts. Overall, these findings contribute to resolving the ongoing debate about the mechanisms of learned distractor suppression. They also offer a new theoretical perspective by establishing spatiotemporally distributed suppression as a core principle of attentional selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for understanding the dynamic nature of attentional control.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Consequently, fear often returns after extinction. This study examined whether targeted retrieval of safety outcomes during extinction training could strengthen extinction memory and mitigate fear relapse. Thirty-nine participants underwent a four-day procedure involving fear acquisition (60% reinforcement rate), two extinction sessions, and a fear renewal test. The control group followed a standard extinction protocol, while the experimental group received identical training only in the first and last 1 or 2 trials per CS type in each session. In the intermediate trials, they repeatedly retrieved the safety outcome following the preceding CS presentation. Conditioned responses were assessed using skin conductance responses (SCR) and subjective assessments (threat expectancy, valence, and arousal).

Interest has been fuelled not only by anatomical discoveries but also by expanding behavioural and comparative evidence. Under leading frameworks, the most informative behavioural indicators of pain-like experience include flexible, targeted responses to harm that suggest more than stereotyped, reflexive withdrawal. Here we tested for such responses in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus), a species of both evolutionary and commercial importance. Using a fully blinded, within-subjects design, we applied either noxious heat, tactile contact, or no contact to a single antenna under both lower- and higher-stress environmental conditions and recorded subsequent grooming behaviour. Crickets were significantly more likely to groom the noxiously stimulated antenna, and did so for longer durations, than under control or tactile treatments. Grooming also showed a distinct temporal profile, with elevated activity sustained across the early observation period. Environmental condition and sex had no effect, indicating that self-protective grooming was expressed consistently across contexts and sexes. These findings provide robust evidence of flexible, site-directed self-protection in Orthoptera, addressing a key gap in the evidence base for pain-like states outside vertebrates. Such evidence strengthens the case for precautionary consideration of insect welfare, while also bearing on the broader scientific question of how felt experience is distributed across the animal kingdom.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Additionally, we developed a workflow to quantify and evaluate lignin structures and interlinkages, determining factors in biomanufacturing using a unique spectroscopic-chromatographic approach enabling a comprehensive understanding of the LF. UV-Vis spectroscopy quantified a total aromatic content of 58.2 g/L, while quantitative 31P NMR clarified the hydroxyl group distribution in the LF. 1H-13C HSQC NMR provided structural identification of lignin units and interconnecting linkages, and gel permeation chromatography showed the molecular weight distribution. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified and quantified 38 lignin-derived monomers and extractives, with benzoic acid (2.7 mg/L) as the most abundant. This integrated approach provides holistic biomass compositional insights and cross-validation across methods, overcomes the limitations of a single technique, and delivers a robust workflow to evaluate the biomass suitability for bio-valorization.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Sequencing of the Plasmodium falciparum genome in 2002 jump-started functional studies, but a large fraction of all predicted proteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we introduce Plasmodium Function Predictor (PlasmoFP), deep learning models designed specifically for the genus Plasmodium. PlasmoFP models are trained on structure-function relationships of proteins of the phylogenetically relevant SAR (Stramenopiles, Alveolate, and Rhizarians) supergroup to predict Gene Ontology terms for partially annotated and \"unknown function\" proteins of 19 Plasmodium species. Our structure-focused approach addresses long-standing challenges to annotating Plasmodium proteins due to their low sequence similarity to other well-characterized proteins. PlasmoFP models estimate epistemic uncertainty, control false discovery rates in model predictions, and outperform existing methods. By integrating PlasmoFP false discovery rate-controlled predictions with existing annotations for Plasmodium proteins, we reduced the proportion of unannotated proteins from 15-59% across species to 3-28% and improved the proportion of fully annotated proteins from 7-42% to 36-68%, improving proteome-wide annotation completeness across the genus. Combined, PlasmoFP predictions help advance Plasmodium basic research which can aid progress towards global malaria elimination.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

These are short sequences around 8% of the length and with 10% of the information content of full amino acid sequences and 3Di sequences. We show that, despite this compression factor, SSEs can be used as a highly effective tertiary structure comparison tool, with accuracy that approaches that of Foldseek, while offering a 200-fold speedup. In addition SSEs offer comparable performance to Foldseek in domain boundary retrieval. Furthermore we show that the particular way in which SSEs encode structure can also be used to specifically detect proteins that differ due to conformational change. These findings demonstrate that SSEs offer a valuable complementary approach for protein structure characterisation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Ramirez-San-Juan, G. R.", "abstract": "Motile cilia are slender cellular appendages, conserved across eukaryotes ranging from unicellular protists to humans, that beat to generate fluid flow. In most organisms, cilia form dense arrays of thousands of filaments that coordinate their motion into persistent, temporally synchronized patterns known as metachronal waves. Despite their ubiquity, the dynamics of these patterns and their role in tuning propulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies. More broadly, they provide mechanistic insights into how metachronal coordination shapes fluid flows generated by dense ciliary arrays found in unicellular protists and airway epithelia alike, ultimately influencing swimming and transport in biological systems.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Among them, Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF) displays the most severe symptoms, such as intellectual disability and epilepsy. The exact consequences of the mutation on actin's properties, however, are not fully understood. Here we explored the cellular effects of the R196H mutation in patient-derived fibroblasts. We show that the heterozygous mutation causes an actin polymerization defect in cells, leading to a fifty percent decrease in filamentous (F-) actin content. This effect can be rescued by the addition of the actin-polymerizing and stabilizing drug, jasplakinolide. We observed no significant defects either in the organization of the cellular actin cytoskeleton, analyzed by superresolution (STED) microscopy, or in the structure of purified filaments stabilized with phalloidin, explored with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The reduced F-actin content correlated with an approximately fourfold reduction in the stiffness of patient-derived cells probed with AFM. Manipulating the cells by mechanical forces through the application of the Dual Laser Optical Tweezers (DLOT) technique suggests that the mutation weakens the attachment of cytoskeletal actin to the plasma membrane. Inducing dynamical reorganization of actin by uniaxial stretching revealed that the interaction of cofilin with actin is also weakened by the mutation. Based on the existing cofilin-actin structures, the binding of cofilin may weaken the interaction of the neighboring residue E195 with K113, one of the lateral contacts stabilizing the filament. Thus, the mutation possibly exerts its effect through the destabilization of the interfilament interactions, potentially interfering allosterically with cofilin binding during actin depolymerization.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While protein clustering can be driven by direct short-range forces, indirect interactions mediated by the membrane itself, particularly those arising from thermal shape fluctuations, are potentially sufficient to drive clustering in the absence of direct binding. In this study, we investigate the capacity of fluctuation-induced interactions to induce clustering using mesoscale simulations based on dynamically triangulated surfaces. We examine the roles of protein-induced changes in the local bending rigidity and Gaussian modulus, as well as the effects of protein concentration, identifying a crossover between dispersed and aggregated states that depends on these three parameters. We further explore the influence of surface tension, finding that tension mildly reduces clustering far from the crossover point but has a pronounced effect near it. We generalize these observations to spherical geometries, reporting similar results relevant to experiments involving small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Extending the model to systems with two types of stiff inclusions, we show that stiff proteins can serve as clustering centers for less stiff proteins. Finally, we analyze the impact of protein-induced preferred membrane curvature. In this scenario, the combination of fluctuation-mediated clustering and curvature induction can drive membrane shape remodeling. The non-additive nature of fluctuation-induced forces poses a challenge to predicting collective behavior, but our simulations provide a comprehensive framework that unifies previous observations.

We previously found PRMT5 to be frequently amplified in a mouse model for aneuploid T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. In this study, we investigated a possible role of PRMT5 as an aneuploidy tolerating gene. We report that PRMT5 is prone to aggregation when expressed at supra-stoichiometric levels compared to its obligate partner protein MEP50 (methylosome protein 50, WDR77). Intriguingly, we also find that protein aggregation, induced by CIN, is mitigated by jointly increased expression of PRMT5 and MEP50. Accordingly, concomitant PRMT5:MEP50 expression renders cancer cells less sensitive to proteasome inhibitors and CIN while inhibition sensitizes cells to CIN. Our findings provide a possible explanation for why PRMT5 and MEP50 display increased expression, particularly in aneuploid cancers and might reveal a targetable vulnerability of aneuploid cancer.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combining the FOLFIRINOX regimen with a GPX4 inhibitor, RSL3, and to identify Redox-related predictive and prognosis biomarkers. Experimental Design: A combination of in vitro and in vivo models were used to evaluate oxidative stress, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and the modulation of Redox proteins, GPX4 and SOD2. Furthermore, survival analyses were assessed with a 122 retrospective human pancreatic cancer cohort. Results: The novel GPX4 inhibitor, RSL3, enhanced the effect of FOLFIRINOX by inducing ROS accumulation that triggered ferroptosis and apoptosis in vitro and a significant tumor shrinkage in vivo in those high ROS levels tumor cells. In contrast, SOD2 overexpression conferred resistance. Furthermore, high GPX4 and ROS expression levels were associated with shorter survival, while elevated SOD2 levels showed a subgroup with better prognosis in our cohort of 122 human pancreatic cancer cases. Thus, a novel molecular signature based on a GPX4-high/SOD2-low profile may help detect patients with the poorest clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: Redox homeostasis regulates susceptibility to ferroptosis and influences treatment efficacy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Notably, sensitivity to ferroptosis was determined not only by GPX4 levels alone, but also by the balance between ROS accumulation and SOD2-mediated antioxidant buffering. These findings support a biomarker-guided approach to treatment stratification and provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of redox-based therapeutic strategies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

TGF is known to induce spontaneous oscillations in single-nephron glomerular filtration rate and tubular fluid flow in male kidneys. However, male-female differences in this dynamic behavior have not been studied. Leveraging intravital two-photon microscopy, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound-based and transdermal recordings, we found TGF-mediated oscillations across spatial scales, from single-nephron to whole-organ levels, and that male kidneys exhibited higher frequencies than females. To understand the mechanisms involved, we developed a dynamical systems model of TGF that agrees with physiological observations. Analysis of the mathematical model indicated that higher reabsorption rate and fluid flow efficiency in male proximal tubules not only result in higher frequencies, but also render male nephrons more susceptible to lose TGF-mediated oscillations. Furosemide abolished TGF-mediated oscillations in male kidneys and upregulated tubular injury marker, suggesting that the propensity to lose TGF-mediated oscillations underlies the heightened risk for injury in males. Our analysis also suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition confers renoprotection by preventing the loss of TGF-mediated oscillations in hyperglycemia.

PVH Bdnf rises acutely under both challenges and remains elevated with sustained HFD. Receptor expression shifts with state: in AgRP neurons, CR increases TrkB transcripts, whereas HFD increases p75NTR transcripts. AgRP-specific deletions define directional roles: TrkB loss reduces AgRP-to-PVH fiber density and yields larger stimulation-evoked feeding, whereas p75NTR loss increases fiber density and limits responses.

We tested the causal role of ventral hippocampal CA1/subiculum (vCA1/Sub) hyperexcitability in social memory failure and anxiety-related behavior, and whether normalizing principal-cell excitability restores function. Methods: In pilocarpine-treated mice we combined blinded behavioral assays (social approach/discrimination, open field, olfaction), whole-cell recordings from mCherry-labeled vCA1/Sub principal neurons, alveus stimulation to assay synaptic inhibition/excitation, immunohistochemistry for parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons, and chemogenetic control of excitability (hM3Dq in controls; hM4Di and KORD in epileptic mice). Missing behavioral outcomes were handled by multiple imputation with bootstrapping; pooled analyses used ANOVA, mixed-effects models, and logistic regression. Results: Epileptic mice showed preserved social approach but impaired social discrimination, with intact detection of social odors. Regular-spiking and bursting vCA1/Sub neurons exhibited depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced synaptically driven hyperpolarizations during alveus stimulation, indicating disinhibition; PV and SST interneuron densities were reduced in stratum oriens. Chemogenetic manipulation bidirectionally tuned excitability: bath CNO depolarized hM3Dq-expressing cells, whereas it hyperpolarized hM4Di-expressing cells by ~5 mV and decreased current-evoked spiking. In vivo, inhibiting vCA1/Sub principal cells (hM4Di or KORD activation) increased the probability of successful social discrimination in epileptic mice without altering investigation time; neither CNO nor salvinorin B affected unDREADDed animals. In the open field, epileptic mice displayed reduced center preference and high-velocity bouts; vCA1/Sub inhibition normalized center preference and movement toward control values. Center preference predicted social discrimination in DREADDed epileptic mice, linking anxiety-related behavior to vCA1/Sub excitability. Conclusions: vCA1/Sub hyperexcitability drives interictal social memory and anxiety-related deficits in chronic TLE. Reducing principal-cell excitability restores behavior despite interneuron loss, supporting a model in which ventral hippocampal output can be retuned to rescue cognition.

The pulmonary microcirculation, by virtue of its dense capillary network and direct anatomical proximity to the heart, is particularly vulnerable. Neutrophils and their effector mechanisms, including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the alarmin S100A8/A9, have been implicated in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, their role in remote damage post-MI remains unclear. Using intravital in vivo imaging in murine MI models and analysis of human lung tissues, we show that MI induces rapid pulmonary neutrophil and platelet recruitment, formation of platelet-neutrophil aggregates within capillaries, and endothelial activation. These changes are accompanied by NET release, fibrin deposition, and microvascular obstruction, leading to impaired vascular perfusion and necrosis. These pulmonary disturbances closely parallel those in the infarcted myocardium and exceed responses observed in other organs such as the kidney and liver, highlighting the lung as a vulnerable target organ. Increased neutrophil recruitment was associated with marked upregulation of the neutrophil-derived, NET-associated alarmin S100A8/A9 in mouse and human lungs, where it co-localised with infiltrating neutrophils, NETs, and platelet aggregates. Additionally, we show that short-term pharmacological inhibition of S100A8/A9 with ABR-238901 significantly attenuated pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, reduced NETosis and fibrin deposition, and restored capillary perfusion while rebalancing the pulmonary immune landscape. Together, these findings identify the lung as a principal site of remote thrombo-inflammatory injury after MI and implicate S100A8/A9, a neutrophil-derived, NET-associated alarmin, as a mechanistic driver of pulmonary microvascular dysfunction. We propose that targeting this pathway could provide dual protection for both cardiac and pulmonary microcirculations in the acute phase of myocardial injury.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While the effects of spaceflight on well-characterized protein-coding genes have been widely documented, little is known about the behavior of uncharacterized or poorly annotated genomic regions under these conditions. LOC (Locus) genes, often classified as long non-coding RNAs and excluded from conventional analyses, represent a largely unexplored component of the human transcriptome. In this study, we systematically investigated the transcriptional responses of LOC genes as part of the MESSAGE (Microgravity Associated Genetics) Science Mission, Turkiye's first human space biology initiative. Peripheral blood samples were collected from astronauts across five mission phases: pre-launch baseline, post-suborbital flight (~100 km), and on International Space Station (ISS) Days 4, 7, and 10 (~400 km). RNA-Seq analyses revealed six LOC genes with statistically significant expression changes (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test), alongside additional transcripts that, while not statistically significant, exhibited biologically meaningful temporal fluctuations. These dynamic profiles included continuous upregulation, transient activation with subsequent return to baseline, and delayed induction at later ISS stages, highlighting the functional diversity of LOC responses. To assess their translational potential, Open Reading Frame (ORF) analyses were performed on significant transcripts, revealing conserved ORF structures, notably identical ORF33 sequences in LOC124905103 and LOC124900480, suggesting coding capacity. Phylogenetic analyses further supported evolutionary clustering consistent with expression and ORF similarities. Collectively, these findings challenge the notion of LOC genes as transcriptional noise, instead positioning them as candidate biomarkers and functional elements of microgravity adaptation.

We have previously demonstrated that pulmonary exposure to this emerging environmental contaminant impairs endothelial function in the uterine vasculature of nonpregnant and pregnant rats. However, neither impaired endothelial-dependent dilation nor the role of the endothelial-derived vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), in vascular dysfunction after repeated maternal MNP exposure are understood. Therefore, we assessed uterine macro- and microvascular reactivity in Sprague Dawley rats to determine the mechanistic role of NO signaling in endothelial dysfunction after repeated (gestational day 5-19) MNP inhalation during pregnancy. Results identified that MNP exposure reduced fetal growth and impaired endothelial-dependent dilation in the uterine microcirculation, which controls perfusion and resource availability to the fetus. Levels of activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated on Ser1176, were substantially decreased (<50%) in uterine vessels from exposed rats. This suggests MNP inhalation limited NO production and bioavailability. Endothelial function was partially restored by supplementation of arterial segments with the eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), demonstrating that exposed vessels were BH4-deficient. Partial restoration was also achieved by incubation with the reducing agent, DTT, suggesting that exposed vessels contained physiologically relevant levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Increased 3-nitrotyrosine residues and decreased thioredoxin protein expression further suggest MNP fosters nitrosative and oxidative stress in the uterine vasculature, impairing eNOS and endothelial-dependent dilation. These findings implicate eNOS uncoupling as a mechanistic basis for the vascular toxicity of MNPs and the adverse impact of MNPs on fetal development.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Using simple epidemiological models, we explore the effect of three factors on short- and long-term suppression: the strength of density-dependent population regulation (homeostasis); maternal antibodies, and age-dependent mortality. Rapid homeostasis can mitigate long-term population suppression, and surprisingly weak homeostasis can even result in a greater population suppression during the endemic phase compared to the initial epidemic. Maternal antibodies can significantly reduce suppression of the host population if they attenuate rather than block infections. A similar result obtains if the severity of disease is lower in the young than in adults. In both cases, a higher R0 can result in lower suppression, and the average virulence can decline over time without any (genetic) evolution. Our results suggest the need for a nuanced view of long-term suppression by a new pathogen, with the outcome sensitive to many details even in the absence of evolution.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Differentiated between opposing posts, microtissues contain aligned, contractile myotubes, providing a controlled system for investigating the responses of skeletal muscle to nutrient and contractile stimulation. However, microtissue MPS responses to these stimuli remain under-characterized. Stable isotope-labeled amino acid tracers deliver sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar fractional synthetic rates (FSR) for MPS in human studies, but have not been implemented in engineered skeletal muscle. We close these gaps by characterizing stimulation-induced MPS, in microtissues and 2D myotubes derived from the same primary myoblast line, using stable isotope tracers and puromycin incorporation. In microtissues, sarcoplasmic FSR increased significantly during the two-hour period following amino acid treatment (p < 0.0001), whereas myofibrillar FSR remained unchanged (p = 0.159). However, both fractions were unresponsive to ketone stimulation and contraction (all p [&ge;] 0.703). 2D myotubes showed significant increases in sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar FSR in response to amino acid treatment (both p = 0.002). Notably, microtissues demonstrated a more stable myofibrillar protein fraction, with a sarcoplasmic-to-myofibrillar FSR ratio of ~2:1 which closely resembled that of native human muscle. The puromycin-based approach failed to detect MPS responses to any stimulus (all p [&ge;] 0.677), highlighting the superior sensitivity of tracer-based measurements, particularly where longer timescales are needed to capture an effect. These findings support the use of engineered muscle and isotope-derived measurements of MPS in future studies of stimuli regulating skeletal muscle mass.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Despite being a widely studied disease, so new mechanisms should be investigated as possible paths for future diagnostics and treatments in PD. Here, we performed an in silico analysis of the global gene expression of tissues from different brain regions (prefrontal area, putamen, and substantia nigra) in PD patients and controls, to demonstrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We analyzed the dataset series GSE20295 from GEO, which comprises GSE20168, GSE20291, and GSE20292. We identified 13 DEGs, all exhibiting downregulation in PD tissues compared to controls. Notably, the SYT1 (Synaptotagmin-1) gene demonstrated the lowest expression level and nearly the most significant adjusted p-value. SYT1 is implicated in calcium ion sensor activity, a functional domain showing substantial fold enrichment in our study. This gene encodes a protein pivotal for neurotransmitter release at synapses. We also found a significant role of calcium-related processes in PD pathology through GSEA, indicating an overall increase in their activity and a disruption in neurotransmitter release mechanisms mediated by Ca2+. Despite limited research on the correlation between SYT1 and PD to date, our findings suggest the SYT1 gene holds promise as a possible target for PD.

P.; Fahmy, K.", "abstract": "The cell membrane facilitates interactions with the environment and serves as an organizational platform for coordinating cellular processes, with lipids playing a central role in determining membrane property and function. Yet, how lipidome composition influences cellular fitness remains poorly defined. Recent approaches to chemically tune and minimize the lipidomes of genomically minimized bacterial organisms such as JCVI-Syn3A/B offer a streamlined system to explore why cells need such diverse lipid chemistries. In this study, we use isothermal microcalorimetry to assess how changes in lipid composition affect heat dissipated by JCVI-Syn3B cells, a parameter reflecting both growth and metabolic efficiency. By transposing the Monod equation into a calorimetric equation and extending it to the full life times of batch cultures, we introduce a new approach to quantify the metabolic efficiency of JCVI-Syn3B. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that tuning lipidome composition results in considerable variations of energy dissipation at the expense of biomass production. As a consequence, the volume of these minimal cells becomes inversely coupled to the lipidome-dependent entropic cost of cell division. The corresponding change in heat flow per cell mass gives rise to a complex but systematic dependence of growth rates on lipid composition. Interestingly, the maximal rate correlates with maximal lipid diversity, suggesting that the ability to tune local cell membrane charge and curvature through lipid structural diversity is crucial for divisome function. Our observations highlight the critical role of lipidome composition in cell metabolism and growth, and provide a new tool for interrogating the relationship between membrane composition and cell fitness.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We recently discovered that the retrotransposon Copia is a negative regulator of synaptogenesis at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (LNMJ) [1]. Here, we investigated whether the piRNA pathway regulates Copia in this somatic context. Methods Analysis of existing sequencing data revealed the expression of piRNA pathway components in somatic tissues [2]. We focused on Aubergine (aub), a core PIWI-clade Argonaute. We utilized CRISPR generated aub reporter lines and confocal microscopy to confirm the enrichment of AUB at the LNMJ and next generation sequencing coupled with digital PCR to validate the upregulation of TEs in aub knockdown larvae and adult tissues. Results Data from genetic reporters and antibody staining show that AUB is expressed and localized to the LNMJ. Tissue-specific knockdown of aub at the LNMJ resulted in increased TE expression, including Copia. In contrast to the synaptic overgrowth seen with Copia depletion [1], aub reduction caused a decrease in synapse number and impaired motor function and lifespan. These phenotypes are consistent with the upregulation of Copia, a negative regulator of synapse growth. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that AUB functions somatically at the LNMJ to repress TEs, thereby ensuring proper neuromuscular development and function. This work establishes a physiological role for the piRNA pathway in a somatic tissue, linking TE repression to neuromuscular development.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, the effect of sleep deprivation on gBOLD activity and its interaction with aging remain poorly understood. Using a rigorously controlled in-laboratory total sleep deprivation (TSD) protocol, we demonstrate that TSD significantly increases both the amplitude of the gBOLD signal and its coupling with CSF flow, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that may enhance glymphatic clearance following acute sleep loss. Notably, these TSD-induced enhancements exhibit robust age dependency, with diminished responses in individuals at midlife (40-50 yrs). The absence of this compensatory mechanism in these midlife participants may exacerbate age-related impairments in neurotoxic clearance and increase dementia susceptibility, thereby offering mechanistic insights into the nexus between sleep disruption, aging, and neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Prior research on the frontoparietal control network (FPN), a hub of cognitive regulation, has yielded inconsistent findings, often relying on static connectivity models that overlook temporally evolving architecture of the brain. Here, we leverage resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from a large, harmonized multisite dataset (n = 887; 442 MDD, 445 controls) to examine the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) of the FPN. Using a sliding-window approach and k-means clustering, we identified three recurring FPN connectivity states. Compared to controls, patients with MDD spent significantly more time in a hypoconnected state, exhibited prolonged dwell within this configuration, and showed a global reduction in the number of transitions between network states, reflecting diminished neural flexibility. Critically, transitions between hypoconnected and hyperconnected states were selectively impaired, suggesting disrupted efficient access to functionally distinct network modes. These results demonstrate that MDD is characterized not only by altered connectivity strength but by a constricted repertoire of dynamic brain states. This temporal dysregulation of the FPN may constitute a network-level mechanism underlying cognitive inflexibility in depression, highlighting dFC as a promising modality for mechanistic insight and translational applications.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Fatigue is multifactorial and task-dependent, arising from the interplay between performance and perceived fatigability. Fatigue-related changes in sensorimotor control and neural activity may alter skill acquisition and retention. Objective. To synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological evidence on how cognitive, cardiovascular, and neuromuscular fatigue influence motor-skill acquisition, consolidation/retention, and transfer. Methods. A systematic search was conducted within PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Thirty-four studies (39 experiments) met inclusion criteria (fatigue effects on motor learning in non-disabled participants). Data were extracted on fatigue protocol, learning taxonomy, learning stage (acquisition vs. retention/transfer), interval, and neurophysiology. Methodological quality was appraised with a tailored Downs & Black checklist. Results. During acquisition, 64% of experiments reported impairments under fatigue, particularly for visuomotor precision and fine force control; 10% found facilitation (often after cardiovascular exertion or high cognitive load); 15% were neutral; 10% inconclusive. Retention was tested in a fresh state and in a fatigue state in 34 experiments and 6 experiments, respectively. Results during retention tests were relatively variable, depending on fatigue protocols. Neurophysiological measures were scarce (EEG/TMS in only four studies), and very few studies considered the effects of personal factors such as age or sex. Conclusions. Fatigue does not uniformly impair motor learning. Neuromuscular fatigue typically hampers acquisition and sometimes retention, while cardiovascular exertion can transiently prime plasticity and enhance consolidation. Evidence for cognitive fatigue is limited and inconsistent. Future work should use longer retention windows, state-matched testing, and integrated neurophysiology to clarify mechanisms and guide training under fatigue.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In the retina, connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctions integrate visual signals over space and time. However, we do not understand how Cx36 gap junctions in the inner- and outer-retina govern visual thresholds under dim light conditions. Here we address this question using transgenic mouse models, a state-of-the-art operant behavioral assay, and psychophysical modelling. Visual thresholds with Ganzfeld illumination decreased steeply (-2 log/dec) with flash durations < 0.5 s, reaching an asymptotic value of ~2 x 10-4 ph/m2/s with longer flashes. Temporal summation and photon noise modelled under Signal Detection Theory account for the observed thresholds. Removal of outer-retinal Cx36 lowers visual thresholds by 2.6-fold. Nested model analysis suggests that the probability of transmission of single photon signals between rods and bipolar cells increases in the absence of CX36 gap junctions between rods and cones. Removal of Cx36 in both the inner and outer retina increases visual thresholds by 16.5-fold, consistent with a loss of spatial-averaging and reduction of neural noise by Cx36 in the inner-retina. We conclude that both inner- and outer-retinal Cx36 control visual thresholds under dim light conditions, but in distinct ways. Outer-retinal Cx36 increases thresholds, perhaps in a necessary tradeoff that provides rod signals access to the alternative rod-cone pathway, whereas inner-retinal Cx36 decreases thresholds by increasing spatial-integration, more than compensating for outer retina losses.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that the Echinococcus metacestode is an evolutionarily unique, broadly posteriorized tissue, leading us to hypothesize that canonical WNT (cWNT) signalling, which patterns the body axis across metazoans, might be critical for metacestode formation. Here, we report effective RNAi-mediated knockdown of the E. multilocularis beta-catenin gene (bcat-1), the central effector of cWNT signalling, in a primary parasite cell culture system that produces metacestode vesicles. bcat-1(RNAi) cultures were markedly impaired in vesicle formation, exhibited stem-cell hyperproliferation, and displayed disrupted muscle-fibre organisation. Genome-wide transcriptomics revealed a general anteriorization of gene expression, and in situ hybridization showed an overproduction of cells expressing head-inducing factors such as sfrp upon bcat-1 knockdown. Conversely, metacestode-specific genes including the tegumental factors muc-1, TNFR, and antigen B as well as the posterior marker post2b were significantly downregulated, consistent with the observed vesicle-formation defects. In situ analyses further identified anterior markers frizzled-10, nou-darake, notum, and follistatin that were overexpressed in bcat-1(RNAi) cultures and localized to the future anterior pole at the earliest stages of protoscolex formation. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of WNT signalling with pyrvinium pamoate caused complete loss of posterior tissue in Echinococcus protoscoleces, killed metacestode vesicles, and reduced stem-cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations. Together, these findings establish a central role for cWNT signalling in directing Echinococcus body-axis formation and the posteriorization events driving metacestode growth within the host, providing insight into asexual parasite proliferation mediated by this biologically unique larval stage and pointing to potential targets for chemotherapy against AE.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We conducted a comprehensive survey, recording 560 individual lizards representing 13 species from eight families, and used generalized additive models to assess the impact of mean field-active body temperature and net primary productivity on lizard abundance. Our results indicate that a rise in mean field-active body temperature significantly correlates with reduced lizard abundance, supporting the physiological tolerance hypothesis. This finding points out the critical importance of thermoregulation for ectotherm survival in the face of climate change. Conversely, resource availability, measured through net primary productivity, showed no significant effect on lizard abundance.

This motor trait, whether one naturally moves at a faster or slower pace, has been implicated in the ability to perform with external rhythmic structure across various experimental settings. In daily life, external rhythms often emerge through social interaction, as we continuously adapt to and move with rhythms generated by others. While previous studies have shown that individuals with similar spontaneous tempi can synchronize better in structured tasks, the role of individuals' spontaneous tempo in unstructured, dynamic social interactions remains untested. In the current study, we examined how individuals' spontaneous tempo shapes interpersonal coordination and subjective experience during an open-ended, free-form dyadic movement task. We first assessed individuals' tempo using a spontaneous tapping task. Then, we measured interpersonal coordination patterns, including synchrony and leader-follower dynamics using a joint improvisation task inspired by the mirror game. Specifically, we developed a novel platform, composed of large transparent touch screens that resemble a shared window, on which individuals could continuously improvise motion together in an intuitive and playful manner. Participants alternated between game rounds with a designated leader and game rounds of leaderless improvisation. Following the mirror game, we also measured individuals' subjective experience using a flow questionnaire. We found that individuals with similar spontaneous tempi reported greater flow experience during joint performance. Furthermore, we found that individuals with similar spontaneous tempi tended to synchronize less and were more variable and dynamic in their coordination patterns, specifically during leaderless improvisation rounds. Finally, we found that flow experience was highest when a participant's movement tempo during the mirror game aligned with their own spontaneous tempo, regardless of their partner's.

Despite the involvement of circadian clock genes in both interval timing and circadian rhythms, the mechanisms differentiating these functions remain unclear. Using Drosophila as a model, we demonstrate that the CLK/CYC heterodimer, but not PER/TIM, is essential for interval timing. Neuronal CLK/CYC expression is necessary and sufficient for sexual experience-dependent shorter mating duration (SMD) behavior. We identified that CLK/CYC expression in a single pair of ITP-positive LNd neurons is pivotal for SMD. These neurons are glutamatergic with output circuits to central brain regions. CLK variants lacking DNA binding motifs dissociate circadian rhythms from interval timing and sleep behaviors in these neurons. Our study uncovers a specialized circuit for interval timing and highlights the non-circadian functions of circadian clock genes.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We provide the first direct quantification of the metabolic cost of floral buzzing in bumblebees and evaluate its ecological significance. Using flow-through respirometry synchronised with laser vibrometry, we measured carbon dioxide production during buzzing by Bombus terrestris and compared it with flight take-off, which is powered by the same thoracic muscles. Buzzing required high muscular effort, with ~0.10 J per event and mass-specific power ~293 W/kg, and overall costs comparable to take-off because buzzing bouts are longer even though the metabolic rate is lower. Absolute metabolic rate increased with body mass, whereas intertegular span did not, implying that transient load rather than structural size better explains energetic demand in short, high-intensity behaviours. Metabolic traits were repeatable within individuals, and colony identity explained additional variance, consistent with genetic or shared environmental effects. Converting costs to nectar equivalents showed that buzzing required slightly more nectar than take-off and that requirements rose as nectar sugar concentration declined. We conclude that floral buzzing is a major, previously unquantified component of bee energy budgets that is likely to shape nectar supplementation, flower sequencing, and plant-pollinator interaction strength.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Endogenous rhythmic structure is a key characteristic of our cognitive system, organizing both sensory processes and motor behavior. In the motor domain, recent studies demonstrated that individuals vary systematically in the spontaneous tempo of self-paced movement, exhibiting consistent tempo preferences across time, tasks, and cognitive demands. In our daily experience, we often need to perform with others, adjusting our motor signatures to support interpersonal coordination. The purpose of this study is to examine how individuals with distinct spontaneous tempi reconcile their personal tempo preferences with the need to synchronize during joint performance. To this end, we measured individuals' spontaneous tempo across different days using three motor behaviors: tapping, walking, and bouncing. This design allowed us to examine both temporal consistency and cross-task consistency. Participants were then asked to perform these tasks together under two experimental conditions: (1) side-by-side, without explicit instructions to synchronize, and (2) with explicit instructions to synchronize their movements. Our findings replicate and extend recent work, demonstrating that individuals show stable rhythmic preferences across time, tasks, and interactive contexts. When performing together, two complementary patterns emerged. First, dyads converged on a common tempo around 2 Hz, reflecting a preferred tempo for joint rhythmic performance. Second, individuals retained a bias toward their own spontaneous tempo during joint performance, with faster or slower individuals performing correspondingly fast or slow within the range of dyadic tempo. Finally, individuals with more similar spontaneous tempi achieved greater synchrony and temporal stability when performing together. Thus, while individuals can flexibly adjust their spontaneous tempo to support joint action, personal tempo preferences remain a robust source of variability in how people perform and interact with others.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Hypoglycemia, in particular, represents an immediate threat and requires prioritized mitigation in autonomous insulin delivery systems. This paper introduces a risk-aware hybrid nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that combines data-driven uncertainty quantification with formal safety assurance through control barrier functions (CBFs). To account for key uncertainties, such as physiological time delays, unannounced meals, and stress-induced glucose variability, Gaussian processes (GPs) are employed as probabilistic estimators. The proposed method dynamically monitors glucose and regulates insulin injection to enforce safe glucose level control by preventing hypoglycemia. The proposed framework is evaluated using validated physiological simulators for various realistic scenarios.

N.; Koganti, P.; Selvaraj, V.", "abstract": "The translocator protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein with high expression in cells specialized for lipid metabolism, including white adipose tissue (WAT), where its physiological function remains poorly defined. Our previous work demonstrated a role for TSPO in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, prompting us to investigate its contribution to adipocyte lipid homeostasis under metabolic stress. We employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches using global Tspo knockout (Tspo-/-) mice, primary adipocyte cultures, and pharmacological TSPO-binding drugs to examine TSPO function. We show that Tspo-/- mice exhibited increased WAT mass and adipocyte hypertrophy following high-fat diet feeding, with no changes in caloric intake. These changes were accompanied by suppression of key lipolytic genes, reduced circulating NEFA and glycerol levels, and altered expression of fatty acid oxidation genes. Lipidomic profiling showed no genotype-dependent changes, indicating impaired mobilization rather than altered lipid composition. In vitro, TSPO deficiency enhanced lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation and impaired expression of lipolytic genes. TSPO-binding drugs phenocopied this response in TSPO-expressing cells. Mechanistically, we identify protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), an endogenous TSPO ligand, as a suppressor of adipogenic and lipolytic programs. PPIX levels increase during adipogenesis, and its accrual inhibits both lipid accumulation and lipolytic response, whereas hemin does not elicit these effects. Our findings identify TSPO as a regulator of adipocyte lipid metabolism through a previously unrecognized TSPO-PPIX axis that influences lipid mobilization in adipocytes. This mechanism provides insight into TSPO role in metabolic adaptation and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in obesity-associated adipose dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Results revealed significant shifts in stem rust races, with an increasing dominance of virulent races over the last decade. TKTTF dominated from 2012 to 2016, succeeded by TTTTF in 2017, and TKKTF in 2019-2020. By 2021-2022, TTKTT and TTKTF races were prevalent, affecting 90% of wheat fields.

Across the entire tissue section, macrophage infiltration was highest in donors with type 1 diabetes, and appeared contingent on the prescence of insulin-containing islets. Aab+ donors had higher macrophage densities in islet and peri-islet regions than non-diabetic individuals, but there was large case-by-case variation. Additionally, a greater proportion of macrophages highly expressed HLA class II (HLA-II) near and within islet regions of the type 1 diabetes group, which correlated with the proportion of stressed beta cells expressing HLA-II. The higher density of macrophages in the Aab+ and type 1 diabetes donors, taken together with higher expression of HLA-II in the type 1 diabetes pancreas, suggests that macrophages play a pivotal role in human type 1 diabetes initiation and progression.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed two distinct cardiomyocyte populations with differential injury responses. Importantly, although myofibroblasts increased in the fibroblast population, these cells displayed an extracellular matrix gene expression profile distinct from the pro-fibrotic phenotype typically observed in fibrillating adult atria and showed no evidence of fibrosis. Concurrently, monocytes/macrophages were activated and showed upregulated expression of the anti-fibrotic factor GPNMB.

Fifty-six male mice were divided into eight groups (n=7): normal control, diabetes only, malaria only, diabetes + malaria, malaria + OCB, diabetes + OCB, diabetes + malaria + OCB, and diabetes + malaria + metformin. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (40 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 consecutive days, while Plasmodium berghei was inoculated in the malaria groups, and infection was confirmed by Giemsa-stained thin smears. Treatments consisted of OCB (100 mg/kg) or metformin (250 mg/kg) orally for 7 days; controls received phosphate-buffered saline. OCB significantly (p<0.05) reduced parasitemia in infected groups compared with untreated controls.

In time perception, these expectations manifest as systematic biases, namely sequential dependence, where the current percept is influenced by the previous stimulus, and central tendency, the overestimation of short durations and underestimation of long ones. Both perceptual biases, corresponding to individual beliefs about stimulus generation, can vary substantially between participants. However, the neural correlates of these individual beliefs and their effects are unknown. Here, we investigate how these biases and their individual variations are reflected in neural responses in a duration reproduction task. Our EEG results show that in the frontocentral region, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) while experiencing the current stimulus depends on the previous stimulus regardless of whether sequential dependence is high or low. In contrast, in the right parietal region, CNV significantly correlated with the amount of sequential dependence. Central tendency was associated with frontocentral CNV amplitude and post-stimulus P2 components. A Bayesian model of time perception reproduced the observed neural dynamics, suggesting that internal estimates and expectations of stimulus offset are reflected in EEG responses.

Yet, defining their relationship across the continuum from normal aging to neurodegenerative disease has proven challenging. Recent research investigating the dynamic changes of neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2, or Narp, neuronal activity-related pentraxin) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects supports its promise as a prognostic marker of disease progression, possibly as an expression of synaptic damage related to cognitive impairment. However, studies in human subjects are unable to clearly differentiate age-related and disease-related processes. Here we took advantage of a well-characterized rat model that displays substantial individual differences in hippocampal memory during aging, uncontaminated by slowly progressive, spontaneous neurodegenerative disease. Through this approach, we aimed to interrogate the underlying neural substrates that mediate aging as a uniquely permissive condition and the primary risk for neurodegeneration. We found that successful cognitive aging is associated with an elevation of NPTX2 levels above that found in young or cognitively impaired subjects. Pharmacological engagement of neural activity was sufficient to increase NPTX2 levels in all subjects, but cognitively-impaired aged subjects failed to recruit NPTX2 in response to a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Together the findings demonstrate that changes in NPTX2 are coupled to differential cognitive outcomes of aging, and that successful neurocognitive aging is associated with adaptive upregulation of NPTX2, not simply the persistence of youthful synaptic dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Since inharmonic sound spectra contain more information (have higher information entropy), inharmonicity has been suggested to be involved in precision weighting. In this study we explored this issue by parametrically modulating the level of inharmonicity applied to synthetic sounds and recording MMN and P3a responses from healthy volunteers. Our results show that a sigmoid function models the relationship between inharmonicity and MMN amplitude better than any linear or polynomial function. Furthermore, P3a amplitude has an inverted-U relationship with inharmonicity and peaks at inharmonicity levels just below the threshold for pitch discrimination.

Six healthy participants performed isometric contractions (abduction, adduction, flexion and extension) at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction with the shoulder positioned at 30{degrees} and 65{degrees} of lateral abduction. HDsEMGs were recorded from the four muscles and analysed at both the global activation and motor unit levels. Global activation was quantified using root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude and topographic maps. Moreover, HDsEMGs were decomposed into individual motor unit spike trains and motor unit behaviour was characterized by mean discharge rate, coefficient of variation of inter-spike interval, and spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). RMS maps revealed movement-specific activation within and between muscles, with the deltoid and trapezius active across all tasks, while the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi were predominantly activated during flexion and extension. Motor unit discharge rates also showed task-dependent recruitment. MUAP spatial distributions further showed distinct motor unit territories within arrays, suggesting region-specific recruitment strategies across movements.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying motor neuron loss in SBMA, we first performed transcriptomic profiling of both induced pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons (iPSC-MNs) generated from SBMA patients and laser-captured micro dissected motor neurons (LCM-MNs) from symptomatic AR100 SBMA mice. We compared differential gene expression between the two models to identify shared transcriptional programs. To address the temporal progression of molecular changes we conducted profiling at key stages of motor neurogenesis in the developing iPSC-MNs and at pre-symptomatic and end- stage disease in AR100 SBMA mice to elucidate the emergence of the transcriptional phenotype and the trajectory of the gene expression changes. We found significant transcriptional convergence between these two species. Notably, shared dysregulation was observed in pathways related to the spliceosome, the cell cycle and mitochondrial function. These transcriptional alterations emerged early in motor neurogenesis suggesting a developmental component to SBMA. Further in AR100 LCM-MNs we also observed disruption of mitochondrial and DNA damage repair pathways from pre-symptomatic to end stage disease.

A hallmark of crowding is its spatial extent increasing linearly with eccentricity, as described by Bouma's law, reflecting retinal convergence and cortical magnification. Although crowding is typically studied in the periphery and Bouma's law predicts no crowding at the center of gaze - it occurs even foveally. Within the foveola, the central 1 deg of the visual field, characterized by peak visual acuity and largely one-to-one connectivity between photoreceptors and ganglion cells, the Bouma law breaks and the extent of crowding is expected to remain constant with eccentricity. Yet, whether crowding varies at this fine spatial scale remains unknown. To investigate this, we combined high-resolution eye tracking with a gaze-contingent display system to precisely localize gaze and measure crowding thresholds at multiple foveolar eccentricities. Our results reveal that crowding does increase linearly within the foveola, but at a rate significantly slower - approximately 3.5 times-than in the extrafovea. By showing that even within the highest-acuity region of the visual field, spatial integration zones are not fixed but change with eccentricity these findings challenge the view of the central fovea as a spatially uniform processing zone and demonstrate that crowding at this scale follows a distinct regime.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We recently reported that explanted stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes from patients with epilepsy carry residual biomolecules and cells which may be utilised for transcriptome and DNA methylation profiling. Methods: Here, we applied bioinformatic and other analyses to explore the transcriptomes (RNA sequencing-based) of those SEEG cases to better understand the types of recovered transcripts in terms of representation of genes expressed by different cell types, brain structures, and the extent to which the signal may reflect local epileptiform activity. Results: Electrodes from all clinical cases retained protein-coding transcripts which reflected the local molecular microenvironment as well as epileptiform activity. Expression of genes involved in housekeeping functions as well as markers of neuronal activity were consistent between patients and between the electrode locations within the brain. We detected transcripts representing various cell types and subtypes including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, all major classes of glia, and endothelial cells, as well as transcripts enriched in specific brain regions. Several genes showed a gradient of expression depending on the electrode position within the brain. We found examples of gene expression that correlated with epileptiform activity as recorded by SEEG. Interpretation: These findings extend the evidence that SEEG electrodes reflect the molecular microenvironments of brain activity in patients with epilepsy, both at sites of seizure onset and within the wider seizure network. The approach has potential applications in intraoperative surgical decision-making as well as to identify molecular biomarkers or therapeutic targets for the drug-resistant epilepsies.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Dynamic Brain Network Changes Associated with Successful Smoking Cessation", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.13.676003", "authors": "Im, J.; Kim, H.; Lee, J.-H.; Park, H. J.; Joh, H.-K.; Ahn, W.-Y.", "abstract": "Background: Tobacco smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality globally, with the success rate of unaided cessation remaining consistently low. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of smoking cessation is crucial for improving quit rates. However, there has been a lack of studies examining brain network changes associated with smoking cessation over time. In this study, we aimed to investigate longitudinal changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of large-scale brain networks underlying smoking cessation outcomes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: A total of 98 treatment-seeking smokers participated in a 6-week cessation program and underwent resting-state fMRI scans before and after the intervention. Independent component analysis identified the salience network (SN), executive control network (ECN), and default mode network (DMN) components, and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC was compared between successful and unsuccessful quitters using a group by time mixed-effects model. Correlations with smoking-related measures were explored. Results: Significant group-by-time interaction effects were found in FC, particularly involving connections between SN and ECN, as well as between the SN and DMN. Specifically, successful quitters exhibited greater baseline FC in the SN-ECN and SN-DMN circuits, which tended to normalize during the cessation process. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed trends suggesting that stronger pre-quit connectivity between the SN and ECN was associated with greater withdrawal severity and longer smoking history in successful quitters. Conclusions: Taken together, the normalization of initially elevated pre-quit FC in SN-ECN and SN-DMN circuits may reflect an adaptive neural process that supports successful withdrawal management and attentional reallocation during cessation. The identification of these neural substrates not only enhances our mechanistic understanding of smoking cessation over time but also underscores the need for targeted interventions that focus on these neural circuits to enhance quit outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Targeting pathways of neurotrophic signaling is a well-established therapeutic strategy to enhance mitochondrial function and mitigate neurodegeneration. The VPS10p domain receptor, SorCS2, has recently emerged as a receptor with neurotrophic signaling capabilities. Here, we design and develop novel SorCS2-derived macrocyclic peptides mimicking receptor activation in vivo. We show that SorCS2-peptides enhance both neurotrophic support and boost metabolism by activating CREB and AMPK in a CAMKK2-dependent manner. This leads to upregulation of the key transcription factors PGC1a and TFEB and consequentially mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, we show that the lipidated SorCS2 macrocycle, TT-P34, rescues motor behavioral deficits and preserves synaptic and mitochondrial signatures in the zQ175 mouse model of Huntington Disease. In addition, treating a MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson Disease leads to amelioration of behavioral deficits and reduction of dopaminergic loss. Finally, we demonstrate that TT-P34 crosses the blood-brain barrier in non-human primates, and estimate human therapeutic dosing by pharmacodynamic modelling. Together, our findings support the use of TT-P34 as a novel disease-modifying therapy targeting SorCS2-receptor signaling to prevent neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Inspired by this observation, a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm, 100 Hz high-density theta burst stimulation (100 Hz hdTBS), is presented. This paradigm delivers 6 pulses per burst with an inter-pulse interval of 10 ms--doubling the pulse frequency and total pulse count of the conventional intermittent TBS (iTBS). The effect of this new paradigm was studied in the motor cortex of awake rats using a rat-specific focal TMS coil and a hdTBS stimulator developed in house. Results reveal that 100 Hz hdTBS triples the after-effects of conventional iTBS. In a separate group of animals that received two consecutive iTBS session back-to-back (prolonged iTBS), we observed an inhibitory effect. Since that prolonged iTBS matches the total pulse count of 100 Hz hdTBS but produced opposite after-effects, our results underscore the critical roles of the temporal structure of TMS pulses--not merely the total number of pulses--in driving neuroplasticity. This new paradigm has the potential to significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy if confirmed to be safe and effective in humans.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We used a repetitive diffuse TBI (rdTBI) model in mice with continuous video-EEG monitoring up to 4.5 months post-injury to investigate electrographic biomarkers before and during post-traumatic seizure development. 25% of mice developed posttraumatic seizures with highly variable latency (5-126 days post-injury). Most significantly, we identified fast ripple-delta DOWN state coupling as an early biomarker that was detectable at 4 days post-TBI and appeared before seizure onset in all seizure-experiencing mice. This EEG signature distinguished seizure-experiencing from seizure-free TBI mice with high specificity. Power spectrum analysis revealed elevated delta and theta power, reduced physiological fast oscillations (alpha, beta, gamma) and increased pathological high-frequency oscillations (fast ripples) in seizure-experiencing animals, indicating network hyperexcitability. Spike analysis showed that while TBI itself increased cortical excitability, seizure onset triggered a dramatic further escalation in interictal activity. These electrographic signatures were remarkably consistent across all seizure-experiencing animals regardless of single or recurrent seizure pattern. Our results demonstrate that fast ripple-delta coupling represents a promising early biomarker detectable at 4 days post-TBI, before seizure onset, offering potential for early identification of post-traumatic seizure susceptibility. Importantly, this biomarker identified all seizure-prone animals regardless of whether they developed single or recurrent seizures, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance for any post-traumatic seizure occurrence.

In the high-baseline oxytocin group (n = 30), oxytocin levels remained elevated throughout the games, whereas in the low-baseline group (n = 30), oxytocin increased to levels comparable to the high group, without increases in cortisol. Oxytocin promoted a sense of unity mediated by subjective enjoyment. HR synchrony during and after the games increased in both groups, associated with oxytocin levels. Finally, HR synchrony predicted psychological flow and team loyalty, mediated by unity.

The probability of typical and atypical cortical organization has not been fully explored, especially in epilepsy populations. We sought to generate a probabilistic atlas of motor, sensory, and language functions using extraoperative DES in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 2,124 extraoperative DES trials from 125 patients undergoing intracranial monitoring (2008 - 2023). Positive and negative trials were mapped to Montreal Neurological Institute space, parcellated with the Human Connectome Project atlas, and analyzed using probability mapping, bootstrapped region-of-interest hit probabilities, hierarchical clustering, and kernel density estimation. Mixed-effects models assessed clinical predictors of language disruption. Results: Probabilistic maps revealed regions of increased likelihood for eliciting functional responses in expected sensorimotor and language territories, but also demonstrated marked variability and deviations from expected cortical locations. Language disruption occurred in 338 trials, motor in 520, and sensory in 370. Instead of observing high probabilities and low inter-patient variability isolated to classic perisylvian locations (e.g., Broca's and Wernicke's areas), the likelihood of language disruption followed graded probabilistic gradients with high inter-patient variability. The middle frontal gyrus emerged as a consistent locus of naming and speech arrest. Motor phenomena extended into parietal association cortex. Higher-order experiences, including forced thoughts and feelings of presence, were reproducibly evoked from frontal and temporoparietal sites. Early seizure onset and temporal lobe lesions predicted lower naming disruption probabilities. Conclusions: This extraoperative DES atlas, the largest to date, demonstrates that eloquent cortical functions are organized along probabilistic continua rather than fixed regions. Findings highlight the middle frontal gyrus as a critical language node, extend motor mapping into parietal cortex, and delineate reproducible experiential phenomena. Substantial inter-patient variability underscores the necessity of individualized mapping in surgical planning.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Using direct recordings from humans performing a spatial episodic memory task, we show that traveling waves within the insula modulate neuronal interactions across insula subregions, by propagating in distinct spatial patterns during specific phases of memory. In addition to traveling plane waves, insula waves also propagated in complex, heterogenous spatial patterns across task conditions. Insular traveling waves correlated with memory success, highlighting the critical role of insular traveling waves in orchestrating memory performance. Our study suggests that insular traveling waves are a key mechanism for modulating interactions and neural coding across regions to support memory processing and potentially a biomarker for investigating dysfunctions in neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This effect is specific to the location and lower-level features of the training stimulus, as well as other task parameters. However, extensive practice using a specific set of stimulus conditions has been shown to partially generalize to new conditions in the form of faster learning rates and slightly improved performance at the outset. We hypothesized that this effect is caused by nuanced changes in the subject's decision-making strategy that can be revealed through drift-diffusion modeling (DDM). To test this hypothesis, subjects were trained on a coarse direction discrimination task using random dot motion stimuli over several sessions. Stimulus location and direction of motion were fixed during training, and either of them changed on the testing session. A subset of participants were trained on separate days to test for the effect of sleep consolidation. We observed the typical training effects of improved accuracy and reaction times as a function of training. DDM modeling showed that learning induced increased drift rate, decreased boundary height, lowered integration leak, and decreased rate of the collapsing bound. Importantly, while changes to the drift rate and boundary conditions mostly reverted to their pre-training values on the testing session, integration leak and rate of the collapsing bound remained at their post-training values in the new stimulus conditions. Sleep consolidation exerted no meaningful difference on performance, reaction times, or parameter values. These results suggest that the observed changes to accuracy and reaction times are caused by at least two different components with different degrees of transferability, as well as the fruitfulness of DDM for understanding the nuances of perceptual learning.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most common cause of brain injury and seizures in term neonates. The goal of this study was to describe HCAR1 expression and function in the neonatal brain and further understand its role in HIE. Methods: HCAR1 expression was measured using qRT-PCR in developing mice (postnatal day (p)10, 20, 30, 50). Electrophysiology was used to measure neuronal properties and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) in hippocampal principal neurons from HCAR1 knockout and wildtype mice when exposed to lactate. Then, p10 HCAR1 knockout and wildtype mice were exposed to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and placed on electroencephalography (EEG) to compare seizure burden. HCAR1 expression after neonatal HI was measured with PCR. Results: HCAR1 is expressed at p10 at similar levels to adults (n=6/group; 1-way ANOVA, p<0.0004). Lactate decreases amplitudes and sEPSC frequency in wildtype (p<0.0001, p<0.001) but not HCAR1 knockout mice (p<0.26, p=0.91). After HI, HCAR1 knockout mice have higher seizure burden (2318s in WT vs. 6497s in KO (p=0.04)) and behavioral seizure scores (4 in WT vs. 6 in KO (p<0.001)) than wildtypes. HCAR1 expression increased 24h post-HI but drops to below baseline at 48h post-HI. (n=3/group; p=0.02). Conclusion: HCAR1 is expressed on neurons in the developing mouse brain.

However, because of difficulties in demonstrating escalation of nicotine use in rats, its relation to other addiction-related phenomena is currently unknown. Recently, we showed that, compared to rats with a fixed moderate dose of nicotine, rats with access to increasing high doses of nicotine for self-administration progressively escalated their nicotine intake. Whether these animals with escalating patterns of nicotine self-administration also develop other behavioral signs of addiction remains to be investigated. Here we report that after escalation of nicotine intake, animals have a greater difficulty of abstaining from seeking the drug, a greater responsiveness to nicotine-induced craving-like behavior, and an increased vulnerability to re-escalate nicotine intake post-extinction than rats with stable patterns of nicotine intake. No substantial sex differences in the development of these different addiction-related phenomena were observed. Finally, after escalation, nicotine intake also became primarily dependent on nicotine reinforcement and less so on the nicotine-paired cue. Overall, this study shows that most of the post-escalation behavioral changes previously seen with other drugs of abuse are generalizable to nicotine intake escalation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

We therefore tested whether gabapentinoids modulate dopamine signalling, underlying VGCC-dependence, and potential for treating Parkinson's. In mouse striatum, we reveal that gabapentinoids ex vivo promote dopamine release, via sex-specific dependence on 2{delta}1/2 subunits and alterations to the calcium- and VGCC-subtype-dependence of dopamine release or its tonic inhibition by striatal GABA.

Here we examine the role of dopamine in modulating Drosophila melanogaster larval motor programs underlying movement over and through substrates. First, we performed dual-color calcium imaging in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing dopaminergic neurons and motor neurons to reveal cell-type specific recruitment patterns during fictive motor programs. Activity of select TH-neurons correlated strongly with fictive headsweeps as well as forward and backward fictive locomotion. Next, bath applications of dopamine biased the isolated central nervous system towards fictive forward locomotion and inhibited fictive head sweeps. To probe whether these effects are recapitulated in intact animals, we optogenetically manipulated TH-neuron activity during surface crawling and tunneling. Optogenetic activation of TH-neurons with CsChrimson during crawling had no effect on headsweeps and slowed locomotor rhythms by increasing wave duration and decreasing wave frequency. Furthermore, posterior asymmetries, motor sequences characteristic of tunneling, were triggered. On the other hand, optogenetically inhibiting TH-neurons with GtACR1 had little effect on surface crawling. Underground, TH-neuron activation enhanced tunneling activity by increasing wave frequency, instead of duration, which increased overall tunneling time, whereas inhibition decreased time spent tunneling. These results suggest that dopaminergic modulation of larval forward locomotion is dependent on sensorimotor context. We propose dopamine mediates a coordinated network effort to shift central pattern generators to promote tunneling-specific motor programs.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Presently, we examined the ability of NLX-101 to normalize several aspects of behavioral anomalies displayed by adult male FMR1 KO2 mice, a transgenic murine model of FXS. FMR1 KO2 mice were treated with NLX-101 (0.64 & 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and tested sequentially in 1) the open-field test to study hyperactivity and stereotypies (self-grooming), 2) the three chamber partition test (social memory), 3) the nesting behavior test (daily living), 4) the novel object recognition test (working memory) and 5) the hyponeophagia (novelty suppression feeding) test (anxiety). Each test was separated by a three-day wash-out period. NLX-101 normalized hyperactivity and excessive self-grooming at both 0.64 and 2.5 mg/kg, whereas hyponeophagia, and deficits in working and social memory, were partially normalized at 0.64 mg/kg and fully at 2.5 mg/kg. Abnormal nest building was partially normalized at 2.5 mg/kg.

Understanding the molecular features that control axon growth potential is critical for uncovering how neural circuits form, mature, and respond to injury or disease. The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) offers a powerful model to dissect axon growth programs, as lineage-related Kenyon cells (KCs) undergo different developmental events under shared spatiotemporal conditions. During metamorphosis, {gamma}-KCs undergo axon pruning, followed by developmental regrowth at the same time-frame as /{beta}-KCs initiate axon growth - thus providing a unique opportunity to compare these distinct growth paradigms. To uncover the underlying genetic programs, we performed RNA-sequencing of /{beta}- and {gamma}-KCs during their initial growth and developmental regrowth, respectively, revealing dynamic transcriptional changes and identifying 300 shared genes upregulated during both growth states. A targeted loss-of-function screen revealed genes specifically required for either /{beta} initial growth, {gamma} regrowth, or both. Focusing on one such candidate, Pmvk, we found that it plays a crucial role in axon regrowth by acting within the mevalonate pathway. Notably, other enzymes in this pathway were also required, suggesting that the entire metabolic pathway is essential for supporting regrowth. Using mutant analyses and rescue exepriements, we demosntrate that Pmvk likely controls axon regrwoth via prenylation of Rheb, an effector of the TOR pathway, which we previously found to be required for regrowth. Our developmental transcriptomic atlas not only advances understanding of intrinsic axon growth programs, but also provides candidate genes and a valuable framework for future studies aimed at enhancing axon regeneration in the adult nervous system.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

The control group received intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline while four experimental groups received i.p. 5 FU at 12.5 25 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight. Saline or 5 FU was administered for four consecutive days, followed by alternate-day dosing until day 12. Behavioral assessments were conducted and animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the final test. Cortical tissues were analyzed using biochemical assays histology and immunohistochemistry. 5 FU administration caused dose-dependent decreases in body weight food intake and locomotor activity. Treated rats also showed impaired spatial working memory and reduced time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Biochemically 5 FU significantly increased cortical malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels while total antioxidant capacity and interleukin 10 levels decreased. Histological analysis revealed progressive disruption of cortical cytoarchitecture with increasing doses. 5 FU induces dose-dependent neurotoxicity in the rat cerebral cortex characterized by behavioral deficits, oxidative stress neuroinflammation and histomorphological alterations. These findings highlight the need to better understand and mitigate CNS toxicity associated with 5 FU based chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, current models of these neural interactions, typically based on divisive normalization (DN) or descriptive frameworks, fail to account for the wide range of effects documented for CS motion alone. Here, we propose that both neural and perceptual phenomena related to center-surround motion emerge from a single normative principle: Bayesian causal inference over the latent structure of motion. We derived neural predictions from a causal inference model of perception that dynamically infers the most probable reference frame for moving stimuli. Specifically, we generated predictions for both the mean response and variability of single neurons across the full 4D space of center and surround motion (i.e., directions and speeds). These predictions exhibit complex interactions that are unexplainable by classic DN models but qualitatively match a wide range of neural data from the primate middle temporal area (MT). Our model shows how a heterogeneous population of MT neurons, variously encoding motion in retinal coordinates or relative to an inferred reference frame, can arise from this single inferential process. Our results resolve long-standing puzzles, such as when and why surround stimuli suppress versus facilitate neural responses, and why neural data can alternately support or challenge relative motion coding. By unifying disparate neural observations with perception, our work suggests new, theory-driven experiments to probe the circuit-level implementation of these computations.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Smoldering lesions, defined by an inactive core, poor remyelination and a rim of chronically activated microglia, are hallmarks of a progressive disease course and correlate with irreversible disability. The mechanisms driving their formation remain poorly understood. Using a chimeric mouse model, we investigated the long-term impact of healthy donors (HD) and MS patient-derived lymphocytes (LY) graft on the evolution of spinal cord demyelinated lesion. Three months post-grafting, only MS-derived LY persisted as perivascular cuffs interacting with vascular and murine immune cells, mirroring MS smoldering lesion pathology. MS LY-grafted mice exhibited impaired functional recovery and slower somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) conduction compared to controls. Electron microscopy confirmed glial scar formation, persistent demyelination and a lesion architecture with an inflammatory inactive center but active rim. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed an imbalance in CNS cell populations, with MS LY-grafted mice showing reduced neuronal abundance, enriched activated microglia, and immature oligodendroglial profiles, correlating with slower SSEP conduction speeds. Immune cell subclustering identified an enrichment of disease-associated microglia and interferon-responsive microglia in MS LY-grafted mice, marked by elevated pro-inflammatory markers and active myelin phagocytosis. Oligodendroglial cells displayed downregulated myelination and stress-response genes, with disrupted myelin ultrastructure confirmed by electron microscopy. Multiblock analysis revealed donor-specific variability, with some MS LY inducing outcomes akin to HD, while others drove severe pathology.

Multiple molecular and cellular changes occur following mTBI; here we focus on astrocytes - cells that respond to brain injury and are critical to maintaining neuronal and circuit homeostasis. While some astrocytes become reactive after mTBI, others adopt an 'atypical' state characterized by the loss of multiple functional astrocyte proteins, including glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST) and ion channels (Kir4.1), without upregulation of prototypical reactive astrocyte markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Previous studies have shown that repeated mTBI causes atypical astrocytes (AtAs) that can persist for months, but we know much less about whether a single mTBI causes similar astrocyte phenotypes. To address this, we employed a closed-head mild traumatic brain injury (chmTBI) model in male and female mice and quantified the abundance of AtAs both acutely (3-days) and chronically (1-month) after a single injury. We found that 3-days after chmTBI, AtAs were present in areas subject to blunt force trauma (BFT), consistent with previous reports, as well as in other brain regions presumably affected by diffuse injury. One month after chmTBI, however, the proportion of AtAs was similar between chmTBI and sham injured mice, thereby suggesting AtAs do not persist long term in this model. Consistent with previous studies, this chmTBI model did not induce significant GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes as assayed using immunohistochemistry, at either timepoint. Overall, we show an increase in AtAs 3-days after a single chmTBI that returns to sham levels when examined 1-month after injury. This suggests that after a single mTBI, AtAs are present but do not persist long term, unlike in repeated mTBI where AtAs persist for months after injury.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, variability in detection algorithms and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks hinder transparency and reproducibility across studies. In this work, we introduce pEYES, an open source toolkit designed to streamline EM detection and enable robust, quantitative comparisons between detectors. The toolkit provides implementations for several widely used threshold-based detectors, along with multiple standardized evaluation procedures for assessing detection performance. Using pEYES, we evaluated seven detection algorithms on two publicly-available human annotated datasets containing recordings of subjects freely viewing color images. Performance was assessed using metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, Relative Timing Offset and Deviation, and a sensitivity index (d') for fixation and saccade onsets and offsets. Engbert's adaptive velocity-threshold algorithm consistently matched or outperformed the other detectors, occasionally achieving human level precision. In contrast, several other detectors exhibited substantial variability in performance between datasets. We also found systematic differences in detection scores between fixation and saccade boundaries, with fixation offsets and saccade onsets detected more reliably than their counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of task and dataset specific detector selection in EM analysis. The pEYES toolkit is freely available, and its codebase - along with the analyses presented in this report - is accessible at https://github.com/huji-hcnl/pEYES.

Across ages, DoA episodes emerged from a globally less activated cortical state, with pre-onset surges in delta and beta power peaking in premotor, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. After onset, episodes showed widespread beta enhancement and focal delta suppression in sensorimotor and parietal associative regions relative to stable slow-wave sleep, alongside sustained frontal delta and beta activity compared with physiological motor arousals.

Traditional methods such as self-reports, physiological monitoring, or neuroimaging are often limited by subjectivity, invasiveness, or poor temporal resolution. Saliva offers a practical alternative, reflecting rapid neuroendocrine changes linked to emotional states. We analyzed four key salivary biomarkers: cortisol (stress, HPA-axis activity), alpha-amylase (sympathetic activation), dehydroepiandrosterone (resilience), and oxytocin (social bonding, emotional regulation) to capture multidimensional emotional responses. Two clinical studies (N=30, N=63) and one consumer study (N=80) exposed healthy volunteers to six fragrances, with saliva collected before, 5 minutes after, and 20 minutes after olfactory stimulation. Subjective ratings of happiness, relaxation, confidence, and dynamism were also obtained via questionnaires. Rigorous analytical validation accounted for reproducibility, circadian variation and sample stability. Biomarker patterns revealed fragrance-specific emotional profiles, with distinct subgroups of participants whose biomarker dynamics correlated with specific emotional states. Increased oxytocin and decreased cortisol consistently aligned with happiness and relaxation, whereas distinct biomarker combinations predicted confidence or dynamism. Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting these profiles. Validation in an independent cohort (N=80) using an implicit association test confirmed concordance between molecular profiles and behavioral measures, underscoring the robustness of this method. These findings establish salivary biomarker profiling as a reliable tool for decoding real-time emotional responses. Beyond scientific insights into affective neuroscience, this approach holds translational potential in personalized fragrance design, sensory marketing, and therapeutic applications for stress-related disorders. Expanding the biomarker panel and integrating molecular data with neuroimaging or autonomic measures could further elucidate the interplay between central olfactory processing and peripheral physiology.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Early findings of the toxicity of such blooms stemmed from fatalities of livestock drinking from affected water. Since then, various toxins have been identified such as the microcystins. Microcystin-LR has been studied as a representative congener due to its abundance and toxicity. While there have been extensive studies of microcystin-LR by oral route exposure, we have turned our attention to inhalation route exposure due to the recent findings of microcystin-containing lake and sea-spray aerosol. We have shown inflammatory outcomes in the airways of mice and in human cell culture models after microcystin aerosol exposure, and have found a consistent molecular patterns similar to those of Type 1/Type 17 driven neutrophilic asthma. Here we address the hypothesis that MC-LR will increase the inflammatory mediators of neutrophilic asthma leading to worsening symptoms. This is tested and characterized in both in vitro and in vivo models. We found that asthma symptoms and molecular signatures of inflammation are both worsened by MC-LR exposure in a mouse model of neutrophilic asthma. We found that 3D human airway cell culture models reconstructed from asthmatic donor cells are similarly affected, however healthy donor cells are nearly unaltered by comparison. Aggregating these findings with RNA sequencing data from all models, we developed a hypothetical molecular mechanism which relies on MC-LR mediated amplification of existing inflammatory signaling. We test this in a human reporter cell line of NF-{kappa}B activity and further demonstrate the mechanism by inhibitor testing. This study sheds light on the risk to asthmatic patients living near or recreating on affected bodies of water. Beyond asthma, we believe this study provides crucial insight into the findings over the last 40 years concerning disparate outcomes of MC-LR exposure as the result of exposure will be dependent on the signaling state of the tissue upon exposure.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED), also known as microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) using continuous sample rotation has emerged as a powerful method for solving structures from sub-micrometre-sized crystals. However, the resolution of MicroED data from protein crystals is often limited by radiation damage. Serial electron diffraction (SerialED) overcomes this limitation by merging single-shot diffraction patterns from thousands of crystals, but its widespread use has been hindered by the complexity and scarcity of equipment required for single shot data acquisition. Here, we introduce continuous SerialED (c-SerialED), a simple, robust and widely accessible protocol. This approach collects diffraction data quickly and efficiently from all crystals within a given area, without prior crystal identification. We show that only using a standard cryo-EM instrument equipped with a simple widely available CMOS detector, c-SerialED greatly reduces radiation damage while improving the data quality. We demonstrate that c-SerialED enables determination of lysozyme structures at atomic resolution (0.83 [A]) and improves the data resolution of Dype Type Peroxidase Aa (DTPAa) crystals from 2.5 [A] (MicroED) to 1.3 [A]. Remarkably, the resulting structures are virtually free of radiation damage. The improved data quality and resolution allow visualization of radiation sensitive chemical features and protein-ligand interactions to state-of-the-art accuracy. By providing a convenient, fast, and damage-minimizing workflow on existing cryo-EM setups, c-SerialED significantly enhances the applicability of electron diffraction in structural biology.

To identify the developmental mechanism linking maternal obesity to cardiometabolic disease in the offspring, a high fat/high fructose diet or low-fat control diet were introduced 4 weeks prior to mating in C57BL6 females and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring born to obese dams had greater whole-body adiposity prior to puberty and were more susceptible to diet-induced obesity in adulthood. On postnatal day 10 (PND10) when pups born to obese dams had greater accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue, single cell sequencing was used to identify adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in the stromal vascular fraction. Two distinct lineages of APCs were identified that arose from a common proliferative root, terminating in committed preadipocytes and anti-adipogenic APCs. In pups born to obese dams, the proliferative root made up a greater proportion of APCs, more of these cells were in the G2M and S phases of the cell cycle and there was an enrichment in genes associated with proliferation (mKi67, Fat3, Ccn4, Gata4). On PND10, APCs isolated from the inguinal depots of pups born to obese dams were hyper-proliferative and there was a greater abundance of total APCs, whereas there were no differences in adipocyte size. After puberty, APCs in subcutaneous depots of offspring born to obese dams were more adipogenic in vitro and this group gained a greater amount of body fat in response to pharmacological stimulation of adipogenesis by rosiglitazone. Male adults born to obese dams had a lower abundance of APCs and were more susceptible to APC exhaustion due to prolonged exposure to rosiglitazone.

Infections causes shrinkage and subsequent regrowth to original intestinal dimensions, suggesting homeostasis, whereas diet can induce adaptive changes. Whether diet and infection differ in the kinetics, magnitude, or cellular mechanisms that drive intestinal resizing, and whether intestines use a fixed size memory versus an adaption to nutrient availability, still remains unclear. Objective: To determine whether intestinal regrowth after infection reflects a fixed memory of a target size (homeostasis) or an adaptation to the nutritional state during regrowth, and to identify the cellular modalities that drive infection- and diet-induced resizing. Design: Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we quantified intestinal size, cell size, cell number, and epithelial turnover in response to dietary shifts and oral bacterial infections, both individually and in combination. Results: Infection-induced atrophy occurred only when the intestine was initially large, and regrowth required nutrient availability. Distinct cellular mechanisms underpinned changes in intestinal size: diet-induced growth in unchallenged intestines was mediated by enterocyte hypertrophy, whereas post-infection regrowth required intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. Consistently, ISC ablation impaired regrowth only after infection. Bacteria functioned both as pathogens and nutrients, triggering intestinal shrinkage when damaging a large organ, but promoting growth when consumed by nutrient-deprived flies. Conclusion: Intestinal regrowth after infection reflects a context-dependent, diet-driven adaptation, not a fixed intestinal size memory. Diet and infection engage distinct, stimulus-specific cellular programs to reshape the midgut, revealing a modular logic of organ plasticity with implications for tissue repair and metabolic regulation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Adult males and females were heat-hardened by exposure to 41C for one hour and subsequently tested for heat survival and knockdown following one-hour heat shocks across a range of temperatures up to the lethal limit, ramping CTmax assays and static temperature knockdown time assays. The three species differed markedly in their heat tolerance across all assays, with Ae. aegypti being the most heat tolerant and Cx. quinquefasciatus being the least. Females from all three species were more heat tolerant than males in the one-hour heat shock assays, but effects of sex were absent or inconsistent for CTmax and heat knockdown time assays. A beneficial impact of heat hardening on subsequent heat shock knockdown was evident in both sexes of all three species. However, hardening effects differed substantially for survival 24 hr later, ranging from no effect of hardening in Cx. quinquefasciatus to a ~1C increase in LT50 in Ae. notoscriptus. In contrast, no effects of heat hardening were detected for CTmax or static knockdown time assays. An additional experiment in Ae. aegypti detected no benefits of heat shock exposure in female patents on the thermal tolerance of offspring. Our findings emphasize the need to consider effects of acclimation including heat hardening in models to predict the response of mosquitoes to climate warming.

We analysed fauna from 660 sediment cores across four habitat zones (established dunes, incipient dunes, upper intertidal, lower intertidal) along the Dutch North Sea coast using environmental DNA metabarcoding and joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to characterise communities and infer assembly patterns. Across all habitats, beta diversity was dominated by species turnover rather than nestedness, indicating reassembly of communities through species replacement rather than species loss. Turnover was significantly associated with urbanisation gradients, with the strongest effects in incipient dune habitats, but assembly responses differed by habitat. In dune zones, urban proximity was associated with weaker environmental filtering and stronger species co-distribution, and communities in incipient dunes showed the greatest sensitivity to local disturbance such as trampling and beach cleaning. In contrast, environmental filtering remained the dominant factor in the lower intertidal, where hydrodynamic influences are more important than urban effects. Analysis of OTU-level responses identified candidate taxa for tolerance and sensitivity to urban stressors. This highlights the potential of combining eDNA with JSDMs for bioindicator development. Overall, our results demonstrate that urbanisation changes not only which species occur where, but also the environmental and spatial processes structuring beach and dune communities. These findings show the need for habitat-specific management that protects both biodiversity and the ecological patterns that sustain it in urban coastal systems.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Recent links between feeding ecology and brain size have revived interest in foraging cognition as a core component in cognitive evolution. We investigated whether free-ranging Guinea baboons (Papio papio) keep track of the spatio-temporal availability of a preferred food resource, the Natal orange (Strychnos spinosa). A natural experiment, a massive wildfire that destroyed most oranges in 2019, allowed us to disentangle habitual routines from goal-directed behaviour in the baboons. The animals' space-use patterns shifted significantly following the wildfire. After one single visit, they stopped going to the area during the period when Natal oranges would normally be available. In the following year, they resumed regular space-use patterns. We also assessed travel linearity, speed, and departure time from sleeping sites towards the target area with and without ripe fruit. Guinea baboons travelled more linearly, 14% faster, and ~40 minutes earlier towards the target area when S. spinosa was in season compared to when it was not. In conclusion, Guinea baboons rapidly updated their knowledge of high-value food availability and adjusted their space-use accordingly.

Mitochondrial dysfunction accelerates neurodegeneration aggravating the severity of ALS. We hypothesized that increasing the mitochondrial function of motor neurons may promote neuronal survival. Therefore, we investigated the potential of neuron-derived mitochondria containing extracellular vehicles (EVs) as a novel therapeutic approach for ALS using differentiated NSC-34 cells as a surrogate for neurons. Neuron derived-large EVs (lEVs) but not small EVs (sEVs) contained mitochondria. However, we observed increased cell viability and oxygen consumption rates in heat-stressed neurons treated with both sEVs and lEVs suggesting improved mitochondrial function in recipient neurons. The increased oxygen consumption rates in sEV-treated heat-stressed neurons was accompanied by a greater proton leak compared to lEV treatment. The greater proton leak observed with sEVs likely suggests a lower efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation compared to that achieved by cells treated with mitochondria-containing lEVs. These findings suggest that mitochondrial components present in sEVs, such as proteins and mitochondrial DNA, may too contribute to improving cellular respiration. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that lEV mitochondria are transported into the lumbar spinal cord motor neurons following intramuscular injection in C57BL/6 mice in a EV dose-dependent manner. Collectively, for the first time, we have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of neuronal EVs in recipient heat-stressed neurons and the delivery of lEV mitochondria to spinal cord motor neurons in vivo without any EV surface modifications for neuronal targeting. Further studies will determine the therapeutic efficacy of mitochondria-containing EVs in the SOD1G93A transgenic mouse model of ALS.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Y.; Ghilini, F.; Prieto, E. D.; Diaz, C.; Schilardi, P.

The resulting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are further exacerbated by rising antimicrobial resistance, underscoring the urgent need for strategies that both prevent biofilm formation and reduce reliance on antibiotics. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a widely used material in medical tubing, is highly prone to bacterial attachment, making it a critical target for intervention. Here, we show that complete eradication of Staphylococcus aureus, both sessile on PVC and planktonic, can be achieved using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) amyloid-like coating in combination with vancomycin at a dose eight times lower than the MIC. While the amyloid film alone markedly reduces bacterial adhesion, the residual bacterial load still reaches infection-risk thresholds. This dual approach therefore not only prevents biofilm development but also significantly lowers antibiotic requirements, reducing the risk of resistance emergence and improving therapeutic safety. The coatings, deposited on PVC and on glass (as a model surface), were synthesized using dithiothreitol (DTT) as a reducing agent, as alternative to tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Through optimization of the synthesis, the resulting films preserved their physicochemical and anti-biofouling properties while offering a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach. The coatings strongly adhere to both substrates, remain stable under aqueous and mechanical stress, and effectively suppress bacterial and mammalian cell adhesion without cytotoxicity. These properties are clinically relevant, reducing infection risk and mitigating tubing failure due to fibrous capsule formation, encasement, or crystallized biofilm-induced blockage. The demonstrated biocompatibility, robustness, and scalability of this coating platform underscore its translational potential as a clinically relevant strategy to mitigate HAIs, extend the functional lifetime of medical tubing, and alleviate the global burden of antimicrobial resistance.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

The biological functions of condensates are attributed to a variety of physical properties, including viscoelasticity, interfacial tension and saturation concentration. Comprehensive understanding of biological functions of protein condensates and the corresponding sequence encoding requires unified interpretation of the diverse physical properties by a single model. Here we report the diversified physical properties of condensate and the interactions between constituent IDPs can be interpreted on the basis of higher-order residue interactions. These findings are based on s-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of three homogeneous IDP condensates (FUS PLD, ARF6 PLD, LAF-1 RGG) combined with the reported simulation trajectories of two heterogeneous condensates. In all interacting IDPs, there are residue interactions between finite motifs (3~5 residues) that organize in a highly cooperative way: residues form multivalent interactions and their remaking is localized. The sequence features of higher-order interactions (HOIs) are identified: tyrosine, arginine, glutamine and aspartic acid are essential, and their consecutive sequence position is also important. The interaction between corresponding motifs is highly sustained and dominates the cohesive energy of IDP. IDP condensate can be modeled as a HOI-crosslinked network.

Although the FLOT regimen (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) represents the current standard for perioperative chemotherapy, its systemic effects on the tumor microenvironment, including the associated bacterial microbiome and host gene expression, remain poorly understood. Methods: This study investigated the effects of FLOT on the functional and ecological structure of intestinal and diffuse subtype gastric tumors by assessing its simultaneous influence on the human transcriptome, the bacterial transcriptome, and inter-kingdom interactions. We analyzed 55 tumor samples (37 intestinal subtype; 18 diffuse subtype) and explored potential genetic-functional interactions between the bacterial microbiome and the human genome. Results: The results reveal a highly specific functional pattern in the diffuse subtype, absent in the intestinal subtype, demonstrating a unique ecological-transcriptional plasticity mediated by the microbiota under chemotherapeutic pressure. The interaction network was dominated by high-magnitude positive correlations. Notably, the bacterial gene leuS showed a robust association with the human gene HCN1 and processes such as potassium ion transmembrane transport, membrane depolarization, and regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential, indicating a coordinated activation of ion channels and neuroepithelial circuits. Bacterial species including Bacteroides uniformis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Butyrivibrio crossotus, Prevotella copri, and Simiaoa sunii also converged functionally on HCN1. Additionally, bacterial genes mfd, nifJ, secY, rplF, and tet(Q) were associated with pathways related to cell adhesion, epithelial proliferation, membrane potential control, and synaptic transduction. Discussion: Integrative analysis reveals that the FLOT regimen acts as a systemic remodeler of the gastric tumor microenvironment, exerting distinct effects according to the histological subtype. While the intestinal subtype responds more aligned with the cytotoxic goals of chemotherapy, the diffuse subtype exhibits a functional plasticity that favors the emergence of adaptive and possibly pro-tumoral phenotypes. We propose a mechanistic model where in chemotherapy selectively reshapes the microbial ecosystem, which in turn modulates host functional circuits, directly influencing tumor behavior. These findings open perspectives for combined therapeutic strategies that include targeted modulation of the microbiome as an adjuvant to chemotherapy.

S.; Acuna-Pilarte, K.; Jones, M.; Halberg, L.; Ho, T. H.; Koh, M. Y.", "abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1 and HIF-2, are master regulators of the hypoxia response. Under ambient conditions, both are hydroxylated by the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (HIF PHDs) resulting in ubiquitination by the pVHL E3 ligase complex, leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation. During hypoxia, the HIF PHDs are inhibited, resulting in HIF- stabilization and transcriptional activation of genes involved in the adaptation to hypoxia. Previous studies have shown that the collagen PHD, P4HA1, which promotes proline hydroxylation of collagen, inhibits the HIF PHDs by modulating levels of -ketoglutarate and succinate, thus enhancing HIF-1 stability by preventing pVHL-mediate degradation. Here, we investigate the role of collagen PHDs in the regulation of HIF-1/2 in the setting of pVHL deficiency in ccRCC. We show that the collagen PHDs P4HA1 and P4HA2 are required for HIF-1 translation and HIF-2 transcription and translation independently of pVHL function, through a mechanism regulated in part by P4HA1/2-driven collagen production. Thus, we reveal a novel pVHL-independent mechanism of HIF-1/2 regulation driven by P4HA1/2 in ccRCC. Since the HIFs have been strongly implicated in ccRCC initiation and progression, our data suggests that inhibition of P4HA1/2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy in ccRCC.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

RNA-seq and clinical data from a multi-institutional cohort (n=172) were analyzed; FA and GLN pathway activities were inferred by single-sample gene-set variation analysis (ssGSEA), tumors were stratified into low, medium, and high glycolysis, and associations were quantified at pathway, enzyme-class (medium-, long-, very-long-chain), and family levels using correlation, meta-analysis, and bootstrap resampling. FA-GLN coordination varied with glycolysis: membrane-focused families (glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids) coupled most strongly to GLN in low glycolysis tumors; coupling shifted toward very-long-chain FA enzymes in medium glycolysis; and weakened in high glycolysis. Family-level contrasts confirmed weaker glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid coupling in high versus low glycolysis. Survival analyses suggested state and chain-length-specific trends.

The species was described based on its unique antler morphology, but the variable nature of that trait and the species near absence in the fossil record leads to uncertainty concerning its systematic relationships. We used ancient DNA to clarify the taxonomic relationship and evolutionary history of T. hypogaeus. We performed mitochondrial and whole genome analyses with related cervids and showed that ROMM75974 has a close affinity, but relatively high divergence from the Odocoileus sister species. While some ambiguity remains, ROMM75974 could represent a distinct Odocoileus species to be included in the list of extinct North American taxa.

A.; Pardi, M.; DeSantis, L. R. G.", "abstract": "Proboscideans, including mammoths, played a crucial role in past herbivore communities, where resource partitioning helped reduce competition and promote coexistence. Stable carbon isotopes are frequently employed to differentiate between the consumption of C3 and C4 plants in the fossil record. However, as geographic variability influences {delta}13C values, dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is often used in tandem to infer dietary preferences among extinct taxa (e.g., the consumption of grass vs. browse). Interpreting the dietary ecology of proboscideans, like mammoths, rests on our ability to compare fossil specimens to modern taxa with known diets. Here, we established a modern reference for interpreting mammoth DMTA by analyzing teeth from 11 African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana) culled in 1993 from Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa (CITES permit certificate no. 780873). These specimens, housed at the Illinois State Museum, originated from the arid bushveld of northern KNP and were collected during the beginning of the dry season. Previous studies indicate that modern elephants in this region consume a mixed diet, consisting of ~40% grass in the dry season and 50% grass in the wet season. The well-documented dietary and environmental context of these individuals provides an opportunity to assess dental microwear patterns in a modern analog and compare individuals with known diets to extinct mammoths. Specifically, we compared newly acquired modern African bush elephants DMTA to published DMTA data from fossil specimens of Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi). Comparisons with fossil assemblages reveal few statistically significant differences in microwear between mammoth and KNP elephants, with the exception of mammoths from Leisey Shell Pit 1A having significantly lower complexity values than modern African bush elephants--indicative of some mammoth populations eating softer foods and/or less woody browse. Variation and breadth of DMTA from mammoths are similar to the temporally and geographically constrained population of L. africana. Despite potential time averaging in fossil assemblages, the variation in mammoth DMTA aligns with that of a geographically and temporally constrained modern population, indicating that microwear variability in fossil taxa is not necessarily greater than that observed in extant species and is consistent with the highly varied diets of modern African elephants.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While current therapies suppress inflammation, none directly restore epithelial barrier function. Importantly, in CD patients, permeability barrier healing (BH) rather than mucosal healing is associated with long-term remission and a reduced risk of disease complications. Yet BH remains an unaddressed therapeutic target in CD. Here we investigated whether pharmacologic inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) and RIPK3-mediated necroptosis, two convergent pathways of epithelial injury, can promote epithelial viability, regeneration, and barrier integrity in CD. We employed villin-1/gelsolin double knockout (DKO) mice with epithelial-intrinsic ISR activation TNF{Delta}ARE/+ mice with chronic inflammation, and CD patient-derived enteroids (PDEs). Animals and PDE were treated with ISR inhibitor ISRIB, RIPK3 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), or FDA-approved cancer drugs pazopanib and ponatinib, repurposed as potent RIPK3 inhibitors. Epithelial survival, regenerative growth (enteroid formation, budding), and barrier function (transepithelial electrical resistance, TEER) were assessed. Chronic ISR activation and necroptosis were prominent in both murine models and CD PDEs, causing epithelial cell death, Paneth cell expansion, impaired enteroid survival, and regenerative failure. Pharmacologic inhibition with ISRIB, Nec-1, pazopanib, or ponatinib restored villus architecture, reduced inflammation, enhanced epithelial survival and regeneration, and significantly improved TEER. ISR activation and RIPK3-mediated necroptosis converge to drive epithelial injury and barrier dysfunction in CD.

In sheep, infection can cause reproductive failure and represents an important source of zoonotic transmission through contaminated meat. While cell-mediated immunity is the main protective mechanism, the contribution of humoral responses, particularly against individual recombinant antigens (rAGs), remains poorly characterized in ovine toxoplasmosis. Methods: We analyzed the humoral response of lambs experimentally infected with two reference strains of T. gondii (RH and Me49) using different inoculation doses. Recombinant antigens rGra4Gra7, rGra8, rRop2, rCST9, and rBCLA were tested by IgG-ELISA to evaluate their kinetics during infection. Histopathological analyses of brain tissues were performed to assess lesion severity and cyst presence. Additionally, sera from naturally infected sheep were evaluated to test diagnostic performance. Results: An early IgG response against rGra4Gra7 and rGra8 was detected, consistent with markers of acute infections. Anti-rBCLA, rRop2, and rCST9 IgG responses were associated with the chronic phase and correlated with cyst burden. Notably, stronger anti-rGra4Gra7 IgG responses tended to associate with lower lesion scores, suggesting a potential protective role. In naturally infected sheep, IgG-ELISA against rGra4Gra7 and rGra8 demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance, outperforming total lysate antigen (TLA)-based assays. Conclusion: Our findings highlight distinct kinetics of specific antibody responses against selected T. gondii antigens in sheep, suggesting their value as markers of infection stage and pathology. rGra4Gra7 and rGra8 appear particularly promising both as diagnostic candidates and for exploring mechanisms of humoral modulation in ovine toxoplasmosis.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, these sublethal effects have not been studied in insects that are of fundamental importance for human economy and well-being such as dung beetles. We exposed adult dung beetles Euoniticellus intermedius to ivermectin, a commonly used antiparasitic drug in cattle that is excreted in dung, and measured immune activity through phenoloxidase (PO) and its zymogen, prophenoloxidase (proPO), in males and females of different ages. We predicted that both ivermectin exposure and age would reduce immune activity, with the negative effect of ivermectin being more pronounced in older individuals, revealing immunosenescence. Despite PO and proPO activities decreased with age and ivermectin exposure, ivermectin effects on these immune mechanisms were constant across ages, revealing no immunosenescence caused by ivermectin. Whereas males suffered a reduction in PO and proPO with ivermectin and age, female proPO was not affected by ivermectin or age. This reveals a strategy of self-care adopted by females to prioritize immune function when facing stressful conditions.

Prior efforts have faced three recurring challenges: (a) predictive models of gene expression dynamics are often inaccurate or unavailable, (b) nonlinear dynamics and feedback in genetic circuits frequently lead to multi-stability, limiting the effectiveness of deterministic control strategies, and (c) slow biological response times make data collection for learning-based methods prohibitively time-consuming. Recent experimental advances now allow the parallel observation and manipulation of over a million individual cells, opening the door to model-free, data-driven control strategies. Here we investigate the use of Parallelized Q-Networks (PQN), a recently-developed reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn control policies for a simulated bi-stable gene regulatory network.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is widely used in domestic and captive animals, although its application in elephants has not yet been established. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of performing TTE in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), to develop a standardized procedure to optimize image quality, and to assess measurement variability. Materials and Methods Preliminary trials were conducted in ten elephants, including seven free-ranging animals in Cambodia and three captive elephants in France. These led to a standardized TTE protocol based on cooperative training and positive reinforcement. Key refinements included the exclusive use of a left parasternal approach, soaking the thoracic skin with lukewarm water before application of coupling gel, and extension of the left forelimb over a training ball to optimize access to the acoustic window. Each examination included two LV views: a long-axis view for M-mode measurements and a short-axis view for two-dimensional (2D) analysis. A total of 72 examinations were performed on 4 days on three elephants, with offline assessment of eight 2D and M-mode variables, including two indices of LV function (shortening fraction and fractional area change). A general linear model was used to determine within-day and between-day coefficients of variation. Results All examinations were successfully completed without anesthesia or restraint. Within-day and between-day variability were low for all parameters (coefficients of variation <10%), while interindividual variability was higher (5%-19.6%). Discussion LV dimensions and systolic function can be assessed in awake Asian elephants with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. Conclusions The validated TTE procedure developed here enables longitudinal cardiac monitoring in captive Asian elephants without anesthesia, providing a unique opportunity for the antemortem diagnosis of left-sided heart disease and facilitating future comparative and conservation studies in this endangered species.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Few studies have addressed the impact of environmental variables (such as substrate type or moisture content), or stressors like handling, on the development and survival of BSF as they transition from prepupae through adulthood. This study examined the effects of pupation substrate (corn cob grits, potting soil, vermiculite, wood chips, and frass), moisture content (20%, 60%, and 100%), and handling during the prepupal period (daily handling, no handling) on eclosion rate and timing, morphology (mass, head width, thorax length), and abdominal window fullness of adult BSF. Handling delayed adult emergence by over three days, reduced eclosion rates by 30.6%, reduced head width and wet mass in adult males, and reduced window fullness and head width in adult females. Frass resulted in the lowest eclosion rate (72.1 {+/-} 2.4%) while corn cob grits (82.2 {+/-} 2.3%) and wood chips (81.5 {+/-} 2.2%) had the highest. Wood chips also resulted in the highest wet and dry mass, head width, and thorax length for adult males and females. Wood chips may be the best pupation substrate for BSF as it enhances body size and has a good eclosion rate.

Experiments in multiple locations in southern Africa have shown that the odour of 3-mercapto-3-methyl-1-butanol (3M3MB), a component of leopard urine, can protect livestock from leopards, and repel spotted hyaenas. Camera-trapping for four-months at an overnight enclosure (known locally as a kraal), on a cattle ranch in Botswana, with no 3M3MB being released, yielded seven records of leopards and seven of spotted hyaenas, and one calf was killed by a leopard. Over the following 4.5 months, with 3M3MB being released, there were no records of leopards, one record of spotted hyaenas, and no losses of calves. At another ranch, after three leopards entered through a gate during a one-month control period, 3M3MB was deployed at increasing release rates, and the number of leopard records decreased to zero as the release rate increased, but then rose again after five months of continuous use. On the same ranch, when sheep and goats were fitted with collars emitting 3M3MB, losses to leopards declined from seven per month to zero for the five months that the collars were in operation. On a third Botswana ranch, leopards killed 0.6 calves per month when no 3M3MB was present and 0.2 calves per month when 3M3MB was released. The value of the livestock saved was approximately six times the cost of the repellent. At Shangani, in Zimbabwe, camera traps captured images of two leopards just outside shade-cloth kraals where 3M3MB was being released, but no livestock were attacked despite the shade cloth fence providing no physical barrier. On the same ranch, a leopard killed 4 calves in 5 days at a traditional thorn-branch kraal, 3M3MB and camera traps were deployed for the following month, during which no leopard images were captured nor calves killed. After the 3M3MB was removed, 2 calves were killed within 10 days. 3M3MB deterred spotted hyaenas from crossing a veterinary cordon fence in Botswana, and its efficacy rose with release rate.

However, the physiological mechanisms underlying REM memory processes remain relatively unclear compared to NREM memory reactivation. Here we report, in rodents, the existence of prefrontal cortical (PFC) high-frequency ripple chains in REM sleep during consolidation of recently acquired spatial memory. High-density tetrode recordings in hippocampal area CA1 and PFC reveal that, in contrast to NREM cortical ripples, REM cortical ripples occur in characteristic chains that are phase modulated by theta oscillations in phasic REM sleep, corresponding to increased CA1-PFC theta coherence and delineating periods of enhanced hippocampal-cortical communication. REM ripple chains sequentially organize sparse PFC ensemble reactivation of behavioral activity during periods of local suppression, distinct from widespread reactivation bursts during NREM ripples. REM ripple chains also selectively engage CA1 neuronal populations that shift preferred theta-phase from behavior to REM sleep. Co-reactivation of PFC and CA1 neurons during REM ripple chains was linked to CA1 activity suppression during NREM PFC ripples, and to differential changes in CA1 neuronal firing rates in sleep, suggesting REM-driven regulation of hippocampal excitability. A cortical network model incorporating the effects of acetylcholine can reproduce the distinct REM and NREM activity patterns, providing a mechanistic basis for widespread coactivity during NREM cortical ripples, compared to sparse, temporally extended reactivation on a background of local suppression during REM ripple chains.

Here, we had participants complete a Flanker task twice (social observation vs. alone) and employed mixed-effects modeling of single-trial ERPs to test if social observation impacts ERN/CRN trajectories over short (within blocks) or long (between blocks) timescales.

A total of 158 children aged 8-9 with a range of attention abilities completed 30 training sessions over 10 weeks. Compared to an expectancy-matched control group, both VR and tablet training led to significant improvements in teacher-rated inattention, performance-based attention tasks, and eye-tracking measures. While both VR and tablet versions of the intervention showed benefits on specific attention-related and academic outcomes, the VR version showed select advantages in both regards. Notably, intervention dose did not significantly moderate outcomes, suggesting that efficacy may depend more on reaching a threshold of engagement than on total duration. These findings demonstrate the utility and benefits of using each type of technology to enhance measures of cognitive and academic abilities as part of a regular school curriculum.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

M. A.; Sun, L.; Tsu, B.; Kairs, S.; Vlkolinsky, R.; Barnes, C. A.; Roberto, M.; Yates, J. R.", "abstract": "Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is a powerful method for interrogating the molecular composition of neurons, yet its application to acute brain slices has remained limited. Patch-clamp electrophysiology provides direct information on neuronal excitability, synaptic inputs, and ion channel function, making it a natural partner for SCP. However, combining these techniques introduces unique challenges: neurons must be both physiologically characterized and physically collected, and variability during retrieval from the brain slice can affect how faithfully proteomic measurements reflect in situ physiology. Here, we introduce a framework for interpreting patch-SCP outcomes that considers retrieval quality in terms of both the amount of material collected and the synaptic contents being recovered. Using a shotgun strategy in which all patched neurons were collected regardless of electrophysiological outcome, we systematically benchmarked the retrieval of pyramidal neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Capacitance measured during gigaseal-preserved retrieval correlated with protein identifications, providing a proxy for linking soma size to proteome yield. Preservation of neuronal spiking during relocation was associated with broader synaptic enrichment and recovery of transmembrane proteins. By comparison, torn or aspirated neurons produced small proteomes with poor synaptic representation and neurons with lost gigaseals or no recordings displayed variable outcomes that could still yield substantial molecular information. Together, these results establish shotgun patch-SCP as both proof-of-concept and a practical framework for linking neuronal physiology with proteomics in semi-intact circuits.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The flexible control of working memory (WM) requires prioritizing immediately task-relevant information while maintaining information with potential future relevance in a deprioritized state. Using double-serial retrocuing (DSR) with simultaneous EEG recording, we investigated how single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to right intraparietal sulcus impacts neural representations of unprioritized memory items (UMI), relative to irrelevant memory items (IMI) that are no longer needed for the trial. Twelve human participants (8 female) performed DSR plus a single-retrocue task, while spTMS was delivered during delay periods. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that spTMS restored decodability of the UMI concurrent with stimulation, and that of the IMI several timesteps later, after the evoked effects of spTMS were no longer present in the EEG signal. This effect was carried by the alpha and low-beta frequency bands. Analyses of the EEG showed two effects selective to the UMI: both the retrocue designating the UMI and spTMS produced phase shifts in the low-beta band. These results were mirrored by representational geometry analyses, which revealed larger cue-related and spTMS-related rotations of the UMI-representing subspace, compared to the prioritized subspace spTMS. These findings demonstrate that deprioritization involves active neural mechanisms distinct from the processing of the IMI, and that these are supported by low-beta oscillatory dynamics in parietal cortex. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying spTMS-triggered involuntary retrieval of the UMI is the disruption of the encoding of priority status, which may depend on oscillatory dynamics in the low-beta band.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This study reports the effects of a fusogen sealant, composed of polyethylene glycol and chitosan, in an experimental model of complete spinal cord transection in pigs. Objective: To evaluate the functional and morphological recovery of the spinal cord in an animal model of complete transection following treatment with a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate.Materials and methods: Hungarian Mangalica pigs (m = 20.0 {+/-} 2.0 kg, N = 5) underwent complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord, followed by an extended laminectomy and transpedicular fixation. In the experimental group (N = 3), a synthesized gel based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate was applied to the spinal gap; the other group (N = 2) served as a control. The postoperative period lasted 60 days and included multi-component rehabilitation. Clinical-functional status was assessed using established neurological scales. In vivo retrograde tracing of the spinal cord was performed using hydroxystilbamidine (FluoroGold). Following the experiment, immunofluorescent histology was conducted using primary antibodies to neurofilament (NF-200), a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody, and the nuclear dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The resulting morphology was examined via fluorescence and light microscopy. Results: Control animals maintained lower paraplegia, anesthesia, and pelvic dysfunction throughout the experiment. In contrast, the experimental group showed positive changes, including the return of sensation from day two. By the end of the study, all animals in this group could assume an upright posture and ambulate on all limbs. These outcomes were statistically significant. Microscopy revealed axons traversing the injury site in the experimental group, whereas control samples showed degenerative post-traumatic changes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a fusogen sealant based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate promotes significant morphofunctional recovery after complete spinal cord transection, supporting its therapeutic potential.

Among conceptual features, the target of actions (i.e. whether the action was directed at an object, a person, or the self) explained the most unique variance in EEG responses. In fMRI, we found distinct conceptual representations along the ventral, dorsal, and lateral pathways, with the target of actions specifically encoded in lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS).

Our goal was to compare hypothalamic neurons active during Wakefulness or PS rebound (PSR) and explore their potential overlap, with a focus on melanin-concentrating-hormone (MCH), Orexin (Orx), Lhx6 and a new contingent of Meis2-expressing neurons. Method: In the same TRAP2-red mouse, neurons activated during Wakefulness (4h) and PSR (2h) express TdTomato and c-Fos, respectively. Double-labelling and triple immunofluorescence with neurochemical markers were performed to characterize and quantify cell populations in hypothalamic structures. Results: Twelve hypothalamic structures showed distinct activation patterns. The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), zona incerta (ZI) and tuberal nucleus contained more activated neurons during PSR than Wakefulness, whereas the paraventricular hypothalamic (PVN) and supraoptic (SO) nuclei were predominantly activated during Wakefulness. MCH and Lhx6 neurons were mainly recruited during PSR, whereas Orx neurons were activated during both. A ventral subpopulation of MCH neurons showed higher activation during PSR than the dorsal subpopulation. Additionally, ~30% of the c-Fos+ neurons in ZI and AHA express Meis2. A similar proportion of TdTomato+ neurons positive for Meis2 were encountered in PVN and SO. Overall, ~20% of all hypothalamic neurons activated during PSR are now neurochemically identified. Conclusion: Our study identifies new neuronal populations activated during PSR in AHA and tuberal nucleus. We further get evidence that Meis2 delineates novel neuronal populations activated during PSR.

We present OpenfUS Analyzer (OfUSA), a companion software suite designed to help researchers quickly engage with fUS data and perform the full range of analyses needed to generate publication-ready results and figures without relying on additional software. OfUSA offers a versatile and modular architecture including preprocessing, recording quality assessment, signal dynamics exploration, statistical analysis and visualization. These functions are separated yet easily combined into analytic pipelines through a programming-free graphical interface. The framework can be applied across species and experimental contexts, either by registering data to anatomical atlases, as shown here for the mouse brain, or by analyzing data without atlas constraints, as illustrated in a primate dataset. This flexibility, together with its comprehensive functionality, makes OfUSA a practical solution for standardized and reproducible analysis of fUS data in both preclinical and translational research. Using OfUSA, we demonstrate the capacity to detect stimulus-evoked responses with high sensitivity, identify their spatial localization within brain networks, and quantify both their extent and temporal dynamics.

We used diffusion-weighted and functional magnetic resonance imaging from 764 participants of the Human Connectome Project and modelled individual differences in SC-FC coupling with similarity and communication measures. These measures approximate functional interactions unfolding on top of the structural connectome and were set in relation to individual variations in personality traits. Significant associations were only observed during trait-relevant tasks: for agreeableness during social cognition, and conscientiousness could be predicted from task-general coupling patterns.

However, their mechanical fragility and limited processability constrain their performance in implantable devices. Deep eutectic solvents (DES), when combined with PEDOT:PSS, form eutectogels that enable thick, soft coatings. Here, we present a PEDOT:PSS-based eutectogel incorporating choline chloride: lactic acid and GOPS, integrated into flexible thin-film electrode arrays for sciatic nerve interfacing. These implants feature an array of electrodes and a pre-formed spiral geometry to conformally wrap small-diameter nerves. Devices were fabricated using standard photolithography and reactive ion etching techniques, allowing side-by-side comparison of PEDOT:PSS/DES with conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. PEDOT:PSS/DES enabled single-layer films up to 800 nm thick, significantly greater than PEDOT:PSS, and yielding over two-fold improvements in impedance and charge injection capacity in vitro. Acute in vivo electrophysiology in rats confirmed enhanced neural recording and stimulation capabilities, with lower impedance, higher capacitance, and reduced motor activation thresholds. While PEDOT:PSS/DES more reliably elicited motor responses at lower stimulation currents, electromyogram signal amplitudes from the tibialis anterioris at matched stimulation levels were comparable between materials. These results suggest that while superior electrochemical properties improve neural interface performance, local electrode-tissue interactions remain critical.

In combination with phospholipid microspheres, also known as microbubbles, administered in the bloodstream, ultrasound energy is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target specific brain regions with millimetric precision. At the targeted area, the interaction between FUS and microbubbles increases local BBB permeability for 4 to 6 hours, with an ensuing inflammation that resolves within days to weeks. Microglia, as the resident immune cells of the brain, are triggered by FUS-BBB modulation, although the time course of this response is unclear. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize the early cellular (i.e., density, distribution, and morphology) and subcellular (i.e., ultrastructure) changes in microglial activities following FUS-BBB modulation. Methods: We targeted the hippocampi of adult mice with FUS, in the presence of intravenous microbubbles and guided by MRI, and performed analyses 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. Microglia were investigated at the population, cellular and subcellular levels, where hippocampal BBB permeability was identified by the entry of endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig)G in the parenchyma. Respective outcome measures included i) the density and distribution of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-positive (Iba)1-positive (+) cells; ii) the morphology of the soma and processes of Iba1+ cells; and iii) the quantification of microglial organelles (e.g., phagosomes) and contacts with blood vessels and synapses using chip mapping scanning electron microscopy. Results: No significant changes in baseline density and distribution of microglia were found in IgG-positive hippocampal areas at 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. By contrast, FUS-BBB modulation was associated with more elongated microglial cell bodies at both time points. The relative distribution of morphologies at 1 hour shifted toward compact shapes with stubby processes, whereas at 24 hours, shapes were bigger, with fewer processes. At the nanoscale, microglia maintained their interactions with blood vessel elements, except vessels most affected by swollen endfeet, which occurred regardless of treatment. In the parenchyma, 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, microglia reduced the frequency of contacts with pre-synaptic elements and extracellular space pockets, while showing features of increased metabolic demand and reduced lysosomal activity. Conclusion: At 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, traits of microglial surveillance activity were largely maintained, with shifts in the shape of a subset of cells, which adopted a morphology associated with injury shielding. FUS-BBB modulation also appears to temporarily modify the digestive, but not the phagocytic activity, of microglia and to reduce pre-synaptic remodeling early after treatment.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Methods: We performed mass spectrometric sequencing of big tau sequence and mapped its distribution across the human nervous system. Postmortem samples included brains from Alzheimer disease (AD), disease controls, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord from young controls, disease controls and ALS; and peripheral nerves. Big and small tau levels were also quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from young normal controls, amyloid positive and amyloid negative participants. Results: Human big tau results from the insertion of 355 amino acids in the tau protein, encoded by the exon 4a-long and not exon 4a-short. Alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 generates multiple big tau isoforms, expanding the known human tau repertoire. Total tau concentration is ~ 1000-fold higher in the brain than in PNS, where big tau rises sharply along a central-to-peripheral gradient, comprising ~ 50 % of total tau in peripheral nerves compared to only ~ 1 % in brain. CSF big tau levels remain unaltered with CSF A{beta} abnormalities in AD, unlike the small tau isoform, which increases significantly with concomitant A{beta} and cognitive abnormalities. Interpretation: Big tau exhibits a distinct distribution in the human nervous system, decoupled from the changes associated with brain-derived small tau in AD.

This perceptual misalignment has been posited as a key phenomenon in explaining our ability to accurately predict the future position of moving objects, despite the delays in neuronal processing. Our working hypothesis is that the FLE is resulting from the anticipation generated by propagation of neural activity within visual cortical retinotopical maps. According to this hypothesis, the FLE should be affected by discontinuities and anisotropies of the retinotopic map architecture. Using psychophysics we show that the FLE is strongly affected by crossing and the direction of motion in respect to retinotopic features, such as vertical and horizontal meridians and the fovea. The specificity of how early visual cortical retinotopic maps are splitted and magnified around these features led us to suggest that the FLE distortions emerge from propagation in retinotopically organized networks, particularly V1.

The vasculature is composed primarily of endothelial cells, which provide structure, form barriers, and are a source of developmental signals. We recently found that the Mediator, a multiprotein complex, which regulates transcription, was essential for proper vascular development. Here, we investigated the specific role of the Mediator tail subunit Med23 in endothelial cells. Endothelial specific knockout of Med23 in mouse embryos using Tek-Cre results in vascular anomalies, including edema, hemorrhage, and mispatterned vasculature, alongside craniofacial defects such as micrognathia and cleft palate. Neural crest cell formation and migration were normal, however, osteogenic differentiation of neural crest cells was severely impaired in the craniofacial region in Med23 mutants. Spatial transcriptomics revealed downregulated expression of key vascular and osteogenic genes, including Vegfr1 and Col1a1, with altered signaling dynamics between endothelial and osteoblast populations. Elevated HIF1 expression and reduced VEGF signaling were observed in Med23 mutants, suggesting a hypoxia-driven suppression of osteoblast maturation. Consistent with this model, pharmacological inhibition of HIF1, combined with VEGFA supplementation, rescued craniofacial ossification and extended embryonic viability. These findings reveal a critical role for Med23 in coordinating vascular patterning and intramembranous ossification and highlight distinct hypoxic and angiogenic requirements in craniofacial dermal bone versus axial and appendicular endochondral bone development. Thus, the cranial vasculature and more specifically endothelial cells, play an instructive role in neural crest cell differentiation during craniofacial development.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Megaherbivores are known to strongly influence multiple ecological processes, but their bottom-up impacts on vegetation via nutrient redistribution remain poorly understood, particularly in mesic ecosystems. Here, we investigated how woody plant communities are influenced by large nutrient inputs in the form of dung deposited by Asia's largest herbivore, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), in the tropical forests of southern India. 2. We conducted field and mesocosm experiments on woody saplings to examine three mechanisms through which dung deposition by elephants can alter plant community assembly. Specifically, we tested if elephant dung input 1) creates hotspots of plant growth, and shapes plant communities by altering 2) the negative density-dependent effects of neighborhood competition, and 3) interference competition between plant functional types differing in nutrient limitation, namely nitrogen-fixers and non-nitrogen-fixers. 3. Our findings show that dung deposition by elephants can generate fine-scale spatial differences in woody sapling communities by creating local growth hotspots and altering competitive interactions. Notably, saplings receiving dung inputs were buffered against the negative density-dependent effects of neighborhood competition. Importantly, nitrogen-limited species, i.e., non-nitrogen-fixers outcompeted nitrogen-fixers when supplied with elephant dung. These bottom-up effects on plant growth and competition can be of substantially large magnitude, as we estimated that elephants in these forests create a total of 11000 such nutrient-rich sites /km2/year, with each elephant redistributing ~130.29 kg N/year through this pathway and each site receiving 19.83 g N. Synthesis: Our findings highlight the role of nutrient redistribution by megaherbivores as an underappreciated driver of species interactions that can alter plant communities at fine scales, effects that are widely distributed across megaherbivore habitats. Such bottom-up effects of megaherbivores, along with their top-down effects, have important conservation implications and can help in restoring species interactions and spatial heterogeneity in plant communities in defaunated habitats.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to identify how the surrounding landscape and green roof characteristics influence pollinator diversity and abundance. Pollinators, such as bees, wasps, hoverflies and butterflies - were sampled using pan traps and hand netting on 25 green roofs that were categorized into three types based on functionality and vegetation structure: sedum roofs, nature roofs, and roof gardens. To assess pollinator communities, we examined species richness, abundance, and functional diversity - defined here as the range of ecological roles or traits. Roof characteristics (e.g., flower diversity, microrelief, vegetation cover, roof height, size, and age) and landscape factors (e.g. percentage of surrounding green, distance to surrounding green) were analysed in relation to these diversity metrics. We show that a continuous supply of flowers throughout the year, flower abundance and the type of green roof significantly influence pollinator diversity and abundance. Sedum roofs supported lower pollinator diversity compared to the other roof types. Furthermore, our models indicated a decrease in pollinator diversity on higher green roofs, and when honeybee hives are present, while the presence of bee hotels increased pollinator abundance. The study highlights the value of nature roofs and roof gardens, compared to sedum roofs for supporting pollinator diversity. This is linked to the importance of constant forage availability, especially in early spring, which is absent on most sedum roofs. The results from this study offer guidelines to green roof designers on how to design pollinator friendly roofs in urban areas.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This shortfall is common within conserved areas and key biodiversity areas (hereafter \"priority conservation areas\" or PCAs). We demonstrate this case in the Philippines, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, where longstanding biodiversity research and growing policy momentum support efforts to expand coverage of conserved areas. Drawing on over a century of species occurrence records made digitally accessible, we compiled and manually curated these data to assemble and analyze information on Philippine amphibians and squamate reptiles from multiple sources, assessing the spatial distribution of observed diversity in relation to PCAs. Results reveal strong spatial biases, with preserved specimens comprising the majority of records and largely shaping observed diversity patterns. Citizen-science data complement already well-sampled regions, while records from peer-reviewed literature contribute valuable documentation in poorly sampled areas. PCAs are proportionally well-sampled, although gaps and biases remain. Sampling effort and observed diversity were higher in larger PCAs, but this positive area effect diminishes with increasing topographic relief, highlighting large mountain ranges as persistent blind spots in biodiversity documentation. Notably, some areas of higher diversity occur outside established PCAs. We discuss implications of these biases and propose enabling mechanisms to improve primary biodiversity data collection. This study affirms the importance of integrating digitally accessible biodiversity data from multiple sources in revealing sampling gaps and biases, guiding future studies towards poorly sampled areas and informing conservation priorities.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Invasive species serve as natural experiments to study adaptive evolution over contemporary time scales, as their native and invasive populations are exposed to different climatic settings and hence may experience strong selection pressures. In the life cycle of plants, germination stands as a cornerstone, thus, when invasive plant species encounter new surroundings, it is primarily expected that their germination niche will adapt to align with the thermal characteristics of the environment. However, adaptive responses in germination traits, specifically in cardinal temperatures, have not been explored. The objective of this study is to compare the Amaranthus albus (tumble pigweed) germination thermal niche and ecological niche between its native and invaded ranges. Considering geographic areas and climatic conditions, populations of A. albus were gathered from both cold and warm habitats in its native range (US) and its invaded range (Israel), with populations being at least 20 km apart from each other. First, populations were grown under similar conditions in a common garden experiment until seed production. The progeny seeds produced were then subjected to a set of germination trials under gradually changing temperature regimes. Cardinal temperatures and thermal niches for each population were estimated and analyzed in relation to the local climatic conditions of their respective habitats. Finally, a germination window was calculated to characterize the germination of a population throughout the year within its habitat. The invaded range studied here represents a subset of the species native range, with the A. albus establishing in similar climatic surroundings. Similarly, the germination niche for the native range was wider than for the invaded range. Thermal differentiation is evident in both native and invaded ranges. Populations from colder habitats exhibit lower base temperatures than those from warmer ones. This association was more evident for native populations. The remarkable variability observed within the germination pattern completely disappeared in the germination window produced by those models, resulting in a similar pattern across the year for all populations. Our findings demonstrate the capability of species to adapt to new environmental conditions that may arise due to climatic changes. It emphasizes the role of cardinal temperatures, specifically the base temperature, as a potential adaptive characteristic.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

In addition to the microbes naturally found in the environment, test animals can transfer their microbiome to the surrounding media and establish bacterial communities in the exposure vessels. The interactions between the animals and the bacterial communities during the exposure can influence the animal responses to experimental factors, such as particle abundance, aggregation, and other characteristics. However, the current designs in particle ecotoxicology often overlook these interactions. In our 72-hour experiment, Daphnia magna were exposed to mixed kaolin clay and microplastics (<20-m polystyrene fragments). We aimed to assess microbial communities derived from Daphnia microbiota, focusing on particle-associated biofilms and non-adherent cells and the effects of the total suspended solids (1-10 mg/l), microplastics contribution (0-10%), dissolved organic matter (agarose; 0 and 20 mg/l), and aggregate size/topology on these communities. Furthermore, we explored the impact of bacterial diversity and community composition on Daphnia mortality and body condition using individual protein content as a proxy. We found a high similarity between bacterial communities and the Daphnia microbiome, indicating the microbiome as the source. Experimental factors had differential effects on the biofilms and non-adherent cells, with total suspended solids and agarose mainly influencing non-adherent cells at the family level (mostly upregulation) and microplastics affecting biofilms (both up- and downregulation). Aggregate size and topology were the key predictors of bacterial alpha diversity and the abundance of the affected families. Finally, the adverse effects on Daphnia were primarily driven by small aggregate size, agarose addition, and high biofilm diversity. These findings underscore the need to consider microbial components and their interactions with particles and species to comprehensively understand microplastic effects and develop ecologically relevant hazard assessment assays.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have identified a statistically significant association between long-term use of benzathine penicillin (BP) and the onset of EMAP. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. In this study, we performed an integrative in silico analysis to explore the genes modulated by BP that are expressed in ocular tissues and involved in retinal metabolic pathways. Using public databases (PubChem, GTEx, HPA, EYEDB), we identified 52 BP-responsive genes, with six (CD4, CRP, IL6, IL1R1, TAC1, TNF) directly modulated by BP and expressed in the retina. These genes are implicated in inflammation, immune response, and retinal homeostasis. Expression data show strong presence in eye and brain tissues, and several are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Network analysis revealed gene-gene and protein-protein interactions, highlighting a shared pathophysiological axis. Notably, IL6 and TNF are involved in oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chronic inflammation-hallmarks of both EMAP and atrophic AMD.

Two de novo gain-of-function mutants of GLS, S482C and H461L, were recently identified in patients with developmental delay, epilepsy, and infantile cataract. These patients exhibited high glutamate and low glutamine concentrations in the brain, suggesting that the GLS mutants have abnormal enzymology. Here, we examined the enzymatic properties of these GLS mutants and found that they exhibit a total (S482C) or partial (H461L) loss of glutamate product inhibition, lifting this restriction on glutamate accumulation. The mutant enzymes also no longer require the anionic activator phosphate to stimulate enzymatic activity or induce filament formation. Structural analysis of the S482C GAC mutant shows the mutation shifts the key catalytic residue Y466 into the catalytically competent position and disrupts a key hydrogen bond between it and the glutamate product, explaining how the S482C mutant has enzymatic activity in the absence of phosphate and is insensitive to glutamate product inhibition. These results shed new light on the mechanism of phosphate activation and glutamate product inhibition of GLS and show that loss of these enzymatic properties disrupts glutamate homeostasis in the brain and causes neurological disease.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

M.; Budin, I.", "abstract": "The yeast vacuole membrane forms ordered microdomains that facilitate micro-lipophagy under nutrient limitation. We previously found that this process involves the intracellular sorting of sphingolipids to the vacuole. While multiple vacuole protein pathways have been identified, corresponding mechanisms for lipid sorting remain undefined. Here we use a range of approaches to identify how endocytic sorting and intraluminal transport of sphingolipids contribute to the formation of vacuole domains. To visualize sphingolipid trafficking, we employed the ceramide analogue BODIPY C12-ceramide (BODIPY-Cer), which is internalized by cells and stains the vacuole. We observed that cells lacking Vps29 and Vps30, proteins involved in endosomal sorting, show altered vacuole domains and accumulate BODIPY-Cer at sites proximal to the plasma membrane. Subsequent incorporation of endocytic-derived ceramide into the vacuole is dependent on the Niemann-Pick Type C 2 protein (Npc2). Loss of Npc2 reduces domain formation and causes BODIPY-Cer to accumulate within the vacuole lumen. Both intra-vacuole trafficking of BODIPY-Cer and membrane phase separation were not dependent on Npc2's canonical receptor, Ncr1. Lipidomics of isolated vacuoles confirmed that Npc2 independently mediates sphingolipid sorting under micro-lipophagy conditions. In liposome assays, Npc2 robustly transports analogues of ceramide and inositol phosphorylceramide, a complex sphingolipid that is enriched in phase-separated vacuoles. We propose that the enlarged binding cavity of yeast Npc2 is specialized for the incorporation of sphingolipids into the vacuole membrane.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

The proposed mathematical model identifies key parameters influencing BFR at the celluar level and quantifies how biomarkers encode mechanical loading information. This model serves as an excellent starting point to understand how BFR changes over time relative to a given regimen of exogenous loading. We report that the simplest mathematical model explaining this phenomenon with reasonable accuracy is a second order linear critically-damped system with a delay time.

Typically, PGS methods apply regularization or use a clumping and thresholding (C+T) approach to handle SNP inclusion. To achieve good prediction accuracy, these approaches rely on effect size estimates from well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, this is currently not feasible for morphological shape when phenotyped as univariate traits. Here, we introduce a novel framework to enhance polygenic prediction through three key components: (1) leveraging multivariate GWAS summary statistics for improved SNP selection, (2) defining genetically informative phenotypes, and (3) benchmarking PGS methods to select the optimal model. Our approach integrates multivariate GWAS, which performs an omnibus test against all phenotypic variables jointly with increased power. Specifically, our approach leverages P values from multivariate GWAS to improve SNP selection while maintaining the effect size estimates for the univariate trait under investigation, allowing the use of current PGS tools. We evaluated our proposed method for predicting 3D nasal morphology using a dataset of 52,896 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Using the C+T method, SNP selection based on multivariate GWAS resulted in significantly improved phenotypic prediction (P = 9.74e-5) for eigen-shapes, with a mean variance explained of 3.88% (SD = 1.59%) compared to 2.02% (SD = 1.10%) using a traditional univariate approach in the test set (n = 2,896). We also tested whether heritability-optimized phenotypes were more predictable than eigen-shapes derived from principal component analysis (PCA). On average, with SNP selection based on multivariate GWAS using the C+T method, heritability-optimized phenotypes yielded greater predictive performance, with PGS scores explaining 2.72%-10.37% of phenotypic variance, compared to 1.05%-6.84% for eigen-shapes. Furthermore, benchmarking several PGS methods revealed that LDpred2 consistently achieved the best performance for predicting nasal morphology. Our results demonstrate that combining multivariate GWAS P values with optimized phenotypes and advanced PGS models leads to more accurate polygenic prediction for complex morphological traits.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Given the significant sequence and structural similarities between dMPO and hMPO, dMPO serves an ideal model for studying peroxidase functions and related pathologies. We performed saturated computational mutagenesis on dMPO, analyzing the effects of 11,191 missense mutations on its stability. Notably, the G378W mutation exhibited the greatest destabilizing effect, while the W621R, potentially pathogenic, also reduced dMPO stability. To investigate these effects in vivo, we used genome editing to generate the transgenic Drosophila with G378W, W621R, and deletion of residues 305-687. Remarkably, G378W mutants displayed significant alterations in wing morphology and reduced lifespan. RNA-seq analysis of transgenic and wild-type flies revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), as interpreted through gene ontology analysis.

However, the impact of formic acid protocols on the morphology of tissue samples has not been adequately documented. The goal of this study is to examine morphologic effects of formic acid treatment on central nervous system tissue, using mouse model brain hemisphere tissues that exhibit varying degrees of neurodegeneration as a model. This study included normal, non-diseased wild-type tissues and a 5xFAD model, which recapitulates aspects of Alzheimer Disease (AD). A model exhibiting Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), a prion disease of deer and elk, was also used to analyze the effects of formic acid on tissues with spongiform changes. Tissues from both formic acid and untreated control treatment groups were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained, and imaged microscopically. Anatomical regions were analyzed and evaluated quantitatively to determine the width, area, and structural integrity of the tissue between treatment groups. Our findings demonstrated that while formic acid has been previously reported to effectively inactivate prions, it compromised the morphology of mouse brain tissues. Furthermore, the effects of formic acid were not distributed equally between regions of the brain. Age did not play a role in the morphologic changes seen in the formic acid treatment group. Interestingly, the presence of neurodegeneration in the tissues did not appear to exacerbate the effects of morphological changes post-formic acid treatment.

This suggests that a mutation in the GLA gene is necessary to cause FD, but other factors may contribute to its clinical expression. To investigates the impact of GLA mutant protein processing on GLA activity and disease expression, 26 individuals with FD (14 males) were studied. Clinical outcomes explored included the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), the Age-Adjusting Severity Scores (AASS), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) data was available for a subset of participants. Whole cell lysates were employed to assess GLA activity and GLA protein levels. Additionally, endoglycosidase H digestion was performed on cell lysates to quantify each GLA protein form: immature 50 kDa endoplasmic reticulum form and mature 46 kDa lysosomal form. The latter was employed to calculate lysosomal GLA activity and its relationship with clinical outcomes was studied. Fabry participants exhibited more of the immature form of GLA protein (0.23 vs 0.66, p= 0.04). Female patients exhibited higher total GLA activity (19.0 vs 5.1 nmol/hr/mg), total GLA protein levels 0.13 vs 0.50 GLA/LC, p= 0.003), and 46 kDa mature lysosomal form levels than male patients (0.53 vs 0.10, p= 0.001).

The traditional approach of morphological sorting for species delimitation can be challenging due to their minute size and meticulous slide-mounting technique. Ways to accelerate their discovery are needed. We conducted the first large-scale study of Mymaridae in temperate forests, combining DNA megabarcoding and the Large-scale Integrative Taxonomy (LIT) workflow to describe their diversity. We obtained COI barcodes from 2,098 specimens and used ASAP and RESL for species delimitation. Between 42 and 114 molecular clusters were delimited. Reducing morphological validation to only 9% of the sample enabled accurate determination while limiting time and effort. We confirmed the presence of 55 species, including many potentially new to science. The LIT workflow was effective for Mymaridae, although cryptic diversity remains unresolved in some large clusters, especially in the genera Alaptus and Anagrus, where high haplotype diversity and morphological ambiguity suggest additional hidden species. DNA reference databases proved unreliable, with less than 1% correct species matches, highlighting the taxonomic gap for this group.

Molecular changes driven by SD have thus far focused on transcription and translation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of regulatory RNAs, have recently been recognized as an important player in memory research. However, it remains unclear how sleep deprivation modulates the expression of lncRNAs or their targets to lead to memory impairment. In this study, we explored the role of lncRNAs in the disruption of spatial memory caused by SD. We examined a set of synapse-associated lncRNAs that were identified through a transcriptome analysis after SD. Among them, we discovered that the lncRNA Cerox1 is downregulated in dorsal hippocampus following SD, and its levels recover after 2.5 hours of rebound sleep. Sleep is critical for the regulation of metabolism and sleep loss impairs mitochondrial function. Both sleep deprivation and Cerox1 knockdown were found to reduce complex I activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This reduction of complex I activity is linked to the decrease in expression of a subset of complex I subunits including Ndufs1, Ndufs3, Ndufa3 and Ndufs6. Overexpression of Cerox1 has the opposite effect, leading to increased complex I activity. Sleep deprivation reduced ATP levels in the dorsal hippocampus, while Cerox1 overexpression restored it. SD disrupted memory consolidation, and this impairment was rescued when Cerox1 was overexpressed. Cerox1 transcript contains multiple miRNA binding sites that regulate the activity of the lncRNA. Notably, overexpression of Cerox1 transcript lacking miRNA binding sites did not rescue the memory deficit caused by SD. Our findings demonstrated that the impairment of memory consolidation after SD is linked to lncRNA-mediated control of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity essential for sustaining energy requirements.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Hippocampus, a key hub of neural circuits for spatial learning and memory, has attracted tremendous studies. Neuronal information processing in the hippocampus can be regulated by many types of neuropeptides. Cholecystokinin (CCK), the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system which is involved in modulating neuronal functions, such as cognition, memory and neuroplasticity, is widely expressed in the hippocampus. However, whether local excitatory CCK neurons modulates hippocampal function is still unclear. In this study, we showed that CA1 pyramidal neurons receive projections from excitatory CCK neurons in area CA3 (CA3CCK neurons). Subsequently, activation of the CA1-projecting CA3CCK neurons triggers the release of CCK. Then, we found that activity of CA3CCK-CA1 neurons supports the hippocampal-dependent tasks. Furthermore, inhibition of CA3CCK-CA1 projections or knockdown of CA3CCK gene expression markedly impaired the behavioral tasks and neuroplasticity. Taken together, these results may add to a better understanding of how neuromodulators regulate the neural functions in central nervous system.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Historically, concerns around adolescent marijuana use focused on the development of psychosis later in life, however recent findings indicate that cognitive domains may also be at risk. CB1R was shown to interfere with neuronal network oscillations and to impair sensory gating and memory function. Neuronal oscillations are essential in multiple cognitive functions and their impairment was documented in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how adolescent pre-treatment with the CB1R selective agonist CP-55940 may lead to abnormalities in theta synchronization in adulthood. Rats were pre-treated with CP-55940 (n=11, 6 males, 5 females) or vehicle (n=8, 4 males, 4 females) during adolescence (daily i/p injections between PND 32-36 or PND 42-46, n=10 and 9, respectively). They were then tested in adulthood (PND 70-88, n=17 or PND 111-115, n=2) under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta rhythm was elicited by brainstem stimulation at 5 intensity levels one hour before and up to 5 hours after injection. We found a lasting significant decrease in theta power after CP-55940 in adult rats which was aggravated further in rats pre-treated in adolescence with the CB1R agonist. The effect was significantly larger (p=0.0462) in rats pre-treated during early adolescence (PND 32-36) compared to the group pre-treated during late adolescence (PND 42-46). We conclude that 1. Exposure to cannabis during adolescence leads to increased sensitivity to CB1R agonist in adulthood; 2. Early adolescence, a critical period for development of HPC networks generating theta rhythm, is particularly prone to this sensitivity.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

M.; Ngo, T.; Eminhizer, M.; Du, J.; Ramamurthy, V.", "abstract": "Photoreceptor outer segment (OS) degradation is primarily mediated by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells through daily phagocytosis of shed distal OS tips. In contrast, much less is understood about the cell-autonomous mechanisms photoreceptors use to clear mislocalized molecules caused by protein misfolding or trafficking defects. Mislocalized or excess rhodopsin that fails to reach the OS is retained in the inner segment or cell body, where it is presumably degraded via the endolysosomal system. We identify PIKfyve, a phosphoinositide kinase that generates PI(3,5)P2, as a key regulator of this pathway. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), we find that PIKfyve is highly expressed in rod photoreceptors. Rod-specific PIKfyve deletion causes progressive retinal degeneration, marked by inner segment vacuolation, elevated LAMP1/2, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and eventual loss of rod and cone function. Loss of one copy of PIKfyve in rod photoreceptors accelerates degeneration in P23H rhodopsin mutant mice. In RPE cells, PIKfyve loss disrupts phagocytosis and autophagy, leading to accumulation of rhodopsin, LAMP1, LC3A/B, and lipid droplets, along with metabolic disturbances. These findings demonstrate that PIKfyve is essential for photoreceptor and RPE health by regulating lysosomal function, phagocytosis, autophagy, and metabolism, and suggest that enhancing PIKfyve activity could be a therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Competing motivational drives are integral to survival and encompass a spectrum of internal physiological needs such as hunger to external goals like social connection. Elucidating how these motivational states interact at the neural level is critical to our understanding of adaptive behavior. Hunger-driven behaviors are primarily initiated by agouti-related peptide (AgRP), an inverse agonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which acts to promote feeding by suppressing MC4R signaling. MC4R is present in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain region involved in pain, appetite, and social behavior. A pilot study found a dense concentration of AgRP fibers in the PAG of male rats, suggesting a potential link between hunger-related signaling and social behavior in this region. To investigate the role of AgRP and MC4R in the PAG on social interaction, we conducted a within-subject dose-response experiment using male rats. Subjects received bilateral microinjections (0.5 L/side) of either vehicle, an MC4R agonist (THIQ), or an antagonist (HS014) into the PAG prior to a five-minute social exploration (SE) test with a novel juvenile conspecific. Contrary to our hypothesis, pharmacological manipulation of MC4R activity in the PAG did not produce significant changes in social interaction time, suggesting that MC4R in the PAG may not directly play a major role in modulating social behavior in rodents. These results highlight the complexity of the neural circuitry involved in social motivation, hunger, and other competing motivational states.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This study employs the same awake mouse model combined with electrophysiology recordings in key network nodes, cell-specific calcium imaging in the lateral septum, and neurotransmitter sensing in one of the major subcortical cholinergic systems, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM).

Almost all the studies on autism have focused on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis and its associated cannabinoids. In this study the potential therapeutic efficacy of cannflavin B, a related, yet non-psychoactive component of the Cannabis sativa plant, was evaluated. Using prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure in rats, a model that has been widely used to study aspects of autism, we showed that cannflavin B was anxiolytic in the female VPA rats, and normalized sociality in VPA animals of both sexes. When neuronal oscillatory activity was examined, in female VPA rats cannflavin B normalized alterations in low frequency power within the cingulate cortex (Cg), and theta-gamma cross frequency coupling between the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In male VPA animals, cannflavin B induced frequency-specific alterations in power within the PFC, Cg, and dHIP and ameliorated the VPA-induced suppression of oscillatory coherence between all three regions. In each brain region, cannflavin B also attenuated the sex-specific VPA-induced elevations in microglia. In vitro, cannflavin B normalized VPA-induced elevations in cortical and HIP neuronal activity and promoted more organized cortical firing. These findings demonstrate cannflavin B normalizes behavioural and neuronal systems function alterations induced by prenatal VPA in rats.

The study of this dynamics has gained momentum since the development of pulse-chase methods, in which cellular components are labeled with isotopic or fluorescent tracers to assess properties such as turnover rates or half-lives. Standard analyses, however, often rely on simplifications such as that molecules represent a homogeneous and immediately labeled population, which does not always hold true. Here, we present a rigorous analytical framework that refocuses the interpretation of dynamic labeling experiments toward the distribution of metabolic ages, defined as the time molecules have spent within a cell. We demonstrate how this approach ubiquitously captures different aspects of dynamic behavior, including delayed labeling and complex degradation patterns, and is less prone to biased interpretations. We further introduce a general compartmental modeling approach to quantify metabolic age distributions and to test hypotheses about the organization of metabolic networks and show that metabolic ages can be quantified by dynamic labeling requiring minimal assumptions. The utility of this framework is demonstrated by quantifying metabolic ages and determining the kinetic pool structure of budding yeast proteins at optimal and suboptimal growth temperatures, revealing, for example, distinct kinetic populations of ribosomal proteins. In addition, based on the previously published data on nuclear pore complex assembly, we exemplify how age interpretation of dynamic labeling can enable characterizing the order and time scale of the cellular processes.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Solid-state PCFs were constructed by entrapping Synechocystis sp.

Two distinct formulations were tested: (i) Ca2+-PVA-TCNF, in which TCNF was crosslinked with Ca2+ and polyvinyl alcohol to produce hydrogel films approximately 200m thick; and (ii) an all-polysaccharide-based Ca2+-MLG-TCNF formulation, in which TCNF was crosslinked with Ca2+ and mixed-linkage glucan. The latter films were fabricated using an osmotic dehydration approach, yielding mechanically robust, fully biodegradable structures with a thickness of approximately 2mm. The integration of engineered cells with TCNF matrices created a biocatalytic system that improved the distribution of light, nutrients, and substrates to the cells, while facilitating ethylene separation, thereby supporting the fitness of immobilized cells and enhancing their metabolic performance. Using a custom-designed photobiofilm reactor optimized for semi-wet cultivation, the solid-state PCFs sustained ethylene production for over four months, representing the longest reported continuous ethylene production by cyanobacteria to date. Notably, the solid-state PCFs achieved up to a twofold increase in ethylene yield compared to the continuous-flow suspension culture. Importantly, the suspension-based system also represented the first demonstration of four-month ethylene production under continuous-flow operation. In addition, biodegradability assessments confirmed the environmental compatibility of the TCNF-based matrices, with the all-polysaccharide formulation being particularly advantageous due to its exclusively nature-based composition.

Each parasite expresses just one VSG at a time, but within a host, many VSGs can be expressed simultaneously. VSGSeq is an amplicon sequencing approach that enables surveillance of the population-wide diversity and abundance of expressed VSGs. vsgseq2 is an updated bioinformatics pipeline that enhances the reproducibility, accuracy, and efficiency of VSGseq analysis, utilising publicly available analytical tools.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a pan-cancer analysis of 484 genes encoding RHO GTPases, regulators, proximal effectors, distal downstream signaling elements, and components of their proximal interactomes using data from over 10,000 tumor samples and 33 tumor types present in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition, we have utilized available data from genome-wide functional dependency screens performed in more than 1,000 gene-edited cancer cell lines. This study has uncovered positively selected mutations in both well-known and previously uncharacterized RHO pathway genes. Transcriptomic profiling reveals widespread and tumor-specific differential expression patterns, some of them correlating with copy number changes. Interestingly, certain regulators exhibit consistent expression profiles across tumors opposite to those predicted from their canonical roles. Coexpression and gene set enrichment analyses highlight coordinated transcriptional programs involving some RHO GTPase pathway genes and their linkage to key cancer hallmarks, including extracellular matrix reorganization, cell motility, cell cycle progression, cell survival, and immune modulation. Functional screens further identify context-specific dependencies on several deregulated RHO GTPase pathway genes.

Movie-trained ViV1T accurately captured core V1 properties, including orientation and direction selectivity as well as contextual modulation, despite lacking explicit feedback mechanisms. The model also revealed a new subpopulation of neurons that switched its response to iso-oriented surround stimuli from inhibition to excitation between high and low contrasts. Additionally, novel dynamic ViV1T-generated surround stimuli elicited stronger modulatory effects than static images and traditional gratings. We confirmed these predictions through semi-closed-loop in vivo recordings.

LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD), a severe congenital disorder caused by loss of laminin-2, presents both hurdles: the LAMA2 gene exceeds AAV capacity, and severely affected patients do not produce the native protein. Here, we developed an AAV-based therapy using two engineered linker proteins derived from endogenously expressed components. These linker proteins restore laminin receptor binding and polymerization, enabling reassembly of a functional basement membrane. Dual AAV delivery of the linkers in a severe LAMA2 MD mouse model resulted in robust expression and significant improvements in muscle histology and function. Employing myotropic capsids enabled therapeutic efficacy at lower vector doses. However, muscle-specific targeting unmasked a LAMA2-related peripheral neuropathy. To address this, we expressed one linker under a muscle-specific promoter and the other under a ubiquitous promoter, delivered via AAV9 or AAV8. This approach achieved near-complete phenotypic restoration when administered neonatally and provided significant benefit when given at progressed disease stages. Our strategy offers a mutation-independent, size-compatible, and potentially immune-tolerable treatment for LAMA2 MD with broad clinical potential.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Beyond their role synchronizing neuronal activity, they also support complex computations such as coincidence detection, a circuit mechanism in which differences in input timing are encoded by the firing rates of coupled neurons, enabling preferential responses to synchronous over temporally dispersed inputs. Electrical coupling allows each neuron to act as a current sink for its partner during independent depolarizations, thereby reducing excitability. In contrast, synchronous inputs across the network minimize voltage differences through gap junctions, reducing current shunting and increasing spiking probability. However, the contribution of intrinsic neuronal properties to coincidence detection remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this issue in the Mesencephalic Trigeminal (MesV) Nucleus of mice, a structure composed of somatically-coupled neurons. Using whole-cell recordings and pharmacological tools, we examined the role of the D-type K+ current (ID), finding that it critically shapes both the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of MesV neurons and the dynamics of electrical synaptic transmission. Its fast activation kinetics and subthreshold voltage range of activation make ID a key determinant of transmission strength and timing. Furthermore, the ID, likely mediated by Kv1 subunits, is expressed at the soma and the axon initial segment. Finally, we characterized two key parameters of coincidence detection, precision (time window for effective input summation) and gain (differential response to coincident versus dispersed inputs), finding that ID enhances precision by accelerating membrane repolarization and reduces the gain by limiting neuronal excitability.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the HTT C-terminal domain remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to generate and validate novel monoclonal antibodies targeting the HTT C-terminal HEAT containing domain to better detect HTT independently of potential effects of polyglutamine length that can impact some N-terminally targeted antibodies. METHODS: We immunized mice with a highly purified, well characterized recombinant protein corresponding to the HTT C-terminal domain. We generated monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell lines and characterized the antibodies using parental and HTT-knockout cell lines in common immuno-applications. RESULTS: Three novel, independent hybridoma lines producing anti-HTT monoclonal antibodies were derived. Using CRISPR-edited HTT knockout cell lines we identified one clone, anti-HTT [2F8], that was specific and effective across Western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays. All antibodies bound full-length HTT irrespective of HAP40 interaction or polyQ length and showed no cross-reactivity to the N-terminal HEAT domain. CONCLUSIONS: These C-terminal HTT mAbs are thus valuable additional tools for studying endogenous HTT function in both normal and disease contexts.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

D. Y.", "abstract": "Aging disrupts brain network integration and is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and neurological diseases, yet the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. Most previous studies have utilized cross-sectional or acute approaches, limiting insights into the longitudinal dynamics of the neural network. In this study, we chronically recorded laminar electrophysiological activity in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal CA1 region of young (2-month-old) and aged (13-month-old) mice over 16 weeks. This approach allowed us to directly assess how aging modulates functional connectivity within hierarchically connected cortical and hippocampal circuits. We found that single-unit spiking activity and the signal-to-noise ratio were largely preserved in aged versus young mice, suggesting intact neuronal firing properties. However, aged mice showed global reductions in local field potential (LFP) power and a selective decrease in coherence across delta, alpha-beta, and gamma frequency bands within and between cortical layers and V1-CA1 pathways, while phase amplitude coupling remained unaffected. Interestingly, population level excitatory activity in CA1 was increased in aged animals. These findings indicate that aging selectively impairs network-level synchrony and temporal coordination in specific frequency bands and regions, with minimal loss of single-neuron function. Our results highlight the necessity of longitudinal, multi-region measurements to uncover the multi-scale vulnerabilities of the aging brain. Understanding the depth- and region-dependent circuit changes will guide strategies to preserve cortical-hippocampal communication and cognitive function in aging, as well as enhance neural interface technologies for older populations.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

However, the causality and regulatory mechanisms for most of these STRs remains unknown. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable testing the regulatory activity of a large number of synthesized variants, but have not been applied to STRs due to experimental and computational challenges. Here, we optimized an MPRA framework based on random barcoding to study the impact of variation in repeat copy number on expression. We first performed an MPRA on sequences derived from 30,516 promoter-proximal STR loci along with up to 152bp of genomic context, testing 3-4 variants with differing repeat copy numbers for each locus in HEK293T cells. We identified 1,366 loci with significant associations between repeat copy number and expression, which were enriched for positive effect sizes (P=2.08e-110). We then designed a second MPRA in which we performed deeper perturbations, including systematic manipulation of the repeat unit sequence, orientation, and copy number, with 200-300 perturbations for each of the 300 loci with the strongest signals. Our results revealed that the repeat unit sequence is the primary driver of differences in the relationship between copy number and expression across loci, whereas orientation and flanking sequence have weaker effects, primarily for AT-rich repeat units. The high resolution of these perturbations enabled us to detect non-linear effects, most notably for AAAC/GTTT repeats, which emerge only beyond a certain copy number threshold. Finally, we observed that a subset of STRs in our library show expression levels that are tightly linked with predicted DNA secondary structure formation. We repeated our perturbation MPRA in HeLa S3 cells under wildtype and RNase H1 knockdown conditions, which, via reduction in RNase H1 activity, are expected to hinder resolution of R-loops. This demonstrated that associations between copy number and expression at G-quadruplex-forming CCCCG/CGGGG repeats are particularly sensitive to loss of RNase H1, providing support for an R-loop mediated mechanism for these repeats. Altogether, we establish STRs as a critical component of the non-coding regulatory grammar and provide a framework for understanding how this dynamic form of genetic variation shapes gene expression.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

HepG2 and HUH7 cell lines were exposed to CLEC and glucose for 24 weeks, mimicking a chronic heavy metal exposure paradigm seen in normal and type II diabetic individuals. We observe that CLEC exposures significantly affect the long-term health of mitochondria, including decreased mitochondrial mass, increased superoxide production, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in a CLEC and glucose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the Seahorse MitoStress assay revealed CLEC induced significant chronic oxidative stress. In particular, CLEC cells showed altered levels of basal and non-mitochondrial respiration, causing dysregulation in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCRs). Lastly, we identified significant impacts of CLEC and glucose exposures on the mitochondrial dynamics (fission/fusion) of the CLEC cells, which showed enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation and turnover rates. We also identified novel cell compensatory mechanisms that may mask the true extent of chronic Cd exposure induced damage in liver cells. CLEC and glucose work additively to damage hepatocellular mitochondrial function.

Methods: In total, 607 RGM clinical isolates, representing 32 species or complexes, collected between 2019 and 2023 in Japan were examined. To detect the presence of erm(55)-carrying plasmids, we conducted PCR screening, minimum inhibitory concentration testing for clarithromycin, and whole-plasmid genome sequencing. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to characterise the plasmids. Results: Among the 607 RGM isolates, 0.8% (5/607) possessed the plasmid with the erm(55) gene and exhibited inducible macrolide resistance, with ratios of 100% (1/1) in Mycobacterium murale, 50% (3/6) in M. obuense, and 0.8% (1/125) in M. chelonae.

This stress can reduce growth, leaf area, and stomatal conductance (Ks), and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, exploring solutions to enhance drought tolerance is crucial. This study aimed to evaluate the use of fungal root endophytes from Stenocereus spp. to induce drought tolerance in T. cacao genotype ICS95. In vitro drought tolerance screening identified five fungal isolates that exhibited the highest biomass production and less than 20% biomass loss under drought compared to non-drought conditions. The soil of juvenile T. cacao plants was inoculated with these isolates, and physiological and morphological parameters were assessed, including leaf water potential ({Psi}L), stomatal conductance (Ks), proline content, and growth. The results showed a significant decrease in {Psi}L and Ks in juveniles under drought stress, which was observed across all five fungal isolates tested. However, juveniles inoculated with Phoma sp. exhibited less negative {Psi}L and lower Ks than non-inoculated controls, suggesting that this fungus may be a potential inducer of drought tolerance in T. cacao ICS95. One intriguing result was that plants inoculated with this fungus accumulated less proline during the drought treatment. Under non-drought conditions, juveniles inoculated with Acrophialophora sp., Ectophoma sp., Fusarium sp., and Phoma sp. exhibited an increase in mean leaf area. These findings suggest that fungal endophytes associated with Stenocereus spp. could provide a potential alternative for alleviating drought stress and may also mediate growth promotion under non-drought conditions in cacao.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This involves exploring the potential of beneficial bacteria, such as Actinobacteria, known for producing diverse secondary metabolites with medicinal applications. In a previous study, 422 Actinobacteria were successfully isolated from Lombok, Bali, and Enggano Islands in Indonesia, and subjected to various bioactivity tests. Notably, Isolate DHE 6-7 from Enggano Island showed promising poten- tial as a drug candidate. This study aimed to evaluate anticancer activity of DHE 6-7 isolates in T47D breast cancer cell lines and pinpoint the key metabo- lite contributing to its anticancer activity. The secondary metabolites from the DHE 6-7 culture were extracted using ethyl acetate by liquid-liquid extraction and its bioactive compound was analysed using thin layer chromatography. Sub- sequently, the extract underwent cytotoxic and antiproliferative assays in T47D cells. While Actinomycin-D was previously identified as a major bioactive com- pound in methanolic extract of DHE 6-7 isolate, this study confirmed that ethyl acetate extraction was able to retain the Actinomycin-D content from DHE 6-7 isolate. Interestingly however, the ethyl acetate extract of DHE 6-7 (EAE of DHE 6-7) showed superior cytotoxic activity in T47D cells compared to actinomycin-D alone. This may suggest the contribution of additional secondary metabolites in the EAE of DHE 6-7 to its anticancer activity. Notably, the combination of the EAE of DHE 6-7 isolate and 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) exhibited a synergistic effect, indicating the potential use of these compound(s) as a co-chemotherapeutic agent.

Here we study the neutralising epitopes on WIV-1 Spike of three mAbs that confer broad sarbecovirues and SARS-CoV-2 variant neutralisation, including XEC and JN.1. mAb V1WT_06 binds a highly conserved RBD site V epitope that is mediated by the heavy chain alone. V1WT_06 contact residues are highly conserved in circulating viruses suggesting that the epitope is evolutionarily and functionally constrained. mAbs V1WT_41 and VA14_26 bind overlapping RBD class 4 epitopes with differing angles of approach that impact on the degree of ACE2 competition. We show that neutralisation by these mAbs is maintained when virus entry is via Japanese horseshoe bat and Halcyon horseshoe bat ACE2. These mAbs are ideal candidates for therapeutic antibody development and inform the rational design of pan-coronavirus vaccines.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we apply an integrative approach that includes data collection, curation, bioinformatics analyses and state-of-the-art structure prediction methods to fill these gaps. We define the optimal binding preference of tandemly arranged SH3 domains as [PAVIL]PPR[PR][^DE][^DE], and propose potential new instances of this SLiM among the family members and their binding partners. Structure predictions suggest the possibility of a novel, reverse binding mode for certain motif instances. A search of the human proteome with the sequence signatures of SH3 tandemization and follow-up structure analyses suggest that SH3 tandemization could be specific for this family.

However, little remained known concerning the peculiarities of the reaction of RPs ADP-ribosylation itself. Here, we study ADP-ribosylation of human RPs within the large (60S) and small (40S) ribosomal subunits and those isolated from the subunits, with PARP1 and PARP2 in vitro using radioactively labeled NAD+. We fail to detect the modification of ribosome-bound RPs but observed ADP-ribosylation of certain ribosome-free RPs when we use total protein isolated from the subunits. RPs from the 60S subunit were globally more modified than those from the 40S subunit, and ADP-ribosylation of several 60S RPs (but not 40S) was considerably enhanced in the presence of histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1). With all kind RPs, HPF1 switches the modification preferentially to their serine/tyrosine residues. Major targets of the 60S RPs ADP-ribosylation were identified as RPL4 (uL4), RPL6 (eL6) and RPL13A/RPL15 (uL13/eL15). The modification levels of particular RPs differently depend on the concentration of total RP; the most selective HPF1-dependent ADP-ribosylation occurs in RPL6 (eL6). When present simultaneously with histones, RPs win linker histone H1 in the competition for both PARPs; in contrast, core histones strongly compete with RPs for ADP-ribosylation.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined four cryo-EM structures of OXGR1 bound to -ketoglutarate (AKG), itaconate (ITA), and structural related succinate (SUC) and maleate (MA). These structures reveal a positively charged binding pocket and an extensive hydrogen-bond network critical for OXGR1 recognizing dicarboxylic acids. In addition, we identify a distinct arrangement of hydrophobic residues that modulates ligand potency and selectivity. Mutational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that non-canonical micro-switch motifs, including FRY and NLxxY, are essential for ligand recognition and receptor activation. Comparative structural and evolutionary analyses indicate that these mechanisms are conserved across species, underscoring the critical role of OXGR1 in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

Existing approaches depend on double-strand DNA breaks, which can lead to unintended genome alterations. Many monogenic diseases arise from diverse patient-specific mutations, making individualized correction impractical and underscoring the need for universal full-gene replacement strategies. We developed INsertion by Targeted Anchoring and Conditional Transposition (INTACT) to enable targeted insertion at genomic safe harbor loci. We engineered a mammalian transposase with mutations in its DNA-binding domain to reduce off-target integration. Site specificity was then restored by linking programmable sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to the transposase. Systematic optimization of INTACT revealed key determinants of precision, including non-covalent linkage between the transposase and DNA-binding protein, strict spacing between the binding site and the TTAA insertion sequence, and linkage of the DNA-binding protein to an internal position within the transposase. On-target insertion was achieved across multiple loci, with optimized INTACT averaging 1.2 targeted insertions per cell. An off-target assay confirmed that DNA-binding domain mutations substantially reduced unwanted integration events to near-background levels.

The colonisation success of herbivorous pests depends mostly on the abundance of vegetal resource across the newly invaded territory. The explicit spatial representation of plant distribution offers a cost-effective approach to anticipate the spread of herbivorous insects over areas with fragmented and heterogeneous vegetal populations. In this article, we focus on the case of the recent invasion of chestnut trees (Castanea sativa) of the French Eastern Pyrenees by its most virulent pest, the gall-forming parasite Dryocosmus kuriphilus. Using tools from graph theory and available public data on the mesh size and distribution of chestnut trees, we model the spatial distribution of the pest resource across natural forests. In this framework, a graph provides a mapping of 1 km2 quadrats that constitute the territory. Quadrats are grouped to form communities, which are areas with homogeneous chestnut tree distribution, and in which the risk of parasite infestation and propagation is similar. Graph traversal algorithms then measure the vulnerability and the dangerousness of each patch, defined as their susceptibility to become infected and to contribute to the pest propagation. Such a spatial assessment of the invasion risk provides unique insights into potential propagation scenarios, improving the early detection and spread monitoring of these insect invaders.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Case-only analysis has been proposed to improve power for GxE detection. However, case-only analysis relies on key assumptions, including correct specification of the disease risk model and marginal independence between genetic and environmental variables. In this study, we systematically investigate the challenges of case-only analysis using polygenic risk scores (PRS) as genetic variables in large biobanks. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the false positive control of PRS-based case-only analysis depends on the log-linear disease risk model and weak main effects, and that it is prone to false positives under other commonly used disease risk models. We then conduct case-only analyses for breast cancer, prostate cancer, class 3 obesity, and short stature in the UK Biobank, using PRS derived from non-overlapping chromosome sets (e.g., even-numbered and odd-numbered chromosomes) that are unlikely to interact with each other. The resulting case-only regression estimates consistently show negative shifts compared to population-based estimates, suggesting false positives driven by collider bias due to model misspecification. Furthermore, correlations between chromosome set-specific PRS, likely driven by assortative mating or population stratification, suggest additional sources of confounding. Our results underscore the challenges of applying PRS-based case-only analysis in large biobank settings and highlight the need for caution when interpreting case-only results.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

It is widely accepted that small ORFs are rarely conserved across distant taxa, particularly in deeply rooted ancestors. Growing evidence supports their biological relevance and potential roles in gene innovation. Here, we integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets to identify and characterize 454 putative small ORFs in Tribolium castaneum. Conservation analyses revealed 230 small ORFs conserved within Coleoptera, 167 in insects, 85 in arthropods, 39 in eukaryotes, and six in bacteria. Conserved small ORFs displayed higher GC content (~44.87%), with bacterial-conserved sequences exceeding 50%. Functional enrichment revealed dozens of small ORFs associated with catalytic, transporter, structural, and regulatory roles. Binding site predictions indicated 254 small ORFs possess protein-protein interaction potential. Expression profiles across 14 RNA-seq libraries spanning multiple developmental stages showed 40.1% of small ORFs expressed (TPM >1) in at least one sample, and 16.5% expressed in five or more libraries. Conserved small ORFs showed broader and more stable expression, while lineage-specific ones displayed restricted expression, mostly in gonads or embryos. Isoformic and small CDSs were the most widely expressed classes. Notably, 29 small ORFs exhibited transcriptional and translational support (Swiss-Prot and/or Ribo-seq), 28 being small CDSs. A total of 390 small ORFs had potential paralogs, supporting gene duplication as a mechanism for small ORF emergence.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated. Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the 'ground truth' was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics.

Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Using K-Means clustering, four distinct conductance states, including a fully-blocked state (State 0), two intermediates (States 1 and 2), and a fully open pore (State 3) were identified. Multi-exponential kinetic analysis of state-to-state transitions was performed, and resulting lifetimes and amplitudes were correlated with molecular properties of the guest residue. Our correlation analysis of these kinetic parameters to defined molecular properties of the guest residues reveals which physical properties govern the mechanism. The fully blocked State 0 acts as a 'hydrophobic trap,' with the lifetime of entry transitions (e.g., 1[-&gt;]0) strongly predicted by side-chain hydrophobicity. Conversely, escaping this trap is a steric process governed by molecular size, though the probability of a fast escape is uniquely facilitated by aromaticity, suggesting a specific ungating interaction with the pore's {phi}-clamp, which is consistent with clamp site dilation. Rearrangements between partially blocked states are also dominated by hydrophobicity, reflecting the side chain exploring different contacts within the pore. Final dissociation to open nanopore is a multi-pathway process where the dominant physical force depends on the starting state: escape from deeper states is an energetic battle against hydrophobicity and aromaticity, while escape from shallower states presents a final steric hurdle. Overall, this work dissects the peptide translocation process, demonstrating how distinct physical forces--hydrophobicity, sterics, and aromaticity--govern specific, sequential steps of intra-pore dynamics and release, providing a detailed energy landscape for peptide-nanopore interactions.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Custom 3D-printed stamps were designed to produce circular, square, and triangular microwells with equal cross-sectional area. Time-lapse imaging and AI-based segmentation were employed to track the evolution of spheroid morphology, with circularity and projected area used as quantitative indicators of compaction dynamics. We show that the compaction process follows predictable exponential trends in both parameters, with mesenchymal spheroids (from human dermal fibroblasts line HDF) compacting faster than epithelial spheroids (from ARPE-19 cells). Spheroid rounding was simulated as a visco-capillary-driven process with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model using the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method in OpenFOAM. The visco-capillary velocity extracted from both experimental and simulation data served as a unifying parameter that explained differences in compaction kinetics. Using additional mechanical measurements (AFM and compression), we estimated surface tension and effective viscosity, confirming that surface tension differences predominantly drive the observed kinetics. Pharmacological treatments modulating cytoskeletal tension revealed that contractility inhibition significantly modified spheroid formation dynamics, allowing acquisition of non-spherical cell aggregates.

Our method preserves cell viability, and achieves 50x higher functionalization efficiency than previous methods with a standardized protocol applicable to any azide-containing molecule. Applications of the method show reproducible and tunable phenotypic outcomes at the single-cell level: fluorophore labeling yielded adjustable fluorescence, beta-lactamase conferred scalable antibiotic resistance, and DNA coatings modulated adhesion and aggregation. This platform provides quantitative, non-genetic control over microbial phenotypes and complements genetic engineering approaches.

Here, we performed transcriptomics analyses of peripheral neutrophils exposed to an inflammatory stimulus, comparing responses of neutrophils obtained from FM patients versus healthy controls. We observed a state of inflammation in neutrophils from FM patients. However, FM neutrophils were unable to efficiently respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This impairment was especially characteristic of FM patients with no improvement after 5 years after diagnosis in comparison with those who did improve. Blood plasma from FM patients directly stimulated a wide range of primary sensory neurons in vitro and induced pain hypersensitivity when injected into mice. Further analysis identified NF-{kappa}B suppression as a key biological process associated with low grade inflammation and LPS non-responsiveness in neutrophils from FM patients. The clinically used NF-{kappa}B activator, bryostatin, alleviated hypersensitivity in mice treated with FM plasma, pointing to controlled inflammation induction through reactivation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway as a possible therapeutic target for FM treatment. Our whole blood single-cell RNA sequencing replicated this NF-{kappa}B-driven inflammation observed in bulk analyses transcriptomics in FM patients and revealed that this inflammatory signature is strongly pronounced not only in neutrophils, but across a broad range of immune cells.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

How these RNAs dynamically fold and refold in response to cellular signals remains poorly understood. Given that RNAs interact with ubiquitous RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) prone to form biomolecular condensates, we explore how protein droplets interacting along an RNA impact its folding process. Attached droplets prevent premature folding by competing with RNA:RNA interactions. When droplets dissolve due to cellular signals, capillary effects cause the RNA to collapse while refolding. We test this process of condensate-guided RNA folding by adapting established RNA secondary structure predictors to mimic various folding pathways and supplement this with coarse-grained simulations. We find that interactions with transient droplets robustly leads to the formation of long-range RNA contacts, which are otherwise hard to achieve. Our results compare favorably with available experimental data. We propose that this strategy, which we call droplet-assisted RNA folding, represents a previously unexplored mechanism for shaping RNA structures.

While exercise is recommended for CKD patients, the molecular responses to different exercise modalities remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the anabolic, catabolic, and myogenic responses of skeletal muscle to aerobic exercise (AE) and combined exercise (CE; aerobic plus resistance) in people with CKD. Methods: Muscle biopsies were collected from participants in a 12-week randomized controlled trial of supervised exercise training, the ExTRA CKD trial. Samples were obtained at baseline, 24 hours after an initial bout of exercise (untrained), and 24 hours after the final training session (trained). Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to assess changes in key markers of protein synthesis, degradation, and regeneration. To complement these data, in vitro experiments using mechanically stretched primary skeletal muscle cells from CKD and healthy control donors were used to explore the time course of anabolic signalling. Results: In vivo, Akt phosphorylation was blunted following unaccustomed CE but significantly upregulated following training, indicating partial restoration of anabolic signalling. No change was observed in response to AE. Myostatin expression was significantly downregulated following both AE and CE in the untrained state, while Pax7 and myogenic gene expression were upregulated only in response to CE after training. In vitro, mechanical stretch induced significant phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K in both CKD and control cells, with no group difference in Akt response and a trend toward faster return to baseline of p70S6K phosphorylation in CKD cells. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that CE, but not AE, induces beneficial anabolic and myogenic responses in skeletal muscle in CKD, and highlight the value of combining in vivo and in vitro models to explore temporal dynamics and mechanistic insight into muscle adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

While mechanistic investigations have uncovered many facets of GATA1 biology, how GATA1 co-regulates divergent cell fates remains only partially characterized. We previously described that loss of Stag2, a member of the cohesin complex and a recurrent mutational target in myelodysplastic syndrome and Down Syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, results in altered chromatin accessibility, transcription factor function, and cell differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that chromatin accessibility facilitates lineage specificity of GATA1, thereby permitting efficient cellular differentiation. To understand the connection between chromatin accessibility and GATA1, we performed comprehensive studies of erythropoiesis in Stag2{triangleup} mice. Defects in Stag2-deficient hematopoiesis included reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors (EryPs), impaired terminal erythroid maturation, increased number of MkPs, and increased megakaryocytes. RNA- and ATAC-sequencing of EryPs revealed altered patterns of Gata1 target gene expression with altered accessibility in conjunction with loss of expression of erythroid targets and gain of megakaryocyte targets. Gata1 occupancy was lost at erythroid targets, while occupancy increased at megakaryocyte targets. Functionally, we observed that Stag2-deficient EryPs have diminished erythroid output and augmented megakaryocyte output in orthogonal differentiation assays.

While previous approaches have focused on mean concentrations, we here propose treating PFAS exposure variability as an ecological signal rather than statistical noise. To examine this variability-as-signal hypothesis, we analysed PFAS concentrations in plasma and stable isotopes in plasma and red blood cells from 112 individuals of two sympatric guillemot species (Uria lomvia, n = 45; U. aalge, n = 67) across five Icelandic colonies during the 2018 breeding season. The dual tissue isotopic approach allowed us to assess foraging consistency across different temporal scales, providing context for interpreting PFAS exposure patterns. PFAS variability was dominated by two compound groups: Long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, 79% of variance) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, 13% of variance). We standardised individual variability into Z scores to quantify individual expression of these exposure patterns, revealing three distinct variability clusters corresponded with oceanographic transitions between Arctic and Atlantic waters. Segmented regression analysis showed that significant threshold effects at the Arctic Atlantic habitats (distinguished by isotopic breakpoints {delta}13Cconsist = 0.19, {delta}15Nconsist = 0.00) with contrasting ecological drivers: PFOS variability responded to habitat driven shifts ({delta}13C, p < 0.01) and PFCA variability to trophic indicators ({delta}15N). Both species exhibited similar PFAS patterns when foraging in the same water masses, with notable exceptions where niche partitioning occurred at oceanographic boundaries. Our findings demonstrate that water mass characteristics and foraging strategies create structured PFAS variability patterns that reflect local ecological adaptations within broader geographical gradients. This variability focused framework reveals ecological dimensions of contamination that complement traditional mean based approaches and may improve understanding of contaminant risks in rapidly changing marine ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Despite their proliferation in numerous research domains, a major obstacle to wider adoption in clinical settings has been the well-established heterogeneity in prediction accuracy across a variety of demographic variables, such as age, sex, and genetic ancestry. To address this deficiency, recent research efforts aimed to improve representation in genetic studies and develop stratified PRS inference methods that greatly enhanced accuracy in minority populations. However, with these stratified scores in hand, it remains unclear how to assign the best score, or mixture of scores, for a particular test individual in the clinic. To bridge this gap, we present MoEPRS, an ensemble learning method based on the Mixture-of-Experts framework, that blends the stratified scores using personalized mixing weights to predict the target phenotype. In biobank-scale analyses of 7 complex traits in the UK and CARTaGENE biobanks, we show that MoEPRS generally provides modest improvements in prediction accuracy over single source PRS models and its predictive performance is maintained across biobanks. Furthermore, we demonstrate practical use cases where the model automatically identifies and adapts to diverse sources of heterogeneity in the data, which allows for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current polygenic scores across various cohort strata.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Past efforts identified some resistant sources and race-specific genes underpinning Striga resistance, but deployment of associated markers in breeding is limited. Here, we utilized a 51K cowpea iSelect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to decipher genomic regions underlying Striga resistance and explore marker conversion and validation for easy deployment. The study used two-year phenotypic data on a minicore panel of 368 cowpea genotypes screened at two sites in Northern Nigeria. SNPs performances were verified and validated using two independent sets of 60 and 20 diverse genotypes respectively. The minicore displayed apparent differences in response to the S. gesnerioides attack. A genome-wide scan uncovered a primary gene effect signal on chromosome Vu11 and minor regions on chromosomes Vu02, Vu03, Vu07, Vu09 and Vu10. The major effect region on Vu11 harbored a coil-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein, encoded by the RSG3-301 gene, previously implicated in race-specific resistance to S. gesnerioides in cowpea. The associated SNPs were successfully converted into Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) assays and validated using 20 independent diverse cowpea genotypes. Five KASP markers, snpVU00075, snpVU00076, snpVU00077, snpVU00078, and snpVU00079, depicted consistent and significant associations with the phenotype in the validation set.

Here, we use single-molecule magnetic tweezers to measure DNA twist in high concentrations of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and CsCl. For all salts, twist initially increases approximately as ~[salt]^1/2, but plateaus above 3 M. LiCl causes the largest twist increase, by ~0.8 degrees/bp compared to physiological salt, still far below the suggested C-form values of 2-3 degrees/bp. We perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for DNA in LiCl solutions with different force fields.

To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this region's role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this \"orthographic stream\" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing.

While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain.

To demonstrate the capabilities of our model and inference technique, we tested extensively on synthetic data and then predicted yeast growth under three different experimental conditions. As before, the proportion of total colony growth above which pseudohyphal growth is permitted was a key parameter that contributed to colony morphology. Since our NLE-based approach incorporates time series data, it yielded better parameter estimates and more accurate predictions compared to our ABC-based method. This updated approach improved understanding of how the probability that a stated cell produces a pseudohyphal cell influences colony morphology. In this way, the model also has the potential to generate hypotheses, which can be tested through biological experiments to increase the understanding of the basis for different growth patterns in yeast.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Burridge, M.; Chua, T.; Whitwell, H.; Ye, Y.", "abstract": "Proteasomes reversibly form foci bodies in a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-dependent manner upon stress. We previously reported that internalized protein aggregates were targeted by proteasome-dense foci1, and proposed that such transient aggregate-associated droplets (TAADs) may facilitate aggregate removal2. Here we use quantitative imaging to show that TAADs represent a novel type of gel-like proteasome condensate. TAADs are irregular in shape and slow to disperse, sequestering proteasomes in alignment with our observation of confined diffusion3. We demonstrate that TAADs co-localize with cytosolic alpha-synuclein aggregates to facilitate their clearance. Inhibition of proteasome or ubiquitination activity abolish this aggregate clearance. We identify RAD23B necessary for TAAD formation, amid other co-localizing chaperones and (co-)proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasomes system. TAAD formation is associated with higher proteasomal substrate turnover whilst retaining overall catalytic efficiency, suggestive of altered degradation mechanisms upon aggregate engagement. Proteomics analysis show impact on key mitochondrial-associated processes even after apparent clearance of aggregates. Similar TAAD-aggregate co-localizations can be observed in iPSC-differentiated neurons and in disease-relevant samples, with no detection of compromised proteasome activity. Together, our results indicate a model where TAADs concentrate local proteasome activity, which facilitates aggregate clearance in healthy ageing cells. Potentially with persisting pathological aggregates, TAADs may remain engaged and conceivably sequester proteasomes from physiological activities, thus contributing to neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Ascidian sperms exhibit a robust chemotactic strategy by swimming along circular paths whose centres form large-scale spirals, guiding them toward attractant-releasing eggs. Although their intracellular Ca2+ dynamics exhibit rhythmic bursts aligned with flagellar modulation, the underlying computational principles remain unclear. Here, we proposea minimal model that captures ascidian sperm chemotaxis through a combination of swimming trajectory control and an internal signalling model with fold-change detection (FCD). This model responds to relative rather than absolute changes in the stimulus concentration, achieving scale-invariant signal processing. Concurrently, the spiral swimming path enables spatial sampling of the concentration field, allowing the cell to infer gradient direction. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of a resilient signalling module and physically structured sampling trajectory enables effective chemotaxis in complex environments.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

This study integrates glycosylation and inflammation-related gene features for the first time to construct a prognostic model for gastric cancer, providing new theoretical basis for revealing immune escape mechanisms and personalized treatment strategies. Methods: Transcriptomic and clinical data derived from GC samples were meticulously examined, utilizing resources from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Through differential expression analysis, we successfully identified glycosylation and inflammatory-related differentially expressed genes (GANDIRDEGs). To construct a prognostic gene signature, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis in conjunction with Cox regression analysis. Additionally, we performed somatic mutation (SM) along with copy number variation (CNV) analyses, alongside gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Furthermore, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) along with a comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltration and drug sensitivity. Results: We identified and validated a six-gene (INHBA, OLR1, ROS1, EPHA5, TACR1, and IL6) signature, termed GANDIRDEGs, which showed excellent performance in distinguishing overall survival (OS) between high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) cohorts. Moreover, we developed a prognostic nomogram utilizing this six-gene signature that provides highly accurate predictions of GC patient outcomes.SM and CNV analyses revealed that MSR1 had the highest mutation rate among the GANDIRDEGs, with a mutation rate of 5%. GO, KEGG, and GSEA revealed significant associations of each pivotal gene with pathways, including cytokine signaling, the inflammatory response, and apoptosis mediated by CDKN1A through TP53, among various biological functions and signal transduction pathways. Our findings offer a novel gene signature, GANDIRDEGs, that correlated with prognosis, immune infiltration, and therapeutic sensitivity in patients with GC. Conclusio: This study establishes a prognostic signature integrating glycosylation and inflammatory pathways in GC, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of immune evasion and potential personalized treatment approaches.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a targeted enzymatic ablation method to eliminate the Golgi and trigger de novo organelle formation. Single-cell RNA-seq of cells rebuilding Golgi revealed an orchestrated induction of a broad Golgi gene network coinciding with structural and functional organelle maturation. This gene set spans all Golgi sub-compartments and functions, including glycosylation, trafficking, and ion transport, thus supporting the concept of a unified Golgi regulon, enabling the simultaneous expression of components required for the organelle structural and functional integrity. Through promoter analysis and RNAi screening, we identified CREB3L1 as a key transcriptional regulator critical for Golgi gene activation and organelle reformation. These findings indicate that CREB3L1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms orchestrate a complete Golgi biogenesis program that may be essential for organelle regeneration and for secretory pathway plasticity during physiological remodeling.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

How adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs), a large family of mechanosensors with more than 30 members in humans, transduce mechanical cues into metabotropic commands, has been a matter of debate due to the lack of suitable approaches to analyze receptor activation during mechanotransduction in live cells. Here we use human ADGRG1/GPR56 (G1), an aGPCR with roles in brain development, skeletal muscle, and platelet function, to study the events during aGPCR mechanotransduction. We show that G1 dissociation, taking place at [~]18 pN, occurs at retracting fibers during cell migration over an adhesive substrate, an effect that can be enhanced by cell stretching. Simultaneous live recording of G protein recruitment through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging and pharmacological assays during force transmission onto G1 show graded receptor responses with sub-maximal signaling before receptor dissociation, and maximal activation thereafter. Both modes require the intramolecular agonist/Stachel element of the receptor. Our findings demonstrate that non-dissociative and dissociative aGPCR signaling can emerge from the same aGPCR depending on mechanical stimulus magnitude, demonstrating the capability of aGPCRs for graded receptor responses upon force detection.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Decoding the Impact of Lipid Saturation on ER Signaling Networks, ERSU, UPR, and ERAD", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.15.676312", "authors": "Li, X.; Niwa, M.", "abstract": "The faithful inheritance of a functional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is safeguarded by the ER stress Surveillance, ERSU checkpoint, which delays cytokinesis when ER homeostasis is perturbed. Under stress, ER transmission to the daughter cell is halted, while in parallel, but through independent pathways, the unfolded protein response, UPR, restores ER function and ER associated degradation, ERAD, eliminates misfolded proteins, ultimately allowing cell cycle re-entry. ER stress also transiently stimulates sphingolipid biosynthesis, with the intermediate phytosphingosine PHS acting as a key activator of ERSU. Yet, how broader lipid parameters such as membrane composition, saturation, and fluidity, reshape ER quality control and, in particular, govern ER inheritance during division remains poorly understood. To address this, we employed a tightly controlled experimental system to selectively alter lipid saturation and phospholipid composition while monitoring ER inheritance within the framework of ER homeostasis maintained by UPR and ERAD. Strikingly, we found that perturbations in lipid balance exerted specific effects on ER inheritance that were distinct from their impact on UPR and ERAD. These findings reveal lipid homeostasis as a critical integrator of ER functional regulation, linking ERSU, UPR, and ERAD into a unified adaptive network that ensures robust ER transmission and cellular resilience under stress.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are prevalent, highly heritable psychiatric disorders with significant degrees of genetic overlap. Using open-sourced summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 1000 Genomes European reference panel, we utilize a plethora of statistical frameworks to estimate shared genetic liability across MDD, BPD, and ADHD. We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta (PTPRD), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRDs D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (RET) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2, ERK1/2, and PKC. We hypothesize that these mechanisms contribute to the significantly altered reward-related behaviors such as cocaine-conditioned place preference, cocaine self-administration, motivation for cocaine, and goal oriented behavior that are consistently observed across PTPRD KO/inhibition mice studies. With the inclusion of literature review, we present the first integrated multivariate genetic and mechanistic analysis aimed to identify pleiotropic, cell type-specific mechanisms driving psychiatric comorbidity at the biochemical level.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we sought to identify allosteric regulatory metabolites of the MAS enzymes cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) and mitochondrial GOT2. Using the Atavistik Metabolite Proprietary Screening platform, we identified several structurally similar metabolite hits, most notably deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP) and deoxyguanosine monophosphate (dGMP), as candidate interactors with GOT1. Follow-up thermal shift assays revealed that dAMP and dGMP destabilize GOT1 in the absence of its cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), but have no destabilizing effect when PLP is present. Crystallographic analysis confirmed that dAMP and dGMP bind in the PLP pocket of GOT1, suggesting competitive binding.

V.", "abstract": "The cohesin complex is composed of core ring proteins (Smc1, Smc3 and Mcd1) and associated factors (Pds5, Scc3, and Rad61) that bind via Mcd1. Cohesin extrusion (looping from within a single DNA molecule) and cohesion (the tethering together of two different DNA molecules) underlie the many roles that cohesins play in chromosome segregation, gene transcription, DNA repair, chromosome condensation, replication fork progression, and genomic organization. While cohesin function flanks the activities of critical cell checkpoints (including spindle assembly and DNA damage checkpoints), the extent to which cells directly target cohesins in response to aberrant cohesin function remains unknown. Based on prior evidence that cells mutated for cohesin contain reduced Mcd1 protein, we tested whether loss of Mcd1 is based simply on cohesin instability. We find that Mcd1 loss persists even in rad61 cells, which contain elevated levels of stable chromosome-bound cohesins, contrary to a simple instability model. In fact, re-elevating Mcd1 levels suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defects of all cohesin alleles tested, revealing that Mcd1 loss is a fundamental mechanism through which cohesins are inactivated to promote cell lethality. Our findings further reveal that cells that exhibit aberrant cohesin function employ E3 ligases to target Mcd1 for degradation. This mechanism of degradation appears unique in that Mcd1 is reduced during S phase, when Mcd1 levels typically peak and despite a dramatic upregulation in MCD1 transcription. We infer from these latter findings that cells contain a negative feedback mechanism used to maintain Mcd1 homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": ""}
