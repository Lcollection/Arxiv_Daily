It is often un-derstood as involving top-down prediction of bottom-up sensory patterns, but the term also ap-plies to feed-forward predictive mechanisms, for example in the retina. Here, I discuss a recent model of low-level predictive processing in the auditory brainstem that is of the feed-forward flavor. Past sensory input from the cochlea is delayed and compared with the current input, with a delay that is tuned with the objective of minimizing prediction error. This operation can be performed uniformly across peripheral channels, or independently within each peripheral channel with parameters local to that channel. The result is a sensory representation that is in-variant to a certain class of masking sounds (harmonic, quasi-harmonic, or spectrally sparse), thus contributing to Auditory Scene Analysis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss that mod-el in the light of predictive coding, and examine how it might fit within a wider hierarchical model that supports the perceptual representation of objects and events in the world.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that Sarm1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, is upregulated in SCs after nerve injury and plays a critical role in the early SC injury response. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing to compare wild-type and Sarm1 knockout SCs 24 hours after nerve injury, we found that Sarm1-deficient SCs are enriched in a distinct cluster expressing myelination genes (Fth1, Ptgds, Ptprd) that is largely absent in wild-type cells and show increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle genes across all injured SC states. Functional validation revealed cell type specific Sarm1 knockout SCs displayed increased mitochondrial respiration and enhanced axon protection in in vitro degeneration models, with axon protection also confirmed in an in vivo Drosophila wing injury model. We propose that Sarm1 gates the transition from a protection-associated Schwann cell state (PASC), demarcated by myelin formation genes, to a Repair SC state. These findings challenge the prevailing view of Sarm1 as an exclusively axon-autonomous regulator and reveal its critical role in the SC injury response, with broad implications for treating peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

TMZ resistant (R) U251 cells exhibited suppressed apoptosis and complete blockade of autophagy flux, evidenced by LC3II and p62 accumulation and insensitivity to Bafilomycin A1. BCL2L13, strongly upregulated in R cells, emerged as a dual regulator of mitophagy and ceramide metabolism. BCL2L13 knockdown (KD) produced opposite effects in TMZ sensitive (NR) and resistant cells: in NR cells, KD elevated LC3II, reduced respiratory reserve, and triggered compensatory lipid synthesis; in R cells, KD decreased LC3II without restoring flux or TMZ sensitivity. Lipidomic profiling revealed that BCL2L13 loss reactivated CerS6 in NR cells, increasing C16:0 and mid-chain ceramides, while relieving CerS2 inhibition in R cells, elevating very long chain (C22 to C24) and glycosylated ceramides. These distinct sphingolipid signatures were confirmed by PLS-DA and KEGG enrichment, which highlighted steroid hormone, arachidonic, and linoleic acid metabolism in NR KD cells versus neuroactive ligand-receptor and signaling pathways in R KD cells. Together, these findings position BCL2L13 as a molecular integrator of mitochondrial respiration, autophagy flux, and CerS-dependent lipid remodeling, unveiling a context-specific metabolic mechanism that supports GBM cell survival under chemotherapeutic stress.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Recent discussions of tACS propose that, entraining the phase of brain activity to the stimulation current, stimulation effects extend globally across the whole brain based on phase differences. However, immediate online spatiotemporal propagation of resting-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals within the brain due to multi-region stimulation remains unclear. The objectives of the present study were three-fold: 1) to elucidate the immediate online effect of tACS on BOLD signal, 2) to examine the extent of the influence on the brain when applying tACS, and 3) to explore whether variations in the phase difference between two brain regions result in differential effects on the stimulated areas and the whole brain. Through two experiments involving high-definition tACS with simultaneous measurements using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we revealed that the immediate online stimulation effects not only altered BOLD signals in the stimulated regions but also propagated across the whole brain in specific spatiotemporal patterns (functional networks). Stimulation effects were observed specifically in regions rich in neural fibres, including the grey and white matter, with no effect in regions containing cerebrospinal fluid. The timing of the signal value peaks depended on the stimulated region and functional networks, with a notable trend observed. Thus, tACS with a specific phase difference in two anatomically connected brain regions can immediately modulate online neural dynamics at both local and global scales.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Various laboratory models of cancer demonstrate the extraordinary dynamics of mitochondrial structure, but little is known about the full extent of the complexity of the mitochondrial network, nor its regulation upon exposure to therapeutic stressors. We previously demonstrated the importance of mitochondrial structure and oxidative phosphorylation in the survival of chemotherapy-refractory triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. As TNBC is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with few targeted therapy options, conventional chemotherapies remain the backbone of TNBC treatment. Unfortunately, approximately 45% of TNBC patients retain substantial residual tumor burden following chemotherapy, associated with abysmal prognoses. Herein we present the first three-dimensional analysis of mitochondrial networks in human tumor tissues. Use of two experimentally tractable orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models TNBC enabled us to conduct longitudinal analyses to construct mitochondrial networks in treatment-naive and residual tumors persisting after exposure to a variety of conventional chemotherapies. Further, we modeled lipid droplet (LD) structures and their physical contacts with mitochondria. In total, we reconstructed 3,750 mitochondria and 800 LDs in three dimensions using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), providing unprecedented insights into the complexity and intra-tumoral heterogeneity of mitochondria in TNBC. Both carboplatin (CRB) and docetaxel (DTX) chemotherapies produced residual tumors that harbored mitochondria with significantly increased areas, volumes, and perimeters in both PDX models. Additionally, treatment with the conventional combinations DTX plus CRB or Adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), led to reduced mitochondrial branching and elongation. In contrast, DTX or CRB alone elicited model-specific changes in mitochondrial complexity. Further, the extensive intra-tumoral heterogeneity of mitochondrial structure in untreated PDX tumors significantly decreased in residual tumors. Analyses of LDs revealed significant and consistent elevation of the number and physical proximity of MLCs in residual tumors, congruent with our previous studies providing evidence for transcriptomic and proteomic rewiring of lipid metabolism in residual TNBC. These results highlight the potential for structure-based monitoring of chemotherapeutic metabolic reprogramming and suggest unique molecular mechanisms that may underlie chemoresistance in TNBC. Furthermore, our findings provide novel insights into a new type of intratumoral heterogeneity, that of mitochondrial intratumoral heterogeneity, which complements our understanding of the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic complexity of TNBC.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Many invasive species have low genetic diversity in the invaded habitats, owing to the demographic bottleneck during introduction. Lantana camara is one of the hundred most problematic invasive species globally. Despite its ecological importance in many countries, our understanding of the genetic diversity patterns of this plant remains poor. Previous studies hypothesize that invasive L. camara is a species complex with a hybrid origin, though this has never been tested. We investigated the population genetic patterns of L. camara by sampling 359 plants that represented a spectrum of flower colour variants across 36 locations, spanning most of the biogeographic regions across India. Analyses of the population structure using 19,008 SNPs revealed that L. camara in India exhibits a strong genetic structure. Interestingly, the structuring pattern does not exhibit a strong correlation with geography. In the structure analysis, individuals with similar flower colours clustered together regardless of their location of origin. The genetic distance between most of the individuals was low, indicating the absence of multiple species. A high inbreeding coefficient and a low proportion of heterozygous sites observed suggested that the strong structure could be due to self-fertilization. This was further confirmed by bagging experiments, which demonstrated that L. camara is self-compatible in India. Thus, we infer that L. camara exists as homozygous inbred lines formed by self-fertilization and that these inbred lines could be associated with distinct flower colours. Together, this would explain the correlation between flower colour and genetic structure, and the lack of geographic structure. These results refute the argument that L. camara is a species complex and emphasize the importance of the mating system in shaping the patterns of diversity in this invasive species. Our findings highlight a hitherto unknown role for mating systems in invasive species, furthering our understanding of evolution in invasive species.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

In centrosomal systems, this occurs primarily by directed transport along polarized microtubule tracks, but how non-centrosomal microtubule arrays organize exocytosis remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this question in plant cells, which lack centrosomes and form cortical microtubule arrays. We identify KEULE, an essential SEC/MUNC protein, as a dynamic marker for exocytosis that forms clusters associated with and is required for discrete exocytotic events. Live cell imaging revealed that these clusters have stereotyped patterns of protein accumulation and loss, suggesting distinct phases in the assembly and function of exocytotic protein complexes. Super-resolution image analysis and Bayesian inference for distance distributions revealed that exocytotic events are not randomly distributed but are significantly enriched in ~180 nm wide linear domains flanking cortical microtubules, while being under-represented in adjacent ~520 nm domains. Thus, plant cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional spatial templates for patterning exocytosis, representing a fundamentally different organizational modality that may be shared by other non-centrosomal arrays.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Leveraging a cumulative total of 1.5 s of simulation with a polarizable force field including 1.2 s of conventional Molecular Dynamics (MD) supplemented by Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD), and well-tempered metadynamics (WTMetaD) enhanced sampling techniques, we examined how pH and ionic composition regulate the structural dynamics of preassembled STMV capsids. Six {approx}1M-atom assemblies spanning physiological and stress-mimicking environments were modeled to capture the interplay among protein-protein, protein-RNA, and ion-mediated interactions. A representative GaMD trajectory, corresponding to the up to s-equivalent regime of conventional MD, revealed that the capsid undergoes coordinated radial fluctuations, with collective expansion and contraction of the icosahedral shell. WTMetaD free-energy surfaces, computed for all six assemblies, delineated distinct condition-specific minima, defining thermodynamically accessible conformations for each environment. During the early relaxation dynamics revealed in conventional MD, RNA-free capsids preserved their icosahedral symmetry in physiological salt, where monovalent ions screened intra-capsid electrostatics. RNA encapsidation further modulated this balance through divalent-ion coordination at the protein-RNA interface. Under acidic conditions, a reversible Na+/Mg2+ exchange reorganized interfacial charge networks while maintaining the overall capsid architecture. Transient chloride binding intermittently disrupted key inter-monomer salt bridges, exposing a regulatory mechanism for capsid plasticity and permeability. Our findings establish STMV as an inherently dynamic, ion-responsive structural assembly whose conformational adaptability emerges from finely balanced electrostatic coupling between the capsid and its RNA, providing an atomistic framework for how ssRNA icosahedral viruses sense and adjust to environmental changes.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We show that Enterococcus faecalis suppresses macrophage activation through lactic acid-mediated extracellular acidification. Mutants lacking lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and thus unable to acidify the environment, fail to inhibit NF-{kappa}B. E. faecalis-derived lactic acid acts via MCT-1 and GPR81 through two distinct but complementary mechanisms that culminate in the reduction of NF-{kappa}B activity. Lactic acid acts through MCT-1 to inhibit ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation, leading to reduced STAT3 binding to the Myd88 promoter, and reduced MyD88 protein levels. Lactic acid signaling to GPR81 mediates the phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor YAP, ultimately attenuating NF-{kappa}B signaling. In a murine wound infection model, this lactic acid-driven immunosuppressive niche enables prolonged E. faecalis persistence and enhances the fitness of co-infecting bacteria such as Escherichia coli.

To extend these insights beyond existing annotations, we applied AlphaMissense, a deep-learning pathogenicity predictor, and uncovered localized 'island-like' patterns of elevated pathogenicity within IDRs. Leveraging these signals, we developed a classifier to prioritize predicted ELM motifs (PEMs), revealing thousands of candidate functional sites linked to major disease classes, including neurological, cardiovascular, and cancer-associated genes. Case studies in POLK, FOXP2, and LMOD3 illustrate how this framework connects genetic variation to molecular mechanisms, providing a scalable route to interpret variants of uncertain significance and advancing our understanding of pathogenicity in the disordered proteome.

To test this, we predicted human-derived dimensions from layer-wise activations of multiple DNNs and transformer models trained on large-scale datasets. Results showed that trained DNNs exhibit emergence profiles resembling theoretical expectations from human vision, with behaviourally relevant object dimensions largely absent in early layers, strengthening across layers, and peaking in later layers. Architectural mechanisms such as recurrence and skip connections amplified this encoding, learning objectives redistributed information across layers, and changes in stimulus statistics confirm that hierarchical emergence is a general principle extending to material perception.

To address this question, and to develop an immunocompetent murine model of infection, we directly compared log and stationary phase C. auris systemic infection in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice at high and low doses of infection. Systemic infection with high dose log phase C. auris results in rapid mortality between 2 hours and 1 day post infection, whereas stationary phase C. auris results in significantly extended survival.

We observed that C. auris initially colonizes multiple organs but is rapidly cleared from the lungs and spleen, while kidney fungal burdens remain stable. Mice infected with high dose log phase C. auris had Fibrin-associated blood clotting in multiple organs and decreased serum Fibrinogen levels, suggesting that coagulation may drive rapid mortality.

By combining light and X-ray scattering techniques with microscopy and advanced microfluidic setups, we here report the delicate phase behavior of a model mAb, named mAb1. This is characterized by rapid clustering and LLPS in a narrow NaCl range, above which it transitions into an opalescent state devoid of micron-sized assemblies, yet retaining a similar interaction fingerprint. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we report that the macroscopic solution state of mAb1 is controlled by a positive patch, whose degree of charge screening determines whether LLPS or opalescence will take place. Specifically, neutralization of this patch via counterion interactions diminishes intermolecular repulsion and favors the concerted action of weaker dipole-dipole/hydrophobic interactions, amounting to the creation of a new solution phase, via LLPS. Further NaCl addition distributes ions more uniformly across the surface, attenuating these attractive interactions, leading to the dismantling of droplets while preserving solution opalescence. Finally, we show that LLPS and opalescence are decoupled from stirring-induced aggregation, challenging an unequivocal relationship between these phenomena.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Using whole-body tissue clearing, light sheet microscopy, and AI-based image analysis, we demonstrate that LipiGo exhibits liver detargeting and redirects functional mRNA delivery to lymphoid organs, particularly the spleen. LipiGo shows enhanced uptake within key immune populations, including antigen-presenting cells, compared to standard LNPs. Using DNA hybridization to attach targeting ligands, LipiGo allows active cell-type targeting, where cholesterol-anchoring of targeting moieties avoids the rapid shedding common in traditional PEG-based conjugation. We demonstrate the utility of LipiGo by delivering mRNA cargo to white adipocytes in vivo using a DNA aptamer as a targeting moiety. Overall, the dual-purpose design principle of LipiGo demonstrates high modularity and efficiency, enabling delivery beyond the liver to immune tissues and aptamer-based-cell type specific targeting.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

For instance, fishing bans, aimed at enhancing fish biodiversity in eastern China, may counteract the effectiveness of nutrient control measures in mitigating eutrophication. This study employs a dual modeling approach to evaluate this hypothesis in Lake Hongze, the fourth largest shallow lake in China. The PCLake model was calibrated using observational data from Lake Hongze collected between 2016 and 2020. The calibrated model was subsequently applied in a hindcast analysis from 2020 to 2024 and a forecast simulation from 2025 to 2030 to assess the impacts of fishing bans. Combined with structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis, the results support the hypothesis that fishing bans can exhibit antagonistic effects on nutrient loading control by enhancing top-down regulation relative to bottom-up processes. Specifically, the fishing ban led to increased fish biomass, phytoplankton abundance, and nutrient levels over the past four years, while reducing the abundance of submerged macrophytes, zoobenthos, and zooplankton. Projections further indicate that such antagonistic effects would persist through 2030 if the fishing ban remains in place as planned. Additionally, model forecasts suggest that even with adjustments to the duration and intensity of fishing bans, antagonistic effects could be amplified under more stringent nutrient control scenarios. This study provides valuable insights into maximizing the net benefits of combined environmental management strategies through a systematic framework that evaluates both the effects and underlying processes of different interventions.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Through cancer-induced systemic conditioning, breast tumours generate subclinical alterations in distant organs that facilitate metastatic seeding and pre-metastatic niche formation. Neutrophils, mobilized through cancer-driven emergency granulopoiesis, actively contribute to this process. In this study we extend the concept of neutrophil-dependent conditioning beyond pre-metastatic sites, uncovering a broader systemic regenerative activation that links inflammation, tissue regeneration, and metastasis. This activation manifests as enhanced epithelial progenitor activity, measured by increased organoid formation, across multiple organs, including those with low risk of breast cancer metastasis. This neutrophil-dependent perturbation in lung alveolar progenitors and intestinal epithelial lineage commitment, is an indication of an altered organ physiology, enhancing tissue resilience to injury. Moreover, we identify UPP1 expression, which exclusively characterizes neutrophils generated through emergency granulopoiesis, as a key factor sustaining high translational activity in neutrophil progenitors and enabling the full acquisition of cancer-primed properties. Consequently, neutrophil loss of UPP1 reduces both their lung pro-metastatic function and their capacity to activate alveolar progenitors. Mechanistically, this involves interactions between cancer-primed neutrophils and platelets, which localize within lung interstitial spaces near alveolar cells to stimulate epithelial progenitor activity. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized tumour-induced systemic conditioning in which neutrophils coordinate epithelial regenerative activation as part of a pro-metastatic epithelial niche, with UPP1 as a key determinant of their cancer-primed state.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Continuous stimulation with heartbeat expanded the extracellular space (ECS), visualized by super-resolution 3D STED and 2-photon shadow imaging, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, detected by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Heartbeat sound promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation, synaptogenesis, and organoid maturation, as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing, synaptic marker immunohistochemistry, and high-density multielectrode electrophysiology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated astrocyte-specific expression of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels. Using Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed that low-frequency sound stimulation, including heartbeat, activates PIEZO-mediated Ca2+ responses, which in turn upregulate astrocytic ECM synthesis. Experiments with biomimetic hydrogels demonstrated that physiological matrix stiffness attenuates PIEZO activation, suggesting a mechanoprotective mechanism.

Of the several genera of biting mosquito, species of Anopheles are mostly studied for their ability (termed vector competence) to transmit Plasmodium protozoan parasites, some species of which cause malaria. More than 480 species of Anopheles have been described worldwide and about 70 of these are responsible for Plasmodium spp. transmission. However, the focus on Anopheles as vectors of Plasmodium has led to a relative lack of study about the ability of Anopheles to transmit viruses. Some Anopheles species have been previously confirmed competent for various arboviruses. In most cases they are secondary vectors, with relatively low competence, contributing to overall transmission while other species of mosquito or other vector are responsible for sustained transmission. While secondary vectors may contribute little to transmission, they may play important epidemiological roles by extending the length of the season and/or providing a means of overwintering. Here, we conducted an extensive review of scientific repositories, accessing a diverse range of journals and reports to build an exhaustive database of known Anopheles competence for arboviruses. Opinion pieces, modelling papers lacking experimental confirmation, and papers without vector competence data were excluded. In total, we reviewed 7,343 papers, and after exclusions, we retained 427 papers. We analysed these data, cross referenced with ability to diapause and geographical range. Our results show that some Anopheles spp. have the potential to be secondary vectors of some arboviruses, as well as undergoing diapause as adults in temperate regions of their range. Hence, we infer they could also play an epidemiologically important role in the overwintering of mosquito-borne viruses.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we employ a third-generation FRET-based biosensor (TqLck-V2.3) to visualize Lck conformational dynamics in live T cells with high spatial resolution. Upon TCR engagement, we observe a paradoxical increase in whole-cell FRET signal, which immunolabeling reveals to be due to selective internalization of inactive Lck (pY505), while active Lck (pY394) remains membrane-associated and enriched at the immune synapse (IS). Using CD8 mutants that disrupt Lck binding, we demonstrate that free Lck undergoes more pronounced conformational activation than coreceptor-bound Lck. Furthermore, we show that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) preferentially phosphorylates free Lck at Y505, while CD45 suppresses its activation via dephosphorylation of Y394, suggesting a dual regulatory mechanism that maintains free Lck in an inactive state under resting conditions. High-resolution imaging confirms sustained activation of Lck at the IS and transient inactivation at the periphery, revealing a spatially confined signaling architecture.

Both modifications co-exist with unmodified cytosine in palindromic CpG dyads in different symmetric and asymmetric combinations across the two DNA strands, each having unique regulatory potential. To facilitate investigating the individual functions of such dyad modifications, we report HM-DyadCap. This method employs an evolved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MECP2 HM) for the direct capture and sequencing of DNA fragments containing the CpG dyad hmC/mC. Binding studies reveal a high discrimination of MECP2 HM against off-target dinucleotides. We conduct comparative mapping experiments for mESC genomes with HM-DyadCap, standard MethylCap employing wild type MECP2, as well as MeDIP and hMeDIP protocols. We find that MECP2 HM is blocked by hmC glucosylation, and conduct control enrichments with glucosylated genomes that indicate highly selective enrichment of hmC/mC dyads by MECP2 HM. Metagene profiles correlate hmC/mC marks with actively transcribed genes, and reveal global enrichment in gene bodies as well as depletion at transcription start sites.

The ability of immune cells to collectively behave as an active material that switches physical state is essential for adaptive immunity. Yet the principles governing the control of the physical properties of immune tissues, and how chemical and mechanical forms of control interplay remain obscure. Inspired by minimal immune cell components that recapitulate germinal center (GC) dynamics, we developed an agent-based model that predicted that a tissue's ability to program its own physical properties governs the efficiency of antibody evolution. This motivated our search for biomolecular forms of control capable of tuning this material property. Using a tractable in vitro model, we found that CD40L-stimulated human B cells self-organize into active, liquid-like condensates that round, fuse, and internally mix. GC cytokines IL-4 and IL-21 tuned this effective temperature, driving phase transitions from cohesive, liquid-like states to dispersed, gas-like morphologies.

Previous attempts to incorporate intraspecific resource specialization in models of disease spread by pollinators have assumed specialization on one flower species, completely partitioning the plant-pollinator network, and very gradual changes in specialization, over days or weeks. These assumptions have not been demonstrated empirically but are critical to model conclusions. Here, we used palynology from sequential pollen loads of individual common eastern bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) to explore their foraging preferences and how they change over time. We found individuals in a bumble bee colony exhibited unique repertoires of two to three flower species while the full-colony repertoire was up to three times larger and varied by time of year. Floral constancy of individual bees lasted roughly ten days before turning over. We developed a disease transmission model parametrized with these empirical results, finding that R0 decreased with each additional flower species in a repertoire, which reduces the separation between theorized disease transmission subnetworks.

Our dataset includes 138 taxa from 83 studies, representing different study approaches (observational and experimental) for plants and animals. Using these data, we asked three primary questions: 1). How does phenological variation affect demographic vital rates? 2). Are directional shifts in phenology predictive of changes in demographic vital rates? 3.) Do relationships between phenology and demography depend on taxa, vital rate, and study type? For studies of phenological variation, earlier events conferred demographic benefits whereas later events were associated with demographic costs, with most of the evidence coming from bird and reproduction-focused studies. In contrast, directional phenological shifts were not predictive of demographic responses over time or in experiments. While there was evidence that phenological events shifted earlier through time, there was not significant change in demographic vital rates over those same time periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that organisms may be able to track environmental conditions to maintain demographic performance by shifting their phenology to earlier dates under climate change. Critically, our meta-analysis clarifies that while earlier phenological events tend to confer demographic benefits in the context of phenological variation, directional phenological shifts to earlier timing did not show demographic benefits.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

It is shown that, for high pollen limitation scenarios, autotetraploids can invade an initially diploid population only when the selfing rates are high. Under low pollen limitation, the conditions for tetraploid invasion are less restrictive (selfing rates above 0.3). These results apply to scenarios with either fixed or variable selfing rates in polyploids, but in the latter, high mutation rates of the selfing rate are needed for polyploidy to invade. These results suggest that tetraploid establishment is possible through the evolution of selfing, without introducing a non-functional S-allele. However, the conditions strongly depend on the degree of pollen limitation.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

F.; Gompert, Z.; Nosil, P.", "abstract": "Gene body methylation is one of the most taxonomically widespread epigenetic marks, yet its function and evolutionary history are poorly understood. While there is a positive association between gene body methylation and gene expression in many organisms, the mechanisms behind this relationship are unclear. Here, we investigate the function of gene body methylation in the stick insect Timema cristinae. We compare patterns of genome-wide gene body methylation to gene expression, open chromatin peaks, and chromatin compartments. We find that 95% of genes with gene body methylation occur in open chromatin compartments (euchromatin). Furthermore, highly expressed genes are impoverished in methylation at their transcription start site (TSS), which is associated with a peak of open chromatin. These findings suggest that the positive correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression is due to chromatin compartment structure. Yet, methylation around the TSS is associated with gene expression, possibly playing an inhibitory role as in vertebrates. Lastly, comparative analysis of Apis mellifera reveals a similar relationship between methylation and chromatin compartments, but not gene expression. These results suggest a possible explanation for the heterogeneous association between gene body methylation and gene expression and give insight into DNA methylations role in regulating gene expression.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, and using transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to test causality, we characterised differences in the neural processes supporting verbal short-term memory in healthy participants who varied in their reliance on semantic information. In group analyses, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed the expected pattern for a 'phonological buffer' - this site was responsive to phonological tasks and verbal short-term memory for meaningless items. However, the functions of this site differed across the sample; individuals with the strongest semantic reliance in short-term memory showed weaker phonological responses. They also showed more activation when maintaining meaningful word sequences in short-term memory, compared with nonwords. In these semantically reliant participants, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed stronger functional connectivity to limbic and default mode regions during nonword rehearsal. While inhibitory stimulation to phonologically responsive regions disrupted nonwords more than words in people with good phonological short-term memory, these effects were reversed when verbal short-term memory was more semantically reliant. These findings show that left anterior inferior parietal cortex supports the maintenance of different kinds of verbal information across individuals.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in non-invasive neuroimaging have revealed that thalamic activity can be modulated by attention and task demands. Moreover, lesion studies have hinted at the thalamus's potential role in language processing. Nevertheless, the precise involvement of this structure in language remains unclear. Here, we argue that language-related modulations can occur as early as the sensory thalamic stage, challenging the conventional view of language preprocessing as a predominantly language function. Using functional MRI to image 40 human participants (both female and male) while processing linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli of three main language systems (reading, speech comprehension, and speech production), we demonstrate specific activation of first-order nuclei during targeted language system tasks: lateral geniculate (LGN) for reading, medial geniculate (MGN) for speech comprehension and ventrolateral (VLN) for speech production. Notably, we show linguistic versus non-linguistic stimuli exhibit functional modulations during comprehension tasks (reading and speech) of left MGN and, to a lesser extent, left LGN?in line with prior studies of lateralization of language processes. Multi-voxel classification analysis confirmed left-lateralized linguistic modulation in the MGN, but not in the LGN.

Antigenic drift is traditionally assessed using ferret antisera, which provide monospecific responses, and human vaccinee sera, which reflect exposure to multiple antigens. In this study we evaluated the pig as an alternative source of antisera to study antigenic drift compared to immune responses in ferrets and humans. We included seasonal influenza A(H1N1pdm09) human viruses that had shown different antigenic characteristics when using ferret or human antisera. Methods: Pairs of pigs were inoculated with six human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating between 2019 and 2023, a period of marked antigenic drift. Pig and ferret antisera were analysed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) assays. Results: Pigs were successfully infected with all strains, shedding virus and producing antibody responses, confirming their susceptibility to human influenza A viruses. Antigenic reactivity of pig antisera was qualitatively comparable to ferret antisera in both HI and VN assays, although maximum homologous antibody titres were significantly higher in ferrets. The antisera raised against viruses in circulation in 2019 and before, exempified by A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019, clade 5a.1, were clearly differentiated by both ferret and pig antisera from those in clade 5a.2 and its derivatives that became predominant.

KIAA1217 loss in RPE-1 cells impaired ciliogenesis, producing fewer and shorter cilia. Domain mapping revealed an N-terminal centrosomal targeting domain and an EB1-dependent targeting of KIAA1217 to microtubule tips via C-terminal SxIP motifs. Importantly, defects caused by loss of KIAA1217 or its paralog p140Cap were rescued by inhibiting actin polymerization or Src activity, indicating regulation of actin polymerization through Src family activity.

In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of these mutations. Under normal light conditions, both mutants exhibited reduced activity at 5 days post-fertilization. However, exposure to a low concentration of 5 mM of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole increased their locomotor activity and induced seizures. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the mutants revealed an increase in the transcript levels of c-fos and gad2, and a decrease in a transcript level of gabra1. This suggests that mutations cause a disruption to inhibitory neurotransmission. Local field potential recordings from the optic tectum of the mutants under baseline conditions showed an increase in spontaneous electrical activity.

Humans have elaborated the rhombic lip niche to include a rhombic lip subventricular zone (RL-SVZ) not seen in mice or macaques. Although developmental disruptions of this progenitor zone can cause cerebellar growth abnormalities - from malformations to tumors - the gene regulatory networks underpinning this unique progenitor niche are unknown. Here we provide a predicted gene regulatory network for the human cerebellar rhombic lip, inferred from epigenomic maps of the developing human cerebellum. We generated DNA methylomes of neuroanatomically-dissected mid-gestation human rhombic lip ventricular zone and RL-SVZ (N=9 samples; 15-16 post conception weeks) using low-input Enzymatic MethylSeq. We also mapped histone modifications marking active promoters and enhancers in the whole mid-gestation human fetal cerebellum (N=6 samples; 14 and 18 post-conception weeks). Integrating these data, we identified 9,855 differentially-methylated regions (DMR) which converge on binding sites of over three hundred transcription factors, including master regulators of rhombic lip neurogenesis, ATOH1, NEUROD1, and NEUROD2. DMRs hypomethylated in the RL-SVZ are enriched in active enhancers and in human accelerated regions, and are depleted in active promoters. We inferred 81,844 transcription factor-enhancer-gene links, covering 41 transcription factors active in the rhombic lip, and 4,610 target genes that include drivers of cerebellar neurogenesis and pediatric hindbrain cancer. Twenty-five DMRs overlap human accelerated regions located near genes associated with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and neurological deficits. DMRs are also statistically enriched in copy number aberrations in medulloblastoma, a malignant pediatric hindbrain cancer with subtypes hypothesized to originate in the rhombic lip. Close to one-quarter of the DMRs overlap known copy number aberrations in medulloblastoma, nominating potential enhancer and promoter elements impacted by these genomic aberrations.

Monitoring changes in functional diversity is essential to understand differences between taxonomic and functional diversity trends. The Red List Index (RLI) is a widely used metric in conservation policy, and tracks trends in aggregate extinction risk across sets of species over time. We present a functional Red List Index (fRLI), which weights species by their morphological uniqueness at either local or global scales, to indicate the risk that future extinctions could pose to functional diversity. We applied the fRLI on birds and found higher aggregate extinction risk for both local and global fRLI compared with the standard RLI. Species with higher local uniqueness were more likely to be at higher risk of extinction while we found no difference for globally unique species. Globally or locally unique species were not more likely to show escalation in extinction risk between 1988 and 2024 than less unique species; however, locally unique birds had a lower proportion of their resident range covered by site-based conservation measures, leaving them vulnerable to future decline.

In 1999, selection favored increased growth at low temperatures at the expense of decreased growth at high temperatures. We document evolution consistent with this past selection: caterpillars now grow faster at low temperatures but slower at warm temperatures in 2024 compared to 1999. However, temperatures have changed rapidly, with increasing incidence of high temperatures such that selection in 2024 has reversed to favor increased growth at the highest temperature assayed. Over the 25 years, phenotypic variation has increased at warm temperatures and a tradeoff between growth at intermediate and warm temperatures has strengthened, consistent with evolutionary constraints that may restrict evolution to grow faster at rare, high temperatures. Our study demonstrates the potential for rapid evolution of thermal sensitivity in response to climate change in an agricultural pest.

Anticipated changes in climate are predicted to increase mortality and decrease the biomass of many boreal tree species, putting at risk the functioning of this ecosystem and hence its role in carbon absorption and climate change mitigation. Genomic offset methods leverage spatial distribution of genomic diversity and its association with environmental variables to generate maps of populations vulnerable to projected changes in climate. Here we analyse over 60 populations and more than 1400 individuals of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P), a dominant boreal forest species, to compare population-level genomic offsets calculated with Gradient Forest with multiple fitness traits measured in four long-term (>40 yr) common gardens. Within common gardens, we found that genomic offset predictions were unaffected by the number or type of markers used for model training, with the exception of LFMM climate-associated markers. Most models predicted fitness equally well even when the number of populations in the training set was reduced down to ten or was restricted to a single genetic cluster, suggesting that Gradient Forest can reliably estimate fitness for new populations and novel climates. However, model performances varied among common gardens, with highly accurate fitness predictions in some gardens but contradictory results in others. The accuracy of model predictions was strongly influenced by the choice of climate variables and their relationships with fitness traits. Overall, our results indicate that predicting genomic offsets in genetically structured species across large spatial scales is challenging, because of variation in environmental effects on genotypes and in the interactions among climate variables across the landscape.

Sex-specific plasticity is a higher order phenotype that emerges due to the effect of the environment and sex on core growth regulatory mechanisms. Genetic variation in SSP necessarily requires sex- and environment-specific variation in growth, yet the developmental-genetic mechanisms enabling such context-dependent size variation remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and functional validation in Drosophila melanogaster, we dissected the genetic architecture of body size, size plasticity, SSD, and SSP across 196 isogenic lineages. We find that each phenotype is governed by largely non-overlapping sets of loci, with most candidate variants lying outside canonical growth pathways. Instead, size trait are shaped by \"private QTLs\", whose effects are limited to specific sex, trait, or environmental contexts. Functional knockdown of selected candidate genes for SSP revealed that while most did not affect SSP directly, many influenced body size, SSD, and size plasticity, in a manner consistent with their nested phenotypic relationships. Together, our results suggest that context-dependent alleles in genes peripheral to core growth regulatory pathways drive variation in SSD and SSP, offering a mechanistic explanation for their evolutionary lability and highlighting the role of private QTLs in structuring complex trait architecture.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We also assessed whether data from multiple breeds already available based on D-loop sequences could be organised into a useful framework for resolving the complex history of modern horse breeds. We identified eight mtDNA haplotypes among 88 Exmoor pony samples, representing all extant maternal lines. While phylogenetic trees based on D-loop sequences lacked resolution, clustering published sequences to a mitogenome-derived haplogroup framework allowed assessment of the distribution and relationships of lineages across diverse horse populations, including ancient DNA samples and Przelwalski's horses. The most basal lineages of Exmoors were traced back to the Pleistocene, supporting their ancient origin and status as a primitive population, with a possible ancestral role in the development of some modern breeds. The founder lineages were found to be polyphyletic, with more derived haplogroups representing subsequent mixture with other domestic horse breeds. Although nuclear genome sequencing is needed to fully assess levels of admixture, we identified new haplotypes, along with rare or basal haplotypes that could be prioritised for conservation in rewilding studies.

We demonstrate that low-frequency EPS, applied early on during NMO development and maintained over several weeks, promotes structural and functional maturation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Independent of stimulation waveform dynamics, EPS-trained NMOs (EPS-NMOs) displayed stronger and more frequent spontaneous contractions that persisted long after stimulation ceased. Quantitative imaging and transcriptomic analyses revealed a robust improvement in EPS-NMO skeletal muscle and neural tissue morphology, coordinated regulation of lineage-specific biomarkers, and upregulation of gene programmes associated with mature neuromuscular function. Mechanobiological measurements further demonstrated increased EPS-NMO tissue stiffness and faster relaxation dynamics, consistent with advanced excitation-contraction coupling and force generation. Collectively, these findings establish EPS as a powerful, non-invasive, and on-demand modality for driving the morphological and functional maturation of complex organoid systems.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

A major limiting factor is the neurovascular unit (NVU), which is both anatomically complex and characterized by a highly selective barrier. Conventional 2D in-vitro models and in-vivo animal models do not adequately replicate its pathophysiology. Organ-on-a-Chip technology provides a powerful platform to model the NVU, enabling replication of its anatomical and functional features within a dynamic microenvironment that closely mimics the human brain. However, the requirement for specialized facilities and technical expertise limits accessibility, reducing broader translational applications. Additionally, conventional endpoint analyses constrain real-time monitoring of cellular behavior. Here, we present and validate a novel bi-modular microfluidic chip that offers an easy-to-use and scalable solution for studying cellular cross-talk, while enabling live imaging and real-time measurements. The model incorporates human endothelial cells and primary neurons that were investigated through immunofluorescence and live imaging. The design overcomes key fabrication challenges and integrates a simplified method for Trans-Epithelial/Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) monitoring, allowing in situ real-time assessment of barrier integrity. Overall, this platform represents a robust and versatile tool for in-vitro studies of the NVU, facilitating comprehensive evaluation of its structural and functional dynamics.

In breast cancer, increased tumor stiffness is associated with elevated metastasis risk and poor survival. We identify a unique role of the JAK family kinase TYK2 in suppressing breast cancer metastasis under low ECM stiffness. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 in mammary acini and patient-derived organoids leads to invasion at low ECM stiffness by promoting Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, which is independent of cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling. TYK2 blockade promotes metastasis in breast tumor cell- and patient-derived xenografts. TYK2 localizes at the plasma membrane via IFNAR1 association under low stiffness, but it becomes cytoplasmic and inactivated at high stiffness. Normal human breast epithelium displays membrane-localized TYK2, whereas invasive breast tumors exhibit cytoplasmic TYK2. These findings uncover a TYK2-dependent mechanism by which ECM rigidity suppresses breast cancer metastasis and underscore the need for vigilant breast cancer screening in patients receiving TYK2 inhibitors.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

The relationship between altered SMARCB1 protein products and severe functional brain changes in Coffin-Siris syndrome remains largely unknown. We performed cellular, molecular, and behavioural analyses of a Coffin-Siris syndrome mouse model with a heterozygous nervous system-specific Smarcb1 mutation. In addition, we evaluated general cognitive abilities, as well as cognitive and behavioural functioning, in individuals with SMARCB1-related Coffin-Siris syndrome. Smarcb1 mutant mice exhibited deficits in fine motor coordination and balance, as well as impaired spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, these mice showed anxiety-like behaviours and agitation when exposed to novel environments. The detected behavioural abnormalities could indicate impaired decision-making, which results in impaired risk assessment. Comparable cognitive and behavioural deviations were identified in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome and SMARCB1 pathogenic variants. Our analysis of the Smarcb1 mouse model revealed structural alterations in the brain, including decreased dendritic length and complexity of dendritic trees. These alterations may explain the observed functional impairments. Notably, our finding of reduced Wasl transcripts in mutant Purkinje cell nuclei suggests that dysregulation of actin polymerization may be involved in the discovered dendritic defects.

We combined a preregistered electroencephalography (EEG) experiment (N = 87) with the Judge-Advisor System to identify how two common forms of social information - feedback and advice - shape judgment and decision-making. Participants made numerical estimates, received either feedback (good/bad) or advice (a specific alternative estimate) that was either close to or far from their own, and then revised their response. Across behavioral and neural indices, both information types showed proximity-dependent effects, yet diverged in their temporal dynamics. Feedback elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN) that decreased with confidence, indicating reflexive performance monitoring. Advice produced sustained late positive complex (LPC) activity whose onset slowed with higher confidence and lower proximity, reflecting deliberate integration of external information. For both, P300 amplitudes increased with proximity, consistent with the reward value of social validation. These findings reveal two complementary neurocognitive routes by which social information guides decisions: a rapid evaluative route engaged by feedback and a slower deliberative route engaged by advice.

Moreover, we find that the OB-mPFC delta and beta power-based connectivity is enhanced by WM. On the other hand, theta oscillations have the most prominent roles in phase coupling in this circuit. We also show bidirectional information transfer, stronger in the mPFC-to-OB direction, between the two brain areas.

We tested the hypothesis that, within striatal circuits, flexibility relies on nanoscale remodeling of synaptic machinery coupling anterograde glutamatergic transmission to retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, a process disrupted in states of rigidity and aging. In the dorsolateral striatum, we found cell-type-specific facilitation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5)-dependent, endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression at cortico-striatal synapses of indirect pathway neurons in flexible goal-directed behavior, but not after training promoting inflexibility. Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) super-resolution imaging revealed that behavioral adaptation, but not rigidity, is accompanied by increased postsynaptic abundance of mGlu5 and diacylglycerol lipase- (DAGL), an endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzyme, and presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In parallel, the nanoscale distance between mGlu5 and DAGL is reduced in postsynaptic spine heads. These nanoscale changes emerged within the time window required for behavioral updating. Intriguingly, the molecular densities of mGlu5, DAGL, and CB1 receptors predict the strength of behavioral adaptation. In aging mice, these nanoscale changes were absent in association with behavioral rigidity. These findings identify a nanoscale synaptic remodeling mechanism that enables behavioral flexibility and reveal how its failure contributes to rigidity, including that observed in aging.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Dysregulation of this control characterizes disorders such as anxiety or addiction, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated circuits engaged during approach-avoidance control using fMRI with concurrent eye-tracking, and behavioral measures. Forty participants (22 females) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task with free- and forced-choice trials. Each trial comprised anticipation, response (using a joystick to approach/obtain or avoid/forgo outcomes), and outcome phases. Before scanning, participants learned that conditioned stimuli (CS) predicted an aversive stimulation (avCS+), appetitive reward (appCS+), both outcomes (confCS+), or no outcome (neuCS-). Discordant responses (e.g., approaching avCS+) were slower than concordant responses (e.g., avoiding avCS+), confirming heightened control demands. Overcoming threat-driven avoidance specifically recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while suppressing reward-driven approach lacked distinct neural signatures. During anticipation, confCS+ and avCS+ showed overlapping activation in salience-control networks, including middle/anterior cingulate cortex (MCC/ ACC), anterior insula, IFG, and ventral striatum (VS). Interestingly, confCS+ evoked threat-like anticipatory neurophysiological responses (pupil dilation; ACC/insula activation) but subsequently triggered reward-like approach behavior. Multivariate pattern and psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that this dissociation was driven by differential encoding of upcoming responses in the ventral striatum during the anticipation phase and by altered functional coupling between the VS and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). These findings indicate that motivational control prioritizes salience over valence and suggest a VS-rTPJ network for resolving approach-avoidance conflicts, offering novel insights into neural dynamics of flexible goal-directed behavior.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Premature termination codons are often assumed to produce uniform haploinsufficiency via nonsense-mediated decay, yet whether distinct SCN2A premature stop codons yield equivalent molecular, cellular, and behavioral outcomes remains unknown. We generated two mouse lines carrying patient mutations -- Scn2aY84X/+ (p.Tyr84UAA; early coding sequence) and Scn2aR1627X/+ (p.Arg1627UGA; terminal coding exon) -- on a C57BL/6J background. Allele-specific expression was quantified by targeted next-generation sequencing of whole-brain reverse transcribed cDNA. NaV1.2 protein was measured in half-brain lysates by automated western blot and ex vivo whole-cell recordings were obtained from layer 5b pyramidal-tract neurons in medial prefrontal cortex. A panel of behavioral assays assessed locomotion/exploration, motor learning, anxiety-like behavior, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and seizure susceptibility. Allele-specific RNA handling diverged by position: mRNA carrying Y84X engaged partial nonsense-mediated decay, whereas R1627X transcripts were at allelic balance. Despite this difference in RNA fate, NaV1.2 protein was comparably reduced in both lines. Electrophysiologically, both premature termination codon mutations slowed the action-potential upstroke, with a larger decrement in Scn2aY84X/+ than in Scn2aR1627X/+. Spike threshold was depolarized only in Scn2aY84X/+, whereas Scn2aR1627X/+ remained similar to wild type. Frequency-current relations showed reduced firing at near-rheobase inputs in both mutants, with responses approaching wild type at stronger currents. Behaviorally, locomotion, sociability, and sensorimotor gating were preserved. Both lines exhibited increased grooming, consistent with restrictive, repetitive behavior; Scn2aY84X/+ alone showed greater exploration in the elevated-risk context and a male-predominant deficit in rotarod learning. In maximal electroshock testing, mortality was lower in both lines without differences in seizure threshold or severity.

Dysregulated inflammatory macrophage activation contributes to diseases including sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modification prime macrophages for activation, and several histone modifying enzymes (HMEs) have been implicated in this regulation. Objective To systematically identify histone modifying enzymes that regulate inflammatory macrophage activation. Methods We performed a CRISPR knockout screen with single-cell RNA-seq readout (CROP-seq) targeting 92 macrophage-expressed HMEs in immortalized LPS-activated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The resulting single-cell transcriptomes were analyzed to identify significant perturbations. Kdm5c was selected for experimental validation in mouse BMDMs, and its expression pattern was compared with macrophage subsets from human atherosclerotic plaques using scRNA-seq data. Results The CROP-seq screen identified Prmt6, Carm1, Kat2b, and Kdm5c as top regulators of inflammatory macrophage activation. Validation in a KO cell line revealed loss of Kdm5c suppressed inflammatory tone at baseline but led to an exaggerated transcriptional response to LPS stimulation, indicating a role for Kdm5c in balancing tonic and inducible activation. A weighted gene module derived from Kdm5c-deficient macrophages was enriched in inflammatory macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaques. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate the value of CROP-seq screening to dissect the epigenetic control of macrophage activation.

In oscine songbirds, birdsong is a learned behavior that functions in territory defense, species recognition, and mate attraction. Increased noise levels in urban areas can reduce signal efficacy, which can have negative impacts on fitness. However, many species have persisted in urban settings by singing at less noisy times of day, singing at higher amplitudes, or changing aspects of their song to reduce masking by low-frequency ambient noise. Previous studies have often focused on modern populations of single species in rural and urban settings; here, we conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of the effects of urbanization on the birdsongs of nine species across ~60 years. We use machine learning to assess distinguishability between songs from historic and modern timepoints. Additionally, we assess whether variation within modern songs is associated with urbanization, and whether song differences over time are associated with changes in urbanization levels. We find that while there are some song-feature differences between historic and modern songs, and between modern songs along a rural-urban gradient, these differences are not consistent across species. These results reinforce the notion that species respond differently to urbanization by altering different aspects of their songs. For the vocal-learning songbird species studied, historic and modern songs were not distinguishable using dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning, and some modern songs differed in more urban settings. However, the non-vocal-learning (suboscine) species showed an overall increase in its lower song frequencies in modern songs, but showed no systematic differences in song features along an urbanization gradient, suggesting more dynamic changes in the vocal learners and population-level changes in the non-learners. This spatiotemporal study is the first to compile and analyze historic and modern songs from multiple species alongside urbanization data, bringing new insights to the effects of urbanization on birdsong", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We performed whole-genome sequencing of several renowned and local durian cultivars, including Musang King (D197) , Sultan (D24), Black Thorn (D200) , Muar Gold (D101), and Red Prawn (D13) collected from distinct geographic regions across Malaysia. Illumina sequencing yielded approximately 20 to 30x coverage per sample, sufficient for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection and population genomic analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on genome-wide SNPs revealed visible population stratification and varying degrees of genetic relatedness among Malaysian durians. Subsequent KING kinship analysis indicated that most cultivars are relatively clonal, with the notable exception of the reference Musang King genome, which appeared genetically heterogeneous compared to other Musang King samples, a finding further supported by population structure inference from admixture analysis and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 haplotyping. Notably, the Black Thorn cultivar showed no relatedness to Malaysian varieties but exhibited distant genetic similarity to the northern Thai Kan Yao variety.

Motion-capture data were collected from eight collegiate baseball pitchers, and joint-angle time series were analyzed using logistic regression models to predict pitch type (fastball vs. breaking ball). Specifically, two analyses were conducted: (1) a sliding time-window analysis to identify when and where predictive cues emerged within target motions and (2) a set-size analysis to evaluate how prediction accuracy varied with dataset size. The main results revealed that (1) predictive cues were distributed across the entire body, but models integrating whole-body information achieved the highest accuracy; (2) informative cues emerged in most body regions around the initiation of the pitchers weight shift; (3) the accumulation of opponent-specific information had a pronounced effect up to approximately 30 pitches; and (4) substantial individual differences existed in when and which cues were effective for pitch-type prediction. Although alignment with human athletes must be carefully examined in future work, these findings highlight the utility of the proposed analysis as a complementary approach to conventional hypothesis-testing experiments.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We identified and benchmarked several reproducible microglial states and a core set of genes leading to microglia activation in the mice brain. We investigated microglial heterogeneity and studied the impact of aging and parabiosis-mediated exposure of young and old blood on microglia subpopulations across four different brain regions including cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. We revealed region specific differences in microglia subpopulation composition and age-related changes, with cerebellum and striatum displaying the most distinctive profiles and dynamic shifts compared to other brain regions. We consistently observed cerebellum as the most responsive, while striatum appeared distinctive by its minimal responsiveness to these interventions. Our findings highlighted the role of microglia in brain regional vulnerability and provided a foundation for microglia-targeted treatment for modulating brain aging.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) is a member of the murine intestinal microbiota associated with colitis in immunodeficient mice, despite driving dominant immune regulatory responses in normal hosts which allow colonization without pathology. However, whether this colonization influences intestinal immune homeostasis more widely remains unexplored. Here, we report that Hh colonization confers a disease protective effect on DSS colitis, attenuating intestinal inflammation and other disease parameters. Disease attenuation required persistent colonization and was dependent on host CD4+ T cells. We further show that Hh colonization promotes a conserved anti-inflammatory transcriptional programme across several effector and regulatory intestinal CD4+ T cell subsets. Thus, although persistent stimulation of host immune responses allows the host to tolerate 'pathobionts' like Hh, this is compensated by the promotion of tissue-protective immunological conditioning.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

However, for oil palm, one of the most important and widespread tree plantations, we lack a detailed understanding of how this process affects microclimate and biodiversity. We therefore compiled environmental and biodiversity data of oil palm plantations that were repeatedly sampled over a 6 year period in Malaysian Borneo. Using these data, we made a chronosequence of the microclimate and biodiversity of oil palm plantations between the ages 5 and 18. We found that oil palm plantations increasingly buffer temperature and humidity over time, becoming cooler and less dry. Animal responses differed between taxa: spider and beetle abundance increased, ant abundance decreased, and mammal and dung-beetle abundances stayed constant. The diversity of beetles in general increased and family-level community composition changed, while dung-beetle and mammal diversity stayed constant. Some taxa are therefore likely limited by the harsh microclimate of young plantations', while increased habitat complexity and fruit and leaf production in older plantations could also drive increased abundances of other taxa. Our results reveal that oil palm plantations undergo considerable changes, even over a decade after establishment. Correspondingly, plantation age should be considered in studies into oil palm plantations' impact on climate and biodiversity, and landscape level diversity could be increased by allowing multiple oil palm stand-ages to co-exist.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

While reduced SAM availability is known to cause DNA hypomethylation, the effects of elevated Met/SAM remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the Arabidopsis thaliana mto1 mutant, which accumulates Met and SAM due to a mutation in cystathionine {gamma}-synthase, the first committed enzyme of Met biosynthesis. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed widespread hypermethylation in mto1, particularly in non-CG contexts (CHG and CHH), with the strongest changes in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Hypermethylation was concentrated in transposable elements (TEs), especially retrotransposon families such as Gypsy and Copia. Transcriptome profiling showed that TE-genes (TEGs) were broadly downregulated, consistent with reinforced TE silencing due to the hypermethylation. Despite these epigenetic changes, expression of core DNA methyltransferases and demethylases was largely unchanged, suggesting that increased SAM availability enhances enzymatic activity rather than gene expression. In addition, ~25% of protein-coding genes were differentially expressed in mto1, though most changes were not directly linked to promoter- or gene-body methylation. Instead, the strong bias toward hypermethylation of TEs and repression of TEGs suggests that elevated Met/SAM primarily affects gene expression indirectly. Together, these findings demonstrate that an excess of Met/SAM reinforces heterochromatic DNA methylation and transposon silencing, providing new insights into the connection between amino acid metabolism and epigenetic regulation in plants.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

LC neurons show pathology in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including age-related accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) and accelerated loss of neuromelanin (NM) pigmentation. NM-sensitive neuroimaging of the LC predicts previous cognitive decline, clinical severity, and future AD progression. While these findings suggest that the LC plays an etiologic role in AD, the molecular landscape of the LC prior to clinical manifestation of sporadic AD remains largely uncharacterized. This information is critical for developing interventions that preserve LC integrity and function. We performed spatially-resolved transcriptomics on 85 sections of human postmortem LC from N=33 neurotypical middle-aged donors, balanced for epidemiologic AD risk factors including sex, African or European ancestry, and APOE genotype (carriers of the E4/risk or E2/protective alleles). Comparing across APOE genotypes, we find astrocytic gene expression differences proximal to LC neurons. Associating NM content with local gene expression, we show that higher overall APOE gene expression correlates with reduced NM content and an enrichment of NM-associated genes in aging pathways. Unexpectedly, we find enriched LC expression of cholesterol synthesis genes, alongside evidence for lipid synthesis gene regulatory network activity in NM-containing LC specifically, revealing a potential intersection between intrinsic lipid metabolism in LC neurons, NM, and the role of APOE-mediated lipid biology in AD.

These conditions can include access to nutrients, such as amino acids, and exposure to toxic compounds, like copper. To investigate the ability of Brucella abortus, a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for a major zoonosis, to cope with copper, we performed a Tn-seq analysis to identify copper-sensitive mutants. Unexpectedly, we realized that classical copper resistance systems (involving CopA and CueO homologs) do not appear to be robustly needed, while histidine and purine biosynthesis pathways are crucial to cope with copper. We show that hisA, hisB, hisC and hisD mutants are auxotrophic for histidine and sensitive to copper. This suggests that the reported attenuation of his mutants in macrophages could be based on auxotrophy or/and copper sensitivity. Therefore, we generated suppressor strains with a restored resistance to copper for hisC, but still auxotrophs for histidine. Our data suggest that this suppression is due to the overproduction of a homolog of OppA, a periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein. Analysis of these suppressors shows that the absence of histidine biosynthesis capacity, and not copper sensitivity, is required for optimal growth of B. abortus in macrophages.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We found that glucocorticoids, among the most prescribed medicines, significantly increase P-body numbers across diverse epithelial cell types. This effect was fully reversible after glucocorticoid withdrawal, illustrating the adaptive dynamics of P-bodies. Using genetic invalidation and rescue approaches, we demonstrated that this accumulation requires the Glucocorticoid Receptor alpha isoform. P-body accumulation was associated with the sequestration of P-body-specific-targeted mRNAs, altering their translation yield. Notably, this translational regulation depends on transcript sequence features rather than abundance, with AU-rich mRNA transcripts being sequestered and GC-rich mRNAs preferentially translated under glucocorticoid treatment. Furthermore, we linked the decrease of LSM14B, a negative regulator of P-bodies, under glucocorticoid treatment to P-body reshaping. Our results reveal that, beyond their known transcriptional activity, prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids influences mRNA post-transcription and translation through a nucleotide composition-based mechanism.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We use this genetic system to make comprehensive genome-wide measurements of mRNA and protein concentrations and stability. We find that protein and mRNA turnover rates are weakly related to cell size, but that mRNA concentrations are strongly size-dependent. This establishes that transcriptional regulation is the basis of proteome remodeling. Live-cell imaging of endogenous mRNAs using MS2 fluorescent protein binding motifs is used to measure how transcriptional dynamics change with cell size.

Results: Stable IPF/ILD exhibited moderate negative correlations between the six most significant metabolites and HRCT scores (r = -0.27 to -0.51), along with a high abundance of specific phospholipids (triacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diacylglycerol), sphingomyelin, ceramide, and acylcarnitine. In contrast, progressive disease showed weak positive correlations between the six most significant metabolites and HRCT scores (r = 0.19-0.26), and moderate negative correlation between specific triacylglycerol species and HRCT scores (r = -0.37- 0.4). Furthermore, metabolomic analysis in individuals with progressive disease revealed both high and low abundances of specific phospholipid species (including high and low triacylglycerol species, as well as low levels of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol), along with high levels of certain sphingomyelin, ceramide, taurine, and purine bases, and low levels of xanthine and lactic acid observed.

While conservation implies possible functional redundancy, the distinct roles of each YPEL paralog have not been defined. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae possesses a single ortholog, MOH1, which contributes to survival and stress responses and can be functionally complemented by human YPELs. However, the cellular role of MOH1 remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the function of MOH1 in S. cerevisiae. MOH1 deletion (moh1{Delta}) conferred sensitivity to sodium azide and sulfuric acid but increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. Moh1 protein levels decreased upon hydrogen peroxide treatment and increased following sulfuric acid exposure, indicating stress-dependent regulation. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that moh1{Delta} cells are constitutively rounder, tend to form clumps, and exhibit rough surface features, indicating altered cellular architecture. RNA profiling and FTIR spectroscopy revealed transcriptional reprogramming and metabolic remodeling in moh1{Delta} cells, including alterations in lipid, protein, and cell wall polysaccharide levels and composition. Intracellular ROS assays indicated that hydrogen peroxide resistance can be attributed to decreased cellular uptake resulting from altered permeability, rather than changes in mitochondrial ROS production.

In the mouse colon, neuropod cells express various peptide hormones, such as Pyy and Glp1, presynaptic proteins, and make synaptic contacts with sensory neurons. While their function is not fully elucidated, they play a significant role in relaying signals to the brainstem upon sensing nutrients and microbial factors in the gut lumen. Their occurrence in the human gastrointestinal tract is currently not established. In this study, we showed that Pyy-expressing cells (L-cells) in the human colon exhibit characteristics of neuropod cells. Utilizing advanced histological methods and confocal microscopy we found that L-cells of the healthy human colon possess distinctive morphology, express synaptic proteins, and exist proximal to sensory neurons. This agrees with our meta-analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data that showed that human colonic L-cells express pre- and post-synaptic genes. As inflammatory conditions could affect colonic neuropod cells, we aimed to profile the phenotypic and transcriptional changes of neuropod cells both in human and murine colon in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and experimental colitis, respectively. In human IBD, the abundance of neuropod cells and spatial proximity to sensory neurons were decreased in the colon of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. L-cells in IBD patients display genes related to innate and adaptive immunity, including antigen presentation genes suggesting a role in immune regulation. We further confirmed the effects of intestinal inflammation in neuropod cells by utilizing the DSS mouse model of colitis, where we showed that acute DSS colitis induced spatially distinct effects on the abundance of neuropod cells and impaired the synaptic connection with sensory neurons.

To elucidate the neural correlates underlying these rapid perceptual changes, we investigated brain activity during the hand morph illusion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-four participants (22 with upper limb CRPS, 22 pain free controls) completed the hand morph illusion task during fMRI and provided trial-by-trial ratings of ownership, likeability, and pain of their affected hand. People with CRPS showed greater activation of the left premotor cortex (PMC) during the illusion compared with controls. Functional connectivity between the left PMC and right extrastriate body area (EBA) was also revealed in CRPS during the illusion. No main effects of the illusion, relative to a sham condition, were found on pain intensity, limb ownership, or likeability ratings. These findings provide the first identification of neural correlates of body perception disturbance in CRPS, implicating PMC EBA networks in altered body representation. Further neuroimaging research is required to define the neural signature underlying this disturbance.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Although fibrocytes were identified in early descriptive studies across several mammalian systems, most of this work predated modern molecular approaches, and the cells remain incompletely defined at the molecular level and have not previously been derived or characterized in cattle. Seeking somatic cells that could be collected aseptically and reproducibly under field conditions for reprogramming to pluripotency, we recognized fibrocytes as a practical and previously unexplored candidate population. Here, we establish a reproducible method for fibrocyte derivation and expansion from adult bovine blood and define their molecular identity using transcriptomic and network analyses. Principal component and differential expression analyses revealed extensive immune, inflammatory, metabolic, and stress-responsive pathways that distinguished fibrocytes from fibroblasts. Upstream regulator analysis identified a fibrocyte-restricted transcriptional network governed by SPI1, IRF5/IRF7, NFKBIZ, PRDM1, CIITA, and MAFB, supporting a monocyte-derived origin and indicating some retention of hematopoietic lineage memory despite acquisition of mesenchymal features. Optimized fibrocyte medium (FbC; dexamethasone, ascorbate, PDGF-BB, EGF, A83-01, CHIR99021) supported stable proliferation and selectively enhanced cytoskeletal and matrix-constructive programs while attenuating inflammatory tone. When reprogrammed with polycistronic OCT4-SOX2-KLF4-cMYC and SV40 large T antigen, fibrocytes generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies exhibiting defining molecular and morphological features of pluripotency. These findings establish fibrocytes as a field-adaptable, stably expandable, and reprogrammable somatic cell type with practical applications in induced pluripotent stem cell generation, genetic preservation, and reproductive biotechnology.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

U.; Bruchhaus, I.; Krauss-Etschmann, S.; Bossen, J.; Roeder, T.", "abstract": "Chronic inflammation disrupts epithelial regeneration, yet how immune signaling reprograms progenitor fate remains unclear. Using the Drosophila airway as a model of epithelial remodeling, we identify the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway as a central integrator of immune and stress cues that balances apoptosis and compensatory proliferation in airway progenitors. Persistent activation of the innate immune IMD pathway induces simultaneous cell death and proliferation through a non-canonical route that bypasses NF-{kappa}B/Relish and instead engages JNK. Downstream, distinct transcriptional modules orchestrate these divergent fates: Foxo and AP-1 drive apoptosis, whereas the ETS factor Ets21C mediates proliferation. Genetic inhibition of JNK or its effectors restores progenitor homeostasis, while constitutive activation recapitulates inflammation-induced tissue remodeling. These responses are cell-autonomous, revealing that airway progenitors actively interpret immune and stress signals to determine their fate. Collectively, our findings uncover a modular signaling architecture that links inflammation to regeneration and highlight conserved JNK-dependent transcriptional programs as potential therapeutic targets to prevent progenitor exhaustion in chronic airway disease.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

At the moment, camptothecin is mainly sourced from trees, causing limited supply and high costs. Improving access to strictosidinic acid would help to elucidate yet unknown biosynthetic steps and in the long term enable sustainable production of camptothecin in heterologous hosts. While structurally similar to the common monoterpene indole alkaloid precursor strictosidine, strictosidinic acid has not been the target of metabolic engineering efforts before. Here, we present a strategy to produce strictosidinic acid from glucose and tryptophan in engineered yeast. First, we create a basic strain that generates 75 mg/L strictosidine. We further optimise this strain by introducing a membrane steroid binding protein and a second copy of the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase mutant gene ERG20WW, boosting strictosidine levels by 5.5-fold to 398 mg/L. At these higher titres, a previously overlooked shunt product, (2E,6E)-2,6-dimethylocta-2,6-dienedioic acid (DOA), was identified that diverts flux from the pathway. Lastly, we reprogrammed our strictosidine strain to strictosidinic acid production by four genomic modifications. Final fed-batch cultivation in shake flasks resulted in 843 mg/L strictosidine or 548 mg/L strictosidinic acid, respectively, after 168 hours. Taken together, our work now grants access to strictosidinic acid by metabolic engineering, while revealing strategies to further enhance the production of strictosidine and related monoterpene indole alkaloids.

G.; Crystal, J. D.; Hohmann, A.

Spontaneous pain has been assessed in rodents using the conditioned place preference (CPP) approach, given that the relief of pain is described as rewarding and results in negative reinforcement (i.e. removal of an aversive pain state). LY2828360 is a CB2 agonist that failed in a clinical trial for osteoarthritis pain. We compared impact of LY2828360 on evoked and spontaneous pain using a spared nerve injury (SNI) model in rats. First, we verified that an analgesic dose of gabapentin (100 mg/kg i.p.) produces CPP in rats with SNI, but not in sham-operated rats, consistent with a previous report (Griggs et al. 2015). We then used a within-subjects design to ascertain whether the CB2 agonist LY2828360 (10 mg/kg i.p., chronic) would suppress both evoked and spontaneous pain in rats with SNI. To assess evoked pain behavior, mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds were measured and revealed that LY2828360 reliably suppressed mechanical hypersensitivity in the paw ipsilateral, but not contralateral to SNI. Furthermore, efficacy was sustained across repeated injections without development of tolerance. To assess spontaneous pain behavior, we tested the ability of LY2828360 to prevent gabapentin-induced CPP in the SNI model, as failure to develop CPP to gabapentin following treatment with an analgesic has been considered evidence of suppression of spontaneous pain. The same rats that showed suppression of mechanically-evoked responses following chronic LY282860 treatment did not develop CPP to gabapentin. However, rats that were tested in parallel and treated chronically with vehicle showed robust mechanical hypersensitivity, but also did not develop CPP to gabapentin. These studies document that CB2 agonist-induced suppression of mechanically evoked pain is highly robust and reproducible, whereas CPP, used to assess spontaneous pain, is vulnerable to disruption and requires rigorous controls to rule out alternative explanations (e.g. failure to learn).", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Pharmacological assays revealed that sec-5 was less sensitive to microtubule-stabilizing and -disrupting drugs during ABA-induced stomatal closing, consistent with a defect in cytoskeletal dynamics. Confocal imaging and quantitative analysis of microtubule rearrangements showed that SEC loss-of-function mutation retarded microtubule reorganization in response to ABA, with abnormal microtubule bundling and density.

Conventional statistical models have focused on average treatment effects, overlooking individual variability, and struggling to identify key moderators. Generalized Random Forest (GRF) can predict individualized treatment effects, but current implementations suffer from two critical limitations: (1) prediction performances vary substantially across random initializations, and (2) identification of key moderator is limited in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce two methodological advances to address these issues. First, a seed ensemble strategy stabilizes predictions by aggregating models trained under different random initializations. Second, a backward elimination procedure systematically identifies key moderators from high-dimensional inputs. Simulation analyses across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable and valid predictions across random seeds, improved performance in moderator identification, and robust generalization of independent data. To facilitate adoption and interpretation, we provide step-by-step guidance using large-scale neuroimaging dataset (N = 8,778) with reusable code.

Additionally, fetal exposure to low-dose dioxin reduced {beta}-cell area in female mice at birth; however, the role of AHR in {beta}-cell development has not been explored. To characterize the AHR pathway in developing human {beta}-cells, we differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into islet-like cell clusters (SC-islets) in vitro and treated cells with vehicle or dioxin for 24-hours at key stages of differentiation. Dioxin exposure robustly upregulated AHR gene targets (CYP1A1, AHRR) at all stages of differentiation but only had modest effects on markers of islet development and maturity. We next generated an AHR knock-out (KO) hESC line and found that basal CYP1A1 expression was profoundly suppressed in AHR-KO cells compared to parental cells at all stages of differentiation. Key markers of developing and mature pancreatic islets were largely unaffected by AHR deletion; however, G6PC2 was consistently downregulated in SC-islets from AHR-KO cells compared to parental cells. Interestingly, AHR-KO SC-islets also showed modestly increased insulin secretion relative to the parental line, suggesting a role for AHR in islet development. This novel AHR-KO cell line will allow for deeper investigation into the impact of AHR on development of human islets and other cell lineages.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Counterillumination is somewhat similar, achieving crypsis in midwater marine organisms by the emission of bioluminescence directed downwards. Although mesopelagic squids are assumed to use counterillumination, high-resolution spatiotemporal changes in illumination, particularly for each type of photophore, have not been elucidated. Watasenia scintillans has three types of photophore on its ventral surfaces: blue-emitting and green-emitting abdominal photophores, and ocular photophores. It is demonstrated here that all three types of photophore are involved in counterillumination synchronously, reversibly, and repeatedly in response to changes in dim overhead lighting. The green abdominal photophores exhibited a gradual decay and maintained their glow in the dark. Conversely, when animals were exposed to air, green luminescence alone was quickly extinguished. There were no observed color shifts (such as from green to blue) in any of the photophores. The ocular photophores emit blue light irregularly, partly because they are concealed by the epidermal chromatophores. While synchronous illumination does suggest the crypsis hypothesis, the ability to independently control each type of photophore could also support a previous hypothesis of conspecific signaling.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we used chemostat bioreactors (pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, and a solids retention time [SRT] of 4 d) to simulate gut-relevant, transient nutrient conditions and to enrich for lactate-consuming communities. DL-lactate-consuming consortia were enriched from a human-derived microbiota and then inoculated into duplicate bioreactors, which were fed exclusively D- or L-lactate. After steady-state was reached, the fed lactate stereoisomers were switched to assess community resilience. Regardless of the fed stereoisomer, the fermentation product spectra were consistent and dominated by acetate, propionate, and CO2. However, microbial communities and biomass yields diverged sharply, with a high relative abundance of Anaerotignum in D-lactate enrichments and Acidipropionibacterium and Propionibacterium in L-lactate enrichments. Notably, the biomass yield for D-lactate feeding was less than half that for L-lactate feeding, suggesting that the two isomers are metabolized through distinct biochemical pathways despite similar product spectra.

To address this gap, we developed genetically engineered mouse cell line models (GEM-CLeMs) by introducing common glioma driver mutations into immortalized astrocytes. A high-grade glioma model was generated by combining Pten knockdown with RAS V12 overexpression, while a low-grade glioma model was produced through p53 knockdown with mutant IDH1R132H overexpression. The RAS/Pten GEM-CLeM tumors grew rapidly in vivo, displayed necrosis, multinucleated pleomorphisms, abundant vascularization, and showed strong enrichment for extracellular matrix remodelling and mesenchymal genes, features closely aligned with human glioblastoma. Importantly, the RAS/Pten GEM-CLeM tumors showed similar survival trends and immune infiltration patterns as a corresponding KrasG12D/PtencKO GEMM, but could be grown to larger sizes, facilitating better stromal and immune analyses. In contrast, the IDH1R132H/p53 GEM-CLeM formed slow-growing tumors with distinctive immune infiltration and vascular patterns, consistent with low-grade glioma phenotypes.

This study aims to investigate whether pretreatment with inhaled cannabidiol (CBD) can inhibit GBM growth in a preclinical murine model. Specifically, we hypothesize that CBD pretreatment may reduce tumor progression and modulate the tumor microenvironment. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with inhaled CBD for either 3 or 14 days, or a placebo, followed by intracranial implantation of glioblastoma cells. Tumor growth, immune checkpoint expression (IDO/PD-L1), and key biomarkers (MGMT/ Ki67) were assessed to determine the impact of CBD pretreatment on tumor progression and the immune microenvironment. Results: The 14-day CBD pretreatment significantly reduced tumor growth compared to both the placebo and 3-day CBD groups. Additionally, this group showed lower expression of immune checkpoints (IDO, PD-L1) and reduced levels of MGMT and Ki67, suggesting enhanced tumor suppression. These results indicate that prolonged CBD pretreatment modulates the tumor microenvironment and may improve tumor control and reduce relapse risk. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that inhaled CBD pretreatment significantly inhibits GBM growth in a preclinical model.

P.", "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and an urgent public health threat. This bacterial pathogen is challenging to treat due to antibiotic resistance and high recurrence rates, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic strategies. The host inflammatory response is a major driver of C. difficile-associated disease and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Currently, few strategies targeting the inflammatory response have been leveraged to treat CDI. Here, we show that administration of the prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog misoprostol markedly reduces CDI severity by modulating host immune responses. During CDI, misoprostol decreases circulating neutrophils and limits infiltration into the colon, reducing epithelial damage, intestinal pathology, and infection severity. Additionally, misoprostol reduces serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), an important cytokine in neutrophil mobilization, controlling neutrophil levels during CDI. Together, these findings highlight neutrophil infiltration as a key driver of C. difficile-associated disease and identify innate immune modulation as a potential host-directed therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

N.; Ferec, C.; Liao, Z.; Zou, W.-B.; Chen, J.-M.", "abstract": "Variants with intermediate functional effects--those that neither abolish nor fully preserve gene function--constitute an underappreciated source of genetic complexity and a grey zone for classification within the current ACMG/AMP binary pathogenic-or-benign framework. Here, we address this issue using GT>GC (+2T>C) 5' splice-site variants, approximately 15% of which retain variable amounts of wild-type transcript, as a tractable model. Drawing on disease-associated GT>GC variants and those analyzed by full-length gene splicing assays, we show that residual wild-type transcript levels form a continuum from barely detectable to near normal. Notably, GT>GC variants retaining substantial wild-type transcript (e.g., SPINK1 c.194+2T>C, HBB c.315+2T>C, and BRCA2 c.8331+2T>C) frequently present classification challenges. Our findings also indicate that in classical Mendelian disorders caused by monoallelic or biallelic complete loss-of-function alleles, GT>GC variants are not invariably pathogenic (e.g., DOCK8 c.3234+2T>C). Minigene analyses of selected CFTR and BAP1 variants further illustrate the inherent difficulty of predicting and experimentally quantifying residual wild-type transcript levels (e.g., CFTR c.2490+2T>C and CFTR c.4242+2T>C). Because GT>GC variants that generate wild-type transcript exemplify the degeneracy and context dependence of splice-site recognition, insights from their study extend to other splice-altering variants outside the invariant +1, -1, and -2 positions. Overall, our analysis highlights that grey-zone variants with intermediate functional effects represent a biological reality that complicates the genotype-phenotype relationship and underscores the need for classification frameworks that accommodate the full spectrum of variant effects and the true complexity of human genetic disease.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated sex differences in flexible learning in two domains: the learning of stimulus- and action-based associations and their reversals. During action-based learning, rats selected between two identical visual stimuli presented on a touchscreen, where the spatial location predicted a higher probability of reward. For stimulus-based learning, rats chose between two distinct visual stimuli presented in pseudorandom spatial locations, one of which was associated with a higher probability of reward. Reversal phases involved switching reward contingency between the two actions or stimuli. To gain a detailed understanding of diffferences across conditions, we modeled animal trial-by-trial choices using reinforcement learning (RL) models and examined their steady-state behavior to capture transitions between distinct behavioral states. We found that female rats were more likely to omit trials and take longer to initiate trials in both domains. The omissions were more frequent in late-stage action-based reversal learning, once learning had plateaued. Moreover, although the estimated parameters of the best-fitting RL model revealed some sex differences, the model that incorporated transitions between different behavioral states provided a better overall fit to the data. This model also revealed that across all reversal phases, females exhibited a higher transition-specific lapse rate than males, indicating greater task disengagement once there was no need for further learning. Together, our fine-grained analysis of behavior adds to a growing literature on sex differences in flexible reward learning.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we overcome this limitation using a multimodal ultrasound imaging platform, an imaging technique that offers brain-wide coverage in living animals at 10-100 m resolution. To monitor the co-evolution of tumor growth, neural activity and vascular remodeling, we integrated (1) nonlinear imaging of acoustic reporter gene expressing-tumors, (2) hemodynamic functional imaging of brain activity, and (3) super-resolution microscopy of the vasculature. Integrating these modalities for the first time and applying them to a common model of glioblastoma, we followed tumor-brain interactions in individual animals over their disease lifetimes. Our approach allowed us to precisely map the spatial displacement of functional brain regions, the local and global disruption of functional connectivity, and the remodeling of the blood supply to support tumor growth.

Heteronuclear two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments form the basis of several NMR based investigations, especially those involving biomolecules like proteins. However, in solution, as the molecule of interest becomes larger, transverse relaxation times of the spins of interest become shorter. This makes it difficult to record 2D 1H-13C or 1H-15N correlation maps of large protein molecules using standard Fourier-transform based experiments as they contain transfer delays that are long compared to the short relaxation times. Herein, we explore the possibility of leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) to obtain 2D correlation maps of proteins while eliminating transfer delays from experiments. In this study, we show that 2D methyl 1H-13C correlation maps can be obtained from experiments containing only a single 1H excitation pulse followed by off-resonance 13C continuous-wave decoupling. A DNN was successfully trained to reconstruct the 2D 1H-13C correlation map from datasets recorded with two 13C decoupling fields using protein samples enriched with (ILV) 13CHD2 methyl groups in a 2H background. The efficacy of this strategy is demonstrated by using the DNN to reconstruct methyl 1H-13C correlation maps of the ~8 kDa FF domain from human HYPA/FBP11, the ~18 kDa T4 phage lysozyme, as well as on the ~360 kDa 77 particle from the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome.

While glycated proteins such as albumin or hemoglobin are widely used as biomarkers for glycemic control, the structural and chemical changes induced by glycation may also alter their interactions with lipid interfaces, including cellular membranes and lipoproteins, potentially affecting their biological distribution and diagnostic detectability. In this study, we investigated how glycation influences the interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) of different compositions, used as model systems to replicate the diversity of membrane surface charges and fluidity. Using neutron reflectometry (NR), we compared the membrane association of BSA and a chemically-enhanced glycated form of BSA (gBSA), focusing on nanostructural changes at the bilayer interface. Our results showed negligible interaction of either proteins with zwitterionic or cationic membranes. In contrast, both BSA and gBSA exhibited significant binding to negatively charged bilayers, with glycation significantly amplifying this interaction. Quantitatively, the membrane-associated protein volume fraction increased from 0.11 (BSA) to 0.17 (gBSA) suggesting that glycation modifies the protein s surface properties in ways that promote stronger lipid interactions with negatively charged membranes. These findings suggest that glycation not only affects protein structure but also modulates protein-membrane affinity in a lipid-dependent manner. This has important implications for the bioavailability and behavior of glycated albumin in the bloodstream, potentially influencing the accuracy of clinical assays and contributing to membrane-related pathophysiology in diabetes.

Methods Forty TBI and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was used to assess the clinical severity of TBI. Spearmans rank-order correlation was employed to find the association between GCS scores and IL levels. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human IL-1{beta} and IL-18 ELISA kits was conducted to measure the serum IL-1{beta} and IL-18 levels. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were measured to assess the potential of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 as biomarkers. Results The patients had mild TBI (mTBI) with a mean GCS score of 11.05 {+/-} 1.67. A negative correlation was found between GCS scores and IL levels.

In a previous study, we compared SOX10-bound regulatory elements in Schwann cells and identified a specific enrichment for nuclear receptor motifs at SOX10 binding sites in Schwann cells. NR2F1 and NR2F2 (Coup-TFI/Coup-TFII) are expressed from neural crest through Schwann cell maturity, and knockdown of nuclear receptors Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 in primary Schwann cells downregulated several myelin genes.

However, electric stimulation of small, sensitive target regions, such as the inner ear, can cause ad-verse side effects (SEs). Objective: To identify stimulation parameters with low side-effect profiles while reliably stimulating the cochlea, thereby improving patient comfort and safety and paving the way for the development of a medical device for treating patients with chronic tinnitus. Approach: Hearing-healthy participants were stimulated with electrodes in the ear canal. Stimulation of the cochlea elicits a soft hearing impression (HI) in participants, indicating successful stimulation of the early auditory pathway. We systematically compare HS and SEs across distinct electrode configurations and stimulation parameters, including stimulation frequency and the presence of a Direct Current (DC)-offset. We record SE occurrence via vis-ual analog scales after stimulation. Main Results: We find that tACS stimulation between 250 and 2000 Hz reliably elicits HIs in participants. SEs are generally low. No occurrence of SEs resulted in participant withdrawal or severe adverse events, with only phosphenes, skin tingling, and a sense of vibration being reported as impactful. The addition of a slight DC-offset increases the occurrence and magni-tude of SEs considerably. Significance: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of tACS in non-invasively stimulating the auditory pathway with minimal adverse SE. Stimulation parameters with a low SE profile can be applied in further studies with tinnitus patients.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

H.; Schumacher, L.; D Nunez, M.; Weindel, G.; Rieskamp, J.", "abstract": "Over the past sixty years, evidence accumulation models have emerged as a dominant framework for explaining the neural and behavioral aspects of the process underlying decision making. These models have also been widely used as a measurement instrument to assess individual differences in latent cognitive constructs underlying decision making. A central assumption of most of these models is that decision makers accumulate noisy evidence until a fixed decision threshold is reached. However, both behavioral and neuroscientific findings, along with theoretical considerations related to optimality, have suggested that the decision threshold varies over time. Although time-dependent threshold models often provide a better account of empirical data, a major challenge associated with these models is the unreliable estimation of their parameters. This limitation has led researchers to emphasize model-fitting comparisons rather than interpreting parameter values or accounting for individual differences in the dynamics of the decision threshold. In this work, we address the reliability issue of parameter estimation in time-dependent threshold diffusion models by proposing a joint modeling approach that links non-decision time to external observations. Parameter recovery simulations demonstrate that informing the diffusion model with trial-level noisy measurements of non-decision time substantially improves the reliability of parameter estimation for time-dependent threshold diffusion models. Additionally, we reanalyzed the experimental data from two perceptual decision-making tasks to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed modeling approach. Non-decision time measurements were extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using the hidden multivariate pattern method.

However, the relationships between distinct abilities and their interdependencies during memory tasks and motor learning activities are not clear. An important question is whether being proficient in memory or motor learning tasks also translates into better performance in another, similar task - reflecting potential generalization of motor learning abilities. To investigate the correlation between memory performance and motor learning in mice, we used a combination of behavioral tasks that assess general exploratory behavior, declarative memory, and fine motor learning. For the exploratory behavior, we used the Open Field task, and assessed declarative memory using the Novel Object Recognition and Y-maze. Motor learning was assessed through the Vertical Pole and Pellet Reaching task. We found a negative correlation between the Vertical Pole task and the motor learning task, where a shorter time for an individual to turn on a pole correlated with an increased number of attempts to reach a sugar pellet in the motor learning task. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between the Y-maze and the motor learning task, where a higher exploration rate indicated a higher success ratio in the pellet reaching task.

While they have traditionally been associated with perceptual modulations and covert attention shifts in extrafoveal vision, recent evidence indicates that microsaccades also modulate perception within the central fovea in a spatially selective manner. However, the temporal dynamics of these modulations in fine spatial discrimination remain largely unexplored. Here we used high-precision eye tracking and gaze-contingent display control to achieve accurate localization of the line of sight and to restrict visual stimulation to selective locations within the central fovea during instructed microsaccades. Our results show that visual performance peaks approximately 70 milliseconds before microsaccade onset at the target location, while perception at equally eccentric, non-target foveal locations is concurrently impaired. This is followed by a generalized suppression phase while the microsaccade is in flight, when fine spatial discrimination drops to near-chance levels.

Chronic pain is increasingly recognized as a key risk factor for delirium, and microglial activation may be the central mediator linking these two conditions. Methods: We used a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of persistent neuropathic pain in tandem with a postoperative delirium (POD) mouse model. Pain assessments, electroencephalography (EEG) recording, and immunofluorescence were performed to characterize pain and delirium-like states. Microglia were isolated for RNA-seq to elucidate gene expression changes comprehensively. Results: SNI mice showed persistent mechanical hypersensitivity from Day 7 onwards and demonstrated disrupted sleep-wake patterns in EEG indices. Immunofluorescence revealed sustained microglial activation in both the hippocampus and cortex following SNI. RNA-seq analyses indicated the upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., interleukin-6 production, NF-{kappa}B signaling) in SNI mice that also underwent head-mount surgery. Notably, the coincidence of persistent pain and an acute delirium-like state further exacerbated neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that neuropathic pain-induced microglial activation primes the brain for exaggerated inflammatory responses under additional surgical stress, potentially worsening delirium. Further investigations into microglia-focused therapies may inform novel strategies for mitigating delirium in patients with neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Efficient clearance of dead cells and pathogens is essential for survival and requires both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs, predominantly consisting of neutrophil granulocytes) constitute an important first line of defense. These highly specialized cells can phagocytose pathogens and clear apoptotic cells through efferocytosis. Beta-2-microglobulin ({beta}2m) serves as the light chain of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, associating non-covalently with the heavy transmembrane chain that binds and presents antigenic peptides to CD8+ T cells. This represents the canonical role of {beta}2m. {beta}2m is also found in the granules of PMNs and is released into the extracellular space during degranulation. However, a specific function for {beta}2m in the context of PMN function or degranulation has not yet been identified. We now present evidence that {beta}2m is of importance for both phagocytosis of pathogens and efferocytosis of dead cells by PMNs. The addition of exogenous {beta}2m (50 mg/l) to PMNs in the presence of latex beads increased the phagocytic activity from 23% to 31%. Furthermore, both {beta}2m and desLys58-{beta}2m (dK58{beta}2m) enhanced phagocytosis of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria by more than 3.6-fold, though no effect was observed with zymosan bioparticles. Maintaining tissue homeostasis requires the continuous generation of new cells and the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells through efferocytosis. Treatment with {beta}2m or dK58{beta}2m led to a dose-dependent increase in efferocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells, reaching up to a two-fold enhancement. This effect was comparable to that obtained by GM-CSF, used as a positive control. In all cases, cytochalasin D blocked {beta}2m-mediated uptake in PMNs. These data demonstrate that {beta}2m can be of importance in phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens as part of the innate immune response and tissue homeostasis by removing dead cells by efferocytosis.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first investigation of telomere length across age in Molossus molossus, a tropical bat historically categorised as the shortest-lived bat on record. Through a multi-year mark-recapture study in Gamboa, Panama, we sampled 492 individuals (n = 317 females, 175 males) and documented a female M. molossus surviving to at least 13 years of age, more than doubling the previously reported maximum lifespan of 5.6 years. Across the population, relative telomere length (rTL) showed no overall decline with age. However, sex-specific models revealed clear divergence: males tended to have longer rTL than females but showed significant age-related shortening, whereas females exhibited stable rTL across the observed age range. The pattern of telomere stability in females aligns closely with results observed in long-lived bats of the Myotis genus while male-specific attrition suggests differential physiological and life-history costs between the sexes. Overall, the findings here challenge previous assumptions about the lifespan and ageing biology of M. molossus, demonstrate that telomere maintenance is not limited to temperate bats and reinforce the value of long-term field studies for understanding ageing processes in the wild.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1), a central glycosyltransferase enzyme that regulates lipoprotein metabolism and hemostasis, is a promising therapeutic target. To evaluate its therapeutic potential as a protective variant, B4GALT1 p.Asn352Ser was introduced into the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of healthy mice and APOE*3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mouse models of metabolic syndrome, using editing oligonucleotides and the endogenous adenosine deaminases acting on RNA enzyme. The impact on hepatic glycosylation and systemic lipid homeostasis was investigated using multi-omics profiling. Editing of B4GALT1 messenger RNA (~9-18%) resulted in substantial reductions in total cholesterol (-61%), apolipoprotein B (-72%), LDL-C (-30%), fibrinogen (-55%) (all p < 0.05) and triglycerides (-27%), without altering B4GALT1 expression. Proteomics of plasma and liver identified early suppression of lipogenesis and lipoprotein assembly, followed by sustained suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis and coagulation pathways. Glycomic analysis revealed remodeling of circulating glycoprotein architecture, consistent with altered B4GALT1 activity. Transcript-protein concordance was strongest in lipid pathways, while glycosylation and coagulation showed domain-specific regulatory patterns.

These processes rely on cohesin's ability to tether sister chromatids and form chromatin loops, which depend on cohesin's ATPase activity and Eco1-mediated acetylation of two lysine residues (K112 and K113 in budding yeast) in its Smc3 subunit. How cohesin's ATPase activity and acetylation integrate to control cohesin functions remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed chromatin architecture in yeast mutants with altered cohesin acetylation and/or ATPase activity. We find that acetylation of either K112 or K113 is sufficient to produce a wild-type chromosome structure with loops positioned at cohesin-associated regions (CARs), whereas loss of acetylation at both residues abolishes positioned loops, indicating that acetylation at either lysine alone can maintain wild-type chromatin architecture. We further show that a cohesin acetylation mutant, despite being defective in sister-chromatid tethering and thus failing to establish cohesion, still forms wild-type-like loops, while cohesion-competent mutants lack positioned loops. These results suggest that the activities required for cohesion and loop formation are mechanistically separable, arguing against passive loop capture. Moreover, a mutant with reduced ATPase activity showed a loop profile similar to wild type, indicating that cohesin with lower ATPase activity can still form wild-type chromatin architecture. By contrast, hyper-ATPase mutants accumulate positioned loops, suggesting that increasing ATPase activity can enhance loop processivity. Together, our findings support a multilayered regulatory model in which acetylation fine-tunes ATPase output and cohesin functions to shape genome architecture.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

The system enables precise, nitrogen source-dependent gene regulation and is validated using the BUF1 melanin biosynthesis gene. Replacement of the BUF1 promoter with pMoNIA1 produces a clear phenotypic switch from wild-type dark gray/black pigmentation under inducing conditions (KNO) to buff/tan under repressing conditions (glutamate). Molecular confirmation verified correct cassette integration, and quantitative RT-PCR showed a 44-65-fold repression of BUF1 expression under repressing conditions, substantially stronger than previously reported pMoNIA1 systems.

Here, we map the molecular landscape and trafficking mechanisms that control the presentation of I-O proteins on cancer cell membranes. Employing APEX2-mediated proximity biotinylation and a custom antibody generation and validation platform, we identified approximately 140 high-confidence I-O proteins, primarily ribosomal, proteasomal, chaperone, and translation factors, notably enriched in protein families associated with stress-response pathways. Validation of 500 antibodies encompassing 40 I-O targets across seven tumor cell lines confirmed selective and robust surface localization, while in vivo imaging in mouse xenografts demonstrated pronounced and tu-mor-specific antibody accumulation. I-O proteins were absent on PBMCs and in normal tissues, indicating cancer cell selectivity. Functional analyses revealed that I-O protein tethering to the membrane is dependent on heparan sulfate interactions; enzymatic removal of these glycans led to the clearance of I-O proteins from the cell surface. Notably, the removed proteins returned to baseline levels within six hours, indicating a dynamic balance related to ER-Golgi trafficking and cellular stress. Nearly half of these I-O proteins overlapped with known stress granule components; however, stress elements that promote stress granule formation do not similarly affect surface display of I-O proteins. Furthermore, I-O proteins are present on standard cancer cell lines under lower stress levels needed to induce stress granule formation, suggesting parallel yet mechanistically distinct aspects of the stress response. These findings position I-O display as a new paradigm in protein trafficking, different from traditional secretion pathways and closely linked to stress response.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Diverse proteins support the transport of specific mRNAs, however, mechanisms coordinating mRNA translocation are unclear. We report that that CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) is a key regulator of RNA dynamics through activity-dependent phosphorylation of the RNA cap guanine-7 methyltransferase, RNMT. Following RNA cap methylation in the nucleus, RNMT is retained on specific mRNAs. On stimulation, RNMT translocates into the cytoplasm, increasing levels of locally translated mRNAs. In the cytoplasm, CaMKII phosphorylates RNMT Thr317 on the active site, which inhibits methyltransferase activity and targets RNMT for degradation, thus limiting cytoplasmic RNMT function. RNMT mutants protected from CaMKII-dependent degradation increase locally translated, cytoplasmic mRNAs and accelerate neuronal morphogenesis. RNMT Thr317 phospho-mimic co-ordinately decreases locally translated mRNAs in the cytoplasm and reduces differentiation.

Despite a critical involvement in cancer metastasis, cardiovascular pathophysiology, and inflammatory disorders, the molecular basis of non-canonical activation and functional divergence of CXCR7 remains elusive. Here, we present a complete landscape of CXCR7 activation using a series of cryo-EM structures, and discover an atypical activation mechanism that is distinct from prototypical GPCRs. CXCR7 is maintained in a basal conformation by a unique tripartite ionic-lock involving TM5-TM6, in contrast to a broadly conserved TM3-TM6 ionic-lock in GPCRs, which is disrupted upon receptor activation. Importantly, activation of CXCR7 results in a constricted pocket and distinct surface topology on the intracellular side compared to prototypical GPCRs. Serendipitously, we capture novel dimeric arrangements of CXCR7 with an inter-protomer stitching by a native phospholipid serving as a molecular glue, and identify previously unanticipated extrahelical allosteric sites on the receptor. Surprisingly, in an intermediate state structure of CXCR7, the second extracellular loop (ECL2) displays a self-blocking conformation, in stark contrast to ECL2-mediated self-activating mechanism reported recently for some orphan GPCRs. Finally, we unequivocally establish CXCR7 as an atypical opioid receptor via a large peptide library screening and structure elucidation in complex with distinct opioid peptides imparting full receptor activation. In summary, our study elucidates an atypical mechanism of CXCR7 activation, and establishes it as an alternative, non-canonical opioid receptor target with potential for novel pain therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Four (n=4) MC3 condyles from four Thoroughbred racehorses were selected for the study. Models were generated using both pipelines and the predicted subchondral bone strain was compared. UMELB predicted smaller subchondral strain compared to UWMSN, likely due to more limited modes of deformation. Although the UWMSN pipeline can identify elevated subchondral strain in horses with high fatigue damage, it is more labor intensive and computationally expensive.

This study aims to refine the bio-manufacturing of microalgae EVs as a next-generation nanotherapeutic for OA. Microalgae species (Chlorella sorokiniana, Synechococcus sp., Leptolyngbya sp., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC1690) were screened under varying photoperiods (0h, 16h, 24h light/day) to assess the influence on viability, growth and EV production. EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, protein quantification and immunoblotting. Their antioxidant capacity, cellular recruitment, and therapeutic efficacy were evaluated in a cytokine-induced OA-like in vitro model. Our findings demonstrated that microalgae growth and EV yield were highly light-dependent, with all species maintaining high viability (>80%) across different photoperiods. Notably, Leptolyngbya sp.

Many techniques have been introduced to treat gingival recession, including connective tissue grafting, or CTG; various flap designs; GTR membranes. However, their combination with biologic modifiers has not been explored. So, The present animal study aims to histologically compare collagen membrane impregnated with recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 2 (rhFGF 2) with that of plain collagen membrane in the treatment of Millers Class I and II gingival recessions for root coverage and healing process in beagle dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 18 beagle dogs of ages between 4-6 years were included in the study. The study was conducted as split mouth study on test site collagen membrane impregnated with recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 2 (rhFGF 2) was placed, on control site plain collagen membrane was placed. Histologically bone regeneration, mineralized tissue volume, membrane remnants and clinically recession depth were analysed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the test and the control groups from baseline to 3 months (p=0.331 NS) bone regeneration, whereas, significant difference was observed from baseline to 6 months (p=0.008*). The three months histological specimen of the test and control sites showed woven bone (NB) with rich vasculature along with abundant collagen bundles. Remnants of the membrane can also be observed at the periphery with no signs of multinucleated giant cells. The six months histological report of the test site shows matured bone formation, with rich vasculature, but new bone formation was less in control group. Significant difference was seen between test and control groups for mineralized tissue formation at 6- months. (p=0.003). Highly significant difference was seen for membrane degradation in test group (p=04;0.001**) compared to control group. Significant differences were observed between the test and the control groups for the root coverage from baseline to 3 months.

Understanding alveolar microvascular dynamics and epithelial-endothelial interactions is essential for accurately modeling alveolar physiology and its dysfunction in lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, we present an open-top, membrane-free alveolus-on-chip platform incorporating self-assembled, perfusable 3D vascular networks by primary human lung endothelial cells and pericytes, co-cultured with alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells. These vascular networks were developed within 6 days under continuous flow and remained stable for at least 12 days. The inclusion of pericytes supported capillary-like vessel formation and increased gene expression of EDNRB1, a gene enriched in alveolar microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, CD31 gene expression was higher in 3D endothelial networks compared to 2D endothelial monolayers, suggesting increased cell-cell adhesion. Monocytes could be successfully perfused through the networks, expanding the platforms potential for studying immune interactions in lung disorders. Culturing AEC2 monolayers directly on the vascularized hydrogel enabled physiologically relevant cell-cell interactions without artificial membranes, while maintaining air-liquid interface conditions.

Existing multi-scale graph and transformer models capture complex WSI features effectively but struggle with efficiency. We propose an Adaptive Multi-Scale Graph Transformer (AMGT) for WSI classification that addresses this limitation through two key modules: a Self-Guided Token Aggregation (SGTA) mechanism that fuses multi-resolution features to reduce redundancy, and a Prototypical Transformer (PT) that groups similar tokens into phenotype-representative prototypes with linear complexity. This design preserves essential spatial and semantic information, substantially lowering memory cost and improving interpretability by prototypical learning. AMGT achieves superior performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 1.8% and 5.3% AUC on high-grade ovarian cancer and Camelyon16 datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate AMGT's capacity for scalable, interpretable multi-scale representation learning.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Characterizing tissue-specific (TSp) gene expression is crucial for understanding development and disease; however, traditional expression-based methods often overlook the latent regulatory grammar embedded in the non-coding DNA, particularly in distal promoter regions. Here, we introduce TSProm, a framework that specializes a DNA foundation model (DNABERT2) to decipher the long-range regulatory logic of TSp promoters at the gene isoform level. The contributions of our work are two-fold. First, we propose a novel comparative design that trains two distinct models, A: for general promoter biology and B: for TSp regulation. These models enable the precise isolation of sequence motifs around the transcription start site that uniquely define tissue identity. Second, we introduce a comprehensive explainable AI (xAI) module that integrates attention-based discovery with model-agnostic SHAP analysis for a robust, cross-validated interpretation of learned features. Applying this framework to human brain, liver, and testis promoters, we identified and validated clinically relevant transcription factors (TFs) in brain, such as SP1, MYC, and HES6, and confirmed their known roles in diseases such as gliomas and neuroblastomas. Our analysis further revealed that C2H2 zinc finger proteins are a dominant feature of the global landscape of TSp gene regulation. TSProm provides a novel and interpretable framework for identifying TSp gene regulatory elements, offering powerful computational tools for the study of tissue-specific gene regulation in normal and disease conditions.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Which of these new maps best advances specific biological analyses, however, is not obvious. To elucidate the principles of model selection, we benchmarked fourteen pLMs, spanning several orders of magnitude in parameter count, across a hundred million protein pairs, to assess how well they capture sequence, structure, and function similarity. For each model, we distinguish inherent information, i.e. signal recoverable from raw-embedding distances, and extractable information, i.e. signal revealed through additional supervised training. Three key results emerge. First, pLM protein representation space is inherently different from the space of biological protein representations, i.e. sequences or structures. Here, a size-performance paradox is salient - mid-scale foundation models are as good as much larger ones in reflecting all tested biological properties. Second, pLM representations compress and store biological information in proportion to model size. That is, a lightweight feed-forward network can be trained on embedding pairs to predict said biological properties well - a capacity dividend. Finally, we observe that a task-specific learning radically reshapes the embedding space, gaining inherent understanding of the task, but garbling any further extractions. In other words, smaller pLMs can provide efficient and compute-light general insight. Larger models are advantageous only when fine-tuning is planned to accomplish a specific task. Furthermore, representations generated by \"specialist\" models are not immediately generalizable throughout protein biology. Thus, for pLMs, bigger isn't always better.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Two major subtypes, the adrenergic and mesenchymal, are differentially governed by a subset of transcription factors that comprise the core regulatory circuit (CRC). The former subtype is often associated with MYCN amplification and is particularly aggressive and therapy-resistant, underscoring the need for novel targets. Here, we identify the multifunctional non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding (NONO) protein as a guardian of individual CRC genes, thereby contributing to survival of neuroblastoma cells with different MYCN copy numbers. Intracellular oxidation in response to auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1, rapidly down-regulated the amounts of NONO mRNA and protein in MYCN-amplified Kelly cell line. Conversely, NONO knockdown with RNA interference (siNONO) also triggered intracellular oxidation. These effects were less pronounced in the SK-N-AS cell line carrying a single MYCN copy, as well as in non-malignant HS5 fibroblasts. In Kelly cells, siNONO attenuated auranofin-induced activation of CRC genes HAND2 and PHOX2B. In line with preferential effects on NONO abundance, the Kelly cells were more sensitive than single MYCN copy counterparts to combinations of a sublethal concentration of auranofin with siNONO. Importantly, MYCN-amplified cells demonstrated a significantly suppressed clonogenic survival 14 days after transient exposure to these combinations compared with each agent alone; HS5 fibroblasts were largely spared. Our findings 1) establish NONO as a redox sensor, a non-trivial role for transcriptional proteins, and 2) justify the strategy of therapeutic targeting of MYCN-amplified tumors vulnerable to oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Polycomb targets form extremely long-range loops (long Polycomb loops) that can separate anchors up to 60 Mb. These loops predominantly occur in cells of self-renewal status such as human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), but rarely in cell lines. To identify long Polycomb loops in cancer, we initiated a pan-cancer survey of long Polycomb loops in a collection of 235 tumor samples (33 acute myeloid leukemias, 17 Breast cancer samples, 63 pediatric brain tumors, 70 prostate cancers, and 42 colon cancers). We found most cancers, including all prostate cancers and colon cancers, lack long Polycomb loops except pediatric brain tumors and certain AMLs. In pediatric brain tumors, we found the ependymoma PFA subtype (which shows globally depleted H3K27me3) notably displayed strong long Polycomb loop interactions. AML displayed more diverse levels of long Polycomb loop interactions. Most AMLs lost both long Polycomb loops with Polycomb binding loss at the loop anchors. Whereas 10% of AMLs retain long Polycomb loops as strong as in HSCs. These AMLs recurrently carry mutations in CEBPA and STAG2, which are not associated with the Polycomb complex or DNA methylation machinery. We found that long Polycomb loop strong AML is sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, which induces cell differentiation. Conversely, PRC1 component dependency can be used to predict long Polycomb loop formation in B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Our analysis suggests that the oncogenesis process antagonizes the long Polycomb loop maintenance in most cancers, yet certain cancers may still preserve strong long Polycomb loops from cell-of-origin. The maintenance of long Polycomb loops sensitizes cells to Polycomb inhibition, indicating that such loops could be an epigenomic biomarker for pharmacological or genetic Polycomb inhibition.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

However, like many anthelmintics, resistance has emerged and new solutions are needed including the discovery of new anthelmintic drug targets. In this study, we report the isolation of two unc-49 subunit mRNAs (unc-49b and unc-49c) from the canine parasitic nematode D. immitis.

This condition worsens with age, but plasma BCAA levels are downregulated in old men. The effect of age and/ sex on BCAA metabolism has been rarely studied. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze how age and sex affect BCAA levels and their metabolism in mouse tissues. Male and female young (4-month) and old (18-months) CD2F1 mice were used. BCAA levels and relevant BCAA metabolic enzymes abundance/activity in plasma, muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and heart were analyzed. Old males exhibited greater plasma BCAA concentrations compared to young males and old females, but plasma branched-chain ketoacid (BCKA) levels were lower in old mice in both sexes. Intracellular BCAA levels were lower in skeletal muscle and heart from old mice independent of sex. There was an age-sex interaction in the lever in that reduced total BCAA was seen only in old male animals. In adipose tissue, total BCKA levels were higher in old male animals. Skeletal muscle abundance of the BCAA transporter LAT1 was reduced in old females compared to young females. In the liver, female mice had higher levels of LAT1 than male mice independent of age, while total BCKD was reduced in old females compared to old males. Pp2Cm levels were reduced in old animals independent of sex. In conclusion, while there were some changes in plasma and tissue BCAA/BCKA levels in response to age/sex, such changes were largely not consistent with changes in tissue BCAA catabolic enzyme abundance/activity. This suggests that protein levels of BCAA catabolic enzymes are preserved in aging in healthy animals and likely only become dysregulated in disease states.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Further, we show that IRE1`s endonuclease activity is required for TOR regulation, acting independently of the canonical IRE1/bZIP60 unfolded protein response. Instead, it occurs via Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) of specific transcripts. We identify RAPTOR1b as a direct RIDD target, establishing a mechanistic link between ER stress sensing and TOR signaling. RIDD-mediated degradation of RAPTOR1b mRNA is required for appropriate ABA responses and stress adaptation.

We used a combination of high-throughput root phenotyping and targeted metabolite profiling to examine three leaf terpenoid chemotypes of common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare). Using a phenotyping platform, we tested whether (i) root-chewing wireworms induce root terpenoids locally and alter shoot terpenoids systemically, (ii) phloem-feeding aphids elicit chemotype-dependent responses, and (iii) chemotypes differ in root-system development. After root establishment, the plants were exposed to wireworms (Agriotes spp.) and aphids (Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria), both separately and together, and were then monitored for 60 days. The chemotypes differed in inducible chemistry and root architecture. Chemotype 1 developed the fastest-growing root systems and the highest root:shoot ratios. Wireworms increased stored root sesquiterpenoid levels by more than twofold in chemotypes 1 and 2, whereas chemotype 3 was largely unresponsive. Aphids did not alter root terpenoids, but significantly increased leaf monoterpenoid emissions in chemotype 1 without affecting stored pools. Therefore, storage and emission were decoupled and depended on both organ and chemotype. Our analysis reveals a compartmentalized, chemotype-specific defense strategy in tansy, highlighting the coordinated regulation of the root system and inducible chemistry.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

However, T-cell responses to homocitrullinated peptides remain largely unexplored. We investigated these responses in a humanized HLA-DR4-transgenic (DR4tg) mouse model of RA, which expresses the strongest genetic risk factor for this disease. Methods: DR4tg mice were injected subcutaneously with a homocitrullinated peptide called HomoCitJED while control mice received phosphate-buffered saline. After 10 days, T-cells were analyzed for their phenotypic characteristics, cytokine production, and proliferative capacities in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spleens by flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and ProQuantum immunoassays. Results: HomoCitJED immunization drove robust expansion of T helper (Th) 1, Th17 and hybrid Th1/Th17 CD4+ T cells in dLNs, alongside elevated CD25 activation marker within these subsets. Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed effector activity, revealing higher frequencies of IL-17A+, TNF-a/IL-17A+, and IFN-y/IL-17A+. CD4+ T cells from dLNs also up-regulated the exhaustion markers LAG-3 and Tim-3.

Virulent strains of ASFV cause a severe and often fatal illness, while attenuated strains are usually associated with mild symptoms. Naturally-occurring attenuated strains are typically deleted of more than 20 genes located at the viral genomes extremities. Whether other key differences between virulent and attenuated ASFV strains may contribute to the virulence phenotype remains however largely unexplored. In this work, we sought to determine how the dynamics of viral gene expression may shape the hosts innate immune response to ASFV infection and contribute to ASFV virulence. We conducted a medium-throughput transcriptomic study to characterize the viral transcriptome of a panel of virulent and attenuated strains (171 viral genes), as well as the host response of ASFV-infected macrophages (92 host genes). Confocal imaging allowed further characterization of cellular response to infection, by assessing the dynamics of IFN and NF-{kappa}B pathway activation in ASFV-infected cells. Our results indicate that the two types of viral pathotypes exhibit global differences in the dynamics of genome replication and viral transcription. Virulent ASFV strains displayed a burst of viral transcription early on, while attenuated strains tended to replicate to higher levels at late time points. The host response was much more pronounced in cells infected with attenuated strains compared to virulent ones, with higher expression levels of interferon-stimulated genes, some innate immunity sensors, and the inducible chaperone HSP70.2. Unexpectedly, genotype I and genotype II virulent strains exhibited some notable differences in their kinetics of viral genome replication and in the host response they provoked, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines being induced by genotype II strains. Confocal imaging analysis of ASFV-infected primary macrophages revealed that attenuated strains, but not virulent ones, caused the translocation of both p65 and STAT2 to the nucleus. Strikingly, we identified a group of 26 viral genes that were either expressed at higher levels or at an earlier stage of infection by virulent strains. Several of these genes, such as R298L, H233R, DP71L and MGF505-7R encode for proteins that inhibited the type I Interferon response in a reporter cell line system.

Additionally, it cycles nsp9 through NMPylation-deNMPylation to generate GpppN. It is unclear how the distinct substrates, 5'-pppA-RNA and NTP, are bound, and how NiRAN balances RNAylation versus NMPylation. Earlier models proposed a common base-up pose for both the substrates. Here, structure-guided mutagenesis and reconstitution assays show that 5'-pppA indeed binds base-up during RNAylation, revealing that nsp12-Asp711 confers adenine selectivity, whereas, NTP adopts a perpendicular base-out pose during NMPylation. NiRAN intrinsically favors NMPylation over RNAylation, but nsp13 NTPase activity flips this preference.

Yeast Swc5, a BCNT family member, is an essential subunit of the yeast SWR1C chromatin remodeling complex that catalyzes the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z. Direct connections between CFDP1, H2A.Z deposition, and the mammalian SWR1 homolog, Snf2-Related CREBBP Activator Protein (SRCAP), have not been identified. Here, we perform detailed biochemical reconstitution and characterization of the human SRCAP complex (SRCAP-C). We find that CFDP1 weakly interacts with SRCAP-C in a salt concentration-dependent manner. SRCAP-C purified under a high-salt condition does not co-purify with CFDP1 and is inactive in H2A.Z dimer exchange reaction, but the addition of exogeneous CFDP1 restores the H2A.Z deposition activity of SRCAP-C, demonstrating that CFDP1 is required for H2A.Z dimer exchange by SRCAP-C. We show that CFDP1 stimulates the basal ATPase activity of reconstituted SRCAP-C, suggesting a requirement for CFDP1 in regulating intrinsic catalytic ATPase activity. Consistent with this idea, CFDP1 deficiency in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) leads to a genome-wide reduction of H2A.Z, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3 deposition, accompanied by the upregulation of developmental genes normally marked by these modifications. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into how CFDP1 regulates histone variant H2A.Z deposition by SRCAP-C.

When the proteasome function is impaired due to cellular stress like mutations, chemicals or epigenetic stressors, there is accumulation of unfolded or misfolded, ubiquitinated proteins leading to cellular toxicity. Cells combat this rise in cellular toxicity by sequestering ubiquinated proteins in a transient cellular structure called the aggresome. The transport of this ubquitinated protein cargo along the microtubules to form aggresomes and their clearance from cells by autophagy is called the aggresome processing pathway (APP). APP activation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases and has also been implicated in Influenza A Virus uncoating step. To study the dynamics of APP and the compositional diversity of the aggresome, we used time-dependent proximity labeling, mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Here, we used vimentin (VIM) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), two established aggresome markers as baits to visualize aggresome formation and clearance in HeLa cells.

Further, we characterised the time-dependent protein-protein interactions in the neighbourhood of VIM and HDAC6 during APP progression. Our study identified new interactors of VIM and HDAC6 that maybe involved in aggresome clearance by autophagy. Together, our findings uncover novel APP-associated proteins that are central to advancing the understanding of this poorly characterized and highly complex pathway implicated in multiple diseases.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

While numerous molecular cues have been implicated in regulating these processes, the influence of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, an essential hormonal pathway for male muscle physiology, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that AR expression defines quiescent MuSC and acts as a safeguard of their dormancy. Integrated multi-omic analyses reveal a redistribution of AR binding from quiescence-maintenance loci to regulatory elements driving activation and metabolic reprogramming during repair. Loss of AR at puberty disrupts this balance, precipitating premature cell-cycle entry, skewed divisions toward symmetric differentiation, depletion of the stem cell reservoir, and destabilization of the niche. These defects converge with hallmarks of aging-associated androgen decline, while androgen supplementation restores regenerative competence.

In Drosophila, six OA receptors have been identified: Oamb, Oct2R, Oct1R, Oct2R, Oct3R, and Oct-TyrR, and they have been linked to different behavioral and physiological processes. Here, we investigated the evolutionary characteristics of these receptors across Drosophila species. We found that OA receptors are generally found as single-copy genes. Notably, Oct2R and Oct3R exhibit positive selection within the melanogaster group, though in different structural regions from one another. The positively selected sites in Oct2R are exclusively located in regions important for ligand binding, whereas those in Oct3R are predominantly found in regions crucial for signal transduction. Interestingly, Oct2R remains highly conserved outside the melanogaster group, so the detection of positive selection in its ligand-binding related domains within this clade raises the possibility that it has evolved an additional, melanogaster-specific ligand interaction(s), among other potential reasons. These findings highlight the evolutionary flexibility of aminergic signaling and suggest lineage-specific adaptations of OA receptor function in Drosophila, likely shaped by lineage-specific selective pressures.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Coupled with absolute gene expression quantification, dynamics of development orchestrated at transcript level can be elucidated with high precision. The resolution of this precision can be further improved by studying organisms as close as possible to their basic entities, single cells for example or single embryos. Here, we collected developing embryos of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly, Ceratitis capitata) at hourly time-points for the first 15 hours of development. The medfly is an organism of huge economic importance in agriculture due to its wide host range including apples, pear, citrus, olives, etc. We simultaneously isolated total RNA and genomic DNA from single embryos and sexed the embryos using Y-specific PCR assays. The RNA, spiked with external ERCC standards to aid in absolute quantification, was used to perform Nanopore long-read RNA-seq. We developed a genome-guided transcriptome assembly based on full-length transcripts and identified a total of 22,875 transcripts comprising 3879 novel genes, missed in the current NCBI predicted gene models. We show that, indeed, the absolute quantification of gene expression performs superiorly to relative quantification in highly dynamic systems such as developing embryos. Further, we used unsupervised clustering and lineage tracing algorithms to group and accurately place embryos along a pseudo-temporal development trajectory. We show that medfly embryos undergo successive waves of zygotic genome activation. We discover a dramatic reorganization of maternally deposited mRNA occurring within the first 3 hours of egg laying followed by maternal-to-zygotic transition. We finally identify modules of temporal synexpression and elucidate the biological role of these modules.

M.", "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is characterized by thickened airway mucus that impairs mucociliary clearance and promotes persistent bacterial infections. These chronic infections, primarily caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, lead to progressive lung damage and respiratory failure, which are the leading causes of mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. Although antibiotics remain the cornerstone of treatment for such airway infections, incomplete bacterial eradication often contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This study explores whether the efficacy of conventional antibiotics can be enhanced through co-delivery with antibacterial metal ions released from borate-based bioactive glasses. To evaluate this combination therapy, we developed an in vitro airway infection model that replicates key features of the cystic fibrosis airway environment. The model incorporates a layer of bronchial epithelial cells, a mucus-like hydrogel, and bacteria deposited using an aqueous two-phase system. Multiple bioactive glass formulations were evaluated for their ability to augment antibiotic activity and enhance bacterial eradication. The results demonstrated additive or synergistic antibacterial effects against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, while maintaining mammalian cell viability. These findings suggest that metal ion-antibiotic combination therapies delivered via bioactive glasses may improve treatment outcomes for cystic fibrosis-related infections and reduce reliance on high-dose or prolonged antibiotic regimens. Such approaches hold promise not only for cystic fibrosis patients but also for broader clinical applications where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

In particular, no immunotherapy option has been approved in T-ALL yet. Here, a novel dual antibody engineering approach for targeting CD7 was evaluated. The chimeric CD7 antibody chimTH69 was modified by Fc engineering to improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In addition, it was conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent. The resulting Fc-optimized antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), designated chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE, showed a unique set of effector functions in vitro. It triggered ADCC by mononuclear cells at picomolar concentrations, mediated ADCP by macrophages and directly inhibited the growth of a panel of T-ALL cell lines by delivering the cytotoxic compound to induce G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, due to its specific linker design, chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE demonstrated bystander killing activity against CD7-negative leukemia cells. In mice, CD7-directed therapy with chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE inhibited the growth of subcutaneous CCRF-CEM T-ALL xenografts. Moreover, chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE exerted strong antileukemic effects in a phase II-like patient-derived xenograft preclinical trial in pediatric and adult patients when applied in an experimental overt leukemia setting. ChimTH69-DE-vcMMAE induced minimal residual disease-negativity in one PDX model.

We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 541 samples spanning primary HCC, HPBL, CHOL, and FLC tumors, alongside 21 liver cancer cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Through systematic variance analysis, we identified 2,523 highly variable genes distinguishing cancer subtypes and cell lines, then performed correlation analyses, unsupervised clustering, and pathway enrichment to assess molecular similarities. Molecular subtypes within each cancer type were identified through hierarchical clustering and characterized using pathway analysis. HepG2 cells showed strongest correlation with HPBL (r=0.62), confirming their hepatoblastoma origin despite frequent HCC misclassification. This correlation was driven by shared Wnt pathway dysregulation signatures. Huh7 cells best represented HCC, particularly the immune-modulatory, MYC-activated subtype with the highest median correlation. RBE cells optimally modeled CHOL, specifically the dedifferentiated, immune-evasive subtype. Several commonly used cell lines (LO2, SMMC-7721, MHCC97L) and specific publicly available samples demonstrated likely HeLa contamination.

While squamous metaplasia, mucin hypersecretion, and ciliary dysfunction are hallmark features of smoking-related airway disease, analogous data for EC exposure are limited. To address this gap, we employed a 3D human tracheobronchial epithelial tissue (hTET) model derived from airway basal stem cells and exposed it daily to NJOY ACE (Classic Tobacco) aerosols (1 or 5 puffs) or clean air for 1, 2, or 3 weeks. Remodeling was assessed via immunolabeling and Western blot analysis. MUC5AC expression revealed a transient hypersecretory response, peaking at week 2 and declining by week 3. Multiparametric analysis demonstrated progressive squamous remodeling: early ciliary loss and involucrin upregulation emerged by week 1, with severity increasing in a puff-dependent manner. By week 2, tissues exhibited marked ciliary depletion, altered epithelial thickness, horizontal nuclear reorientation, and elevated involucrin. At week 3, both exposure groups developed a squamous metaplasia phenotype, characterized by involucrin-positive squamous cells replacing ciliated cells. Quantitative analysis confirmed sustained involucrin elevation, with the 1-puff group reaching levels comparable to the 5-puff group by week 3. These findings delineate a sequential pathological trajectory initiated by EC aerosols, progressing from transient goblet cell activation to squamous metaplasia.

Kleptoplasty is a special case of algae-herbivore interaction, where the host animal or protist sequesters the chloroplasts from their prey algae as kleptoplasts inside their own cells. In some kleptoplastic sea slugs, the kleptoplasts can remain functional for months without the help from the algal nucleus, and the fundamental mechanisms in place to achieve this are still largely unsolved. Unlike in purely symbiotic systems like corals, the importance of nutrient balance to kleptoplast longevity has not been addressed in kleptoplastic sea slugs. We studied the phosphate and nitrogen exchange between the sea slug Elysia timida and its Acetabularia acetabulum derived kleptoplasts in various nutrient depletion and replenishment experiments. Our results show that sea slugs consumed phosphate from their surrounding medium and were able to recover electron transfer rates of kleptoplasts originating from phosphate depleted algae, suggesting that the sea slug provided the acquired organelles with phosphate to the extent that they increased the photosynthetic capacity remarkably well. Additional available phosphate in the water also increased the overall longevity of the kleptoplasts. The sea slugs were not able to recover the photosynthesis of nitrogen-depleted kleptoplasts, and additional dissolved nitrate and ammonium were not beneficial for kleptoplast longevity. Our results suggest that the phosphate-nitrogen balance inside the sea slug cells is mainly limited by phosphate, the addition of which can help the kleptoplasts maintain photosynthesis, perhaps by allowing the use of the glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) nitrogen assimilation pathway to function as an efficient alternative electron sink.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We previously performed an mRNA expression profiling study of the temporal cortex region from a cohort of autopsy samples from patients diagnosed with RTT and corresponding age, postmortem interval, and sex-matched controls. These studies identified a significant reduction in the expression of the histamine H3 receptor (HRH3) in RTT patients compared to controls. In the current manuscript, we expand this H3 receptor profiling to additional RTT patient brain samples representing distinct disease mutations and confirm significantly reduced levels of H3 receptor expression in the majority of patients compared to controls. Using mouse models of RTT and MDS, we observed reciprocal changes in H3 receptor expression across various brain areas, with Hrh3 expression being reduced in RTT model animals and increased in a mouse model of MDS. We then tested the hypothesis that phenotypes in these mouse models would be sensitive to an H3 receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively. This point is particularly salient for MDS, as there are no approved treatments available; encouragingly, however, the H3 antagonist/inverse agonist pitolisant (Wakix) has recently been approved for the treatment of narcolepsy, and we sought here to determine if there was potential to repurpose pitolisant for MDS. We evaluated both a small molecule agonist of the H3 receptor, (R)-[alpha]-methylhistamine (RAMH), and pitolisant in RTT and MDS models, respectively, to determine impacts on phenotypes in these disease models.

Therefore, it is significant to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of OUD and identify more effective therapies. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids are self-organized 3D tissues and mimic in vivo human organs. Increasingly, human-specific features of opioid abuse are being investigated using emerging brain organoids, which faithfully model the key functional, structural and biological complexities of neural tissues. However, a significant limitation of brain organoids is the absence of microglia which plays a fundamental role in OUD-related remodeling of neural circuits. In this pilot study, using hiPSC KOLF2.1J cell line, we developed our approach for generating both midbrain organoid and microglia and verified that our midbrain organoid was successfully integrated with microglia. We found that chronic exposure to morphine triggers key elements of immune responses including increased TNF signaling and downregulation of sirtuin3 (Sirt3, a mitochondrial protein, preventing oxidative stress) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, located in the mitochondrial matrix) in microglia-organoid co-cultures. Our findings suggest that immunocompetent midbrain organoids provide excellent models with which to study human-specific mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

M.; Pascoe, C.; Mookherjee, N.", "abstract": "Background: During airway inflammation, chemokines, oxylipins (bioactive lipids) and cationic host defence peptides (CHDP) are enhanced in the lungs. However, the interplay of these molecules in the process of airway inflammation is not fully resolved. The human cathelicidin CHDP, LL-37, can enhance the expression of chemokines which is turn facilitates influx of leukocytes into the lungs. Moreover, LL-37 can get citrullinated during inflammation and the effect of this post-translational modification on LL-37-mediated immunomodulatory functions remains unclear. Therefore, in this study we aimed to define the impact of LL-37 and citrullinated-LL-37 (citLL-37) on oxylipins and its association with downstream chemokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), and its functional impact on leukocyte influx. Methods: We used a lipidomics approach to identify oxylipins that are enhanced in response to LL-37 and citLL-37 in HBEC. We further examined the role of selected oxylipins in LL-37- and citLL-37-mediated chemokine production by ELISA, and related leukocyte migration using a transwell migration assay. Results: We showed that LL-37, but not citLL-37, enhances oxylipins that are known to promote inflammation such as prostaglandins regulated by the cyclooxygenase (COX pathway). Although both LL-37 and citLL-37 upregulated COX-2, LL-37-mediated increase in COX-2 expression was significantly higher than that mediated by citLL-37. We showed that upregulation of COX-2 expression was dependent on the P2X7 purinergic receptor. Our mechanistic studies revealed that LL-37-mediated increase in chemokines, GRO, IL-8 and MIP-3, was dependent on the COX-2 pathway. Our results also indicated that COX-2-induced PGE2 may act in an autocrine manner signaling through its EP receptors to facilitate LL-37-induced chemokine production. We functionally confirmed that factors secreted from HBEC in response to LL-37, but not citLL-37, promotes neutrophil migration which is COX-2 dependent. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that pro-inflammatory responses mediated by LL-37 is alleviated by citrullination of the peptide. These findings suggest that citrullination of LL-37 may be a post-translational regulatory mechanism to control inflammation.

Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in hemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater, a member of the Nimrod receptor family, reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts hemocyte adhesion to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of Acetyl CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1 and DRP1.

D.; Bisserier, M.", "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease characterized by pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and right ventricular failure. Despite recent advances, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and curative treatments are still lacking. Loss of BMPR2 signaling is a hallmark of PAH pathogenesis, yet the mechanisms leading to BMPR2 destabilization are not fully defined. Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in the degradation of BMPR2 and downstream signaling proteins; however, the regulation of Smurf1 and its therapeutic potential remain largely unexplored. Methods: We assessed Smurf1 expression in lung tissues from PAH patients, experimental animal models, and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). Epigenetic regulation of Smurf1 was examined using ChIP-qPCR, EP300 gain- and loss-of-function studies, and pharmacological inhibition with the selective EP300 inhibitor A485. Functional consequences of Smurf1 inhibition were evaluated in vitro using transcriptomic profiling, proliferation assays, and BMPR2-Smad signaling analyses. In vivo therapeutic efficacy was tested in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats treated with the selective Smurf1 inhibitor Smurf1-IN-A01. Results: Smurf1 expression was elevated in PAH patient lungs, experimental models, and PAECs. Increased histone H3K27 acetylation and EP300 occupancy at the Smurf1 promoter implicated epigenetic activation. EP300 inhibition reduced H3K27ac enrichment, suppressed Smurf1 expression, and restored BMPR2 signaling. Smurf1 blockade with Smurf1-IN-A01 reprogrammed the transcriptomic landscape of PAH-PAECs, downregulating inflammatory, fibrotic, and angiogenic gene networks. Functionally, Smurf1 inhibition decreased pathological endothelial proliferation and enhanced BMPR2-mediated Smad1/5/9 activation. In vivo, Smurf1-IN-A01 improved pulmonary hemodynamics, reduced vascular remodeling and fibrosis, and restored BMPR2 signaling in MCT-PAH rats. Conclusions: Our study identifies Smurf1 as an epigenetically regulated driver of endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PAH. Targeting Smurf1 restores BMPR2 signaling, reprograms pathogenic processes, and offers a novel therapeutic strategy for PAH.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Beyond a short and degenerate consensus sequence, the molecular mechanisms underlying PUS7-mediated pseudouridylation remain unknown. A lack of targeted, high-throughput pseudouridine detection methods limits simultaneous interrogation of PUS7 regulatory features across many experimental conditions. We developed novel Nanopore sequencing tools, including Nano-Mod-Amp, to reveal pseudouridine stoichiometry, its RNA structural context, and dependence on PUS7 levels at specific sites across biological conditions. We identified a novel RNA structural signature that is associated with more efficient mRNA modification by PUS7. Pseudouridines are largely responsive to modulations in PUS7 protein levels, demonstrating the regulatory potential of varying PUS7 levels across cellular conditions.

F.; Genduso, C.; Andre, Z.; Tomlinson, A.; Perry, M. W.", "abstract": "The evolution of more complex brains required existing neurons and neural circuits to accommodate new inputs. The genetic and developmental mechanisms that enable such integration are largely unknown. Butterflies evolved more complex retinal mosaics through the addition of a second R7 color photoreceptor per ommatidium (unit eye). In Drosophila, the unique R7 makes a stochastic choice to express one of two opsin genes. In butterflies, the two R7s make two independent stochastic cell fate choices in each ommatidium, producing three ommatidial types instead of the two in flies. Here, we investigate the developmental basis of this change and how the butterfly brain accommodates an expansion in sensory receptor input. We first identified the developmental mechanisms that specify the second R7 cell. We then modified Drosophila retinas to have butterfly-like transcription factor expression, causing recruitment of an additional R7. The two R7s make independent stochastic choices, like butterflies, leading to three stochastically distributed ommatidial types instead of two. In Drosophila, each of the two subtypes of R7s connects to one of two types of Dm8 neurons. Dm8 neurons of both types are born in excess, with Dm8s that are not connected to their cognate R7s undergoing apoptosis. In the presence of extra R7s in butterfly-like retinas, additional Dm8s are retained, leading to two Dm8s per medulla column. We propose a model in which population-level variation in the ratio of R7 subtypes produced in the retina maintains an excess pool of two types of potentially interacting partners in the brain, thus providing developmental flexibility which allows brains to accommodate additional inputs. We demonstrate how excess neurons that are eliminated in normal development facilitated the expansion of color vision in butterflies, and similar cooption events may represent a general mechanism of neural evolution.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we generated an integrative multi-omics map of human CD4 T cell activation and differentiation, combining phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, and chromatin accessibility under Th0, Th1, and iTreg polarization. Within 10 minutes of activation, we observed rapid phosphorylation changes of RNA-binding proteins accompanied by degradation of effector-associated transcripts, preceding chromatin remodeling and later transcriptional activation of the same genes. Moreover, our data highlights how site-specific phosphorylation refines TF activity during T cell differentiation and activation, and identifies CDK1 as a regulator of Th1 effector function. Indeed, we found that a low dose of CKD1 inhibition impairs IFN-{gamma} expression and pro-inflammatory differentiation, while preserving regulatory features in iTregs. Single-cell multi-omic profiling upon CDK1 inhibition revealed how CDK1 activity shapes subset-specific gene regulatory networks, which are enriched for genetic variants associated with immune-traits. Specifically, CDK1-sensitive TFs, including IRF8, connect immune trait heritability to enhancer accessibility at IFNG and TNF loci.

The pentangular polyphenol core of TLN-05220 is decorated with a piperazinone moiety, yet the enzymes responsible for the construction of this uncommon modification from amino acid precursors are unknown. Synthetic piperazinone-containing molecules have diverse antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory bioactivity profiles, and determining biosynthetic routes for the assembly of this heterocycle may enhance drug discovery and medicinal chemistry efforts.

Stable isotopic feeding studies coupled with liquid chromatography--tandem mass spectrometry (LC--MS/MS), identified L-alanine, L-serine, and glycine as metabolic precursors of TLN-05220.

This procedure involves the replacement of damaged and infected pulp tissue with viable tissue that restores the normal tooth structure and function. Antimicrobials are currently used to control the infection; however, they are cytotoxic to stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAP) and can lead to root canal calcification. Management of these teeth requires a scaffold that can control root canal infection, wick the blood into the canal, and support the viability and differentiation of SCAP while inhibiting intracanal calcification. This study aims to develop a composite scaffold made of polyphosphate, a calcium binding inorganic polymer shown to promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, chitosan, a natural antimicrobial polymer that supports stem cell viability and activity, and copper, a metal ion with bactericidal properties. Methodology: The scaffold was prepared by adding copper (Cu) to chitosan solution, followed by polyphosphate. The resulting scaffold was then freeze-dried and analyzed for elemental composition, chemical structure, release of Cu, antibacterial properties, cytotoxicity, as well as differentiation and mineralization assays. Data were analysed by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post hoc test. Result: This study demonstrates that, by combining polyphosphate and chitosan, we could fabricate a scaffold that inhibits bacterial growth by 40 % and supports the viability of fibroblast and SCAP. Adding copper to this scaffold further increased bacterial growth inhibition by up to 68% while preserving cell viability. The immunocytochemistry and Alizarin Red staining revealed that this scaffold also supports the odontogenic differentiation of these stem cells while inhibiting their mineralization potential. Furthermore, this scaffold can be fabricated as a 3D cone-shaped scaffold with a strong vertical wicking ability at a rate of 0.5 mm/s and excellent degradability, with 53 % of the scaffold degraded after 28 days.

However, identifying rare, cell type-specific causal mutations remains challenging due to their low frequency within heterogeneous cell populations. Traditional bulk sequencing approaches lack the resolution to detect rare variants, underscoring the need for novel methods specifically designed for single-cell data of heterogeneous cell populations. Methods: We present an integrated single-cell multi-omics computational framework, SCARCE (Single-Cell Analysis of Rare Clonal Events), tailored for single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) to statistically prioritise rare somatic mutations within defined cell subpopulations. By comparing variant frequencies across subpopulations, identified through either variant-based clustering or cell type annotation from surface marker expression, we identify variants enriched in specific cell populations. Our method applies multiple user-adjustable filters and statistical enrichment tests to distinguish true somatic variants from technical artifacts. Results: SCARCE successfully identifies rare somatic mutations across three distinct datasets using technologies including MissionBio Tapestri and clonally-amplified whole-genome sequencing of single cells. We demonstrate that SCARCE correctly isolates and identifies true variants in a cell population comprising just 10 of 16,316 cells (0.06% of the total population). Furthermore, in an extensively characterised sample with known causal variants, SCARCE correctly identifies all known pathogenic variants among its top-ranked candidates.

It plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular metabolism-linked proliferation of PDAC cells, both under 2D and 3D conditions. Analysis of clinical datasets suggested that patients with elevated YIYA expression generally experience reduced survival in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, YIYA was found to regulate cellular energy metabolism and promote a Warburg phenotype, thereby facilitating the rapid proliferative status of PDAC cells. YIYA-mediated effects were found to be dependent on KRAS. Interestingly, the RIP assay revealed that YIYA interacts not only with KRAS but also with an important enzyme catalyzing the final step of the biochemical process, glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). YIYA was found to be predominantly localised in the cytoplasm, protecting the stability of the KRAS protein under a hyperglycaemic state. Importantly, YIYA knockdown enhanced autophagy-mediated degradation of KRAS. Our study is the first to identify YIYA as a glucose-responsive lncRNA in PDAC cells, and to reveal a novel YIYA-mediated connection between oncogenic KRAS signalling and metabolic reprogramming.

Although molecular fingerprints of aging are diverse, many converge on disruption of the interrelated and overlapping communication networks that coordinate molecular activity. Here, we apply information theory to quantify age-related corruption in gene regulation by modeling regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes (TGs) as a multi-input multi-output communication channel. Using an analytically tractable probabilistic model and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues, we find that the mutual information (a measure of information transfer) between TFs and TGs declines with age across all ten tissues analyzed, establishing loss of regulatory information transmission as a hallmark of aging. Structural analysis of the regulatory network reveals that aging degrades communication primarily through input distribution mismatch, reflecting a loss of coordinated TF activity, rather than channel corruption, or the inability of TFs to reliably activate or inhibit their targets. This mismatch is caused by increased network centralization and loss of stabilizing feedback motifs, leading to reduced robustness to random perturbations. Notably, in silico upregulation of a small set of TFs restores youthful information transfer and gene expression levels, suggesting that targeted reinforcement of key regulatory nodes may rejuvenate aged networks.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Based on these findings, we propose a model in which vibrotactile perceptual judgments are inherently, but flexibly, coupled to actions.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

L.; Konshina, E.; Mitchell, P.; Gu, C.", "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an indispensable, selectively permeable interface that controls the entry and exit of nutrients, ions and waste products into the brain. Despite its biological importance, most measurements of BBB permeability rely on dyes that suffer from nonspecific signals, lack of spatial fidelity, and incompatibility with longitudinal or repeated measurements. Here we present HaloTrace: a method which leverages the HaloTag ligand-receptor tool to generate a precise spatiotemporal readout of BBB integrity that avoids major pitfalls of existing methods. We present evidence that the fluorescent HaloTag ligand has minimal interactions with blood contents but can enter the brain specifically at sites of BBB dysfunction, where it covalently binds to nearby HaloTag receptors. The ligand accumulates in the brain during its short lifetime in circulation and is stably anchored in place for at least 24 hours. Unlike existing tracers, free ligand is not retained in the blood vessels at detectable levels, so the entirety of ligand fluorescence represents true BBB leakage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HaloTrace can quantify BBB permeability at multiple discrete timepoints prior to the experiment endpoint. This offers researchers the ability to study the progression or resolution of BBB permeability in a way current methods cannot. HaloTrace is thus uniquely poised to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of BBB leakage in mouse models.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Existing methods often involves lengthy mechanical disruption and protein extraction, which not only require large starting materials but also can cause significant variations, compromising quantitation accuracy. Here, we present an in-cell proteomics strategy and benchmark its performance against conventional processing methods using several model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor. The comprehensive datasets from this study indicate that the on-filter in-cell (OFIC) processing-based in-cell proteomics strategy can eliminate cell lysis of plant leaves and pollen grains, and process proteins directly, enabling the identification of 9,000 to 12,000 proteins from leaves, and 7,000 to 9,000 proteins from pollen grains using one-shot LCMS. The OFIC strategy demonstrated broadly equivalent or better performance over conventional approaches in the context of simplicity, speed, digestion effectiveness, and quantitation accuracy. Applying the strategy to investigate plant leaf infection of N. benthamiana leaves revealed interesting signature proteins that respond differentially to host-adapted Colletotrichum destructivum and nonhost-adapted Colletotrichum sublineola fungus. The single-vessel approach bypasses cell disruption, substantially simplifying plant sample preparation while reducing the required sample input and enhancing proteomic sensitivity.

As a case in point, recent work has identified novel metal-free phosphotriesterases with a cysteine-containing triad in the active site capable of rate accelerations of up to 1013 in kcat/KM. Here we expand this exploration and observe sequence-structure-function relationships of a range of homologous proteins from the dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) family, revealing 10 new phosphotriesterases. Four new crystal structures provide clues to mechanism, suggesting--based on phylogenetic and structural analysis--that phosphotriesterase activity is mediated by 'lid' loops surrounding the active site with activity correlated over 4 orders of magnitude to loop flexibility. These insights allow protein engineering by loop grafting across homologues, resulting in increased phosphotriesterase activity in a human enzyme.

To that end, we hypothesize that dynamic modulation of hydrogel stiffness during the process of vasculogenesis, recapitulating changes observed during embryonic development, would improve vascular network formation. Using our Collagen I/Norbornene-modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel system, we swelled in additional crosslinker and photoinitiator and exposed the hydrogel to UV light, enabling hydrogel stiffening at user-defined time points with no significant effect on cell viability. We observed that in situ stiffening at early time points, prior to the onset of significant cell migration, resulted in more robust vascular network formation relative to unstiffened controls, while stiffening at later time points disrupted existing vascular networks. These trends continued in in vivo experiments in nude mice, with cell-laden hydrogels stiffened at early time points resulting in improved blood flow, while those stiffened at later time points had the opposite effect. We hypothesized that this was due to differential impacts of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation following in situ stiffening, as supplementation with a Rho kinase inhibitor, downstream of FAK, partially reversed the effects of in situ stiffening. Taken together, this research demonstrates the benefits of incorporating dynamic cues into hydrogel design to create more physiologically relevant vasculature.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Based on fossil faunal assemblages, it has been hypothesised many macropodids lived in sympatry during the Pleistocene, however, local geographic and dietary overlap is equivocal due to taphonomic uncertainty. Modern macropodid species rarely exhibit sympatry, suggesting anthropogenic or environmental changes may have disrupted these communities. Using Sr and C isotopes, we reconstruct foraging ranges and dietary preferences of several fossil macropodid lineages recovered in Middle Pleistocene cave deposits, at Mount Etna Caves, central eastern Queensland, Australia. Our results show that most macropodids, baring a single Petrogale potentially dispersing > 60 km, had limited foraging ranges and remained within 15 km of the fossil site. Moderate to large scale dispersal in individual Petrogale mirrors male-biased dispersal observed in some modern Petrogale populations indicating some individuals have the propensity to move between isolated colonies when corridors for dispersal are present. Smaller macropodids show dietary preferences similar to modern counterparts, while Protemnodon exhibit a division between C3/C4 intake, potentially indicating species-level differences. The analysis of geographic range and diet of this fossil assemblage reveals that macropodids partitioned on the landscape around the cave with a C3-dominant community, comprised of Protemnodon, Petrogale, and Thylogale, to the northwest, and a C4-dominant grassland community, comprised of Notamacropus and isolated members of Protemnodon and Petrogale, to the south. Therefore, we conclude, that although faunal assemblages alone suggest a larger number of macropodids living in sympatry, isotopic proxies uncover complex habitat partitioning between C3 and C4 environments around Mount Etna Caves.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Age-related changes to mitochondria lead to oxidative damage and dysfunction and are proposed to occur early in the trajectory of sarcopenia, supporting the candidacy of mitochondrial-protective therapies. Here, we test the efficacy of mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15 in age-dependent sarcopenic mouse models. Methods: Male and female MitoQC mice aged 24 months received either standard chow or chow supplemented with BAM15 (0.033% mg/g) ad libitum for eight weeks (n=13-14/group). Young (3-month-old) mice served as reference controls (n=8/group). Muscle mitochondrial respiration was assessed in permeabilized fibres, and contractile function was measured in isolated extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. Mitophagy was quantified by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Data were analyzed using one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett or Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. Results: Aged male and female mice exhibited reduced gastrocnemius muscle mass relative to body mass compared with young controls (p<0.05; ~18% and ~32% loss, respectively). BAM15 did not alter muscle size but reversed the age-related loss of contractile function in EDL muscles, to that of the young reference controls in both sexes (p<0.05; ~33% in males, ~16% in females). In male mice, BAM15 improved mitochondrial efficiency, evidenced by restoration of Complex I-linked respiration and decreased proton leak (~52% improvement; p<0.05), and normalized protein levels of oxidative stress marker 4-HNE, without changes in mitophagy or mitochondrial content. In females, BAM15 did not improve mitochondrial parameters, which may be, in part, due to aged female muscle exhibiting unchanged Complex I leak and 4-HNE protein abundance, alongside lower complex I subunit (NDUFB8) protein abundance. Conclusions: BAM15 improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency and contractile function in aged male mice, supporting the potential of mitochondrial uncoupling as a therapeutic strategy for sarcopenia.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Synbiotics, combining probiotics and prebiotics in a synergistic formulation, have emerged as promising candidates to replace antibiotics. This study evaluated the efficacy of dietary synbiotics as alternatives to early-life antibiotic supplementation in broiler chickens, examining their effects on growth performance, gut morphology, and immunity. A total of 80 mixed-sex Cobb 500 broiler chickens were allocated to a 2 x 2 factorial design investigating synbiotic supplementation (Bacillus subtilis and dried fermented Saccharomyces cerevisiae extract) and enrofloxacin treatment (days 0-5) administered via drinking water. During the initial growth period (days 0-7), synbiotic supplementation reduced body weight gain compared to controls. However, synbiotic x antibiotic interactions were observed during days 7-14 and 14-21, where synbiotics without antibiotics produced the highest weight gain in the second week, while controls without either treatment achieved superior performance in the third week. Feed intake was increased by synbiotic supplementation during days 7-14, while antibiotic treatment consistently elevated feed consumption throughout multiple periods and overall trial duration. Feed conversion efficiency was initially impaired by synbiotics (days 0-7) but improved during days 14-21. Antibiotic supplementation resulted in a poorer overall feed conversion ratio. Gut morphological analysis revealed significant synbiotic x antibiotic interactions for duodenal length and empty weights of duodenum and caeca, with synbiotics enhancing these parameters only when combined with antibiotic treatment. Both synbiotic and antibiotic supplementation independently reduced ileal content weight, while antibiotic treatment specifically decreased ileal weight and caecal length. Immune function evaluation through heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios demonstrated a tendency for interaction, where synbiotics reduced this ratio in the absence of antibiotics but showed no effect when combined with antibiotic treatment. Neither treatment affected spleen or bursa weights, indicating minimal impact on immune organ development. These findings suggest that while dietary synbiotics show promise as alternatives to antibiotics in broiler production, their efficacy varies depending on concurrent antibiotic exposure and growth phase. Synbiotics demonstrated beneficial effects on gut morphology and stress markers, particularly when administered without concurrent antibiotic treatment, supporting their potential as functional alternatives in antimicrobial-free poultry production.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Their \"single-circuit\" centralized nervous systems allow evaluation of oxidative stress, a key driver of ALS-FTD pathology, which was induced via hydrogen peroxide. In this study, 180 planaria underwent three phases. Phase 1 established baseline memory using a 28-day operant conditioning protocol with a light-based training device. Success was determined by the proportion of planaria in concentric circles defined as zones (A-C) with a respective gradient descent of light concentration. Phase 2 determined hydrogen peroxide (H2O2;) concentrations sufficient to induce oxidative stress that triggered regenerative signaling and neuronal damage without lethality. Phase 3 applied the optimal concentration, allowed regeneration, and retested memory. The optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide was 5 ppm, triggering blastema formation and neuronal damage while preserving viability. Zone occupancy analyses utilizing prior found concentration revealed measurable post exposure shifts: Zone A increased initially but trended lower post-exposure, Zone B increased, and Zone C decreased significantly. These results indicate that while memory capability persists after neurogenesis, the quality of memory decreases.

Here, participants completed a spatial auditory selective attention task while we measured hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Participants listened to a target sound stream and a simultaneous spatially separated speech stream or white noise masker. Sound streams were spatialized with either 50 s ITDs, 500 s ITDs, naturally occurring ILDs from a non-individualized HRTF, or broadband 10 dB ILDs. Behavioral results revealed a stronger effect of spatial cues when the masker was speech. Error patterns differed in the two difficult conditions, small ITDs and natural ILDs: small ITDs produced lower hit rates, while naturally occurring ILDs produced higher false alarm rates. Small ITDs led to greater activity in prefrontal cortex and activity in superior temporal gyrus that was lateralized, greater in the hemisphere contralateral to attentional focus, consistent with previous reports. These results suggest that natural ILDs alone support source segregation even if they are insufficient to cause large shifts in perceived lateralization, explaining high false alarm rates (confusions between target and distractor words). In contrast, small ITDs alone may be insufficient to segregate competing sources, leading to low hit and false alarm rates.

We demonstrate its utility in blocking lysinoalanine crosslinking between subunits of the spirochete flagellar hook by targeting the native form of the FlgE protein, which differs from the strategies used in previous assays. The flagellar hook protein FlgE self-catalyzes the formation of a lysinoalanine (Lal) inter-subunit crosslink that is essential for the motility, and thus, infectivity of spirochetes. Prevention of Lal crosslinking through inhibition with small molecules thus represents an avenue for therapeutic development against spirochete-related diseases, such as Lyme and syphilis. Screening a library of ~700 compounds with the ELISA confirmed that hexachlorophene, currently the only known inhibitor of Lal crosslinking in FlgE, effectively inhibits the crosslinking reaction.

PDHs within the Bacilaceae phylum contain an ACT domain which enables them to be allosterically regulated by tyrosine. The mechanism via which the ACT domain introduces allostery onto PDH enzymes remains elusive. Furthermore, the evolutionary and biological advantages of ACT domain mediated regulation of metabolic pathways are highly debated. Building on our previous study, in which we solved the crystal structure of a Bacillus antraces ACT-containing PDH and proposed a model for its allosteric regulation by tyrosine, we now present further structural, and functional analyses in support of this model. In this study, we generated truncated PDH protein constructs lacking the ACT domain, determined their crystal structure and evaluated the role of tyrosine in modulating their enzymatic activity. We determined that the truncated PDH remains catalytically active, however, it is no longer allosterically regulated by tyrosine. Comparative structural analysis between the truncated PDH and PDHs naturally lacking the ACT domain that are known to be competitively inhibited by tyrosine revealed only minor changes in a loop region in the prephenate binding site. Attempts to introduce amino acids identified from the competitively inhibited PDH into the truncated construct did not restore tyrosine sensitivity, even at high concentration. This indicates that additional main chain amino acids away from the substrate binding site also contribute competitive inhibition by tyrosine. Analysis of a highly represented phylogenetic tree revealed that ACT containing PDHs are predominantly distributed amongst Firmicute and Actinomycetota. Representative organisms from both groups colonize nutrient limited and extreme environments. This distribution suggests that acquisition of the ACT domain may confer an evolutionary advantage by enabling organisms to efficiently partition chorismate, the end product of the shikimate pathway, for the biosynthesis of tyrosine and other essential aromatic compounds.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

For each, we create protein contact networks (PCNs) and residue interaction graphs (RIGs) based on existing network theory and methodology. We characterize and analyze these protein networks by comparing how each network architecture affects values of small-worldliness. We reexamine a previous method that focused on using node degree, closeness centralities, and residue solvent accessibility to predict functional residues within a protein via a Jackknife technique. We discuss the implications of the construction of these networks based on how the structure information is acquired. We demonstrate that functional residues within small proteins cannot be reliably predicted with the Jackknife technique, even when provided with a curated dataset containing representative standardized values for degree and closeness centrality. We show that functional residues within these small proteins have low degrees within both PCNs and RIGs, thus making them susceptible to the known degree bias towards high degree nodes present in using graph convolutional networks. We discuss how understanding the data can be used to further improve deep learning approaches for small proteins.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Genetic diversity among strains within the colony has the potential to impact symbiont function and subsequently the benefits that honey bees receive from them. Mobilized genes vectored by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) like phages, transposons, conjugative elements and plasmids, are known to rapidly alter bacterial phenotypes. We identified phages and plasmids in genomes of the symbiont Bombella apis between two colonies, with the goal of understanding which MGEs contribute to strain diversification as well as MGE distribution across colonies and between microbial species. Interestingly, we found some B. apis strains carry plasmids while all harbor a diversity of integrated phages, with only one phage clusters conserved across all. Identified B. apis phages are not found outside of the Bombella and Saccaribacter species, suggesting some host specificity for these MGEs. Of the five plasmids discovered, two appear to be phage-plasmids with high similarity to phages found in previously sequenced B. apis genomes. Interestingly, three plasmids in B. apis shared significant average nucleotide identity with known plasmids from acetic acid bacteria isolated from flowers, plants, and fermented foods. This result suggests that B. apis has acquired MGEs, either vertically or horizontally, from plant- and fermented-food associated AABs. Overall, our findings suggest that MGE content varies between colonies and has the potential to shape genetic and phenotypic variation between strains.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

R.; Behrends, V.; Larrouy-Maumus, G.; McQuail, J.; Wigneshweraraj, S.", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is essential for bacterial growth, and adaptation to N starvation involves extensive reprogramming of gene expression. A hallmark subcellular feature in long-term N starved Escherichia coli cells is the presence of biomolecular condensates of the major bacterial RNA regulator Hfq. The Hfq condensates, which accumulate gradually during N starvation, contribute to adaptation by modulating RNA metabolism and central metabolic pathways. Metabolites play central roles in stress responses, often acting as modulators of protein function to support survival and recovery. Glutathione (GSH), a universal stress protectant, has broad roles in bacterial stress adaptation, yet its function during N starvation remains unexplored. Using a GSH-deficient mutant ({Delta}gshAB), we show that GSH is required for optimal survival and recovery from prolonged N starvation. We reveal that GSH regulates the temporal dynamics of Hfq condensation and dissipation during starvation and recovery, respectively, via an as-yet unknown mechanism. Notably, these two functions of GSH appear mutually exclusive, highlighting its pleiotropic role in the adaptive response to N starvation that potentially extends its canonical function as a stress protectant.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that alpine lake bacteria populations harbor diverse antiviral strategies against bacteriophages that could be used to fight against other viral pathogens. To evaluate the presence of bacteria with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in high altitude Swiss lakes, we developed a sampling campaign in 24 alpine lakes in Switzerland. We assessed the decay of two human viruses (echovirus 11 and influenza A virus) in lakewater and characterized the microbial abundance and metabolic diversity in the collected samples. In addition, we obtained a collection of 223 bacterial isolates and selected bacteriophage resistant bacteria to build synthetic communities with enhanced antiviral activity against the two tested human viruses, and one plant virus of commercial significance (Potato Virus X). This confirmed our hypothesis and drew for the first time a relation between bacteriophage resistance and viral inactivation.

Women are disproportionately affected, with ~50% experiencing at least one UTI during their lifetime and 20-30% suffering from recurrent infections. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which accounts for ~75% of cases, employs diverse virulence factors to persist and evade host immunity. Rising antibiotic resistance, driven by widespread antimicrobial misuse, is eroding treatment efficacy and highlights the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies. To uncover novel vulnerabilities under physiologically relevant conditions, we constructed a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library in the UPEC reference strain E. coli CFT073 and systematically profiled gene fitness in rich media versus human urine. The screen revealed multiple pathways that are conditionally essential for UPEC growth in urine, including iron uptake, envelope maintenance, and the biosynthesis of arginine, methionine, and branched-chain amino acids. Notably, we identified acetolactate synthase (ALS) II as the sole active isoform supporting branched-chain amino acid synthesis in urine. Functional validation further demonstrated its druggability: introducing a re-sensitizing mutation overcame the protein's intrinsic resistance to the ALS-targeting herbicide sulfometuron methyl, restoring sensitivity.

This study employs a germ-free pig model to investigate the transplantation of the nasal microbiome into the respiratory tract, exploring its potential to colonize multiple body sites and its impact on host immunity. Using germ-free piglets inoculated with nasal microbiota from healthy donors, we examined the dynamics of microbial community formation across the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and assessed the effects of antibiotic intervention. Our findings reveal that specific taxa, predominantly from the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, cross colonized both respiratory as well as gastrointestinal tract. This cross-colonization highlights the adaptability of nasal microbiota and suggests a significant role in modulating host immunity through the gut-lung axis. The administration of the antibiotic tulathromycin on day 11 post-inoculation altered both nasal and gut microbiota compositions, reducing microbial diversity and impacting immune gene expression and cytokine profiles. These results underscore the complex interactions within the gut-lung axis and emphasize the implications of antibiotic use on microbial health and host immunity.

In both the marine environment and the intestinal track, V. cholerae forms biofilms; a key question regarding the lifestyle of V. cholerae is how do the diverse substrates that it encounters influence its biofilm formation and, in turn, shape its ecological interactions. Here, we use the predator-prey interaction between Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and V. cholerae as a model to explore how the environmental chitin substrate alters V. cholerae biofilm formation and predator-prey interactions. We find that glass-bound biofilms provide strong protection for V. cholerae against predation while also allowing a population of predatory B. bacteriovorus to remain in place. In contrast, chitin-bound biofilms offer less protection against B. bacteriovorus predation and do not maintain a stable population of B. bacteriovorus. Using percolation and population dynamics models, we predict that these changes in predator-prey dynamics can be mostly explained by alterations in biofilm architecture between the two conditions, which changes the fraction of prey available to B. bacteriovorus. Performing targeted biofilm matrix deletions, we confirm this prediction by recapitulating key features of the chitin predator-prey interactions on glass surfaces. Following on this observation, we show that V. cholerae biofilms grown on chitin produce much less of the canonical biofilm matrix components and instead rely on other extracellular structures. Overall, our experiments detail how growth substrate can alter biofilm matrix composition and how these changes in biofilm architecture and cellular arrangement can impact higher-order ecological interactions.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Structural studies suggest that BS recognition occurs through a toehold-mediated strand-invasion mechanism, in which U2 snRNA progressively base-pairs with the intron to form the branch helix. However, given the limited complementarity between U2 snRNA and the intronic BS, it remains unclear how spontaneous strand invasion can occur. Here, using all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show that strand invasion proceeds spontaneously once the toehold region is engaged and the TAT-SF1 factor is released. The key finding is that the branch-stem loop (BSL) of U2 snRNA is maintained in a supercoiled, high-energy conformation by TAT-SF1, which acts as a molecular latch holding the BSL in a poised \"loaded-spring\" state. Displacement of TAT-SF1 allows the BSL to relax, releasing the stored conformational energy that drives strand invasion through local strand-slip and base-pair exchange. Moreover, the simulations reveal that strand invasion can proceed bidirectionally, refining previous models of U2-BS pairing. This work establishes a loaded-spring mechanism as a key physical driver of toehold-mediated strand invasion underlying branch-site recognition within the early spliceosome.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

The most visible changes include a massive reduction of the endosymbiont genome and the development of novel host organs, cells, and compartments specialized for harboring the symbionts. However, many insect symbiosis studies have previously focused either on Proteobacteria or only on a particular symbiosis stage, limiting our broad understanding of how and why symbiont diversity arises from specific microbial clades, how the symbiont genomes erode over evolutionary time, and what the consequences of symbiosis are for diverse host-symbiont pairs. Thanks to the repeated gains and losses of nutritional symbionts, scale insects provide an ideal evolutionary playground for tracking the parallel transitions of insect symbionts that originated as independent evolutionary replicates from the same bacterial phylum. Using extensive genome sampling across the scale insect phylogeny, we recapitulated the path of Bacteroidota transitioning from recently established host-associated bacteria to highly specialized insect endosymbionts with minimal gene sets. Their genomes exhibit strikingly parallel patterns of gene loss and pseudogenization across all gene categories, with some stochastic differences in essential genes for genetic processing and amino acid biosynthesis. In addition to the genetic transition, we show with imaging methods that the symbiotic cells and organs exhibit a trend from more dispersed bacteriocytes to highly compact (and likely more specialized) bacteriomes, which are closely localized to the host digestive system. Our results outline at both genomic and cellular levels a recurrent path by which insect symbioses independently arise, are temporarily maintained for up to several hundred million years, and then are replaced by new symbionts that repeat the process. The gradual nature of the process implies that the outcomes of symbiosis initially depend on how professional vs. naive the host and symbiont are.

In this study, a comprehensive characterization was undertaken on twelve different types of sterile F1 hybrid males among the crosses between four species of Drosophila bipectinata species complex which are experiencing reproductive isolation. Comparing the mating latency and copulation duration among the pure species and hybrids, showed a significant increase in the mating latency of hybrids but the duration of copulation among certain hybrids of Drosophila bipectinata, Drosophila parabipectinata and Drosophila malerkotliana showed no significant reduction in the copulation time and emphasized the strong influence of X chromosome inheritance of hybrid genome. Experimental ablation of antennae demonstrated that male olfactory input is indispensable for heterospecific mating success, consistent with the role of pheromone detection in conspecific recognition, while tarsi ablation revealed striking sex-specific asymmetry: male tarsi removal increased heterospecific success, whereas female tarsi removal abolished mating entirely, highlighting the role of gustatory receptors in female mate choice. Testis dissections further confirmed that post-meiotic defects in hybrids, including failure of spermatid elongation and individualization, these findings demonstrates that reproductive isolation in the D. bipectinata species complex arises from the collective action of multiple barriers, prezygotic isolation mediated by pheromonal and gustatory divergence, and postzygotic sterility driven by spermatogenic failure.

Here, we generated paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and gene expression (snRNA-seq) profiles from 46,188 liver nuclei isolated from male, female and continuous GH-infused male mice to comprehensively map the epigenetic basis of hepatic sexual dimorphism. We identified 127,957 accessible chromatin regions genome-wide, including thousands of novel regions enriched specifically in non-parenchymal cells. Sex-biased differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) were almost exclusively hepatocyte-localized, and continuous GH infusion feminized their accessibility, demonstrating that plasma GH patterns alone are sufficient to reprogram sex-biased hepatocyte chromatin landscapes. Correlation-based peak-to-gene linkage analysis mapped these DARs to sex-biased gene targets and revealed that regulatory interactions are constrained by topologically associated domain boundaries. Motif enrichment analysis identified both established regulators (STAT5, CUX2, BCL6) and novel transcription factors (TFs) at sex-biased DARs. ATAC-seq footprinting revealed novel TF motifs predicted to be occupied at DARs linked to sex-biased genes implicated in MASLD, providing mechanistic insights into the male bias in fatty liver disease. Further, motif co-occurrence analysis revealed TF clusters likely cooperating to regulate sex-dependent gene expression programs. We also identified stringently cell type-specific regulatory regions with cell type-specific TF motifs that define the regulatory architecture underlying hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell identities.

Evaluating beta-diversity based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, we saw strong clustering by sample type (PERMANOVA R^2 = 0.645, p = 0.001) and no significant clustering by location (R^2 = 0.068, p = 0.937). Alpha diversity (Shannon) differed by matrix (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.000416), with sediment and water highest and oyster tissues lowest. Vibrio taxa occurred at low relative abundance across matrices but were slightly enriched in biofilms and tissues; several Vibrio phages were also detected, consistent with potential (but unconfirmed) top-down control.

It is common practice to interpret proximity in principal components (PC) space among taxa as indicative of not just morphological, but also phylogenetic affinity. This interpretation, however, has not been directly evaluated for hominins. Materials and Methods: First, we inferred the posterior distribution of hominin phylogenetic trees and subsampled trees from this distribution. On these phylogenies, we simulated 2D and 3D geometric morphometric datasets and traditional morphological datasets, containing traits analogous to measurements of size or length, with varying numbers of landmarks or traits and evolutionary rates. On each dataset, we conducted a PCA and used neighbor-joining to infer evolutionary relationships from the PC scores of each taxon. We measure the difference between the PCA tree and sampled tree with subtree pruning and regrafting distance and Robinson-Foulds distance. Results: PCA trees inferred from traditional morphometric data were identical to the sampled tree in 0.11% of datasets when we only considered PC axes 1 and 2, and in 2.9% of datasets when we considered all axes. No PCA tree inferred from any of the 2,400,000 shape datasets was identical to the sampled tree, regardless of the number of axes.

Here, we present the first high-contiguity genome of a volutid species, the tropical predatory snail Melo melo, assembled using PacBio HiFi long reads. The final assembly spans 2.29 Gb with high contiguity (N50: 18.6 Mb) and completeness (BUSCO: 92.4%). Phylogenomic analyses place M. melo as an early-branching neogastropod lineage, supporting the basal position of Volutidae within the order. Comparative genomic analyses reveal expansions of gene families associated with digestion and nutrient metabolism (e.g., metallopeptidases), neurotoxicity (conotoxin-like genes), neurotransmission (ion channels), detoxification (cytochrome P450s and ABC transporters), and innate immunity (C1q and LRR-containing proteins), among others. These expansions are consistent with the predatory behavior of M. melo and its adaptation to sediment-rich benthic habitats. Notably, M. melo lacks nacre-related genes but retains several biomineralization-related gene families previously implicated in shell and pearl formation, offering a genomic basis for investigating its distinctive non-nacreous phenotype. Orthology and CAFE analyses further reveal both conserved and lineage-specific dynamics of gene families across the analyzed gastropods. This study fills a key phylogenetic gap in molluscan genomics and establishes Melo melo as a valuable model for understanding the genomic basis of ecological adaptation and trait evolution in basal neogastropods.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

E.; Herr, A. B.", "abstract": "Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of device-related infections, primarily due to its ability to form biofilms, surface-adherent bacterial communities that confer remarkable resistance to antibiotics and host defenses. Small basic protein, Sbp, is a 16-kDa protein expressed by S. epidermidis that has been shown to be crucial for biofilm formation, but little is known about its function. Sbp features a high proportion of basic residues as well as several predicted regions of intrinsic disorder. Consistent with its high positive charge density, Sbp is shown here to interact with double-stranded DNA, a ubiquitous component of the biofilm matrix, forming soluble complexes or large aggregates with short or longer DNA oligonucleotides, respectively. The observed multivalent interaction of Sbp with DNA along with its predicted disorder suggested that it might form biomolecular condensates with DNA. Confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy revealed that Sbp and dsDNA form phase-separated droplets and/or solid aggregates, depending on the concentration and stoichiometry of Sbp and DNA as well as the DNA oligonucleotide length. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that Sbp-DNA condensate droplets initially exhibit liquid-like behavior but gradually transition to a gel-like state. This work provides the first evidence that Sbp binds DNA and undergoes biomolecular condensation, revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism that may contribute to biofilm matrix organization in S. epidermidis.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

A. J.", "abstract": "Cachexia is a complex muscle wasting syndrome that affects majority of hospitalized cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. It is often unresponsive to nutritional interventions, including provision of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine and valine). BCAA are anabolic for skeletal muscle. We wondered whether their ineffectiveness in managing cachexia might be related to altered metabolism of these amino acids, a subject that has received minimal attention. Because estrogen limits BCAA catabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of chemotherapy on cachexia in old mice would be worse in males compared to females, and that this would be related to greater tissue release of BCAA in males. To better reflect age population for which cachexia is an issue, we treated aged male and female mice (18{+/-}2 months) with the chemotherapy drug cocktail FOLFIRI (50mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5FU), 90mg/kg Leucovorin, and 24mg/kg CPT11) or vehicle twice per week for 6 weeks. This cocktail is used in treating colon cancer. Metabolism and concentrations of the BCAA and their metabolites were measured in plasma and tissues. There was a main effect of chemotherapy, reflected in reduced body weight, skeletal muscle, myofibrillar protein content, anabolic signalling and protein synthesis. In response to chemotherapy, males showed worsened outcomes for skeletal muscle weight and ubiquitinated proteins; they also had higher total plasma BCAA but reduced muscle BCAA. There was a main effect of chemotherapy in reducing the expression of the BCAA transporter LAT1. In response to chemotherapy, gastrocnemius muscle of males but not females had reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of BCKD-E1ser293, corresponding with increased activity of this enzyme. Chemotherapy reduced muscle and liver ketoacids of the BCAA only in females. These data suggest that sex differences in BCAA catabolism may be linked to the severity of chemotherapy-induced muscle damage and interventions against cachexia need to take this into account.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

NLR genes are often found in clusters of paralogs with sequence and copy number variation; whether these NLR clusters evolve in response to single or multiple pathogens has been unclear. We report here the isolation of a Phytophthora capsici resistance gene, Rpc2, along with a novel P. infestans resistance gene, Rpi-amr5, from two Solanum americanum accessions. These orthologous genes reside in the Rpi-amr1 cluster, which has previously been associated with resistance to P. infestans. By screening RXLR effector libraries of P. infestans and P. capsici, we identified multiple effectors recognized by both NLRs. Our findings highlight the complexity of NLR clusters and evolution driven by interactions with multiple pathogens.

In this work, we investigated the cis-regulatory landscape of a winter type rapeseed, Express617, across multiple sample types. Combining chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and gene expression, we annotated thousands of novel regulatory elements in the Brassica napus genome. Among those regions, we discovered and functionally characterized super-enhancers, observing an asymmetrical distribution of these regulatory elements favoring the Cn subgenome. Super-enhancer (SE) associated genes were found enriched in tissue identity and responses to stimuli related processes. We further establish and apply an in-silico validation pipeline for super-enhancers, integrating population-level expression analysis and machine learning (ML) models predicting gene expression levels. Almost 50% of the newly identified SE-associated genes had an observed expression higher than the expression levels predicted by the ML model. Moreover, structural variants disrupting super-enhancer elements correlate with a reduction of expression in the associated genes, both consistent with the positive effect of these regulatory regions. These results greatly expand the functional annotation of rapeseed and contribute to a better understanding of the link between regulatory elements and their target genes and processes, providing novel insights and targets for B. napus (epi)-genome editing strategies.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

We find that neuronal deletion of ZMYND11 in mice causes aberrant upregulation of non-neuronal gene programs, leading to reduced dendritic branching and spine density, as well as hyperactivity and abnormal motor behavior. We investigated the mechanism by which ZMYND11 regulates gene expression and discovered that ZMYND11 interacts with and inhibits the histone methyltransferase KMT2A (MLL1), a transcriptional co-activator which contributes to oncogenic and developmental gene programs. We find that a ZRSID-associated ZMYND11 point mutation abrogates ZMYND11 interaction with KMT2A, suggesting that this interaction is critical for the function of ZMYND11 in regulating brain development. Using a degron-tagged ZMYND11 mouse model to enable the rapid degradation of ZMYND11 in primary cortical neurons, we show that gene expression changes induced by ZMYND11 loss are attenuated by treatment with the KMT2A inhibitor revumenib, a drug which has recently been approved for the treatment of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our findings shed light on the convergence of chromatin mechanisms regulating neuronal gene expression and raise the possibility that modulation of KMT2A activity may be a useful therapeutic avenue for ZRSID.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Despite recent advances with pluripotent stem cell-based approaches, there are no models that robustly recapitulate pancreas morphogenesis or the spatial organization of ductal, exocrine, endocrine and mesenchymal cells seen in the native organ. Here, we introduce a new pluripotent stem cell-based pancreatic organoid that captures the complexity seen during pancreatic development, with budding and stratification of multipotent progenitors followed by formation of a ductal network that give rise to peripheral acini. We identify a critical role for mesenchyme-derived factors to robustly promote pancreatic organoid formation and morphogenesis. Human pancreatic organoids are correctly patterned, with functional exocrine acini secreting digestive enzymes into a ductal network. Comparative analysis confirms that the pancreatic organoids are similar to early second trimester human pancreas, with potential to further mature upon transplantation in mice. Finally, we show that endocrinogenesis can be reproduced in organoids, generating functional islet-like clusters interspersed within the ductal network. Together, this represents an exciting new platform to study human pancreas development and a broad array of pancreatic diseases.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Evolutionary studies of vertebrate vision have mainly focused on the light-sensitive opsins neglecting the downstream phototransduction cascade. Here, we investigate patterns of gene loss and expression across jawed vertebrates, providing clarity on the evolution of phototransduction. We next focus on an ecologically diverse sample of frogs represented by whole-eye transcriptomes and genomes from 113 species. We tested the hypothesis that phototransduction genes were lost in the common ancestor of frogs due to nocturnality and that functional differences in phototransduction are driven by variation in habitat, activity pattern, and life history. Across frogs, we recovered 38 of 39 vertebrate phototransduction genes, with all but one of these (GUCA1B2) consistently expressed in frog eyes. This contrasts the high level of gene loss found in other ancestrally nocturnal tetrapods (e.g., mammals and snakes) and is more similar to ray-finned fishes. More than other ecological traits, we found that loss of the larval aquatic life stage (direct development) and inhabiting aquatic and semiaquatic habitats as adults were most strongly associated with shifts in selective strength, with widespread signals of both positive and relaxed selection across frog phototransduction genes. These findings suggest that phototransduction is under different functional constraints in aquatic versus terrestrial light environments and that shifts in the use of these environments have played a strong role in frog visual evolution. Collectively, these results reinforce that frogs are of particular interest for vertebrate visual evolution because they span both an evolutionary and an ontogenetic transition from vision underwater to vision on land.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

However, while ELISA is well-suited for organisms where sample blood can be readily obtained, its application is considerably more challenging in smaller organisms, particularly Drosophila, which has gained widespread use in recent years for physiological studies. Here, we present sensitive phage display-mediated immuno-PCR (PD-iPCR) to detect Drosophila hemolymph proteins via two approaches: 1) by identifying high-affinity nanobodies through phage-display library screening and subsequent affinity maturation and 2) by generating a knockin fly line producing secreted proteins tagged with tandem NanoTags composed of VHH05 and 127D01. Using these approaches, we successfully established PD-iPCR to detect insulin-binding ImpL2 protein in fly hemolymph. Notably, the tandem NanoTag-based sandwich PD-iPCR enabled picomolar detection of tagged antigens, allowing us to quantify elevated ImpL2 levels in the hemolymph of starved flies and those bearing Yki-induced gut tumors.

S.; Ngambenjawong, C.; Ko, H.; Patel, S.; DeAgazio, C.; Fleming, H. E.; Bhatia, S. N.", "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are a major global health threat. Despite the critical need for new antimicrobials, progress is constrained by protracted development timelines, as well as the requirement for chemical novelty to avoid cross-resistance. Repurposing therapeutics approved for indications other than infection offers a potential shortcut to rapidly develop new antibiotics that are outside of existing antibiotic classes and therefore less susceptible to resistance. Cancer therapeutics, which often disrupt essential cellular processes that are evolutionarily conserved within bacteria, are a promising source of novel antimicrobial candidates. However, the narrow therapeutic index of these compounds limits their application for infection. Here, we establish a two-component strategy to repurpose highly toxic therapeutics as antimicrobials by improving their safety profile, using the cytotoxin calicheamicin as a proof-of-concept. In the first arm, we engineer a conditionally-active drug conjugate that restricts calicheamicin activity to infected tissue, improving its therapeutic index. In the second arm, we administer a re-engineered self-resistance enzyme from Micromonospora echinospora, the natural producer of calicheamicin, as an antidote to neutralize calicheamicin released outside of infected tissue, further widening its therapeutic index. The calicheamicin conjugate exhibits activity against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens in response to a protease present within the infected microenvironment. Delivered in combination with the antidote, we demonstrate that antibacterial efficacy is maintained, and off-target toxicity is reduced in a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia. We anticipate that our dual strategy, which enhances drug safety by combining conditional activation of drug activity with neutralization of off-target effects, provides a generalizable framework for repurposing other promising but toxic compounds as antimicrobials.", "date": "2025-10-31", "journal": ""}

Through evaluation on binding affinity datasets spanning single-mutant panels and combinatorial mutants, we demonstrate that CDR-focused training produces superior embed-dings for functional prediction.

Our compact 600M ESM-C model achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or exceeding larger antibody-specific baselines.
