Mps1 is a conserved kinase involved in controlling aspects of chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. The mechanistic explanation for the Mps1-addiction of aneuploid cells is unknown. To address this question, we explored Mps1-dependence in yeast cells with increased sets of chromosomes. These experiments revealed that in yeast, increasing ploidy leads to delays and failures in orienting chromosomes on the mitotic spindle. Yeast cells with elevated numbers of chromosomes proved vulnerable to reductions of Mps1 activity. Cells with reduced Mps1 activity exhibit an extended prometaphase with longer spindles and delays in orienting the chromosomes. One known role of Mps1 is in recruiting Bub1 to the kinetochore in meiosis. We found that the Mps1-addiction of polyploid yeast cells is due in part to its role in Bub1 recruitment. Together, the experiments presented here demonstrate that increased ploidy renders cells more dependent on Mps1 for orienting chromosomes on the spindle. The phenomenon described here may be relevant in understanding why high-ploidy cancer cells exhibit elevated reliance on Mps1 expression for successful chromosome segregation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLosing or gaining chromosomes during cell division leads to aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) and can contribute to cancer and other diseases. Indeed, most cells in solid tumors carry abnormally elevated numbers of chromosomes. Mps1 is a regulator of the machinery that distributes chromosomes to daughter cells. In tumors with elevated chromosome numbers, the expression of Mps1 is often also elevated. In some aneuploid tumor cell lines these elevated Mps1 levels have been shown to be critical for tumor survival. To determine how cells with higher ploidy become dependent on Mps1, we explored Mps1-dependence in yeast cells with increased numbers of chromosomes. We report that yeast cells with elevated chromosome number are sensitive to reductions Mps1 expression. In cells with high ploidy and reduced levels of Mps1, the progression of the cell cycle is delayed and the ability of the cells to properly orient and segregate their chromosomes on the spindle is greatly reduced.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

L.; Beningo, K. A.", "abstract": "Traction force and mechanosensing (the ability to sense the mechanical attributes of the environment) are two key factors that enable a cell to modify its behavior during migration. Previously, it was determined that the calpain small subunit, calpain 4 (CapnS1), regulates the production of traction force independent of its proteolytic holoenzyme. A proteolytic enzyme is formed by calpain 4 binding to either of its catalytic partners, calpain 1 and 2. To further understand how calpain 4 regulates traction force, we used two-hybrid analysis to identify more components of the traction pathway. We discovered that basigin, an integral membrane protein and a documented inducer of matrix-metalloprotease (MMP), binds to calpain 4 in two-hybrid and pull-down assays. Traction force was deficient when basigin was silenced in MEF cells, and this deficiency was also reflected in the defect in substrate adhesion strength. Unlike Capn4-/- MEF cells, the cells deficient in basigin had normal mechanosensing abilities. Together, these results implicate basigin in the pathway in which calpain 4 regulates traction force independent of the catalytic large subunits.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

To overcome this, our brains sustain sensory information in working memory. Although keeping that information accurate while acting on it is vital, humans display two canonical biases: estimates are biased toward a few stimuli (stimulus-specific bias) and prior decisions (decision-consistent bias). Integrative, especially neural mechanistic, accounts of these biases remain scarce. Here, we identify drift dynamics toward discrete attractors as a common source of both biases in orientation estimation, with decisions further steering memory states. Behavior and neuroimaging data reveal how these biases co-evolve through the decision-steered attractor dynamics. Task-optimized recurrent neural networks suggest neural mechanisms that enable categorical decisions to emerge from working memory for continuous stimuli while updating its trajectory, warping decision-consistent biases under stimulus-specific drift.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Mutational and biochemical studies demonstrate that these inhibitors act through a unique mode of inhibition, distinct from reported SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibitors. Across a range of cancer cell lines, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition resulted in lineage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for key transcription factors (TFs). In uveal melanoma (UM), BAF inhibition resulted in loss of enhancer occupancy of SOX10 and MITF, two essential TFs, leading to down-regulation of the melanocytic gene expression program. In a mouse xenograft model of UM, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition was well tolerated and resulted in dose-dependent tumor regression correlating with pharmacodynamic modulation of BAF-target gene expression.

In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these 'multi-active-zone' (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant-eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition, the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single active zone (sAZ) synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs, but develop fewer sAZ synapses and show reduced synapse clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal activity-dependent, eye-specific differences in release site addition during synaptic competition in circuits essential for visual perception and behavior.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Efforts to elucidate the determinants of host range have focused on the repertoires of effectors in the Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). However, recently, we showed that the inability of a P. syringae pv. actinidiae strain to trigger an hypersensitive response (HR) in A. thaliana is due to an inefficient T3SS and not to the absence of a recognized effector. In this context, we compared the efficiency of the T3SS of several P. syringae strains belonging to different phylogroups. Through statistical analysis, we assessed the temporal dynamics of the induction of ion leakage, an HR indicator, in A. thaliana. We revealed that PtoDC3000 avrB and PmaM6 avrB consistently triggered a strong HR while other strains induced it at significantly different intensities depending on temperature. Among thermosensitive strains, both low and warm temperature-dependencies for T3SS efficiency were observed, irrespective of the in-vitro growth optimum of the strains. Surprisingly, differences were also observed among quasi-clonal strains. These results reveal a strong, strain-specific regulatory role of temperature in effector injection and reinforce the importance of environmental factors in the outcome of plant-bacteria interactions.

Currently, the behaviour of these methods when faced with genomic datasets from evolutionary scenarios other than the human lineage remains unknown.

This global analysis identified 60,803 fragmentation spectra corresponding to 8,801 unique substitution sites in proteins derived from 1,782 genes, including 2,000 confidently localized sites. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity.

Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize how alternatively translated proteoform ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions.

Here, bioinformatics, proteomics and fluorescence imaging identified FG-NUPs at PD. Transient expression of GFP fusions at low and intermediate expression levels supported dual localization of 12 NUPs to NPC and PD. Structured illumination microscopy detected the transmembrane anchor NUP CPR5 close to orifices of PD. cpr5 mutants showed reduced intercellular short-root (SHR) transport. However, transport defects cannot be excluded due to indirect effects in the mutants. Identification of FG-NUPs at PD is consistent with the recruitment of NUPs to form a PD pore gating complex consistent with phase separation domains as diffusion barriers at PD. Further analyses will be required to determine whether NUPs are bona fide PD components, or accumulate at PD in certain conditions, or may serve intermediate NPC storage.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Commercialized methods that allow the detection of hundreds of genes in situ, however, are expensive and therefore typically used for generating unimodal reference data rather than for resource-intensive multimodal analyses. A major bottleneck is the lack of a routine means to efficiently generate cell type data. Here, we have developed hamFISH (highly amplified multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization), which enables the sequential detection of 32 genes using multiplexed branched DNA amplification. We used hamFISH to profile the projection, activity, and transcriptomic diversity of the medial amygdala (MeA), a critical node for innate social and defensive behaviors in mice. In total, we profiled 643,834 cells and classified neurons into 16 inhibitory and 10 excitatory types, many of which were found to be spatially clustered. We then examined the organization of outputs of these cells and activation profiles during different social contexts. Therefore, by facilitating multiplexed detection of single molecule RNAs, hamFISH provides a streamlined and versatile platform for multimodal profiling of specific brain nuclei.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

C. W.; Zarin, A. A.; Baines, R.; Landgraf, M.", "abstract": "As developing neural circuits become functional, they undergo a phase of heightened plasticity that facilitates network tuning in response to intrinsic and/or extrinsic stimuli. These developmental windows are termed critical periods (CPs), because perturbations during, but not outside the CP, can lead to lasting and significant changes, such as the formation of sub-optimal or unstable networks. How separate, but connected elements, within a network might respond differently to a CP perturbation is not well understood. To study this, we used the locomotor network of the Drosophila larva as an experimental model, using heat stress as an ecologically relevant CP stimulus. We show that increasing ambient temperature elevates locomotor network activity. When applied during the embryonic CP, heat stress leads to the formation of a network that has suboptimal output; causing larvae to crawl more slowly and requiring longer to recover from electroshock-induced seizures, indicative of decreased network stability. Within the central nervous system, we find transient embryonic CP perturbation leads to increased synaptic drive from premotor interneurons to motoneurons, which in turn adopt reduced excitability. In contrast, the peripheral neuromuscular junction, maintains normal synaptic transmission, despite significant structural changes of synaptic terminal overgrowth and altered postsynaptic receptor field composition. Overall, our data demonstrate that connected elements within a network respond differentially to a CP perturbation. Our results suggest a sequence, or hierarchy, of network adjustment during developmental CPs, and present the larval locomotor network as a highly tractable experimental model system with which to study CP biology.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

To compare video-based analysis against TFTs, we collected data from 129 individuals: 28 with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, 58 with myotonic dystrophy, and 43 with typical movement. Video-based movement recordings took a median time of 16 minutes per participant. In addition to reproducing TFTs (r > 0.98), video metrics can outperform TFTs at disease classification (p < 0.001). Video-based analysis also identifies differences in gait kinematics and arm range of motion not evident in TFTs.

Most of the studies have estimated functional connectivity matrices as correlation coefficients between different brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared to partial correlation connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and following previous results by different authors, we investigate structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity time series under various regularization (a.k.a. noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match with structural connectivity retrieved from Density Weighted Imaging data than standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels. Importantly, we also show that regularization and thresholding are crucial for this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neuro-genetic associations in relation to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

We surgically relocated finger flexor and extensor muscles to examine how the CNS adapts its strategy for finger movement control by measuring muscle activities during grasping tasks. Two months post-surgery, the monkeys demonstrated significant recovery of grasping function despite the initial disruption. Our findings suggest a two-phase CNS adaptation process: an initial phase enabling function with the transferred muscles, followed by a later phase abolishing this enabled function and restoring a control strategy that, while potentially less conflicted than the maladaptive state, resembled the original pattern, possibly representing a 'good enough' solution.

Here, we present the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors for the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis based on in silico prediction and quantitative proteomic analysis of decellularized mesoglea from different life stages. The integration of the matrisome with single cell transcriptome atlases shows that gastrodermal cells are the primary producers of Nematostella's complex ECM, confirming the homology of the cnidarian inner cell layer with bilaterian mesoderm. The transition from larva to polyp is marked by an upregulation of metalloproteases and basement membrane components including all members of an unusually diversified SVEP1/Polydom family, suggesting massive epithelial remodeling. The enrichment of Wnt/PCP pathway factors during this process further indicates directed cell rearrangements as a key contributor to the polyp's morphogenesis.

We present six new contributions: (1) the development of a new model-building framework for neuron-astrocyte networks, (2) the introduction of connectivity concepts for tripartite neuron-astrocyte interactions in biological neural networks, (3) the design of a scalable architecture capable of simulating networks with up to a million cells, (4) a formalized description of neuron-astrocyte modeling that facilitates reproducibility, (5) the integration of experimental data to a greater extent than existing studies, and (6) simulation results demonstrating how neuron-astrocyte interactions drive the emergence of synchronization in local neuronal groups. Specifically, we develop a new technology for representing astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. This includes an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extended neuron model receiving calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, and a parallelized connectivity generation scheme for tripartite interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through benchmarks varying in computing resources and network sizes. Our in silico experiments reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization, demonstrating that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes.

In this study, we use human epithelial cells to investigate the interplay between the Hippo and Rho Family signaling pathways, which have predominantly been characterized as independent actin regulatory mechanisms. We identify that the RhoA effector, ARHGAP18, forms a complex with the Hippo pathway transcription factor YAP to address a long-standing enigma in the field. Using super resolution STORM microscopy, we characterize single-filament-level changes in the actin cytoskeleton that arise from CRISPR/CAS9 knockout of ARHGAP18.

Developing drugs that suppress RyR2 hyperactivation may be key to novel arrhythmia treatments. This study evaluated the antiarrhythmic potential of Ryanozole, a recently developed novel RyR2 modulator with high affinity and selectivity, using CPVT mouse models harboring mutant RyR2s. Experimental approach: In vitro effects of Ryanozole were evaluated by ER Ca2+-based assay and [3H]Ryanodine binding assay using RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. Two lines of mice with different arrhythmia severity, RyR2-R420W and -K4750Q, were employed for in vivo assessments. Intracellular Ca2+ signals were analyzed in isolated cardiomyocytes using Cal520. Antiarrhythmic effects were evaluated by ECG under catecholaminergic challenge in anesthetized mice and during spontaneous arrhythmias in conscious mice. ECG and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated before and after drug administration. Key results: Ryanozole inhibited both wild type and mutant RyR2s with similar IC50 of 15-40 nM. The inhibition was more potent at lower cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. It suppressed Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ sparks without affecting action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients. Ryanozole effectively prevented adrenaline-induced arrhythmias and rapidly terminated spontaneous arrhythmias during daily activity. Importantly, Ryanozole did not impair cardiac conduction or contractility, unlike conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Conclusions and implications: Ryanozole strongly suppresses RyR2 under diastolic Ca2+ conditions, thereby preventing the arrhythmogenic trigger of aberrant Ca2+ release. This mechanism likely provides potent antiarrhythmic effects while preserving cardiac function. Ryanozole is a promising therapeutic candidate treating RyR2-mediated arrhythmias, such as CPVT.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Despite this commonality, synucleinopathies display divergent disease phenotypes that have been attributed to disease specific three-dimensional structures of alpha-synuclein fibrils, each with a unique toxic gain-of-function profile. The Hsc70 chaperone is remarkable in its ability to disassemble pre-existing amyloid fibrils of different proteins in an ATP and co-chaperone dependent manner. We find however, using six well-defined conformational polymorphs of alpha-synuclein fibrils, that the activity of the Hsc70 disaggregase machinery is sensitive to differences in the amyloid conformation, confirming that fibril polymorphism directly affects interactions with the proteostasis network. Amyloid conformation influences not only how efficiently fibrils are cleared by the Hsc70 machinery but also the preferred pathway of disaggregation. We further show that, in vitro, the active processing of fibrils by the Hsc70 machinery inadvertently produces seeding competent species that further promote protein aggregation. Amyloid conformation thus is an important feature that can tilt the balance between beneficial or detrimental protein quality control activities in the context of disease.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

While bone marrow injury, such as by bone fracture, disrupts marrow vasculature, the consequences on local oxygen tension remain unclear. Here, we show in mice that while the tissue oxygen tension in bone marrow is low (25 mmHg, ~4% O2), intracellular oxygenation is heterogeneous and erythroid cells are high in oxygen. Bone fracture elevates oxygen tension in the injured bone marrow (>55 mmHg, ~8%), which persists for over a week post-injury. This oxygen elevation results not from angiogenesis, but rather from localized expansion of erythroid precursor cells in the injured bone marrow. The activated erythroid precursors synthesize hemoglobin and accumulate oxygen, acting as local modulators of oxygen tension. Blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake impairs hemoglobin synthesis, reduces local oxygen levels, and enhances bone regeneration through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. These findings identify erythroid precursors as active regulators of local oxygen availability in the bone marrow niche, which may be targetable to enhance tissue regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Materials and Methods: Twelve Yorkshire swine (3 female, 9 male) underwent unilateral kidney arterial embolization with either Embozene or resorbable microspheres. Angiography was performed to confirm embolization. Vessel recanalization for was determined through angiography. The effect of embolization was evaluated by assessment of serum chemistry markers and by renal histopathology at 1, 3, 7 and 28 days post-procedure. Results: Embolization procedures with both embolic agents were performed with 100% technical success. Hematology, coagulation factors and serum chemistry were largely unremarkable throughout the study period of 28 days. Alginate resorbable alginate microspheres facilitated compete recanalization and revascularisation within the initial 24hr observation window, while the permanent microsphere remained present at all evaluated time points. No inflammation was observed with resorbable microsphere whereas Embozene-induced inflammation was minimal to mild. Vascular histopathologic alteration with resorbable microspheres was limited and resolved by 24 hours, whereas Embozene caused sustained injury extending alteration to the internal elastic lamina, tunica media or adventitia. Conclusion: Alginate resorbable microsphere demonstrated effective temporary embolization with a recanalization time of around 24 hours together with complete renal tissue recovery, no systemic impact, and minimal local reaction compared to Embozene.

The pathogenesis of AFM involves infection of spinal motor neurons and motor neuron death, however the mechanisms linking EV-D68 infection to selective neurotoxicity are not well understood. Dysfunction of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has been implicated in motor neuron injury in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the NPC is also modified by picornavirus proteases during the course of infection. We therefore sought to determine the impact of EV-D68 proteases on NPC composition and function and their role in motor neuron toxicity. We demonstrate widespread disruption of NPC composition by EV-D68 2A and 3C proteases via the direct cleavage of a relatively small number of nucleoporins, notably Nup98 and POM121 by 2Apro. Using reporter systems, we demonstrate that 2Apro inhibits nuclear import and export of protein cargoes and also disrupts the permeability barrier of the NPC, while having no apparent effect on RNA export. We further show that 2Apro is toxic to induced pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons by demonstrating a rescue of toxicity with 2Apro inhibitor telaprevir at concentrations that are insufficient to inhibit viral replication. This study expands our understanding of EV-D68 neuropathogenesis and provides a rationale for targeting the NPC or 2Apro therapeutically in AFM.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Current spatial transcriptomics pipelines require researchers to use a variety of models and tools to explore spatial domains. However, few methods provide researchers with a way to jointly analyze spatial data from both annotation-free and annotation-guided perspectives using consistent inductive biases and levels of interpretability. A single framework with consistent inductive biases ensures coherence and transferability across tasks, reducing the risks of conflicting assumptions. Results: We propose the Spatial Topic Model (SpaTM), a topic-modelling framework capable of annotation-guided and annotation-free analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. SpaTM can be used to learn gene programs that represent histology-based annotations while providing researchers with the ability to infer spatial domains with an annotation-free approach if manual annotations are limited or noisy. Our benchmarking experiments reveal SpaTM's competitiveness at spatial label prediction and clustering when compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate SpaTM's interpretability with its use of topic mixtures to represent cell states and transcriptional programs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ductal carcinoma samples and how its intuitive framework facilitates the integration of annotation-guided and annotation-free analyses of spatial data with downstream analyses. Finally, we demonstrate how SpaTM can be used to extend the analysis of large-scale snRNA-seq atlases with the inference of cell proximity and spatial annotations in human brains with Major Depressive Disorder.

Fecal metaproteomics provides valuable insights by tracking changes in the relative abundance of microbial taxa and their protein functions. To ensure reliable results, it is crucial to minimize alterations in the metaproteome occurring from sample collection to protein extraction. Therefore, employing effective stabilization methods is essential to preserve the integrity of the fecal metaproteome from sample collection to laboratory analysis, particularly over long distances or when rapid freezing options are not readily available. In line with these needs, the second edition of the Critical Assessment of MetaProteome Investigation (CAMPI-2) was specifically focused on testing sample stabilization protocols to be applied before metaproteomic analysis. Results: This collaborative multicenter study assessed the ability of five different stabilization methods, based on two commercial devices and three specific reagents (acetone, lithium dodecyl sulfate, and an RNAlater-like buffer), respectively, to stabilize the fecal metaproteome during room-temperature storage (14 days) and shipment to mass spectrometry facilities. The five methods were tested simultaneously by eight different laboratories across Europe, using aliquots from the same fecal sample. After protein extraction and digestion, duplicate aliquots of the resulting peptides were analyzed independently by two mass spectrometry facilities at distinct international locations. Analysis of the mass spectrometric data using two different search engines revealed that the fecal metaproteome profile differed considerably depending on the stabilization method used in terms of richness, alpha and beta diversity, reproducibility, and quantitative distribution of main taxa and functions. Although each method showed unique strengths and weaknesses, a commercial swab-based device stood out for its remarkable reproducibility and ranked highest for most of the metrics measured. Conclusions: CAMPI-2 allowed a robust evaluation of five different methods for preserving fecal metaproteome samples. The present investigation provides useful data for the design of metaproteomics and multi-omics studies where fecal sampling cannot be immediately followed by long-term storage at -80{degrees}C. Further optimization of the tested protocols is necessary to improve stabilization efficiency and control bias in the taxonomic and functional profile of the gut microbiome.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic {beta}-cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. Indeed, TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that {beta}-cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.\n\nTeaserThis study finds that TRAF6 bridges innate immune signaling to mitophagy to promote glucose control during metabolic stress.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

A strategy to reduce genotyping costs is to genotype a few select individuals at high-density (e.g., parents, grandparents), and many others at low density (e.g., offspring), then impute genotypes. This has been demonstrated in silico for Pacific oyster Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas but was particularly challenging relative to other species and has never been empirically tested. Here, four families of Pacific oysters, bred via marker-assisted selection for variation at a locus for field survival in an ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1)-positive estuary, were exposed to OsHV-1 then genotyped using a low-density amplicon panel (n = 240 individuals). Parents were genotyped with the amplicon panel and by whole-genome resequencing. Offspring genotypes were imputed, and accuracy was determined by comparing against held-out whole-genome data for offspring. Imputation resulted in reduced minor allele frequencies and enriched homozygosity relative to empirical data. An in silico three-generation analysis was used to investigate the effect of deepening the pedigree, resulting in superior concordance in genotypes (GC = 84.5%) and allelic dosage (r = 0.73) compared to two-generation imputation (GC = 75.3%; r = 0.63). Genome-wide associations to OsHV-1 survivorship with imputed data identified significantly associated regions on the expected chromosome 8, but not at the expected position based on previous work, pointing to a potentially more complex genetic architecture for the trait. Our results empirically demonstrate the utility of amplicon panel-based genome-wide imputation in shellfish, and thus enable low-cost selective breeding techniques.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, despite strong performance across genomic loci, these models often struggle to capture inter-individual variation in gene expression. To address this, we propose personal genome training--training models to make genotype-specific predictions at a single locus. We introduce SAGE-net, a scalable framework and software package for training and evaluating S2F models using personal genomes. Using SAGE-net, we systematically explore model architectures and training regimes, showing that personal genome training improves gene expression prediction accuracy for held-out individuals. However, performance gains arise primarily from identifying predictive variants, rather than learning a cis-regulatory grammar that generalizes across loci. This lack of generalization persists across a wide range of hyperparameters. In contrast, when applied to DNA methylation (DNAm), personal genome training enables improved generalization to unseen individuals in unseen genomic regions. This suggests that S2F models may more readily capture the sequence-level determinants of inter-individual variation in epigenomic traits. These findings highlight the need for further exploration to unlock the full potential of S2F models in decoding the regulatory grammar of personal genomes.

However, some systems employ enzymes associated with degradosome or housekeeping functions, such as RNase III or the endoribonuclease RNase E. Here, the endo- and 5'-exoribonuclease RNase J was identified as an additional enzyme involved in crRNA maturation, acting jointly with RNase E in the crRNA maturation of a type III-Bv CRISPR-Cas system, and possibly together with a further RNase in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Computational tools can identify and align orthologous wild-type genetic sequences from different species; however, predictive modeling and engineering of equivalent mouse variants that mirror the nucleotide and/or polypeptide change effects of human variants remains challenging. Here, we present H2M (human-to-mouse), a computational pipeline to analyze human genetic variation data to systematically model and predict the functional consequences of equivalent mouse variants.

Comparisons of two genetically-distinct pairs of epigenetically-distinct variants, each distinguished by a stabilised arrangement of one of these phase-variable loci, found the consequent changes in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were associated with differential expression of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This relationship was hypothesised to be mediated through changes in xenogenic silencing (XS) or nucleoid organisation. Therefore the chromosomal conformation of the both variants of each isolate were characterised using Illumina Hi-C, and Nanopore Pore-C, sequencing. Both methods concurred that the organisation of the pneumococcal chromosome was dominated by small-scale structures, with most pairwise interactions between loci <25 kb apart. Neither found substantial evidence for higher-order structure or XS in the pneumococcal genome, with more complex contact patterns only evident around the replication origin. Comparisons between the variants identified phage-related chromosomal islands (PRCIs) as the foci of differential contact densities between the variants. This was driven by copy number variation, resulting from variable excision and replication of the episomal PRCIs. However, the methods were discordant in their identification of the variant in which the PRCI was more actively replicating in both pairs. Validatory experiments demonstrated that the prevalence of circular PRCIs was not determined by DNA modification, but instead varied stochastically between colonies in both backgrounds, and was metastable during vegetative growth. PRCI excision was inducible by mitomycin C, but independent of the presence of a phage. Yet transcriptional activation of these elements was affected by both signals, indicating transcription and replication are separately regulated. Therefore pneumococcal MGEs do not appear to be subject to XS, resulting in heterogeneity being generated within these bacterial populations through the frequent local disruption of chromosome conformation resulting from the stochastic excision and reintegration of episomal elements.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

For example, timescales of resting-state fMRI signals can parsimoniously predict a significant amount of the individual variability in functional connectivity networks identified in adult human brains. In the present study, we quantified and compared temporal and spatial scales in resting-state fMRI data collected from 2,352 subjects between the ages of 5 and 100 in Developmental, Young Adult, and Aging datasets from Human Connectome Project. For most cortical regions, we found that both temporal and spatial scales largely decreased with age across most cortical areas throughout the lifespan, with the visual cortex and the limbic network consistently showing the largest and smallest scales, respectively. For some prefrontal regions, however, these two scales displayed non-monotonic trajectories during adolescence and peaked around the same time during adolescence and decreased throughout the rest of the lifespan. We also found that cortical myelination increased monotonically throughout the lifespan, and its rate of change was significantly correlated with the changes in both temporal and spatial scales across different cortical regions in adulthood.

A.; Fletcher, K.; Hesford, N.; Glendinning, L.", "abstract": "BackgroundThe avian caecal microbiota plays a vital role in host nutrition, enabling non-digestible, fibrous material to be converted into compounds that can be absorbed and used as an energy source by the host. The diet of adult red grouse (Lagopus scotica) is dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), which is particularly high in fibre. It is therefore likely that the caecal microbiota plays a key role in enabling grouse to thrive on this diet. In this study, we present the first characterisation of the caecal microbiota of red grouse using modern sequencing methods.\n\nResultsWe performed metagenomic sequencing on caecal content samples from fifteen red grouse from three upland estates in Scotland. From this data, we constructed and characterised twelve high-quality, species-level metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Eleven of these MAGs could not be assigned a taxonomic label at species level, indicating that they may be novel species. MAGs belonged to diverse taxa (5 phyla) and several encoded genes and pathways for the digestion of fibres, including cellulose, hemi-cellulose, xylooligosaccharides and pectin. Several MAGs also contained antimicrobial resistance genes, predominantly related to vancomycin resistance.\n\nConclusionsThis study is the first to reconstruct commensal microbial genomes from red grouse. The caeca contain diverse, often novel, microbial taxa capable of fermenting various fibres, potentially aiding in the digestion of the red grouses high-fibre diet. Further research is necessary to explore how these bacteria support red grouse nutrition and health.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

As a result, seizures remain uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients. Brain stimulation is an emerging and promising method to treat various brain disorders, including drug-refractory epilepsy. Selected stimulation protocols previously demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing the seizure rate. The stimulation efficacy critically depends on chosen stimulation parameters, such as the time point, amplitude, and frequency of stimulation. This study aims to explore the neurobiological impact of 1Hz stimulation and provide the mechanistic explanation behind its seizure-delaying and seizure-suppressing effects. We study this effect using a computational model, a modified version of the Epileptor-2 model, in close comparison with such stimulation effects on spontaneous seizures recorded in vitro in a high-potassium model of ictogenesis in rat hippocampal slices. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of spontaneous seizure emergence, the seizure-delaying effect of the stimulation, and the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve the maximal anti-seizure effect. We show that the modified Epileptor-2 model replicates key experimental observations, and captures seizure dynamics and the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES) observed in hippocampal slices. We identify the critical thresholds in the model for seizure onset and determine the optimal stimulation parameters -- timing, amplitude, and duration -- that exceed specific thresholds to delay seizures without triggering premature seizures. Our study highlights the central role of sodium-potassium pump dynamics in terminating seizures and mediating the LFES effect.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Contrary to the common assumption that the capacity of this system is fixed with respect to a single feature dimension, recent research has shown that working memory performance for a simple visual feature - color - is improved when this feature is encoded as part of a real-world object relative to an unrecognizable scrambled object. Using EEG (N = 24), we here demonstrate that this performance benefit is supported by increased neural engagement during the retention period, as indexed by enlarged contralateral-delay-activity during maintenance. Furthermore, the pattern of neural activity across parietal-occipital electrodes was more stable across time, suggesting that real-world objects may support more robust memory representations. Finally, we report a novel fronto-central event-related potential that distinguishes between real-world objects and scrambled objects during encoding and maintenance processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that active visual working memory capacity for simple features is not fixed but can expand depending on what context these features are encoded in.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

However, the pipeline's architecture is not optimal for analyses on high-performance computing or cloud computing environments, which often involve large datasets. To optimize the pipeline, we created MTBseq-nf, a Nextflow wrapper which offers shorter execution times through parallelization along with multiple other key improvements. The MTBseq-nf wrapper, as opposed to the linear, batched analysis of samples in the TBfull step of MTBseq pipeline, can execute multiple instances of the same step in parallel and therefore makes full use of the provided computational resources. For evaluation of scalability and reproducibility, we used 90 M. tuberculosis genomes (European Nucleotide Archive - ENA accession PRJEB7727) for the benchmarking analysis on a dedicated computational server. In our experiments the execution time of MTBseq-nf parallel analysis mode is at least twice as fast as the standard MTBseq pipeline for more than 20 samples.

R.", "abstract": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques are valuable models for HIV cure research, offering insights into tissue reservoirs and testing reservoir-reduction strategies. Despite this utility, low frequencies of latently infected cells in vivo limit mechanistic studies of viral latency ex vivo. In vitro latency models have addressed this limitation for HIV, advancing our understanding of viral persistence. However, no comparable models exist for SIV. To address this gap, we developed an in vitro model of SIV latency in primary rhesus macaque CD4+ T cells, optimizing conditions to promote viral entry while maintaining cells in a minimally activated, non-proliferating state. After 12 days in culture, [~]1-3.3% of cells harbored SIV DNA, primarily as intact proviruses within central and transitional memory CD4+ T cell subsets. These cells remained quiescent, exhibiting minimal spontaneous viral protein production, but could be reactivated by potent T-cell stimulation and benchmark latency-reversing agents. Collectively, this model generates SIV-latently infected cells that resemble predominant cellular reservoirs in vivo--quiescent memory CD4+ T cells carrying inducible proviruses. This system provides a platform for investigating mechanisms of SIV latency, identifying shared and virus-specific features of HIV and SIV persistence, and evaluating strategies to reactivate or silence viral reservoirs.\n\nImportanceViral latency-HIVs ability to persist in a dormant state within CD4+ T cells-remains a critical barrier to developing a cure. Rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) are valuable models for studying HIV, but mechanistic studies of viral persistence are limited by the low frequency of latently infected cells in vivo. While in vitro models have advanced our understanding of HIV latency, comparable tools for studying SIV were lacking. To address this gap, we established a novel model of SIV latency using rhesus macaque CD4+ T cells, mirroring key features of natural reservoirs.

Here we present DIRseq, a fast method for predicting DIRs from the amino-acid sequence. All residues contribute to the propensity of a particular residue to be drug-interacting; the contributing factor of each residue has an amplitude that is determined by its amino-acid type and attenuates with increasing sequence distance from the particular residue. DIRseq predictions match well with DIRs identified by NMR chemical shift perturbation and other methods, including residues L22WK24 and Q52WFT55 in the tumor repressor protein p53.

This visual stability is paralleled by afterimage movement across saccades: Although retinotopically stable, afterimages appear to move in egocentric space wherever the eye moves. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we tasked human observers to localize afterimages relative to briefly flashed probes in complete darkness. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by eye tracking, allowing us to fit a dedicated computational model to accurately predict afterimage movement based on the size of eye movements. The gain of afterimage movement was significantly hypometric, remained unaffected by post-saccadic visual feedback and saccadic adaptation, and was inversely related to saccade gain. These findings suggest that afterimage movement is driven by efference-based, feedforward prediction of visual consequences of saccades and demonstrate the potential of the afterimage-tracking technique for studying visual stability.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

We mapped the neural time-courses of 12 choice-relevant food attributes. Participants (N = 110) viewed food images while we recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). A separate group of participants (N = 421) rated the same images on nutritive properties (healthiness, calorie content, edibility, and level of transformation), hedonic properties (tastiness, willingness to eat, negative and positive valence, and arousal), and familiarity (previous exposure, recognisability, and typicality). Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified differences in patterns of multivariate EEG signals across foods and assessed whether the structure of these differences was correlated with differences in attribute ratings. We observed similar correlation time-courses for many attributes. There was an early window of correlations ([~]200 ms from image onset), followed by sustained windows of correlation from [~]400-650 ms. Using principal components analysis, we identified a set of broader constructs that accounted for variance in ratings across multiple attributes, and were also correlated with the EEG data. Our results indicate that food attributes important for choice are represented rapidly and in parallel, over similar time windows. Furthermore, we reveal that broad dimensions underlying individual attributes are also represented in the neural activity with distinct time-courses, indicating a multilevel structure of food attribute representations.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

As expected, major transcriptomic changes (transitions) occurred during gastrulation and the acquisition of competence.

Mitochondrial dysfunctions are key disease features of the disease, and strategies that improve mitochondrial health have emerged as promising to slow disease progression. Emerging evidence indicates that impaired/insufficient mitophagy may contribute to the accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction seen in patients and animal models of DMD. We therefore hypothesized that overexpressing Parkin, a key mitophagy regulator, may improve mitochondrial and muscle health in a mouse model of DMD. To this end, Parkin was overexpressed using intramuscular injections of adeno-associated viruses performed in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.B10-Dmdmdx/J mice (D2.mdx), a widely used mouse model of DMD. Four and 16 weeks of Parkin overexpression initiated in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.mdx, respectively, resulted in muscle hypertrophy, as indicated by an increase in muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area. While Parkin overexpression did not impact maximal mitochondrial respiration or mitochondrial content, it increased the Acceptor Control Ratio, an index of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency. Parkin overexpression also decreased mitochondrial H2O2 emission, a surrogate for mitochondrial ROS production. However, Parkin overexpression failed to reduce the proportion of fibers with central nuclei and markers of muscle damage and/or necrosis. Taken all together, our results indicate that Parkin overexpression can attenuate muscle atrophy, improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and lower mitochondrial ROS production in a mouse model of DMD.

Our lab and others have shown that CCL22 is upregulated in cancer cells following activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING). STING triggers immune responses against pathogenic and self-DNA mislocalized to the cytoplasm, which can accumulate in cancer cells due to chromosomal instability, damaged mitochondria, and increased expression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. STING activation has been associated with both anti- and pro-tumor immune responses, and a potential mechanism of STING-mediated immune evasion is through CCL22 upregulation. CCL22 was first characterized in macrophages, and here we investigate the effects of STING activation on CCL22 expression in macrophages and monocytes. We report that human macrophages and monocytes are resistant to CCL22 upregulation by STING, but that STING-activated macrophages and monocytes release unidentified paracrine factor(s) that dramatically increase CCL22 upregulation in cancer cells in a manner that remains STING-dependent, as evidenced by the inability of STING knockout cells to upregulate CCL22 in response to these factors. We further found that exogenous type I interferons (IFNs), a major downstream product of STING activation, also upregulate CCL22 in cancer cells via a STING-dependent mechanism and that exogenous IFN{beta} can directly activate STING.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Among the genes inactivated in PWS, the Magel2 gene is considered a significant contributor to the etiology of the syndrome. The loss of the Magel2 gene causes abnormalities in growth and fertility and increased adiposity with altered metabolism in adulthood, which aligns with some of the pathologies observed in PWS. Here we investigate the role of the Magel2 gene, particularly in hypothalamic POMC neurons innervating the medial amygdala (MeA), in the behavioral phenotypes associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Both male and female mice lacking the Magel2 gene in MeA-innervating ARCPomc neurons display no alterations in anxiety-like behavior during the open filed test, light/dark test, and elevated plus maze test in the absence of exposure to acute stress. However, male mice with a Magel2 gene deletion in these specific neurons exhibit increased stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and reduce motivation/spatial learning, while female mice do not show these behavioral changes. Our results suggest that the Magel2 gene in ARCPomc neurons, especially in males, is involved in stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning deficits, offering new insights into the neurological basis of PWS beyond the commonly recognized hyperphagia and obesity. With the recent approval of a novel treatment for hyperphagia in PWS by the FDA, elucidating the cellular mechanisms by which MAGEL2 in ARCPomc neurons innervating the MeA regulates emotional behaviors may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for addressing mental illness in individuals with PWS.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

A total of fifteen male Holtzman albino rats were randomly assigned to one Control group (n = 5, no risperidone) and two treatment groups (n = 5 per group) at doses of 0.4 mg kg-1 day-1 and 4.0 mg kg-1 day-1 of risperidone, administered via orogastric gavage for 20 consecutive days.

Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) enzymes were analyzed. Reduced Glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation quantified as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), were quantified. The findings indicate that both risperidone doses significantly increased CAT activity in brain tissue. The higher dose (4.0 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly reduced TBARS levels in the brain.

These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

A single adoptive transfer of ER-Tregs not only prevents autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice when given before disease onset but also arrests its progression when administered after onset. Compared to Foxp3-overexpressing Teff cells, induced Tregs from naive precursors, and endogenous Tregs, ER-Tregs provide superior protection against autoimmune neuroinflammation. This enhanced efficacy stems from their inherited autoantigen specificity and selectively preserved effector-cell transcriptional programs, which together bolster their fitness in inflammatory environments and enhance their suppressive capacity.

Methods: BMSCs and RAW264.7 cells were fused through transient transfection using the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), respectively. The resulting hybrids were purified using magnetic sorting, and their characteristics were evaluated by examining morphology, glucose uptake rates, phagocytic capacity, cytoskeletal morphology, and the levels of Fc{gamma} receptors, as well as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, adhesion, and complement inhibitory factors. The IgG clearance capability of the hybrids was assessed by measuring internalization efficiency and infiltration into renal organoids. Additionally, the reparative effects of the hybrids were evaluated using doxorubicin-treated MPC5 damage models. Live cell imaging techniques were employed to investigate the interactions between the hybrids and immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Hybrid-derived nanovesicles were isolated, and their abilities to target IgG and clear IL-6 were evaluated using immunofluorescence and ELISA. Furthermore, chloroplasts and C-dots were co-incubated with the hybrids, and their benefits were assessed by measuring cell viability, oxygen content, ROS levels, mitochondrial function, and the levels of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro-repair factors. A scratch assay was conducted to determine the impact of chloroplast transplantation on the migration ability of 3T3 cells. Results: High-purity hybrids were successfully produced that cleared IgG while maintaining their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. They promoted the recovery of podocyte injury through vesicular and mitochondrial delivery, as well as efferocytosis. Furthermore, the hybrids inhibited iDCs primarily through migrasomes, intercellular nanomicrotubule connections, and phagocytosis. The derived nanovesicles were capable of residing in IgG-enriched regions and adsorbing IL-6. Interestingly, the transplanted chloroplasts enabled the hybrids to utilize light energy to enhance their antioxidant capacity and promote the migration of 3T3 cells, which contributes to wound repair. Subsequently, the loading of C-dots was beneficial for enhancing resistance to oxidative damage. Conclusions: Our results suggest that hybrids-mediated therapy is a new and creative therapeutic approach for managing immune-mediated nephropathies.Hybrids demonstrated effective immunomodulatory and promoted injury recovery. The derived nanovesicles have the potential to alleviate the inflammatory burden at sites of antibody immune complex deposition.

Here we identify Mg2+-protoporphyrin IX (MgPpIX), a Mg-containing tetrapyrrole and intermediate in chlorophyll biosynthesis, as inhibitor of hNaV1.5 (IC50 of 1 nM). The activity profile of various metal protoporphyrins correlates with the electrostatic potential at the metal center of the compounds. MgPpIX is specific to hNaV1.5, as no inhibition of other hNaV isoforms (hNaV1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8) was detected. A mutagenesis study and structural modeling reveals that MgPpIX stabilizes the domain-II voltage sensor in the deactivated conformation, with residues E795 and N803 being relevant determinants. MgPpIX also inhibits native NaV channels in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and colorectal carcinoma SW480 cell lines, and suppresses cell migration.

However, empirical evidence increasingly reveals complex environmental trade-offs associated with tourism expansion, particularly in ecologically sensitive heritage sites. Mount Emeishan, a UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage Site in China, exemplifies a destination where tourism has driven regional socio-economic development through culturally meaningful product innovation. Yet, this growth has also imposed significant ecological pressures, particularly in waste management, where hazardous waste accumulation correlates strongly with increasing visitor numbers--posing a growing threat to local ecosystem stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic environmental monitoring framework integrating high-resolution remote sensing imagery (HR-RSI) and advanced image fusion techniques (IFT). The primary objective is to develop a systematic, data-driven methodology for assessing and mitigating tourism-induced environmental degradation, thereby supporting sustainable management of the Emeishan National Park. Empirical evaluation of the framework demonstrated a system stability rate of 88%, representing a 12.7% statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) over traditional monitoring systems under a sample size of 100 test cases. Through the synthesis of multi-source remote sensing data, the study quantitatively assessed the impacts of tourism activities on key environmental indicators, including vegetation cover, land use dynamics, and water quality. Results revealed a noticeable decline in vegetation coverage and significant land use transitions, particularly in high-traffic zones. Furthermore, elevated water pollution risks were observed during peak tourist seasons, underscoring the seasonal nature of tourism-related environmental stressors. These findings provide robust scientific support for policy-makers and tourism authorities in formulating evidence-based environmental protection strategies and adaptive resource management policies.

The second domain captured social difficulties, with the largest {lambda}A and {lambda}E for social communication measures ({lambda}A=0.39(SE=0.10); {lambda}E=0.82(SE=0.10)). We identified trait-specific rGE between pairs of A and E factors with different directions of effect (cognition/language rGE=0.89(SE=0.18), social rGE=-0.62(SE=0.17)). rGE patterns were linked to increased measurable A and E contributions for cognition/language difficulties, but decreased contributions for social problems. Analyses in ABCD confirmed the two domains for E and phenotypic structures, although genomic contributions were low.\n\nConclusionsIn childhood, cognitive/language abilities versus social abilities are influenced by distinct genomic and/or environmental factors, potentially interlinked through trait-specific rGE, suggesting differences in developmental processes.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Understanding its seasonal foraging patterns is essential for conservation planning in such habitats. This study examined winter dietary preferences of blackbuck across three agro-pastoral sites - Palla Salu, Rathgaon, and Sikandra Rao - in Aligarh district, Uttar Pradesh, India. Vegetation sampling recorded 4,125 plant individuals, with Prosopis juliflora and Cynodon dactylon dominating the landscape. However, microhistological analysis of 45 fecal pellet samples identified 18 distinct plant species comprising a total of 860 identifiable fragments. Of these, C. dactylon, Poa annua, Rumex pulcher, and Atriplex patula were significantly preferred. Despite high field abundance, P. juliflora was consistently avoided, likely due to structural or chemical deterrents. Interestingly, rare species such as Chenopodium vulvaria were overrepresented in the diet, suggesting nutrient-specific selectivity. Bonferroni-adjusted confidence intervals confirmed significant foraging preferences across all sites. These findings highlight the blackbuck's adaptive and selective winter feeding strategy and the crucial role of native grasses and forbs during resource-scarce periods. We recommend the control of invasive species and restoration of native forage to enhance habitat quality and support long-term blackbuck conservation in fragmented, human-dominated ecosystems.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Vastus lateralis biopsies from resistance trained males in two prior studies were assessed. In STUDY 1, 11 college-aged men completed an acute bout of either HL or HV RT exercises to failure. Biopsies were collected at PRE, 3 hours post-, and 6 hours post-exercise. In STUDY 2, 15 college-aged men participated in six weeks of supervised unilateral RT where each leg was assigned to either HL or HV RT. Biopsies were collected from both legs prior to and 72 hours following last training bout of the intervention. Biopsies from both studies were used to assess mitochondrial mRNAs, and STUDY 2 biopsies were assayed for mitochondrial proteins and CS activity. Results from both studies revealed several significant main effects of time but no significant interactions. Additionally, CS activity, a surrogate of mitochondrial content, decreased following chronic RT (p=0.016) but no interaction was observed between the HV and HL leg over time (p=0.882).

Endothelial dysfunction, which frequently accompanies the abovementioned conditions and increases with age5-7, might be a key causal and mechanistic factor in cognitive deficits associated with systemic conditions.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the inducible deletion of the Gq/11 signaling pathway in brain endothelial cells leads to an impaired reactivity of the brain vasculature to vasodilating stimuli such as neuronal activity, representing an isolated cerebral endothelial dysfunction.

In recent years, the Feeding Experimentation Device (FED3) has emerged as a major advance, offering programmable modes of operation, affordable costs, and flexibility for investigating a range of feeding and operant behaviours. However, certain limitations prevent researchers from fully harnessing the FED3s capabilities in a user-friendly manner.\n\nNew methodHere, we present the Realtime and Remote FED3 (RTFED) developed for continuous and online home-cage monitoring of mice. Operating on both Raspberry Pi and Windows, RTFED integrates with FED3 to log and transmit feeding events and operant behaviours in real-time. It also incorporates event-triggered video capture through USB cameras, providing additional observational depth. Moreover, RTFED can send TTL signals to external devices (e.g., fibre photometry systems) for precise behaviour-neural synchronization. A key strength of RTFED is its customizable open-source architecture, enabling researchers to tailor both software and hardware configurations to meet specific experimental objectives.\n\nComparison with existing methodsThis flexibility, together with features such as remote data logging and email notifications that allow timely adjustments and animal welfare monitoring based on behavioural observations, substantially reduces animal disturbance and researcher intervention and labour.\n\nConclusionBy offering a cost-effective and modifiable alternative to proprietary commercial solutions, RTFED broadens accessibility, heightens reproducibility, and deepens investigations into feeding and reward-driven behaviours in home-cage settings, ultimately improving the quality and translational relevance of behavioural research.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/666497v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1739b5dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd1422org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54efb4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@455337_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

M.; Pudipeddi, S. S.; Llorach, P.; Walsh, J. J.", "abstract": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical node in the neural circuitry underlying reward and motivated behavior, including hedonic feeding, and its dysfunction is implicated in maladaptive behaviors in numerous psychiatric disorders. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc are predominantly categorized into dopamine 1 receptor-expressing (D1-MSNs) and dopamine 2 receptor-expressing (D2-MSNs) subtypes, which are thought to exert distinct and sometimes opposing roles in reward-related processes. Here, we used optogenetic, chemogenetic, and fiber photometry approaches in Cre-driver mouse lines to dissect the causal contributions of D1-and D2-MSNs to the consumption of a high-fat diet in sated animals. Activation of D1-MSNs via optogenetics or DREADDs significantly suppressed high-fat intake, whereas inhibition of these neurons increased consumption. Conversely, activation of D2-MSNs enhanced high-fat food intake, while their inhibition reduced intake. Fiber photometry revealed dynamic shifts in D2-MSN activity over repeated high-fat exposures, with increasing activity correlating with escalating intake. These results highlight opposing contributions of D1- and D2-MSN populations in regulating hedonic feeding and support a model in which motivational salience and consumption are modulated by MSN subtype-specific activity in the NAc. Understanding this circuitry has implications for the development of targeted treatments for obesity and other disorders of compulsive consumption.\n\nSignificance StatementObesity and metabolic disorders are partly driven by dysregulated motivation for palatable foods, yet the neural circuits underlying hedonic feeding are not fully understood. This study shows that nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) have opposing roles in high-fat food intake during early exposure: D1-MSNs suppress, while D2-MSNs promote, consumption in sated mice. Using chemogenetics, optogenetics, and fiber photometry, we establish a causal link between MSN activity and hedonic feeding. These findings challenge simplified models of reward processing and highlight the experience-dependent roles of MSN subtypes. By defining cell-type-specific contributions to non-homeostatic eating, this work offers key insight into the neural basis of compulsive intake and informs strategies for targeted intervention in obesity and related conditions.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

One such process is representational drift (RD), in which neurons responses change over the timescale of minutes to weeks, while perception and behavior remain unchanged. Generally, RD is believed to be caused by changes in synaptic weights, which alter individual neurons tuning properties. Since these changes alter the population readout, they require adaptation of downstream areas to maintain stable function, a costly and non-local problem. Here we propose that much of the observed drift phenomena can be explained by a simpler mechanism: changes in the excitability of cells without changes in synaptic weights. We show that such excitability changes can change the apparent tuning of neurons without requiring adaptation of population readouts in downstream areas. We use spike coding networks (SCN) to show that the extent of these tuning shifts matches experimentally observed changes. Moreover, specific decoders trained on one excitability setting perform poorly on others, while a general decoder can perform close to optimal across excitability changes if trained across many days. Our work proposes a simple mechanism without synaptic plasticity that explains experimentally observed RD, while downstream decoding and, by extension, behavior remain stable.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Corpora amylacea or \"wasteosomes\", are discontinuous lipid labyrinth structures that are polyglucosan rich, retain cellular waste and are thought to be of astrocytic origin. Wasteosomes have been proposed as a hallmark of glymphatic insufficiency predominantly due to: 1) their spatial localization around glymphatic drainage points including periventricular (PV) regions, perivascular spaces (PVS), and sub-pial regions; and, 2) their correlation with aging, vascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and conditions that impair sleep.

Virological investigations and the use of metagenomic sequencing of samples allowed the identification of new viruses in pigs, such as porcine respirovirus type 1 (PRV1) and swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). The pathogenicity of PRV1 has been investigated experimentally by one research group, whereas SOV is yet to be studied. In this experimental trial, groups of weaners were inoculated with a European isolate of PRV1 (n = 8), a pool of SOV RNA-positive clinical nasal swab material (n = 8) or culture medium serving as controls (n = 4). Four days post inoculation (DPI), two controls and four pigs from each of the PRV1 and SOV groups were euthanized and necropsied. All SOV inoculated pigs tested negative for SOV at DPI 4 and therefore four of these pigs were transferred to the stable with the PRV1- infected pigs to assess direct-contact transmission. Nasal swab samples were collected at regular intervals after challenge and blood samples were collected at DPI 0, 4, and 14. At 14 DPI, the remaining pigs (n = 10) were euthanized and necropsied. Nasal swab samples and tissues from the respiratory tract were examined for PRV1 RNA by reverse transcriptase real- time PCR and blood samples were investigated for PRV1 antibodies by ELISA. Respiratory tissues were also evaluated macro- and microscopically and selected tissues were investigated for in situ detection of PRV1 mRNA by RNAscope. No clinical signs, except for nasal discharge, were observed in any of the pigs. PRV1-shedding was observed from DPI 2 to 11 with peaks between DPI 4 and 7, and PRV1 was transmitted horizontally to all direct-contact pigs. The highest viral load was detected in the upper respiratory tract, i.e. nose, upper and lower trachea compared to the lower respiratory tract, i.e., bronchioles, and alveoli. Generally, a chronic tracheitis at 4 DPI, developing into chronic, erosive tracheitis at 14 DPI was observed in the PRV1 groups and was supported by in situ detection of PRV1 by RNAscope. Three pigs also developed mild, bronchointerstitial pneumonia at 14 DPI. In conclusion, these results showed that PRV1 is a primary porcine respiratory pathogen.\n\nAuthor summaryRespiratory diseases in pigs impair porcine health and welfare and are often caused by a complex interaction between pathogens. We investigated the pathogenesis of two recently discovered viruses: porcine respirovirus type 1 (PRV1) and swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). An experimental model in weaner pigs showed that PRV1 is capable of efficient replication, horizontal transmission and caused pathological manifestations mainly in the upper respiratory tract. The lesions consisted of chronic, erosive tracheitis in all PRV1 infected pigs, resulting in a breakage of the tracheal epithelial barrier, and a few pigs developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. These findings confirm that PRV1 should be considered a primary porcine respiratory pathogen, but in contrast, SOV did not result in a successful infection, and the reasons why remain to be elucidated.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/666573v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c52feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dce06corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@111e769org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6fbdd1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstract created with Biorender.com", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Unlike proteins, lncRNAs exhibit diverse patterns of conservation, reflecting the evolutionary genetic pressures they have undergone. The long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) is a low-conserved, mammal-specific lncRNA. It regulates the cis activation of its neighboring gene Cdkn1A, which encodes the p21 protein, an essential player in the DNA damage response. The syntenic mouse and human lincRNA-p21 genes display low sequence similarity, and their transcripts show distinct cellular localization and different additional cellular functions. Despite these evolutionarily divergent features, both transcripts interact with the same partner in the nucleus, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), to regulate the expression of the Cdkn1a gene. Elucidating the molecular bases of the lincRNA-p21 interaction with hnRNP K is crucial for understanding the activation of the p21-dependent DNA damage response. However, it remains unknown which RNA and protein motifs are involved in this interaction, and whether those motifs are shared between mice and humans. To address this question, we employed in vitro, in cellulo, and ex cellulo SHAPE-MaP to determine the secondary structures of the full-length mouse (3 kb) and human (4 kb) lincRNA-p21 transcripts. We identified a conserved structural RNA motif that comprises a [~]20-nucleotide terminal stem-loop containing a conserved tetranucleotide UCAY. In silico analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro protein-RNA binding assays support the interaction of lincRNA-p21 and this RNA motif with the KH3 domain of hnRNP K. Using eCLIP-qRT-PCR and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we demonstrate that a mutant lacking the conserved structural RNA motif is no longer able to bind the hnRNP K protein within cells. In conclusion, our study reveals a conserved lncRNA-protein interaction between two syntenic transcripts with divergent sequences and structures, highlighting evolutionary pressure to maintain a critical cellular stress-control element.

However, large-scale, longitudinal neuroimaging studies across early childhood, particularly in low- and middle-income countries are rare, yet important, given that they offer a powerful means of capturing within-person changes in neurodevelopment and identifying targets for intervention and support. Here we investigated brain responses to social perception across the first 2000 days of life (conception to five years of age) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) longitudinally with participants in The Gambia within the Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) Project. We found that social visual stimuli elicited a specialised right posterior temporal response across all six age points studied here (5, 8, 12, 18, 24 months and 3-5 years of age), with concurrent specialised left responses at four of the six time points (5, 8, 18 months and 3-5 years of age). Inferior frontal regions showed age-related changes in brain activation, with the youngest (5 months) and oldest (24 months to 3-5 years) time points evidencing more widespread frontal social visual responses. In contrast, social auditory stimuli elicited a significantly stronger and more prolonged response than non-social auditory stimuli across all six age points from 5 months to 3-5 years across a range of frontal and temporal areas. Furthermore, from individual infant trajectories of brain activation, we identified different profiles of age-dependent specialisation to social auditory stimuli, with some specialising earlier than others. Finally, in studying the hemodynamic responses, we showed that their different characteristics were influenced by age and stimulus type, highlighting the limitations of comparing fNIRS signal amplitudes across ages, and the importance of incorporating the timing of the fNIRS response to characterise brain activation more comprehensively.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

To investigate how circuits retain stable wiring and function throughout development, we combined synaptic-level resolution electron microscopy (EM) with computational modeling in the Drosophila larval nociceptive system. Based on EM data, we generated the contactome-the set of synaptic membrane contacts-of this circuit across development to evaluate how different mechanisms contribute to wiring stability. Specifically, we investigated three mechanisms: correlation-based plasticity and synaptic scaling, which modify synaptic strength, and structural plasticity, which preserves synaptic density. We found that synaptic sizes remain largely stable across development, and synapses between the same pre- and postsynaptic neurons do not correlate in size, suggesting that synaptic scaling and correlation-based plasticity play a limited role in shaping connectivity. In contrast, dendritic synaptic density remains invariant despite a previously reported fivefold increase in neuron size and synapse number. This conservation requires increased axonal presynaptic density to compensate for unequal axonal and dendritic growth. As neurons grow, this adjustment is necessary to maintain the relative synaptic input associated with each presynaptic partner across development. Our EM analysis and modeling show that conserving relative connectivity and synaptic density is sufficient to maintain consistent postsynaptic responses across development, highlighting these conserved structural features as key contributors to circuit stability during growth.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Face-selective high frequency broadband (30-160 Hz) neural activity is distributed across the VOTC, with right-hemispheric dominance and regional peaks of activity. Crucially, while a progressive increase in degree of category-selectivity is found along the postero-anterior axis, neural activity occurs largely concurrently (~100ms onset and ~450ms offset) across all VOTC regions.

Using open-access recordings of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus while animals perform a dynamic Pavlovian task, we compare firing rate and behavioral data with a model that considers reward history accumulated over a tunable timescale. Our Bayesian parameter estimation supports that serotonergic neurons are consistent with reward history being estimated over about a hundred trials on average, with a heterogeneity across individual neurons spanning 30 to 300 trials. Anticipatory licking also correlated with reward history at multiple timescale, but could not be dissociated from that of a time/thirst nuisance variable and otherwise mostly on a timescale faster than seen in serotonergic cells.

Interactive social gaze behavior was determined by how primitives were combined, rather than by their independent sums, providing evidence for behavioral compositionality. The amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex represented content and state in an abstract format and orthogonally to one another, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices exhibited limited generalization.

Here we probe working memorys influence on various oscillatory components within visual areas, using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) technique to decompose the local field potential(LFP)4; this method allows single-trial quantification of the properties of various oscillatory components. We examine the impact of spatial working memory on visual processing within the extrastriate middle temporal (MT) visual area of rhesus macaque monkeys, comparing the responses in MT when remembering a location inside or outside the receptive fields of the neurons being recorded. Using traditional bandpass filtering, we replicate previous reports that working memory enhances visual responses, low-frequency oscillatory power, spike-phase locking, and phase coding of visual information. Applying the MODWT method, we find that working memory modulates both oscillatory power and the precise frequency of oscillations within a general frequency band. The precise frequency of several lower frequency components (alpha, theta, and beta frequencies, but not gamma or high gamma) correlates with visually-evoked firing rates of MT neurons on a trial-by-trial basis. This relationship between firing rate and oscillatory component frequency is maintained across memory conditions, indicating a close link between the neural mechanisms driving oscillatory frequency and firing rates.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Influenza A, C and D viruses all have non-human maintenance hosts and likely circulate in several mammalian species. Camelids, as a reservoir for zoonotic viruses, were not extensively studied until the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. Antibody responses to both ICV and IDV could be detected in dromedary camels from Kenya but not differentiated, owing to cross-reactivity. It was unclear whether these findings reflected a technical issue or suggested a role for camelids in ICV and IDV ecology. In the present study, therefore, alpacas (Vicugna pacos), a camelid species, were experimentally inoculated with ICV (C/Victoria/1/2011) or IDV (D/bovine/France/5920/2014) to assess susceptibility and assess the antibody response. We have demonstrated that alpacas can be experimentally infected with both ICV and IDV with subclinical infection of the upper respiratory tract (URT), suggesting that virus transmission could potentially occur.

We have identified that Prdm12, which encodes a histone methyltransferase highly expressed in the central nervous system and lateral preplacodal ectoderm, is also expressed in the sox10-positive cells located at the lateral front of the premigratory neural crest domain in Xenopus laevis embryos.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AFS using the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of 3,686 Chinese Holstein heifers, genotyped with 7,964,217 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after quality control. Significant SNPs and candidate genes were identified and investigated through colocalization analysis of GWAS, expression QTL (eQTL), and splicing QTL (sQTL), and expression analysis in blood RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The heritability estimate for AFS was moderate at 0.276 {+/-} 0.025. Three QTL regions associated with AFS were identified: Region 1 on BTA6 (43688837-45007127 bp, 1.3 Mb with three 200kb windows), explaining 0.47% of genetic variance; Region 2 on BTA6 (62770788-62967316 bp) explaining 0.27% of the genetic variance; and Region 3 on BTA18 (6299721-6498934 bp) explaining 0.17% of the genetic variance.

These genes are enriched in signaling pathways such as progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and action, and selenocompound metabolism.

This study presents a supervised learning framework in order to predict whether an H. pylori infection will result in gastric cancer or a non-malignant outcome with a combination of clinical and genome-derived features. A dataset with 1,363 H. pylori genomes containing host metadata and annotated genomic features was curated. Feature extraction was performed using gene presence/absence profiles, various sequence descriptors, and variant-level annotation features. A white-box logistic regression model and black-box eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier and Random Forest models were trained and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous (SMOTE-NC) was used for addressing class imbalance. SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to assess model interpretability. The baseline model showed an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.89 while the XGBoost model and Random Forest models displayed an AUROC of 0.95. The black-box models improved recall for the gastric cancer group with 0.83 for XGBoost and 0.82 for Random Forest while the baseline model had a recall of 0.73. Feature importance analyses were also used to identify the key drivers of gastric cancer prediction including host age, geographic origin and specific disruptive mutations.

We systematically investigated the relationship between logical reasoning and language using two complementary approaches. First, we used non-invasive brain imaging (fMRI) to examine neural activity as healthy adults engaged in inductive and deductive logical reasoning tasks. And second, we behaviorally evaluated logical abilities in individuals with extensive lesions to the language brain areas and consequent severe linguistic impairment. Our findings reveal that the language system is not engaged during logical reasoning, and patients with severe aphasia exhibit intact performance on logic tasks.

E.", "abstract": "Background: Synaptic dysfunction is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a significant contributor to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Proper localization of proteins involved in pre-and post-synaptic composition is dependent on endosomal recycling and trafficking. Alterations in trafficking complexes, such as retromer, have been shown to impair neuronal synaptic function. The SORL1 gene has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis and its protein product, SORLA, is an endosomal receptor that works in conjunction with retromer to regulate endosomal recycling. Methods: We utilized our established human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived excitatory cortical neuron model to examine SORL1's role in synaptic protein composition and neuronal function. We used Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation (QMI), a mesoscale. proteomics assay to measure synaptic protein interactions, immunocytochemistry to assay synapses and AMPA receptor subunits, and multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) to measure neuronal function of SORL1 KO and isogenic control hiPSC derived neurons. Results: We show that loss of SORL1 expression significantly changes many synaptic protein-protein interactions and patterns of expression. We demonstrate that SORL1 deficient neurons are hyperactive and that the increased activity is driven by glutamatergic neurotransmission. Hyperexcitability has been seen in other models of AD with familial AD variants in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes, due to the increases in amyloid beta (Ab) peptides. In the case of SORL1 deficiency, the hyperexcitability we observe is primarily due to mis-trafficking of synaptic proteins, rather than an overall increase in Ab. Finally, we find that SORL1 deficient neurons have impaired synaptic plasticity. Conclusions: These findings further support a growing body of literature implicating early endosomal recycling defects as drivers of AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, our work supports further emphasis on exploring the SORL1-retromer pathway for therapeutic development in AD.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

In the MGE, somatostatin-expressing (SST+) cells arise predominantly from the dorsal-posterior MGE from E12-E16 whereas parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) cells are born in the ventral-anterior MGE throughout embryogenesis.

A similar organization has never been explored in the CGE, despite the significant increase in CGE-derived interneurons in primates compared to rodents.

One month post-transplantation, brains were immunostained for interneuron markers to relate mature CGE-derived interneurons with spatiotemporal origins within the CGE. Our results indicate that there are significant spatial biases in the CGE, with specific interneuron subtypes preferentially arising from distinct CGE subdomains. These biases are relatively stable over time, implying a minimal relationship between temporal birthdate and interneuron subtype.

Combining cell-type-specific pharmacogenetics, behavioral assays, and computational modeling, we found that reducing PV+-mediated inhibition during encoding enhanced the subsequent discrimination of similar inputs but it increased vulnerability to interference. In contrast, increased inhibition stabilized memory representations at the cost of discriminability. Together, the results establish PV+ interneurons as key modulators of hippocampal memory processing, enabling the system to prioritize either flexible updating or robust retention based on inhibitory tone at the time of encoding.

Genomes were assembled using Illumina short reads, scaffolded with Oxford Nanopore long reads, and aligned to the phased N. vison reference genome.

A reference-free pangenome revealed an open architecture, highlighting considerable subspecies diversity. Subspecies-specific gene enrichment reflected adaptation: N. vison evergladensis showed enrichment in traits related to reproduction and sensory function; N. vison vulgivaga in cytoskeletal remodeling and oxidative stress; and N. vison lutensis in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and cellular stress pathways. Assessment of the mitogenomes resolved N. vison lutensis as a distinct lineage, while nuclear data supported broader subspecies divergence but lacked fine scale resolution.

Methods: Young female homozygous APOE{epsilon}3 and APOE{epsilon}4 mice (n=19-20/group; ~6 months old) fed a high-fat diet were ovariectomized (OVX), OVX and supplemented with 17{beta}-estradiol, or left intact. Results: In APOE{epsilon}3 mice, OVX was associated with impaired posterior cerebral artery endothelium-dependent dilation, which was rescued by 17{beta}-estradiol. However, in APOE{epsilon}4 mice, there was no effect of OVX or 17{beta}-estradiol on cerebral artery endothelial function. Carotid artery passive stiffness was greater with OVX and lower with 17{beta}-estradiol treatment in APOE{epsilon}3 mice, but there was no impact of OVX or 17{beta}-estradiol in the APOE{epsilon}4 mice. In cerebral arteries and arterioles, mitochondrial complexes I and I+II respiration were lower in APOE{epsilon}4 mice compared with APOE{epsilon}3 mice. 17{beta}-estradiol led to higher mitochondrial complex I respiration in APOE{epsilon}3 but not APOE{epsilon}4 mice. These functional differences were concomitant with group differences in mitochondrial DNA copy number, antioxidant enzymes, and pro-inflammatory factors. In contrast to other outcomes, we found that 17{beta}-estradiol treatment was associated with lower cerebral artery stiffness in APOE{epsilon}4 but not APOE{epsilon}3 mice. Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that the APOE genotype modulates the impact of estrogen on the cerebral vasculature. We found that 17{beta}-estradiol enhances cerebrovascular endothelial and mitochondrial function in APOE{epsilon}3 mice but not in APOE{epsilon}4 mice. The results suggest that 17?-estradiol supplementation has more cerebrovascular benefit for APOE{epsilon}4 non-carriers.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Yet, how sap feeders affect floral attractiveness to pollinators remains poorly understood, despite the critical role of this tripartite interaction in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These intricate interactions may be further enriched by pronounced sexual dimorphisms in dioecious species. In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. Contrary to sexual selection theory, female plants were not less attractive than males under control conditions. Instead, our results suggest that females exhibit plasticity in floral trait expression depending on pollination success. Moreover, both sexes produced a diverse array of potentially bioactive nectar metabolites, with females showing higher abundances of many compounds that may influence female pollinator behaviour. Aphid infestation altered floral traits differently between sexes, with stronger declines in female floral attractiveness, suggesting sex-specific defence strategies and possible involvement of indirect defences in stabilizing this specialized plant-pollinator-herbivore system.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Two behaviors were observed: a significantly higher production in rich medium than in iron-restricted medium for CC1, CC2, and some CC3 strains, and the opposite phenomenon for CC6 ones. Analysis of the ECM of two representative strains using confocal microscopy showed that biofilm of the CC3 strain in rich medium contained similar amounts of proteins, eDNA and polysaccharides while that of CC6 strain was predominantly proteinaceous. Under iron-restricted conditions, biofilm structure and composition of both strains completely differed from those obtained in rich conditions. The proteomic analysis of their biofilm ECM by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry identified 321 proteins common to both strains, mainly intracellular and in particular ribosomal. Of note, 202 proteins differed between the strains in terms of abundance, with a higher proportion of membrane proteins in the CC3 strain.\n\nThis study performed on a large cohort of strains shows that S. lugdunensis biofilm-forming capacity is strongly associated with CC and iron availability.

We explored the role of RV cardiac myofibroblasts (cMFB) on this transition utilizing a rat model and 3 cohorts of 81 patients which included clinical data, RV tissues and blood. We hypothesized that the loss of UCP2, critical for mitochondrial calcium (mCa++) regulation and cardiac fibroblasts (cFB) differentiation, is associated with dRV in rats and humans; and that a loss-of-function UCP2 SNP (rs659366) may predict dRV in human PAH. We separated rat cRV from dRV based on catheterization and echocardiographic criteria and found a significant increase in cMFB in dRV. In isolated hearts, RV contractility was lower in dRV but not in isolated cardiomyocyte (CM), pointing to a non-CM cause. Mitochondrial respiration was lower in dRV cMFB than in control and cRV cFB. mCa++ was progressively decreased from normal to cRV to dRV c(M)FB, and the same was true for c(M)FB (but not CM) UCP2 levels. Human PAH, but not secondary pulmonary hypertension, dRVs had more cMFB and less UCP2 than control and cRVs. Decreased UCP2 (protein and mRNA) levels and the presence of heterozygous/homozygous UCP2 SNP were associated with worse RV performance (TAPSE, cardiac index), even among patients with similar mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Our data point to a change of cell identity (cFB to cMFB) in the RV as a driver of RV decompensation.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using 209 serum/plasma samples from various regions of Peru, stored at the National Institute of Health. Detection of HBV and HDV was performed by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. Nucleic acids were purified and quantified for library preparation and sequencing using the Illumina platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to reference genomes to determine genotypes, subgenotypes, and clinically relevant mutations. Geneious Prime was used for assembly and phylogenetic analysis, and STATA v.14.0 for statistical analysis. Results: HBV genotype F was the most prevalent (96.1%), with subgenotype F1b being predominant, followed by genotypes H, G, and C. Mutations associated with virulence and immune escape were identified, particularly A1762T/G1764A (66.7%) and A1762T/G1764A + G1896A (45.7%). All HDV sequences corresponded to genotype 3 (HDV-3), which was detected in six regions of the country. Conclusions: The findings confirm the predominant circulation of HBV genotype F and HDV genotype 3 in Peru, with genotypic diversity that may influence clinical outcomes, viral load, and response to treatment.

Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of Thr210 has been reported, but other evidence identified a strict requirement for the Aurora A partner Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation. Here, we investigate the elusive mechanistic basis for this requirement. We show that Aurora A:Bora phosphorylates Thr210 of PLK1 in vitro, while Aurora A, other Aurora A:activator complexes, and Aurora B:INCENP fail to target T210 even at high kinase/substrate ratios. A transient interaction of Bora and PLK1, identified by structural modelling and probed mutationally, is uniquely required for Thr210 phosphorylation. Dependency on Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation is eliminated after mutating Lys208, in the Aurora consensus, into arginine. This conservative mutation turns PLK1 into an excellent substrate of nearly all tested active Aurora kinases, especially Aurora B.

With this framework, the cell representation can be enhanced considerably by performing convolution on its neighboring cells. Performance evaluation across seven biological tasks, including scRNA-seq data clustering and spatial transcriptomics domain identification, shows that TopoLa significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models.

D.", "abstract": "When amphibians invaded the terrestrial realm, they likely needed a strategy such as aestivation to survive water and oxygen stress in the novel environment. In fact, aestivation appears to be an ancestral state in amphibians. We conducted a literature review about the genes previously linked to aestivation and then we searched for additional candidate genes related to the aestivation phenotype by comparing evolutionary rates of 13,578 genes in 31 amphibian species, including 10 aestivating species and 21 non-aestivating species. Based on the assumption that aestivation has two main requirements -- a) metabolic regulation needed to control transitions to/from the hypometabolic state, and b) cell preservation strategies needed to sustain biological processes over long-term dormancy -- we expected to find distinct relative evolutionary rates (RER) in genes related to those traits. We identified 323 genes with significant RERs; these genes were enriched for some processes overlapping with our predictions and with literature findings, such as shifts between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Other genes related to protein and membrane trafficking (TRAPP, SNARE, and Arp2/3 complexes) are newly associated with aestivation. RER patterns suggest that aestivation in amphibians relies on a set of highly conserved core processes and other auxiliary processes that have diversified across the phylogeny. Given the vast number and diversity of aestivating amphibian lineages, we predict that more in-depth molecular studies of amphibian aestivation will offer novel insight into hypometabolic processes that could inspire medical innovations to prevent organ atrophy, address problems with angiogenesis, and combat processes underlying cancer.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Impaired CerS activity leads to lower ceramide and resolves insulin resistance. Drosophila has only one CerS, named Schlank, which contains a catalytic lag1p motif and, like many CerS, a homeodomain regulating lipid homeostasis. How CerS homeodomains are associated with diabetes has been little studied. Here we demonstrate that, depending on the respective mutation in the CerS homeodomain high sugar diet (HSD)-induced insulin resistance is exacerbated or ameliorated. HSD shifts the profile of sphingolipids towards polyunsaturated longer sphingoid bases, systemic insulin signaling is reduced, as indicated by nuclear accumulation of FOXO, and secretion of insulin-like peptide 2 (DILP2) is impaired. Expression of a CerS variant with a mutation in the nuclear localization signal 2 within its homeodomain in the fat body improves systemic insulin signaling and DILP2 release. Thus, the CerS homeodomain may be a potential target to attenuate insulin resistance.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

By employing a bespoke bioreactor capable of delivering nano-amplitude vibration (30 nm, 1kHz) to human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, we observed osteo-specific differentiation. We related this to the mechanotransductive mechanism by showing that inhibition of intracellular tension results in the loss of cytoskeletal organisation and myosin activation driven by nanovibration. Further, we dissect the mechanism of osteogenesis using a panel of Wnt agonists and antagonists and highlight the role of non-canonical Wnt. Then, using Bcl3-/- cells and by stimulating with BCL3 peptide, we show that non-canonical Wnt, osteogenesis-related inflammation and osteogenesis itself are all regulated by BCL3. This is important as nanoscale direct cell-stimulation is gaining interest, and there is an emerging consensus that such signals can be osteogenic.

Using a combination of spectroscopy and micromanipulation techniques, we reveal that SLBs are pinned to the support, creating barriers for lipid diffusion. Furthermore, they are intrinsically stretched and under tension, causing membrane rupture and the formation of stable ~2 nm aqueous pores that allow the permeation of small hydrophilic molecules. Despite strong adhesion, SLBs can undergo localized shape changes associated with membrane fusion, and membrane nanotubes can be extruded under optical forces.

Fundamental and applied approaches have been enabled thanks to the generation of patient-derived tumoroids (PDTs), ex vivo 3D structures used as avatars of the original tumor. We generated neuroblastoma PDTs and quantified the spatial distribution of CD133+ cancer stem cells using immunohistochemistry. We observed that those cells tend to aggregate in the PDT. In order to better understand the set of rules needed for generating such structures, we implemented a multiscale agent-based neuroblastoma tumoroid model. Model rules specify single cell's fate based on its intracellular content, which dynamically evolves according to a stochastic gene regulatory network. The state of this network can be modulated by cell-to-cell signalling through neighbor cells fate decisions and, possibly, spatial location. We first observed that in the absence of any spatial rules for inter-cellular interactions, no spatial structure emerged. The addition of simple rules (signalling by cell-to-cell contact or differential cell adhesion) only marginally improved the quantitative agreement to the experimental dataset. In sharp contrast, the addition of short-range pro-stem cell diffusive signalling among stem cells produced very realistic 3D PDT-like structures. This works highlights the power of our multiscale approach to discard too simplistic rules and to propose a minimal set of hypotheses required to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively experimentally observed spatial structures. In the case of neuroblastomas-derived PDTs, short-range spatial diffusion of stem-to-stem cell signalling proved to play a key role in successfully reconstructing the spatial structure.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here we perform massively parallel energetic measurements on a model human PDZ domain to directly and comprehensively answer this question. In total we quantify the binding to a ligand and abundance of ~190,000 protein variants to quantify free energy changes for mutations throughout the canonical domain fold and ~7,000 energetic couplings between these mutations and the two domain extensions, both alone and in combination. We find that both extensions-one structured and one more dynamic-substantially and specifically re-shape the energy landscape of the domain, with the removal of an [a]-helix altering the energetic consequences of 424 mutations in 54 sites on fold stability and 420 mutations in 56 sites on binding to a ligand.

Here, we provide evidence from cultured hepatocytes that mtDNA synthesis and lipid droplet biogenesis occur at spatially and functionally distinct ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites. We find that, during saturated lipid stress, cells pause mtDNA synthesis and mitochondrial network expansion secondary to rerouted fatty acid trafficking through the ER and lipid droplet biogenesis, coincident with a defect in soluble protein import to the ER lumen. The relative composition of fatty acid pools available to cells is critical, as monounsaturated fatty acid supplementation rescued both ER proteostasis and mtDNA synthesis, even in the presence of excess saturated fat.

In nematodes, many modes of reproduction exist ('regular' sexuality, hermaphroditism, parthenogenesis), but most species have a XX/X0 system: females have two X chromosomes and males have one. In rare cases, Y chromosomes have emerged in males, but without associated changes in reproductive mode. Here we demonstrate that, in Mesorhabditis nematodes, a new Y chromosome co-emerged with an unconventional mode of reproduction called autopseudogamy. In this system, females produce clonal females plus rare (~10%) males, needed for fertilisation only. These males do not contribute to the female genome and may thus be 'genetically useless' - except for their Y. Analysing the Y chromosomes of two autopseudogamous species, we found two conserved features: i) they accumulated male-beneficial genes, and ii) they display a strong fertilisation drive, in that mainly Y-bearing sperm fertilise female oocytes. Both features are, evolutionarily speaking, favourable in the context of autopseudogamy, making the Y chromosome a possible stabilisor of this mode of reproduction.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the consequences of UFA depletion in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline using an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system to conditionally degrade FAT-7, the major {Delta}9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase, in a fat-5; fat-6 double mutant background. This strategy bypassed the lethality associated with complete loss of {Delta}9 desaturase activity, enabling analysis of UFA deficiency in adult animals. UFA depletion led to a dramatic reduction in brood size, elevated embryonic and larval lethality, and a severe loss of germline nuclei. We found that UFAs are essential for mitotic proliferation, DNA replication, and chromosome organization in the germline. Moreover, reduced UFA levels impaired meiotic progression, accompanied by loss of membrane integrity in the syncytial germline. Notably, UFA deficiency increased nuclear pore complex (NPC) signal intensity, suggesting alterations to the nuclear envelope (NE). Together, our findings demonstrate that UFAs are indispensable for germline maintenance, affecting cell cycle progression, chromosome organization, and membrane architecture. These results underscore a fundamental link between acyl chain composition and reproductive success, highlighting the critical role of lipid homeostasis in the germline.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Recently, small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) were identified, although their mechanisms of action have not been fully defined. Here we explore the interaction of PR65 with two SMAPs, ATUX-8385 and the non-functional DBK-776, using single-molecule optical tweezers, ensemble methods, and computational analysis. In the absence of SMAP, PR65 shows multiple unfolding and refolding transitions, and the force-extension profiles are very heterogeneous with evidence of misfolding. Similar heterogeneity has been observed for chemical-induced unfolding of tandem-repeat proteins like PR65, a consequence of the internal symmetry of the repeat architecture. In the presence of ATUX-8385, higher unfolding and refolding forces are observed globally, and there is less misfolding, suggesting that ATUX-8385 acts like a pharmacological chaperone. In contrast, DBK-766-binding induces higher unfolding forces for only a few repeats of PR65, suggestive of a more localised effect; moreover, subsequent stretch-relax cycles show that PR65 is irreversibly locked in the unfolded state. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations provide additional insights how SMAP binding modulates PR65 structure and function.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that attraction of C. elegans to a medium-chain alcohol switches to avoidance in a uniform background of a second attractive odorant. This context-dependent behavioral plasticity is mediated by symmetric inversion of the odor-evoked response sign in the bilateral AWC olfactory neurons. Here we show that this symmetric response plasticity is driven by asymmetric molecular mechanisms in the AWC neuron pair. Mutations in the gcy-12 receptor guanylyl cyclase abolish odor response plasticity only in AWCOFF; the opposing odor-evoked response signs in AWCOFF and AWCON in gcy-12 mutants results in these animals being behaviorally indifferent to this chemical. We find that gcy-12 is expressed, and required, in both AWC neurons to regulate odor response plasticity only in AWCOFF. We further show that disruption of AWC fate lateralization results in loss of asymmetry in the response plasticity in gcy-12 mutants. Our results indicate that symmetric neuronal response plasticity can arise from asymmetry in underlying molecular mechanisms, and suggest that lateralization of signaling pathways in defined conditions may enhance neuronal and behavioral flexibility.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

For the zygote to inherit an H3K27 methylation blueprint from its mother, PcG-modified states established during oogenesis must persist through early embryogenesis until the onset of large-scale zygotic transcription (Zygotic Genome Activation, ZGA). However, questions have persisted regarding the relative contributions of two molecular mechanisms to the propagation of H3K27 methylation through early development: 1) allosteric regulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)) by existing H3K27me2/3, and 2) nucleation of E(z) activity at chromatin by DNA binding factors. Here, we investigate how allostery and nucleation contribute to H3K27 methylation dynamics in early Drosophila embryogenesis by developing and experimentally validating a mathematical model. This model incorporates measurements of the nuclear concentration dynamics of E(z) and the Polycomb Response Element binding factor Pleiohomeotic (Pho), as well as the dilution of epigenetic modifications at DNA replication with the incorporation of histones to nascent chromatin. With stochastic simulations and in vivo experiments, we assert that allosteric regulation of E(z) maintains a PcG-imprint on maternal chromosomes in the form of lower-order H3K27 methylation states (H3K27me1/2), that de novo establishment of H3K27 methylation at paternal chromosomes relies on nucleation of E(z) activity by Pho, and that broad H3K27me3 domains at both maternal and paternal chromosomes are re-established at ZGA.

Central to this approach is UbqTop, a custom computational platform that predicts Ub chain topology from tandem MS (MS2) fragmentation data by utilizing Bayesian-like scoring algorithm. To address the challenge of analyzing complex substrates, we combine this with selective Asp-N proteolysis, which digests the substrate while preserving intact Ub chains.

By contrast, an open, modular and automated system would allow researchers to tailor experimental conditions by tweaking mixing, dispensing, and freezing parameters while lowering barriers to adoption. We present VitriFlex, an open-source cryo-EM grid preparation platform built around an industrial-grade SCARA robot and 3D-printed components. Designed for modularity and ease of assembly, the system enables programmable control of grid handling, sample deposition, and blotting, supporting both standard and time-resolved workflows. VitriFlex's modularity allows flexible implementation of sample delivery strategies, including pre-mixing and on-grid mixing modes, combined with acoustic-assisted spray application. The system allows for spray-to-plunge delays as short as ~130 ms, enabling initiation of biochemical reactions within sub-second timescales prior to vitrification. Protocols are easily modifiable, and new components can be integrated with minimal redesign. We validated the platform using standard single-particle samples including apoferritin and dGTPase. Additionally, we demonstrate effective mixing capabilities by generating spike-ACE2 and 7-bungarotoxin complexes.

While related Pseudomonas species are hyperflagellated, P. aeruginosa maintains strict monoflagellation through the FleQ-FleN regulatory circuit. Here, we demonstrate that FleN dosage is essential for maintaining monoflagellation and bacterial fitness. Wild-type P. aeruginosa consistently displayed unipolar monoflagellation, while {Delta}fleN mutants developed over two-to-five flagella per cell in uni- or bipolar arrangements. Hyperflagellated {Delta}fleN cells exhibited severe fitness defects including reduced growth rates, attenuated virulence in nematode infection models, and competitive disadvantages in co-culture experiments. Remarkably, {Delta}fleN cells rapidly evolved suppressor mutations in fleQ that partially restored growth and motility without always restoring monoflagellation. Five independent suppressor alleles mapped to critical FleQ functional domains (four in the AAA+ ATPase domain, one in the DNA-binding domain), suggesting reduced protein activity that rebalances the disrupted regulatory circuit. Single-cell motility analysis revealed that suppressor strains exhibit heterogeneous swimming dynamics, with subpopulations achieving wild-type speeds despite carrying multiple flagella. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that hyperflagellation triggers extensive cellular reprogramming beyond flagellar components, affecting metabolic pathways, stress responses, and signaling networks. While hyperflagellated cells suffered complete loss of pathogenicity in animal infection models, environmental selection under viscous conditions could drive wild-type cells to evolve enhanced motility through specific fleN mutations. These findings suggest that bacterial flagellar regulatory circuits function as evolutionary capacitors, normally constraining phenotypic variation but enabling rapid adaptation to alternative motility configurations when environmental pressures exceed the performance limits of standard monotrichous flagellation.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested how distinct properties of industrialized diets alter brain neurochemistry and change appetite. We probed the properties of an industrialized diet through contrasts targeting the overall diet pattern (Western vs. control), enriched macronutrients (fat vs. sugar), and isocaloric trade-offs of macronutrient variants (saturated fatty acids vs. polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]). The most salient effects emerged from the finest-grained contrast: PUFA conditioning increased appetite through a mechanism involving elevated brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a primary serotonin catabolite associated with the gut microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplants into germ-free mice confirmed that the PUFA-conditioned gut microbiota carries an appetite-enhancing signature.

Core genome analysis revealed that A. xylosoxidans is highly adaptable, possessing a relatively small core genome. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolates from the United States revealed high resistance to multiple antibiotics including ceftolozane/tazobactam, aztreonam, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Our data show that imipenem/relebactam (IMR) is not more effective against A. xylosoxidans than imipenem (IMI) alone, indicating that relebactam does not inhibit {beta}-lactamase activity in Achromobacter. The species features multiple secretion systems, including the Type III secretion system (T3SS) of the YscN family, which is similar to those found in Bordetella pertussis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Isolates collected from the same patients showed dynamic changes in cytotoxicity, flagella motility, biofilm and antibiotic resistance suggesting its dynamic adaptation to host environment. Intra-host evolved isolates, NIH-010 and NIH-016, demonstrated the loss of flagella motility and variable cytotoxicity while exhibiting increased antibiotic resistance and enhanced biofilm formation.

We then expanded our analysis to globally distributed viral genomes. Viral distributions varied by estuary habitat, reflecting prokaryote community patterns, and highlighting that virus-host interactions are strongly influenced by environment. Viral lineages, up until approximately the rank of genus, were largely partitioned by ecological niche based on factors such as salinity and the aquatic-terrestrial divide. Across habitat boundaries, we identified variations in genomic GC content, and genomic signatures of salinity adaptation, particularly in virus major tail and capsid proteins. These included elevated ratios of acidic to basic amino acids and decreased protein isoelectric points at higher salinities which did not solely reflect biases inherited due to reliance on host machinery. Salinity is a well-described physiological stressor for prokaryotes. Results suggest that viruses employ some of the same osmoadaptive strategies independent of adaptation based on host machinery.

Recent systematic quantification of the growth of Plasmodium falciparum - the species that causes the majority of malaria mortality - under a range of shaking conditions has shown that parasite invasion of erythrocytes is affected by the shear stress to which the interacting cells are exposed. Blood flow could similarly impact shear stress and therefore invasion in vivo, but there is currently no method to precisely test the impact of flow-induced forces on parasite invasion. We have developed a microfluidic device with four channels, each with dimensions similar to those of a post-capillary venule, but with different flow velocities. Highly synchronised P. falciparum parasites are injected into the device, and parasite egress and invasion are quantified using newly developed custom video analysis, which fully automates cell type identification and trajectory tracking. The device was tested with both wild-type P. falciparum lines and lines where genes encoding proteins involved in parasite attachment had been deleted. Deletion of Erythrocyte Binding Antigen 175 (PfEBA175) has a significant impact on invasion under flow, but not in static culture.

TRIM32-mediated NSP14 SUMOylation at K9 and K200 inhibits RNA binding and NSP10 cofactor recruitment, respectively, ultimately suppressing ExoN activity. Our study further revealed that NSP14 SUMOylation by TRIM32 and its antiviral activity are broadly conserved for coronaviruses. These results identify the coronaviral NSP14 protein as a direct target of host restriction via SUMOylation, which may uncover novel ways to therapeutically inhibit coronavirus infections in humans.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

We show that mice lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rlim are lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity, owing to reduced food intake and enhanced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. We identify GABAergic neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), components of the central circadian clock, as mediators of these effects. Specifically, Rlim in neurons expressing Cre driven by RIP regulatory sequences governs daily thermogenic rhythms, while Rlim in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing neurons modulates diurnal feeding behavior. Thus, Rlim is a key regulator of diurnal rhythms controlling energy balance.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Prior studies have shown that males and females differ in gray matter volume, network connectivity profiles, and their associations with behavior and cognition. However, how these sex differences manifest in the coupling between brain structure and function remains less understood. In this study, we introduce dynamic inter-modality source coupling (dIMSC), an extension of our earlier inter-modality source coupling method (IMSC). While IMSC evaluates the coupling between source-based morphometry (SBM) from structural MRI (sMRI) and static functional network connectivity from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), dIMSC incorporates the temporal dimension by linking SBM with dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC). Objectives: This study investigated the transient coupling between dynamic FNC (dFNC) and sMRI gray matter volume over time, and compared sex differences in dFNC-sMRI coupling across brain regions in children. Methods: We used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, focusing on children aged 9-11 years. Structural MRI data were analyzed using SBM, applying independent component analysis (ICA) to extract gray matter sources. Resting-state fMRI data were processed to compute dFNC using a sliding window approach. For each subject, dIMSC was computed as the cross-correlation between the dFNC matrix and the SBM vector, resulting in a time-resolved vector that reflects the strength of structure-function coupling across components. Coupling values were categorized into positive, neutral, or negative based on a specific threshold. Sex differences in dFNC-sMRI coupling were evaluated using two-sample t-tests with correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analysis revealed significant sex-specific patterns, with males exhibiting stronger positive coupling in the postcentral gyrus and precuneus, whereas females showed stronger coupling in the inferior parietal lobule and middle frontal gyrus. Additional sex differences emerged in the neutral and negative coupling domain, with males demonstrating stronger coupling in the superior temporal gyrus, calcarine gyrus, and superior parietal lobule, whereas females exhibited stronger coupling in the caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and inferior parietal lobule. Conclusion: Together these findings suggest distinct coupling in brain structure-function coupling between sexes, potentially reflecting sex-specific organization of functional networks and their structural substrates. The dIMSC method advances our earlier work by enabling time-resolved analysis of brain structure-function coupling, providing a powerful framework for investigating neurodevelopmental processes.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here, each brain region is modelled by two oscillator clusters: a cluster of low-frequency (LFO) and high-frequency Hopf oscillators (HFO) coupled with an innovative power-coupling rule, facilitating cross-frequency interactions. The model is trained in two stages: learning oscillator frequencies and phase relations using a biologically plausible complex-Hebbian rule in the first stage, followed by a modified complex backpropagation for amplitude approximation, overcoming limitations of poor accuracy and computational complexity in existing models. This framework outperforms current methods in replicating empirical Functional Connectivity (FC), Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD), and modularity over disparate spatio-temporal scales. The correlation between the FC of fMRI and the FCs of various EEG frequency bands is reflected in the strengths of the LFO-HFO coupling. Furthermore, in-silico structural perturbation studies quantified the effect of pruning of the anatomical connectivity on spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of FC, FCD, modularity, and integration level (ISOR). The model's ability to reconstruct simultaneous EEG-fMRI data showcases significant advancement in understanding the resting-state brain's functionality from multimodal settings and deciphering neurological disorders in diverse spatiotemporal scales.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Research into the biology of this virus, including assessment of the possibility that it may be vector-transmitted, is hindered by a lack of molecular tools and robust genetic systems. Therefore, we sequenced the complete 3' untranslated region, which was not previously available, and developed an infectious clone of ENTV to facilitate further investigation of the virus. Virus derived from the clone replicated similarly to the parental virus isolate in various vertebrate cells. Surprisingly, ENTV replicated to high titers in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito cell lines, but there was no replication or infection in Culex tarsalis cells. In addition, phylogenetic and bioinformatics analyses strongly suggested that ENTV may be associated with a mosquito host. Given the bioinformatics support and efficient growth in Aedes cells, we orally exposed Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to ENTV to evaluate infection. The ENTV blood-fed mosquitoes were all negative for infection; however, when ENTV was intrathoracically inoculated, bypassing the initial midgut infection and escape barriers, it replicated to high levels in the body, without dissemination of infectious virus into the saliva. These findings suggest that, despite demonstrating high molecular compatibility at the cellular level in Aedes mosquitoes, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are unlikely to serve as competent vectors for ENTV transmission due to strong midgut infection barriers. The clone presented in this manuscript should help to clarify the mechanisms for transmission and maintenance of ENTV, which remain poorly understood.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

In coral reef fishes, color pattern changes during ontogeny can serve adaptive functions, yet the mechanisms and ecological contexts shaping these transitions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated color pattern development in the tomato anemonefish (Amphiprion frenatus), which exhibits transient posterior white barring during early juvenile stages. We demonstrated that the timing of bar loss is plastic and modulated by the social environment, where juveniles cohabiting with adult conspecifics exhibited bar loss ~24 days earlier than those isolated from adults. Through transcriptomic profiling, we identified gene expression changes implicating apoptosis- and autophagy-related pathways, as well as alterations in chromatophore development. Moreover, shifts in the expression of multiple thyroid hormone marker genes highlighted the potential neuroendocrinal integration of social cues that promoted bar loss. Ultrastructural analyses via transmission electron microscopy and in-situ assays indicated massive apoptosis of iridophores and associated dermal remodeling during the white-to-orange transition. The pharmacological inhibition of caspases delayed bar loss, confirming the functional role of programmed cell death. Behavioral trials revealed that adults responded differently to juveniles with/without the posterior bar, suggesting a role of transient barring in conflict avoidance during recruitment. Lastly, our evolutionary reconstruction of this plastic trait suggests that colony size is an important factor promoting this ontogenetic switch throughout anemonefishes. Our results provide compelling evidence for socially mediated plasticity in color pattern ontogeny with ecological and evolutionary implications for communication and species diversification in reef fishes.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

While research on the genomics of adaptation is growing, aridity-driven intraspecific divergence remains poorly quantified. Here, we address this gap by using genomic data from 230 individuals of the arid-adapted four-striped mouse Rhabdomys bechuanae, sampled across an aridity gradient in southern Africa, a region facing increasing aridification. Combining these data with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and present-day aridity indices, we investigate, from a spatio-temporal perspective, how intraspecific genetic variation relates to aridity. Inference of past effective population size revealed a sharp decline around 15,000 years BP, coinciding with regional aridification and likely reflecting reduced connectivity during dry periods. Population structure followed a pattern of isolation by distance and mirrored the aridity gradient. Genotype-Environment Association analyses identified SNPs and genes significantly associated with aridity and genetically differentiated among populations, with functions related to water and energy conservation - as expected under arid conditions - as well as neurotransmission. These findings highlight the underappreciated role for neurological processes in coping with water and resource scarcity. More broadly, our integrative population genomics approach strongly suggests that aridity shapes population connectivity and adaptation, with implications for climate resilience.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Rad50 possesses ATPase activity that provides energy for the nuclease activities of Mre11. To elucidate the variation in exonuclease activity across the T4 phage MR complex population, we conducted smFRET studies utilizing a dual-labeled Cy3 and Cy5 double-stranded DNA substrate. Our findings revealed that the wild-type (WT) MR complex population was predominantly divided into two distinct rates of exonuclease activity. The majority of the population (94%) exhibited rapid exonuclease activity, with an average rate exceeding 20 nucleotides per second, while the remaining fraction showed substantially slower exonuclease activity, averaging 0.50 nucleotides per second. Furthermore, we compared the activity of the WT population to a mutant complex harboring the Mre11 mutation L101D, which has previously been shown to disrupt the Mre11 dimer interface. The MR complex with the L101D mutation exhibited a much higher percentage of the population displaying slow exonuclease activity (78%), while the remaining population exhibited fast exonuclease activity at a rate similar to that of the WT population. Additional activity parameters were evaluated, such as pause times and transition amplitudes, under various enzyme concentrations, revealing further differences between the WT and L101D MR complexes.

The Glu residue of the motif coordinates with a divalent metal cation at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the I domain. Owing to this conserved recognition mechanism, previously identified binding sequences show low subtype selectivity. In this study, we identified triple-helical peptide ligands capable of selectively binding to the 2I domain in a manner independent of both Glu and a divalent metal cation. By employing yeast-two hybrid screening using a randomized triple-helical peptide library, we identified sequences in which canonical Glu was substituted by aliphatic residues such as Met. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed by the 2I domain and a triple-helical peptide containing GFOGMR (O: 4-hydroxyproline)--a Met-substituted variant of the canonical integrin-binding sequence GFOGER--revealed a novel binding mode. In this mode, the peptide was recognized by the closed form of the 2I domain in a metal cation-independent manner. Furthermore, this interaction mode enabled Met-containing peptides to specifically bind to the integrin 2I domain.

Persistent homology (PH), a technique from topological data analysis (TDA), provides a deformation-invariant framework for capturing structural patterns in high-dimensional data. Methods: In this study, PH was applied to a diverse collection of scRNA-seq datasets spanning eight tissue types to investigate how data integration affects the topological features and biological interpretability of the resulting representations. Clustering was performed based on PH-derived pairwise distances and global topological structure was assessed through Betti curves, Euler characteristics, and persistence landscapes. By comparing these summaries across raw, normalized, and integrated datasets, we examined whether integration enhances the detection of biologically meaningful patterns, or, conversely, obscures fine-scale structure. Results: This approach demonstrates that PH can serve as a powerful complementary strategy for evaluating the impact of integration and reveals how topological summaries can help disentangle biological signal from batch-related noise in single-cell data.

However, public 16S rRNA datasets often lack standardized metadata, particularly information on the sequenced hypervariable regions or primers used, which are critical for accurate analysis and data reuse. To address this, we present the HVRLocator, a computational tool that reliably identifies sequenced hypervariable regions, enhancing metadata quality and enabling more robust large-scale microbiome studies. Results: The HVRLocator tool processed samples at an average rate of 0.147 per minute. Validation confirmed 100% accuracy in predicting alignment positions, correctly matching sequences to the expected primer regions based on literature. We demonstrated how to use the tool to select appropriate and comparable sequences for building a global bacterial database from V4 region amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene. Using HVRLocator, we selected 36,217 valid samples out of 45,882 runs, enabling us to identify cases where metadata incorrectly labeled sequences as targeting the V4 region. Conclusion: Even when metadata is available, it can be inaccurate or misleading. HVRLocator offers a reliable and efficient method to identify the exact hypervariable sequenced region, ensuring accurate processing of large-scale 16S rRNA amplicon data. By bypassing inconsistent metadata and literature, it streamlines data curation and enhances the reliability of microbial studies, syntheses, and meta-analyses.

Precisely controlling microgel size and elasticity is crucial yet complex, as various factors influence polymerization and the resulting network structure. While it is well established that chemical reactions in microdroplets are typically faster and more homogeneous than in bulk systems, an often-overlooked aspect is the increased sensitivity of these microreactors: minor variations in chemical or physical parameters can lead to significant changes in the resulting microgel properties. Our study identifies flow conditions as a key factor influencing both microgel elasticity and size, by modulating interfacial transport during gelation. Using a flow-focusing microfluidic chip, we generated pre-gel droplets with identical composition dispersed in an oil phase, systematically varying the PAAm-to-oil flow rate ratio while keeping the total flow rate constant. This approach yields droplets with minimal diameter variation (< 1um), yet produces beads with distinct Young's moduli, despite identical total monomer concentrations. Further analysis revealed that the catalyst transport across the oil-water interface significantly affects the polymerization efficiency and polymer network. Our findings highlight that despite the advantages of droplet-based polymerization, achieving reproducible microgel properties requires careful control of flow parameters.

Intravitreal injection, the standard administration route to the posterior segment, often results in suboptimal drug diffusion through the vitreous, preventing drugs from reaching the retina. While various strategies have been explored to enhance the mobility of drug molecules and nanomedicines (drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles) in the vitreous, no method has demonstrated guided transport of drugs and particles through the vitreous. In this study we explore photothermal transport of nanoparticles in vitreous, using a pulsed-laser and indocyanine green added to the vitreous, both being clinically approved modalities. We found that photothermal transport allows to guide nanoparticles from one place in the vitreous towards the laser illuminated area in the vitreous, at a distance of the injection spot of the nanoparticles. Using multiple-particle tracking and numerical simulations, we found that both thermal convection and thermophoresis contribute to photothermal transport of nanoparticles in vitreous. We identified parameters for optimizing this effect, including dye concentration, particle size, distance from the laser focus, and laser fluence.

Genetic ablation of the glucocorticoid receptor in different cellular compartments revealed glucocorticoids acted not on immune cells but directly on tumor cells to downregulate expression of GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant). This inhibited TGF-{beta} signaling and unleashed CTL killing. In agreement, glucocorticoids stimulated tumor control in multiple cancer models, but only if the tumors also responded to pharmacological inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling. Furthermore, melanoma patients with high glucocorticoid receptor expression or signaling showed improved prognosis and lower TGF-{beta} signaling in tumor-infiltrating CTLs.

VRACs are heteromers of proteins from the leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 (LRRC8A-E), with LRRC8A being essential. Other LRRC8 subunits are expressed in a cell type-specific manner and modulate the biophysical properties of VRACs, including permeability to small signaling molecules. Here, we used primary astrocyte cultures from wild-type and genetically modified C57BL/6 mice to investigate (i) LRRC8 subunit composition of endogenous VRACs in the brain and (ii) the subunit determinants of VRAC permeability to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. qPCR and RNA-seq revealed high expression of Lrrc8a-d in mouse forebrain and astrocytes. As expected, Lrrc8a deletion abolished VRAC activity, measured as swelling-activated release of the glutamate analogue D-[3H]aspartate. RNAi knockdown of individual subunits established that LRRC8A and LRRC8C are key components of astrocytic glutamate-permeable VRACs, with their siRNAs reducing radiotracer release by 85% and 56%, respectively. Downregulation of LRRC8D had a moderate effect, which depended on the severity of swelling. Combined silencing of LRRC8C and LRRC8D suggested that these subunits act in distinct channel populations. LRRC8B silencing alone was ineffective but partially rescued glutamate release in LRRC8C- or LRRC8D-knockdown cells. Overall, these findings indicate that astrocytic glutamate-permeable VRACs are primarily composed of LRRC8A and LRRC8C, with a possible structural role for LRRC8B.

The primary hypothesis was that modeling sample size in the simulations would reduce cluster thresholds. A secondary hypothesis was that this reduction in cluster size was due to between-subject variability, which was tested by eliminating the corresponding standard error term. Whole-brain acquisition volume parameters were fixed, while the following key parameters were varied to reflect commonly employed ranges: sample size (N = 10, 20, or 30), corrected p-value (.05, .01, or .001), individual-voxel p-value (.01, .005, or .001), FWHM (3, 5, or 7 mm), and voxel resolution (2 or 3 mm). Each simulation consisted of 100 iterations repeated 100 times, with a total of 4,860,000 iterations and 66,420,000 simulated subjects. There was a significant effect of condition; clusters were approximately 18% smaller with versus without N modeled (and there was a significant increase in cluster thresholds for larger sample sizes).

In this study, we analyzed the data of peripheral blood and spleen of mice infected with Echinococcus granulosus(EG) by scRNA+TCR+BCR-seq, and made the following novel findings: (1) Peripheral blood of Echinococcus granulosus (EG)-infected mice contained a higher proportion of dual TCR(T cell receptor) T cells with higher clonality than uninfected mice; (2) There was a bias in V gene usage between single TCR T and dual TCR T cells, as well as between single BCR(B cell receptor) B cells and dual BCR B cells in EG-infected mice; (3) Dual TCR Tregs, dual TCR effector CD8 T cells, dual BCR Bregs, and dual BCR memory/dividing B cells exhibited relatively high clonal expansion in EG-infected mice; (4) Shared CDR3 sequences and consistently highly expressed mRNA molecules exist between single receptor T/B and dual receptor T/B cells in EG-infected mice. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that dual BCR B cells are closely related to the expression of factors associated with pathways such as \"Th1/Th2 differentiation\" and \"antigen processing and presentation\". These results suggest that dual TCR T and dual BCR B cells may be involved in the specific responses and regulation of EG-infected mice, providing a novel perspective for the adaptive immune response mechanisms and targeted therapy of parasitic infections.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we used short- and long-read RNA sequencing to interrogate the transcriptome-wide effects of HNRNPH1 depletion and its regulation of specific splicing events. Differential alternative splicing analysis revealed effects on the transcriptome that involved all splice event categories. We confirmed HNRNPH1's regulation of a splicing event involving TCF3-exons 18a and 18b that encode distinct TCF3 transcription factor isoforms. Extending this finding, we present evidence that in neuroblastoma, HNRNPH1 is a MYCN target, potentially explaining the higher levels of HNRNPH1 and TCF3-exon 18a transcript variants in this tumor type. Analysis of two skipped exon events determined that HNRNPH1 regulates the splicing of exons encoding part of the EIF4G1 translation initiation factor's N-terminus and an exon included in the 5'UTR of specific transcript variants encoding the mitotic kinase AURKA. Using reporter constructs, we show this AURKA 5' UTR exon enhances expression, suggesting HNRNPH1 could contribute to regulating AURKA protein levels. Our findings highlight HNRNPH1' roles in regulating the expression of proteins with diverse cellular functions.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

A.; Lee, C.", "abstract": "CTCF-mediated chromatin loops are known to influence gene regulation, yet their role in pre-mRNA splicing remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that structural variants (SVs) at the anchors of intronic CTCF loops can modulate exon usage. By integrating high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and gene expression datasets from C57BL/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129S) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), with structural variant (SV) maps from the 129S mouse, we identified thousands of intron-anchored CTCF loops. Our data indicate that SVs intersecting loop anchors are more frequently associated with differential exon inclusion events than with changes in overall gene expression. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of two SV-harboring intronic CTCF sites in Numbl and Ireb2 validated the predicted splicing shifts observed between B6 and 129S ESC that correspond with diminished long-range chromatin looping. Our findings reveal a direct mechanistic link between 3D genome architecture and alternative splicing and highlight non-coding SVs as modulators of transcript diversity. Our study has thus identified a novel class of CTCF-bound regulatory elements regulating alternative splicing.

Podocytes, cells in the kidney are terminally differentiated and incapable of division in vivo making the establishment of primary cultures particularly challenging. The ability of cells to proliferate and avoid senescence is closely linked to telomere length. When telomere length becomes critically reduced, it results in cellular senescence. Methods We present the successful rejuvenation of a human SIX2-positive renal progenitor cell line derived from the urine of a 30-year-old West African male (UM30-OSN). To achieve partial reprogramming, plasmids expressing the Yamanaka factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-Myc, and KLF4 were employed. Results UM30-OSN expresses the pluripotency-associated marker SSEA4, renal stem cell markers such as SIX2, CD133 and CD24, determined by immunofluorescence, FACS and qPCR. Expression analysis revealed downregulation of senescence markers p21and p53 and upregulation of proliferation-associated genes PCNA, KI67 and TERT, confirming rejuvenation. Upon podocyte differentiation, UM30-OSN cells expressed podocyte-specific markers NPHS1, NPHS2, SYNPO and CD2AP. Comparative transcriptome analyses revealed a correlation co-efficiency (R2 = 0.88) with the immortal podocyte line AB 8/13. To demonstrate the usefulness of UM30-OSN to model APOL1-mediated kidney disease, we investigated the effects of Interferon[gamma]; (IFN[gamma];) on UM30-OSN derived podocytes and evaluated the potential of the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor Baricitinib to mitigate IFN[gamma];-induced cellular responses. IFN[gamma]; stimulation resulting in increased phosphorylation of STAT1, activation of APOL1, upregulation of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic markers such as, IL-6, TGF[beta];, Vimentin, Fibronectin, and morphological changes indicative of cell stress. Pre-treatment with Baricitinib effectively inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, reduced expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis-associated genes, and preserved podocyte morphology. Conclusion Given their robust proliferation capacity, UM30-OSN cells represent a valuable additional model for investigating kidney-associated diseases such the contribution of APOL1 high-risk variants to kidney injury and fibrosis.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

J.; Spurgeon, D.; Kille, P.; Cunha, L.", "abstract": "Earthworms thriving in naturally occurring geothermal soils offer rare insight into rapid adaptation to environmental extremes. Here, we show that the pantropical earthworm Amynthas gracilis survives and flourishes in soils of the Furnas Volcano (Sao Miguel Island, Azores), where conditions include elevated temperatures (up to 40 degrees C), high CO2 (88.6%), low O2 (10%), toxic metals, and mildly acidic pH. In a reciprocal-transplant, mesocosm-based experiment between soils overlying areas of active volcanic degassing (hereafter active degassing soils) and reference soils, we observed convergence of epidermal thickness in transplanted earthworms to the local resident phenotype (24 +/- 3.9 micrometers in active degassing soil vs. 43.8 +/- 8 micrometers in reference soil) within 31 days. Combining RNA-Seq, DNA (5-cytosine) methylation mapping, and microRNA profiling, we show that this phenotypic plasticity arises from coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. While gene-body methylation occurred at approximately 98% of loci, levels varied considerably, and differentially methylated regions were enriched for genes whose expression also changed under volcanic stress. Multi-omics network analysis identified epithelial morphogenesis, circulatory system formation, and neural development as regulatory hubs. Notably, a core set of 41 epithelial morphogenesis genes exhibited consistent methylation and miRNA signatures. Additional modules governing ion transport and signal transduction further contributed to the adaptive response. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that A. gracilis employs dynamic DNA methylation and microRNA regulation alongside transcriptional plasticity to achieve persistent phenotypic adjustment under volcanic stress. This work enhances our understanding of extremophile resilience and provides a scalable model for predicting organismal adaptive capacity under environmental extremes.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

It triggers the S-phase checkpoint, a signaling pathway that coordinates the handling of replication obstacles with cell cycle progression. One prominent source of replication stress is the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks on the template, such as those induced by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). In this study, we investigated how the S-phase checkpoint responds to CPT-induced replication stress. We show that both activation and timely deactivation of checkpoint signaling are critical for DNA replication completion and cell viability. Using a locus-specific approach, we found that checkpoint signaling is actively dampened at lesion sites. Mechanistically, this attenuation involves the displacement of the checkpoint mediator Rad9 by the DNA repair factors Slx4 and Fun30. This local dampening not only promotes cell cycle progression, but also permits Exo1-dependent resection of replication forks stalled by Top1-DNA crosslinks. Controlled resection, in turn, allows homologous recombination factors to access and stabilize the forks, preventing their degradation. In conclusion, we propose that local checkpoint dampening by Slx4 and Fun30 at replication stress sites is a critical mechanism that promotes replication completion and preserves genome stability.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

S.; McNinch, C.; Barletta, A. B.

We characterized the Anopheles gambiae fat body and associated cells, examining their responses to blood feeding, bacterial infection, and immune priming following Plasmodium berghei infection, at single-cell resolution. We analyzed 97,650 nuclei from the female mosquito's abdominal body wall and identified seven major cell types. Fat body trophocytes were the most abundant (~85% of cells), while sessile hemocytes represented 7.4% of cells. Trophocytes consisted of five subpopulations, including basal (T1, T2), metabolic-enriched (T3), immune-responsive (T4), and a vitellogenic population (T5) exclusive to blood-fed females. T4 trophocytes exhibited constitutive expression of immune genes, while multiple cell types, including other trophocytes, hemocytes, and epidermal epithelial cells, responded to a systemic bacterial challenge. Oenocytes (1.1% of cells) induced the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipids in response to immune priming. Blood feeding triggered massive transcriptomic changes, with a strong induction of vitellogenin and multiple genes involved in DNA replication, consistent with trophocyte endoreplication and metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, vitellogenin mRNA was expressed only in the first layer of trophocytes facing the hemolymph and had an apical subcellular localization. These findings provide a high-resolution atlas of fat body and associated cells, revealing specialized roles in immunity and reproduction and offering insights into how mosquitoes coordinate metabolic and immune functions at the cellular level.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

The ability to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics can help reduce costly encounters. While the solitary Testudo hatchlings use familiarity to avoid unfamiliar conspecifics, it remains unclear whether this strategy persists into adulthood or varies by sex. After a group familiarisation phase, we tested adult Testudo hermanni in a novel arena with either a familiar or unfamiliar same-sex individual after a period of cohabitation. Familiarity had no significant effect on inter-individual distance, facing orientation, or aggression, suggesting that adult tortoises do not modulate social cohesion based on familiarity. In contrast, we found striking sex differences: males approached conspecifics quickly and remained in close proximity throughout the test, frequently displaying aggression; females initially explored the partner but then distanced themselves, with minimal aggression, as hatchlings do. These results suggest that while tortoises maintain a solitary strategy across life stages, adult social behaviour is shaped more by sex-specific motivations than by familiarity. By showing that sex-specific behaviours dominate adult social interactions, this study provides insight into solitary strategies in tortoises and highlights considerations important for conservation planning.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

Three-dimensional (3D) quantification of whole-muscle architecture and strain, and their relationship during contraction is critical to understanding the mechanical function of skeletal muscle in health and disease. This has proven to be challenging, as brightness mode ultrasound is capable of measuring muscle architecture during contraction but cannot capture 3D changes in whole-muscle architecture, while Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-based tractography can measure 3D whole-muscle architecture but its use during contraction is precluded by long scan times (>5 minutes). In this study, we implement DTI-based tractography with an image registration-based approach, previously validated under passive deformation, to estimate 3D whole-muscle architecture of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during moderate intensity contractions (20-40% MVC). Moreover, this approach allows the measurement of whole-muscle strain during contraction, facilitating the evaluation of intramuscular relationships between architecture and strain. Our results show a decrease in the fiber-tract length, an increase in the pennation angle, and an increase in the fiber curvature of the TA during contraction. Intramuscular strain heterogeneity was observed between and within different regions of the muscle, with exploratory analyses suggesting that regional strain heterogeneity could be influenced by muscle architecture. Our results showcase the potential of MRI-based methods to obtain 3D estimates of whole-muscle architecture and strain during contraction, providing a breadth of new data that allows for new avenues of skeletal muscle biomechanical research.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}

The DNA receptor ComEA is essential for transporting external transforming DNA into the periplasm by an unknown mechanism. Here, single-molecule optical tweezers and electron microscopy approaches show that Geobacillus stearothermophilus ComEA forms dynamic oligomers on DNA that can switch between two conformations depending on local concentration. When ComEA sparsely decorates DNA, it forms bridging oligomers that condense the DNA to generate sub-pN pulling forces. When ComEA more fully decorates DNA, it forms non-bridging oligomers that decondense DNA and cannot generate force. Mutating ComEA to favor either bridging or non-bridging conformations causes transformation deficiency in Bacillus subtilis, meaning condensation and decondensation are separately essential. Our results show that ComEA reversibly condenses DNA during natural transformation, first producing force to pull DNA into the periplasm and then abating force production to promote transport into the cytoplasm.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": ""}
