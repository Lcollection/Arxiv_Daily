Exposure to high levels of air pollutants have been associated with brain differences in youth, though the relevance of these brain findings to behavioral outcomes such as cognitive development is less clear. In this study, we used the US Environmental Protection Agency's thresholds for unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), Ozone (O3), and NO2 pollutants to compare youth exclusively exposed to high levels of each pollutant to their respective socioeconomically-matched low-pollution peers over a two-year period in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. No youth in ABCD study were found to be at or above the unhealthy threshold for NO2. Separate multivariate analyses for PM2.5 (NHigh=348; Ncontrol=279) and O3 (NHigh=355; Ncontrol=324) resulted in two very similar neurocognitive latent variables loading positively on cortical functional maturation and task performance, and negatively on cortical grey matter thickness. We found a significant difference in this neurocognitive maturation latent variable over time between the high-pollution and control groups from 9-10 to 11-12 years of age, such that maturation of cortical networks, increase in task performance, and cortical thinning were significantly higher in the control groups. These results were adjusted for parental income and education and youth's age, sex, race/ethnicity, site, head-motion, scanner, general factor of psychopathology, pubertal status, and area deprivation index, in addition to the matching between high-pollution and control groups. In conclusion, exposure to high levels of PM2.5 and O3 is associated with lags in normative neurocognitive maturation in early adolescence.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Concatenated subunit constructs are powerful tools for elucidating subunit stoichiometry in ion channel gating and regulation, allowing control over subunit arrangement, stoichiometry, and mutation. However, the additional S0 transmembrane segment in BK places its N- and C-termini on opposite sides of the membrane, preventing tandem BK channel subunit construction by conventional methods. To investigate the atypical all-or-none modulatory function of {gamma} subunits and the subunit stoichiometry of BK channel gating, we developed concatenated constructs containing 2 or 4 BK subunits by splicing them into modular forms that can be co-expressed to form functional channels. These constructs retained voltage and Ca2+ gating properties similar to intact BK channels. By fusing the LRRC26 ({gamma}1) subunit to the N-terminus of tandem BK constructs, we found that a single {gamma}1 subunit per  subunit tetramer is sufficient to fully modulate the channel. Furthermore, the L312A mutation in the deep pore region exhibited a stoichiometrically graded effect on voltage-gated BK channel activation. In contrast, a V288A mutation at the selectivity filter induced channel inactivation only when present in all four BK subunits. Thus, by engineering concatenated BK constructs, we identified three distinct stoichiometric modes of BK channel gating control by LRRC26, the pore, and the selectivity filter. This study offers new molecular tools and advances our understanding of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel gating and modulation.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Arain, S.; Mentor, W.; Garcia-Marin, V.; Birk, A.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical early driver of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in optic nerve injury. We evaluated whether HDAP2, a mitochondria-targeted aromatic peptide designed to support mitochondrial membrane integrity, could preserve neuronal structure after optic nerve crush (ONC). Systemically administered HDAP2 penetrated the blood-retinal barrier and localized to RGCs and mitochondrial-rich retinal layers. Daily treatment (IP, 3 mg/kg for 14 days) significantly improved RGC survival compared to saline-treated ONC animals. RGC densities increased across central, midperipheral, and peripheral regions, and surviving RGCs exhibited approximately two-fold higher RBPMS expression, suggesting improved cellular health. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that HDAP2 substantially reduced mitochondrial loss within crushed optic nerve axons. Mitochondrial density in HDAP2-treated nerves reached 70% of uninjured levels (0.129 {+/-} 0.029 vs. 0.185 {+/-} 0.017) and was 5.3-fold higher than untreated ONC nerves (0.025 {+/-} 0.012; Kruska-Wallis p = 0.039; Cohen's d = 2.77). Mitochondrial morphology was similar across groups, indicating that HDAP2 prevents mitochondrial loss rather than rescuing damaged organelles. HDAP2-treated nerves also contained a higher density of structurally intact axons, consistent with reduced ultrastructural degeneration following injury. These findings demonstrate that HDAP2 limits mitochondrial loss and attenuates neuronal degeneration after ONC. Together, the results support HDAP2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for protecting CNS projection neurons by maintaining mitochondrial stability after axonal injury.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

We confirm that the proteolytic processing of PCDH19, previously described in hippocampal neurons, also takes place in cortical neurons in vivo and show that nuclear transport of its intracellular domain is mediated by importins. RNAseq analysis further indicates that the intracellular domain of PCDH19 leads to broad transcriptomic changes. Finally, we use in utero electroporation to provide the first in vivo data about the role of this cleaved intracellular domain in upper layer cortical neurons, where it reduces spine density through an increase in Xlr gene expression without affecting overall dendritic morphology.

We hypothesized that transendocardial injection of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived committed cardiac progenitor cells (CCPs), combined with cardiac fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (cECM) to enhance cell retention, will generate cardiac tissue grafts improving contractility without triggering ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: hiPSCs were differentiated using bioreactors and small molecules to produce committed cardiac progenitor cells (CCPs). MI was created using a coronary artery balloon occlusion and reperfusion model in Yucatan mini pigs. Four weeks later, epicardial needle injections of CCPs+cECM were performed in a small initial feasibility cohort (n=6), and then transendocardial injections of CCPs+cECM (n=14), CCPs alone (n=14), cECM alone (n=4) or vehicle control (n=13) into the peri-infarct region in a randomized cohort. Arrhythmias were evaluated using implanted event recorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and invasive pressure-volume assessment were used to evaluate left ventricular anatomic and functional performance. Detailed histology was performed to detect and characterize human grafts. Results: A scalable biomanufacturing protocol was developed generating CCPs which can efficiently differentiate into cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells in vitro. Intramyocardial delivery of CCPs to post-MI porcine hearts resulted in engraftment and differentiation of CCPs to form ventricular cardiomyocyte rich grafts. There was no significant difference in cardiac MRI-based measured cardiac volumes or function between control, CCP and CCP+cECM groups; however, pressure-volume analysis showed an improvement in dobutamine-stimulated functional reserve in CCP and CCP+cECM groups. Delivery of CCPs did not result in tumors or ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusions: Transendocardial delivery of CCPs with or without cECM into post-MI porcine hearts resulted in comparable human cardiomyocyte grafts which did not improve resting LV function but did improve stress-induced contractile reserve without triggering ventricular arrhythmias.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

In Col4a3 null mice (C57BL/6 background), we found that increased glomerular capillary deformability (reduced Youngs modulus, E) appears 2 to 3 months before detectable proteinuria or elevated serum creatinine. This early change indicates that podocyte injury precedes traditional clinical markers of disease and corresponds to reduced podocyte adhesion and loss. Bulk and podocyte-enriched RNAseq data, obtained from deconvoluting bulk RNA sequencing data, showed that starting at 4 months, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) steadily rise while extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and maladaptive repair begin. By 7 months, pathology shifts toward widespread parenchymal fibrosis, interleukin, cytokine, and chemokine signaling, cytoskeleton disruption, metabolic failure, and podocyte dedifferentiation. Notably, administration of the chemical chaperone TauroUrsoDeoxcycholic Acid (TUDCA) from weaning reduced ER stress, preserved glomerular stiffness, minimized podocyte detachment and loss, normalized inflammatory, injury, and fibrotic gene expression, and halved proteinuria and serum creatinine at 7 months, preserving kidney structure. Differentially expressed podocyte enriched genes from 4-month Col4a3 null (vs WT) mice were mapped to human orthologs in the NEPTUNE cohort. Four genes (CRB2, GPC6, NKD1, STX11) were associated with End Stage Renal Disease or 40% loss of eGFR (ESRD40). Collectively, our results identify these four genes and ER stress/UPR as key and treatable drivers of podocyte injury and disease progression in Alport syndrome, well before overt proteinuria, and highlight UPR activation and several genes as promising targets for disease modifying therapies.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

This \"clock\" relies on the activity of interconnected clusters of neurons that harbor the clock machinery. The hierarchy among clusters involved in the control of rest-activity cycles has been extensively studied. Sexually dimorphic behaviors, on the other hand, have received less attention. Even though egg-laying, a female characteristic behavior, has been shown to be rhythmic, it remains largely unexplored possibly due to metholodological constraints. The current study provides the first steps towards determining the neural substrates underlying the circadian control of egg-laying. We show that, whereas the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) and the dorsal neurons (DNs) are dispensable, the lateral dorsal neurons (LNds) are necessary for rhythmic egg-laying. Systematically probing the Drosophila connectome for contacts between circadian clusters and oviposition-related neurons, we found no evidence of direct connections between LNvs or DNs and neurons recruited during oviposition. Conversely, we did find bidirectional connections between Cryptochrome (Cry) expressing LNd (Cry+ LNds) and oviposition related neurons. Taken together, these results reveal that Cry+ LNd neurons have a leading role in the control of the egg-laying rhythm in Drosophila females.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Creb binding protein (CBP) and EP300 (p300) are transcription coactivators that regulate gene expression in multicellular organisms, following their recruitment to cis-regulatory elements. CBP and p300 contain large IDRs, however little is known about how these different IDRs work together to regulate CBP function. Here, we show that CBP-IDRs cooperate to control different aspects of CBP behaviour in the nucleus, by regulating the properties of fluid-like condensates formed by endogenous CBP. We show how IDRs with different sequence properties make unique contributions to CBP behaviour by establishing a balance between positive and negative regulation of CBP condensates. These conflicting interactions are functionally important, shaping CBPs response to factors such as lysine acetylation, that influence condensate formation. When disrupted, regulatory CBP-IDRs change how CBP interacts with chromatin, alter patterns of CBP-dependent histone acetylation and change gene expression. Together, our work highlights how IDRs with different sequences, spatially segregated in the same protein, can cooperate to shape protein function.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Single cell analyses revealed co-occurrence of several methylated residues on histones. Histone hypermethylation correlated with bacterial load and was prevented by antibiotic treatment. Mapping of trimethylation of histone 3 at residues K4 and K9 revealed a broad distribution throughout the chromatin. Nuclear fractions of infected cells exhibited a four-fold decrease of demethylase activity towards H3K4me3 and a two-fold increase in succinate concentration, a competitive inhibitor for the demethylase co-factor -ketoglutarate. Supplementation of the culture medium with dimethyl-ketoglutarate (DMKG) or with iron, a second co-factor of histone lysine demethylases, reduced histone hypermethylation. DMKG supplementation modified the transcription of about one third of the infection-responsive genes, indicating that histone hypermethylation contributes to modulating the transcriptional response of the host to infection. Finally, chemical inhibition of histone demethylases in a mouse model of infection showed a moderate benefit regarding the outcome of infection.

Animals were reared continuously under ground-based simulated Martian conditions across six generations and assessed using high-throughput behavioral and morphometric assays. Animals remained viable but acquired progressive transgenerational impairments across multiple functional domains. Swimming frequency showed immediate and severe deficits at all generations tested (Cohen's d = 2.6-4.2), while chemotaxis deficits emerged more gradually, becoming significant by Generation 4. Morphological changes followed non-monotonic trajectories, with transient compensatory growth at Generation 4 followed by increased developmental variability at Generation 6. These differential patterns of impairment across neuromuscular, sensory, and developmental systems reveal domain-specific vulnerabilities to sustained Martian conditions.

MoPaDi combines diffusion autoencoders with task-specific multiple instance learning classifiers to manipulate tissue images and flip predictions by modifying relevant visual features. We extensively validated MoPaDi across colorectal, breast, liver, and lung cancers, covering tissue type, cancer subtype, and a biomarker (microsatellite instability) classification tasks. Counterfactual explanations were assessed through quantitative analyses, pathologists' evaluations, and independent foundation model-based classifiers. We further disentangled model predictions into stain style- and morphology-related components using a hybrid decomposition approach. Unlike conventional reviews of highly attended regions typical in digital pathology, MoPaDi explanations enabled pathologists to directly identify morphological features driving the classifier's predictions from a limited number of top-contributing tiles (N = 52 for microsatellite instability classifier). Consistent with the literature, our biomarker classifier associated high microsatellite instability with mucinous differentiation, glandular patterns, and lymphocytic infiltration.

To interpret our predictions, we introduce a deterministic motif discovery algorithm to leverage our data structure, recapitulating the established motifs of numerous RBPs as validation. Importantly, we characterize the binding motifs and binding contexts for 71 RBPs in HepG2 and 74 RBPs in K562, with many of them being novel. Finally, through feature integration, transitive inference, and a new cross-prediction approach, we propose novel cooperative and competitive RBP-RBP interaction partners and hypothesize their potential regulatory functions. In summary, we present a complete framework for investigating the contextual determinants of specific RBP binding, and we demonstrate the significance of our findings in delineating RBP binding patterns, interactions, and functions.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

A key scientific question is whether these biological and artificial systems, despite their different architectures, converge on similar strategies to solve this challenge. While ASR systems now achieve human-level performance, research on their parallels with the brain has been limited by biologically implausible, non-causal models and comparisons that stop at predicting brain activity without detailing the alignment of the underlying representations. Furthermore, studies using text-based models overlook the crucial acoustic stages of speech processing. Here, using high-resolution intracranial recordings and a causal, recurrent ASR model, we bridge these gaps by uncovering a striking correspondence between the brain's processing hierarchy and the model's internal representations. Specifically, we demonstrate a deep alignment in their algorithmic approach: neural activity in distinct cortical regions maps topographically to corresponding model layers, and critically, the representational content at each stage follows a parallel progression from acoustic to phonetic, lexical, and semantic information. This work thus moves beyond demonstrating simple model-brain alignment to specifying the shared underlying representations at each stage of processing, providing direct evidence that both systems converge on a similar computational strategy for transforming sound into meaning.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

In a sample of ten intracranial EEG patients we tracked slow neural state-patterns as patients viewed a movie and then searched their memories in a structured naturalistic interview. As patients answered questions (\"after A, when does B happen next?\"), state-patterns from movie-viewing were reinstated in neocortex. During the critical memory-search period, states unfurled in a forward direction, realizing a trajectory from A to B in memory. Punctate moments of state-transition during memory-search were marked by low-frequency power decreases in cortex and preceded by power decreases in hippocampus that correlated with reinstatement.

Here, we directly demonstrate image-specific foveal feedback to primary visual cortex in the context of saccadic eye movements. To this end, we used a gaze-contingent fMRI paradigm, in which peripheral saccade targets disappeared before they could be fixated. Despite no direct foveal stimulation, we were able to decode peripheral saccade targets from foveal retinotopic areas, demonstrating that image-specific feedback during saccade preparation may underlie this effect. Decoding was sensitive to shape but not semantic category of natural images, indicating feedback of only low-to-mid-level information. Cross-decoding to a control condition with foveal stimulus presentation indicates a shared representational format between foveal feedback and direct stimulation. Moreover, eccentricity-dependent analyses showed a u-shaped decoding curve, confirming that these results are not explained by spillover of peripheral activity or large receptive fields. Finally, fluctuations in foveal decodability covaried with activity in the intraparietal sulcus, thus providing a candidate region for driving foveal feedback. These findings suggest that foveal cortex predicts the features of incoming stimuli through feedback from higher cortical areas, which offers a candidate mechanism underlying stable perception.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Toxicity models are among the most commonly used mouse models to induce demyelination; however, it remains unclear whether different demyelination models elicit distinct glial responses, and how comparable these changes are to human diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To address this gap, we integrated new and published single cell transcriptomic data of the subcortical white matter from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and cuprizone (CPZ) toxicity models, and compared them to an existing human MS dataset. We find that CPZ demyelination induces a distinct oligodendrocyte (OL) state, enriched for cell stress pathways and Cdkn1a and Nupr1 expression, that resembles disease-associated OLs in MS lesions. However, both LPC and CPZ converge at a similar remyelination OL state that expresses immune-related genes, such as Socs3 and B2m. Analysis of microglia reveals a largely conserved activation of microglia in both models, but LPC demyelination induces a stronger response, with recruitment of perivascular macrophages, that persists longer during remyelination. Interestingly, both mouse models do not recapitulate the heterogeneity of microglia across different MS lesion types. Overall, this comparative analysis uncovers specific gene expression differences between mouse demyelination models and human MS lesions, providing a foundation for using the animal models effectively to advance remyelination therapies.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Although swelling was recently shown to occur in two steps, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving this process remained unclear. Using fast quantitative microscopy, we reveal that between the two swelling phases, cell volume transiently stabilizes despite sustained plasma membrane permeability to ions and small molecules. From a biophysical perspective, the existence of such a plateau is puzzling, as ion pumps should not be able to regulate cell volume under these conditions. To address this, we developed a physical model based on an ion pump and leak framework that incorporates the dynamics of non-selective pore formation. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the plateau phase is controlled by the dynamics of the GSDMD pore enlargement, which is modulated by Ninj1 activation, possibly through intracellular calcium. Ninj1-mediated lesions are also required for the second swelling phase. We further show that fully opened GSDMD pores display an effective hydrodynamic radius slightly above 1.9 nm, providing an insitu upper bound for pore size. Together, our findings demonstrate that pyroptotic volume dysregulation emerges from the successive and interdependent actions of GSDMD and Ninj1, each imparting distinct permeability regimes associated with increased water filtration and decreased ion selectivity due to pore opening. These insights bridge molecular and biophysical perspectives on lytic cell death and may inform the broader understanding of membrane rupture in inflammatory and pathological contexts.\n\nSignificance StatementAmong programmed modes of lytic cell death, pyroptosis mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD) and ninjurin-1 (Ninj1) involves dramatic changes in cell shape and large volume fluctuations, fundamentally altering the cells physical properties. By combining optogenetics, quantitative microscopy, and modeling, we show that a progressive increase in plasma membrane pore size drives cell swelling and membrane lysis through successive and interdependent actions of GSDMD and Ninj1, each imparting distinct permeability regimes associated with increased water filtration and decreased ion selectivity. A deeper understanding of these dynamic cell modifications will shed light on the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving different forms of cell death.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Bayesian hierarchical regression showed that increasing PA levels were associated with faster reward learning under high uncertainty (large action space) but faster punishment learning under low uncertainty (reduced action space). These learning biases--reflecting the interaction between PA and reinforcement type--were associated with reinforcement-driven modulation of motor variability and frontal theta (4-7 Hz) activity encoding feedback changes and signalling motor adjustments.

The parent neurons of the axons are in the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus and their terminals form calyx-like multi-release site synapses in the rodent forebrain extended amygdala similar to the calyx of Held in the auditory brain stem. The latter is a giant, excitatory, cup-like axo-somatic high-fidelity synapse. The PACAP-positive terminals also form enveloping axo-somatic specialization with mixed glutamatergic and cholinergic molecular identities, co-expressing VGluT1, VGluT2, VAChT, and the neuropeptides PACAP, CGRP, and neurotensin, together with calretinin in the presynaptic compartment. We identified a distinct neuronal subpopulation in the pontine Kolliker-Fuse region of the parabrachial complex that gives rise to these calyceal terminals, which engulf PKCdelta/GluD1 somata in the capsular central amygdala and oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Strikingly, GluD1 immunolabeling is concentrated at axo-somatic contact zones apposed to VAChT presynaptic vesicle clusters zones but is absent from postsynaptic densities of conventional type I synapses within the same terminals.

This setup incorporates high-speed 3D tracking, real-time visual feedback, and automated data processing, creating realistic and interactive scenarios.We present experimental results, obtained with Rummy-nose tetras (Hemigrammus rhodostomus), showing that freely moving real fish consistently adjusted their speed, depth, and spatial positioning to follow virtual fish effectively. Fish matched moderate virtual speeds comfortably, struggled slightly at higher speeds, and actively maintained vertical positioning to sustain group cohesion. Fish also displayed significant environmental awareness, adjusting their proximity to the tank walls while maintaining visual contact with virtual fish. The implementation of this VR system provides critical insights into sensory and cognitive processes underlying collective movement and decision-making in fish. By revealing both flexibility and constraints in fish behavior, our findings underscore the potential of VR technology to study social interactions in controlled yet realistic settings.

These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion, and suggests two distinct, injury-specific routes to restored function. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate midline contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. Despite these differences, sensitivity analysis revealed that restored activation of sublesional lumbar rhythm-generating circuits and appropriately balanced lumbar commissural connectivity are the key determinants of post-injury gait expression, suggesting that injury symmetry shapes how the cord reorganizes, but effective recovery in both cases depends on re-engaging these lumbar networks, which makes them prime targets for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice we show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are robustly engaged by contraversive movement during cue-evoked avoidance and exploratory behavior. Model-based analyses controlling for movement and other covariates revealed that STN neurons additionally encode salient sensory cues, punished errors, and especially cautious responding, where their activity anticipates avoidance actions. Targeted lesions and optogenetic manipulations reveal that STN projections to the midbrain are necessary for executing cued avoidance. These findings identify a critical role for the STN in orchestrating adaptive goal-directed behavior by integrating sensory, motor, and punitive signals to guide timely, cautious actions via its midbrain projections.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

ATP ligates the canonical Purinergic Receptor 2 subtype X7 receptor (P2X7) to mediate endosomal Two-pore domain Weak Inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2 (TWIK2) translocation into the plasma membrane (PM). This endows the cells to transit to a  ready state for microbial killing in two directions: first, K+ efflux via PM-TWIK2 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which further activates metabolic pathways; second, upon bacterial phagocytosis, PM-TWIK2 internalizes into phagosome membrane with proper topological orientation, where TWIK2 mediates K+ influx into phagosomes to control pH and ionic strength favoring bacterial killing.

Intriguingly, ECACYC both affects the outer-membrane permeability barrier and functions in regulation of diacylglycerol-phosphate-linked ECA levels. While the length of linear ECA polymers generated by WzyE is regulated by the co-polymerase WzzE, WzzE is also required for ECACYC biogenesis and no ECACYC is synthesized in its absence. To uncover WzzE functions necessary for ECACYC biosynthesis, we generated plasmid-borne and chromosomal wzzE mutants in Escherichia coli K-12 and quantified their effects on linear chain-length regulation and on ECACYC synthesis. Mutations affecting linear ECA chain-length regulation in either transmembrane helix 2 or the periplasmic domain abolished ECACYC synthesis. Notably, two variants at residue F104 exhibited identical linear ECA chain-length regulation which was similar to wild type, but resulted in sharply different ECACYC production: chromosomal WzzEF104Y produced near wild-type levels of ECACYC, whereas WzzEF104H produced approximately two-fold less ECACYC.

We find that communities shifted toward larger body mass and smaller appendage sizes over time, the opposite of widely observed within-species temporal changes in North American birds. These unexpected patterns arise from changes in the relative abundance of a very small number of hyper-dominant species, with 23 out of 470 (5%) species explaining the community-level trajectories in functional traits. These species are known to be heavily impacted--both positively and negatively--by human activities, and the idiosyncratic drivers of population sizes result in weak associations between community-level functional shifts and major bioclimatic variables but strong associations with human-induced land use changes.

We show evidence for an evolutionary mechanism involving recombination-mediated exchange of these tail fiber loci across the entire Pectobacterium genus, which complements the previously known mechanism for DNA sequence inversion to maintain tailocin polymorphism at the population level. In addition, the ability to exchange tail-fiber loci in a highly targeted and genus-wide manner could influence the community dynamics in nutrient rich environments such as infected plant tissues. In conclusion, the strong signal for carotovoricin retention and ability to exchange tail fibers indicates that it significantly contributes to the community interactions of the Pectobacterium phytopathogens.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate whether variation in Xi expression among genes predicts transcriptional and phenotypic consequences of X-linked variation. We find that Xi expression levels are a strong linear predictor of female-male expression differences, suggesting that other compensatory or regulatory mechanisms play a more minor role in sex differences in X-linked gene expression. Among females, we identify traits--including BMI, estradiol, and testosterone levels--for which higher Xi expression correlates with the strength of evidence for either additive or dominance effects on the trait. We hypothesize that an underappreciated mechanism could generate dominance effects of X-linked variants on a trait--specifically when the variant influences skew in X inactivation. The work establishes Xi expression as important for understanding transcriptional sex differences and the physiological variation among females.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

These cells constitute most of the layer 2/3 excitatory populations, span distinct projection and functional hierarchies, and collectively orchestrate cortical integration and excitatory signaling. While viewing drifting gratings, Cux2 neurons exhibited compact and stable trajectories, whereas Emx1 and Slc17a7 showed broader and more distributed dynamics, implying their functional divergence in visual processes. Such geometric distinctions can be mechanistically accounted for within a low-dimensional control space where the dominant axes correspond to the effective integration timescale and recurrent gain.

However, their sustained protective efficacies were limited by relatively short-lived antibody responses and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, necessitating frequent and variant-updated boosters. We recently developed the ESCRT- and ALIX-binding region (EABR) mRNA vaccine platform, which encodes engineered immunogens that induce budding of enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) from the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in presentation of immunogens on cell surfaces and eVLPs. Prior studies showed that spike (S)-EABR mRNA-LNP immunizations elicited enhanced neutralizing antibody responses against ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 compared with conventional S mRNA-LNP in naive mice, but the effectiveness of S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters in the context of pre-existing immunity has not been investigated. Here, we evaluated monovalent Wuhan-Hu-1 (Wu1) and bivalent (Wu1/BA.5) S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters in mice pre-vaccinated with conventional Wu1 S mRNA-LNP. Compared to conventional S mRNA-LNP boosters, the EABR approach enhanced monovalent and bivalent mRNA-LNP booster-induced neutralizing responses against Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.5, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1, with bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP consistently eliciting the highest titers. Epitope mapping of polyclonal antisera by deep mutational scanning revealed that bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosted diverse polyclass anti-RBD responses, suggesting balanced targeting of multiple RBD epitope classes. In contrast, monovalent S, bivalent S, and monovalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters elicited less diverse polyclonal serum responses primarily targeting immunodominant RBD epitopes. Cryo-EM structures demonstrated that bivalent mRNA immunizations promote S heterotrimer formation, potentially enhancing bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP booster-induced antibody breadth and polyclass epitope targeting by activating cross-reactive B cells through intra-S crosslinking. These findings support the future design of bivalent or multivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters as a promising strategy to confer broader, and therefore potentially more durable, protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other rapidly evolving viruses.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

AVHuBERT identified McGurk syllables as something other than \"ba\" at a rate of 59%, demonstrating a robust McGurk effect. The rate of the McGurk effect was similar to that observed in humans: 100 participants presented with the same McGurk syllables reported non-\"ba\" percepts on 56% of trials. AVHubert variants and humans produced a wide variety of responses to McGurk syllables, including the canonical McGurk fusion percept of \"da\", responses without any initial consonant such as \"ah\" and responses with other initial consonants such as \"fa\".

Existing low-cost options often lack real-time listening and require a complex setup. There remains a critical need for versatile, affordable, and field-ready tools that support acoustic behavioural research, educational and conservation outreach. New Tool: I introduce Esperdyne, an open-source, dual-channel ultrasound monitoring and recording system based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. With a component cost under 75 Euro, Esperdyne combines real-time heterodyne monitoring, stereo recording from a retroactive ring buffer, and an intuitive rotary-based user interface with OLED display. It supports full-duplex 192 kHz audio, dual-band tuning for simultaneous FM/CF monitoring, and real-time playback via headphones or a speaker. All audio processing--including adjustable carrier frequency mixing, gain control, and file-saving logic--is implemented without reliance on fixed-rate audio libraries. Applications: Esperdyne has been tested in field conditions and shown to reliably detect high-SNR calls and harmonics from free-flying bats. A companion tool Bat Reviewer supports rapid inspection, playback, and export of selected recordings. Together, these tools enable portable, solo-operated acoustic surveys with minimal training. Beyond ecological research, Esperdyne is suitable for education, outreach, and preliminary field assessments in remote or resource-constrained settings. Its modular design encourages hardware customisation and firmware extension by interdisciplinary teams. Availability and Implementation: Full hardware schematics, firmware, and software tools are publicly available. The system can be built using hobbyist-accessible components and standard Arduino tooling. By sharing this system openly, I aim to lower technical barriers and foster broader participation in ultrasound-based biodiversity monitoring and conservation. Esperdyne demonstrates how microcontroller-based platforms can bridge gaps between affordability, usability, and scientific capability--supporting global efforts in soundscape ecology.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Quantifying a trait-mediated indirect effect of an environmental stressor on population dynamics", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.04.674171", "authors": "Shibasaki, S.; Yamamichi, M.", "abstract": "Trait-mediated indirect interactions have been intensively studied to understand ecological dynamics in biological communities. Yet, little is known about the relative importance of trait-mediated indirect effects of environmental stressors on population dynamics. How does an environmental stressor indirectly affect the population dynamics of a focal species by altering the traits of interacting species and the strength of interspecific interactions? Here, we quantified the direct and trait-mediated indirect effects of an environmental stressor by combining rotifer-alga experiments and Bayesian parameter estimation of a dynamic model. These days, human activities salinize freshwater lakes globally, thereby increasing the death rates and decreasing birth rates of plankton species. Salinity stress is also known to induce cell clumping in certain phytoplankton species. As larger clumps work as a defense trait against gape-limited predation by zooplankton, the salinity stress can affect zooplankton not only directly but also indirectly through phytoplankton trait changes. We first show that a green alga, Chlamydomonas sphaeroides, formed larger clumps than the two model species of green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris) under a moderate salinity stress (0.06M NaCl). Then, by tracking the clump size distributions of Chlamydomonas sphaeroides, we confirmed that small clumps are more vulnerable to predation by rotifers, Brachionus calyciflorus, as previous studies demonstrated. Finally, we co-cultured the green algae and rotifers for a week with and without salinity stress and fitted the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We first estimated how salinity stress increased the rotifer mortality rate using Chlorella vulgaris, which seldom showed clump formation. Then, by using Chlamydomonas sphaeroides, we estimated how salinity stress increased the mortality rate and decreased the attack rate due to clump formation. We found that salinity stress increased the rotifer mortality rate by more than seventeen-fold, and decreased the attack rate on Chlamydomonas sphaeroides to approximately half of that without salinity stress. These results indicate that salinity stress can weaken the predator-prey interaction, and thus salinization can harm freshwater zooplankton species through increasing the mortality rates and decreasing the attack rates. This will be an important step for a quantitative understanding of how environmental stressors can affect community dynamics via trait modifications.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

However, they often overlook crucial aspects of adaptation, including the long-term temporal evolutionary dynamics, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes, the influence of past evolution on future evolutionary trajectories (contingency), and the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation. Experimental evolution has been a useful tool for answering these questions, but extracting fundamental principles and predictive features of evolutionary outcomes from these datasets remains challenging due to the large number of covariates and confounding effects, such as differences in experimental setup, species lifestyle, gene content, and evolution rate. Here, we sought to circumvent these challenges by comparing distant yeast species that share several evolutionary features but differ mainly in evolutionary history and genome architecture, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus, we evolved 10 populations of the fission yeast for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset (i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions), allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species. The most frequent adapting route in these conditions involved upregulating fermentation genes and downregulating the glycolysis gene pyk1, which has not previously been observed in S. cerevisiae evolved populations or in wild Kluyveromyces lactis, but similar evolutionary paths have been observed in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and in clinically relevant populations, such as some cancer cells. This suggests that parallelism is pervasive in the tree of life and that mechanisms of adaptation can be shared among closely related or distant species. Despite similar gene content and identical environments, recurrent adaptation across S. pombe populations involved different genes than in S. cerevisiae and was mostly detectable at the transcriptomic level. This suggests that trans-regulatory effects may play an important role in adaptation on short evolutionary timescales and that differences in evolutionary outcomes between these species may be attributed to contingency.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

We isolated BDEVs from the prefrontal cortex of rats subjected to chronic morphine exposure and performed integrative analyses of their RNA and protein cargo. Total RNA sequencing with ribosomal RNA depletion was combined with unbiased proteomics to define morphine-induced alterations. Functional validation was conducted by exposing primary cortical neurons to BDEVs from morphine- or vehicle-treated donors, followed by transcriptomic profiling. Morphine significantly reprogrammed the transcriptome and proteome of BDEVs, with enrichment of pathways related to synaptic plasticity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Among the most robust changes, the synaptic regulator ARC and the ER stress marker Hspa5 were consistently modulated at both mRNA and protein levels. In functional assays, morphine-derived BDEVs altered neuronal expression of genes associated with synaptic remodeling and excitability, including Ncam1 and Kcnn1. These findings provide the first evidence that chronic opioid exposure reprograms BDEV cargo in a brain region critical for addiction, and that these vesicles are sufficient to induce transcriptional changes in recipient neurons.

Here, we present a high-throughput, semi-automated image analysis pipeline integrating the Blackbird CNC Microscopy Imaging Robot with computer vision models for mite life stage identification. We developed a publicly available dataset of over 1,500 annotated images (nearly 32,000 labeled instances) spanning five biologically relevant classes across 10 host species and >25 cultivars. Three YOLO11-based object detection models (three-, four-, and five-class configurations) were trained and evaluated using real and synthetic data. The three-class model achieved the highest overall performance on the hold out test set (precision = 0.875, recall = 0.871, mAP50 = 0.883), with detection accuracy robust to host background and moderate object densities. Application to miticidal assays demonstrated reliable fecundity estimation but reduced accuracy for mortality assessment due to misclassification of dead mites. In hop cultivar assays, the pipeline detected significant differences in fecundity, aligning with manual counts (R2 [&ge;] 0.98). Performance declined on hosts absent from training data and at densities exceeding [~]80 objects per image, underscoring the need for host-specific fine-tuning and density-aware assay experimental design.

We focus on the roles of the pioneer transcription factor GATA4 and the architectural protein CTCF. Using an inducible knockdown system during human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we show that GATA4 is essential for timely topological activation of key cardiac genes, while partial depletion of CTCF, anticipating physiological downregulation during development, enhances this process. Deletion of a single CTCF binding site on TTN leads to modest gene decompaction and transcriptional activation. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of chamber-specific cardiac organoids reveals that loss of GATA4 delays differentiation and sustains proliferation of early cardiomyocytes, whereas premature CTCF depletion accelerates yet alters cardiomyocyte maturation. These findings suggest that CTCF and GATA4 have antagonistic roles on chromatin dynamics during cardiomyogenesis, forming a rheostat that maintains accurate developmental tempo.

While both genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. In a recent preprint, we showed that cytokine signaling may be dysregulated in chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup(15q)), one of the most common syndromic forms of ASD. Specifically, Dup(15q) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibit an amplified Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) response to Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine often upregulated in ASD. To identify which gene in the 15q region may be responsible for modifying cytokine signalling responses in Dup(15q), we focus on the Cytoplasmic FMRP-Interacting Protein 1 (CYFIP1) gene, as increased CYFIP1 dosage in Dup(15q) is associated with increased severity of neurobehavioral symptoms in individuals with Dup(15q) and CYFIP1 dysregulation has been linked to altered expression of various genes involved in immunoregulatory signalling pathways. Here, we explore the effects of CYFIP1 overexpression (CYFIP1-OE) on cytokine signaling, demonstrating that CYFIP1-OE in HEK293 cells modifies the expression and activity of several cytokine signaling-related transcription factors, including STAT3 and STAT1. Additionally, we use SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to assess neuron-related phenotypes, showing that CYFIP1-OE alters IL-6-induced neurite outgrowth.

Using eDNA metabarcoding, we obtained a comprehensive and standardized overview of metazoan community diversity in 12 paired ports and adjacent natural areas along the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. As expected, we found that NIS are more abundant in ports than in natural habitats, and that the species assemblages in ports differ from those in natural habitats. In addition, we observed that communities in ports are far more homogeneous than their natural counterparts. This finding supports the hypothesis of biotic homogenization in highly anthropized habitats. We also observed a pattern that had previously been documented mainly in fish, but that we identified here in every phylum studied except Arthropoda: species richness detected in ports is comparable to, and in some case even greater than, that observed in natural habitats.

Microbiotas were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in sow feces and vagina at days 77 and 113, in colostrum, and in piglet feces at three days, three weeks and ten weeks of age. Sow fecal microbiota changed during pregnancy, but less in antibiotic groups. No significant effects on sow microbiota remained on day 113. The piglets of the antibiotic-treated sows had lower Firmicutes+Actinobacteriota to Bacteroidota+Proteobacteria ratio, lower alpha diversity and higher relative abundance of Escherichia at three days. At ten weeks, they exhibited higher alpha diversity, had higher of Prevotella and Clostridium sp. CAG-127, and smaller increase of Limosilactobacillus than the control. Increased alpha diversity at 10 weeks was associated with lower weight gain during nursing. Oliverpabstia and Mitsuokella were positively associated with growth, while CAG-127 and Campylobacter B were negatively associated. Sow antibiotic treatment decreased the positive effect of Oliverpabstia and Mitsuokella and increased the negative effects of CAG-127 and Campylobacter B.

We obtained local field potentials (LFP) from the frozen brain regions under non-depolarized (high external NaCl) and depolarized (high external KCl) saline solutions, observing spontaneous oscillations under both conditions. The electrical oscillations of the brain tissue had different amplitudes in the absence (0 mV) or presence (100 mV) of holding potential and were inhibited by the MT stabilizer paclitaxel. A frequency domain spectral analysis of the time records revealed the presence of two major peaks at approximately ~38 Hz and ~93 Hz in both preparations. However, the energy contribution of each peak was different in the hippocampus compared to neocortex. Coupled with our electron microscopy observations, these data suggest that rat brain MTs produce electrical oscillations with specific properties in the various regions of the mammalian brain, which could be partially related as their intra-axonal distributions. MT oscillations may be implicated in the wave coherence of brain activity, supporting their contribution to the concept of a brain central oscillator that drives its function.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

However, the functional role of MT oscillations in the physiology of brain function remains unknown. Acute dehydration (DH) induced by water restriction results in changes in osmolality that require the modification of osmosensitive neuronal activity in the regions of the CNS involved in osmoregulation, in particular magnocellular neurons from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON), responsible for the release of vasopressin and implicate osmosensor channels, associated with an intricate mesh of MTs. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of 24 h water deprivation (DH, dehydrated group) on the MT-based cytoskeleton of adult Wistar rats, as compared to a control group with free access to water (Control, euhydrated group). We obtained local field potentials (LFP) from isolated SON and cortex (CTX) brain tissue, observing spontaneous oscillations under both conditions. The electrical oscillations of the brain tissue from DH animals had different amplitudes and frequency peaks as compared to controls. A frequency domain spectral analysis of the time records indicated specific, SON-associated MT energy contributions of the frequency peaks in the challenged group, most particularly a dramatic increase in the 10-20 Hz range, and a statistically significant reduction in the high frequency 83-100 Hz region, not observed in the CTX samples. The data indicate that brain MTs respond to dehydration to produce electrical oscillations with distinct properties in the areas of the mammalian brain that specifically contribute to the homeostatic response.

OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins.

It uses the distribution of predicted mutational effects to infer fitness functions under different evolutionary scenarios (random drift, stabilising selection, or directional selection). Through maximum-likelihood estimation, it identifies the regime that best explains observed changes along a lineage from an ancestral sequence. RegEvol corrects biases that affected previous tests based on machine learning of transcription factor binding, while remaining conservative across different levels of divergence.

Using in vivo extracellular recordings in awake mice in a naturalistic wall-passing paradigm, we find brainstem neurons employ two distance-coding schemes: a \"proximity\" code, where firing increases monotonically as objects approach the face; and a \"map\" code, where neurons exhibit peak tuning at specific distances to collectively tile peri-head space. The map code outperforms proximity code in population decoding of distance. Perturbation experiments reveal multi-whisker integration and internuclear inhibition contribute to the generation of map-like tuning.

Non-coding variants can alter regulatory mechanisms, such as transcription factor (TF) binding control of gene expression, potentially contributing human diseases. However, with the increasing number of disease-associated variants, comprehensive functional validation remains a significant challenge. In this work, we developed a novel method called SNP Bind-n-Seq to evaluate >3,000 CHD-risk variants for allelic binding for the cardiac TFs NKX2-5, GATA4, and TBX5 in a high-throughput manner. These binding affinity data sets were coupled with a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to screen CHD-risk variant genotype-dependent regulatory activity. We identified 170 variants that exhibit allelic TF binding and 187 that modulate gene expression. Combining both approaches revealed three high-confidence variants with genotype-dependent TF binding, genotype-dependent transcriptional activity, and eOTL behavior in cardiac cells.

Within the VNO, pheromones are sensed by two families of G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) the type 1 and type 2 vomeronasal receptors (V1Rs and V2Rs). However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of V1R and V2R by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). Here we show that VSN precursors transiently express Testes-expressed gene 15 (Tex15), which in the germline is required to repress the expression of transposable elements during spermatogenesis. We find that the absence of Tex15 results in a dysregulated VR choice for V1Rs and A, B, and D family V2Rs, which manifest as a less diverse repertoire of VR expressing cells and includes a dramatic reduction in the expression of specific receptors that have been tied to intermale aggression. Accordingly, Tex15 knockout mice exhibit lowered activation in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb (AOB) after exposure to male odorants, and a loss of stereotyped aggression between male mice. Taken together, these results show that Tex15 plays a critical role in pheromone sensing by ensuring that VSNs express a diverse set of receptor proteins.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

O.; Veyrunes, F.", "abstract": "Sex differences in social aggression are widespread across the animal kingdom, with males typically displaying greater territoriality. While this dimorphism has traditionally been attributed to sex hormones, sex chromosomes can also contribute to it independently of hormonal influence. In the African pygmy mouse Mus minutoides, naturally occurring sex-reversed XY females (named X*Y due to a mutation on the X chromosome) are highly territorial in comparison to the other female genotypes present in the population (XX and XX*). However, the molecular basis of this phenotype remains unknown. Here, we evaluate molecular factors - known to correlate with aggressiveness - following a standardized behavioural assessment of aggression. We focus on i) the androgen pathway by quantifying testosterone serum levels and expression of its receptor in the brain; ii) the brain dopaminergic system through expression of dopamine-regulating genes, including the sex-determining Sry gene; and iii) neuroendocrine circuits, via vasopressin and oxytocin expression. These systems, although distinct, converge on hypothalamic-limbic circuits that regulate social behaviour and threat responses, providing an integrated framework for the modulation of aggression. Contrary to earlier reports, we found reduced level of aggression in X*Y females, likely to reflect a breeding facility effect. We also observe no correlations between aggressiveness and androgen levels or gene expression of the tested factors. However, our results support a stimulation of the dopaminergic system and of the oxytocin pathway following the agonistic assay suggesting their potential involvement in aggression-related responses. This further supports the idea that aggression is multifactorial. It is shaped by the interaction of several neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter pathways rather than a single determinant.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Keratocytes adopt a dendritic morphology to minimize light scatter, while secreting crystallin-like proteins that match refractive indices between cells and matrix.

Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIMP provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone.

Here, we describe an on-demand replacement for agar dilution (AD), specifically substituting poloxamer 407 (also known as Pluronic F-127) for Bacto Agar as the solidifying agent. Notably, 20% poloxamer 407 solutions (e.g., with Mueller-Hinton broth) remain liquid at refrigerated temperatures, but solidify upon warming, enabling facile set-up of poloxamer dilution testing (PD) in Petri dish or microwell format. For fosfomycin susceptibility testing, PD and reference agar dilution (AD) showed excellent categorical (CA) and essential (EA) agreement for E. coli (100% and 87%, respectively, n=31). For other Enterobacterales, excluding Klebsiella spp; CA and EA were both 82% (n=17, respectively). For P. aeruginosa, CA and EA were 60% and 100% (n=10), respectively, with the lower CA reflecting the large number of strains tested with MICs near categorical breakpoints. There were no very major errors, while major errors were only observed for Klebsiella spp. Additionally, PD substantially reduced the number of skipped dilutions 6-fold for E. coli (P < 0.0001) and inhibited swarming of Proteus species. We conclude that PD and AD, an imperfect gold standard, have essentially equivalent practical performance and that PD can therefore serve as an on-demand alternative testing methodology in clinical laboratories for fosfomycin testing of gram-negative pathogens.

The software allows researchers to train or apply models that jointly embed omics and text data using any numeric representation stored in an AnnData .obsm layer and any text encoder available in Hugging Face. mmContext supports integration of diverse biological text sources and provides pipelines for training, evaluation, and data preparation. We train and evaluate models for a RNA-Seq and text integration task, and demonstrate their utility through zero-shot classification of cell types and diseases across four independent datasets. By releasing all models, datasets, and tutorials openly, mmContext enables reproducible and accessible multimodal learning for omics-text integration.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that PARIS also contributes to Alzheimers disease by elevating STAT3 transcriptional activity, thereby inducing tau pathology, hippocampal atrophy, and glial activation. Genetic depletion of Paris reduced tau phosphorylation and cognitive decline in tauopathy mice, whereas neuron-specific PARIS overexpression caused tau accumulation, gliosis, and memory impairment. In contrast, astrocyte-specific overexpression did not induce pathology, indicating that PARIS acts in neurons to drive tau phosphorylation and glial activation. The pathological features induced by neuronal PARIS overexpression were rescued by STAT3 inhibition, demonstrating that PARIS and STAT3 signaling underlies these effects. Moreover, Paris knockout did not alter pathology in the amyloid-driven mouse model, highlighting specificity for tau pathology. Together, these findings reveal PARIS as a neuronal regulator of STAT3 signaling that exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration and identify the PARIS and STAT3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimers disease.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Sensor-space EEG analyses typically rely on electrode layouts or data-driven components and rarely encode cortical geometry, which makes scalp patterns difficult to link to anatomy and to compare across participants. We introduce a sensor-space basis dictionary that explicitly incorporates cortical geometry. Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenmodes are computed on a standard cortical template (fsaverage) and mapped through the lead-field matrix of a three-layer boundary-element head model to yield cortex-anchored sensor-space harmonics. This leadfield-mapped LB dictionary spans scalp topographies while preserving a meaningful spatial-frequency ordering inherited from the cortical manifold. We assess representational efficiency using ordinary least squares projections of resting EEG (eyes closed and eyes open) across 59-, 32-, and 19-channel montages, and compare against spherical harmonics (SPH), principal components (PCA), and independent components (ICA). Efficiency is quantified by the variance explained (R-squared) by the leading K modes, and by two efficiency indices, K70 and K90, defined as the smallest number of modes needed to reach at least 70% and 90% of the variance. Reliability is quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3,1) for eyes-open versus eyes-closed coefficients. The cortex-anchored basis shows higher early-K variance explained (R-squared) than SPH and PCA (for example, in 59-channel eyes-closed data at the number of modes K = 4, LB achieves an R-squared of about 0.56 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.59], compared with SPH about 0.44 [0.42, 0.46] and PCA about 0.08 [0.07, 0.09]) and reaches 70% and 90% variance with fewer modes (LB K70 about 8.6 versus SPH 12.3, PCA 19.3, ICA 22.8; LB K90 about 22.6 versus SPH 25.3, PCA 23.2, ICA 30.2). Mode-wise coefficient reliability is comparable between LB and SPH. By combining cortical eigenmodes with a forward head model, this approach provides a geometry-aligned, interpretable representation of sensor-space EEG that offers superior fidelity-complexity trade-offs at small K and a principled scaffold for low-dimensional EEG sensor-space analysis.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

While the middle temporal (MT) cortex is central to motion processing, the role of V1 in motion transparency remains controversial. It is still unclear at what spatial scale segmentation for motion transparency occurs. To address these questions, we conducted human psychophysics experiments using locally paired-dot stimuli moving in two directions separated by 90{degrees}. Subjects performed a 3AFC task to report whether the visual stimulus had no motion, a single direction, or two distinct directions. We systematically manipulated the path length of the dots, and therefore, the spatial separation between the paired dots, and the retinal eccentricity of the visual stimulus. We found that as the spatial separation between the paired dots increased, subjects perception shifted from a single direction to two distinct directions. Critically, we found that the spatial separation required for this perceptual transition increased with the eccentricity and closely matched the known receptive field sizes of V1 neurons at those eccentricities. Direction segmentation occurred only when the spatial separation between motion components exceeded the V1 receptive field size. Conversely, direction integration occurred when the spatial separation was smaller than the V1 receptive field size. Our results demonstrate that the receptive field size of V1 neurons sets the critical spatial scale for direction segmentation and suggest that V1 plays a key role in motion transparency and, more generally, in motion segmentation.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

However, evidence for its performance remains limited to a few model proteins. Here, we evaluated CusF as a solubility tag for two heterologous proteins: a putative poly(A)-polymerase from Enterococcus faecalis (Efa PAP) and the red fluorescent protein mCherry. The proteins were fused to CusF, expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and Rosetta 2 (DE3) strains, and assessed for solubility and IMAC binding. Native Efa PAP was completely insoluble under all tested conditions, and fusion to CusF did not improve its solubility. Similarly, CusF-mCherry accumulated predominantly in the insoluble fraction, with only traces detectable in soluble lysates. Soluble CusF-mCherry did not bind Cu2+-charged IMAC resin, while moderate binding to Ni2+-charged resin was attributable to the vector-encoded His-tag rather than CusF. These results indicate that CusF does not universally enhance protein solubility and may not always bind Cu-based IMAC resin.

Substantial studies demonstrated that genome phylogeny can be inferred based upon the generalized gene content approach. Two simple types were widely-used: the first-order gene content (J=1) for the presence or absence of a gene family, and the second-order gene content (J=2) for the extended gene content (absence, single-copy, or duplicates). Moreover, a specific form of birth-death-input process was invoked to model the evolutionary process of a gene family, taking gene duplication, gene loss and new gene origin or horizontal gene transfer into account. Gu X. Genome distance and phylogenetic inference accommodating gene duplication, loss and new gene input, Mol Phylogenet Evol 2023]. Though genome distance methods have been successful for genome phylogeny inference, the maximum likelihood (ML) approach is subject to a huge computation burden. In this article, I formulate a finite-state ML approximation to solve this problem. For a given J-order gene contents, the evolution of a gene family along a phylogeny is modeled by a stochastic process with a finite (J+1) number of states. Consequently, the computational cost of a finite-state likelihood for a given phylogeny is comparable to a typical sequence-based likelihood function. Two analyses were carried out as a proof of concept, including a simulation study to examine the performance of phylogenetic inference, and a case study to evaluate to what extent the Fixed-State ML can be used to determine the root of the genome phylogeny. Overall, the Fixed-State ML may shed lights on the feasibility of phylogenetic likelihood analysis on the pattern of genome evolution.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Conservation of mahseers, a group of charismatic freshwater fishes native to the South, East and South-East Asia, situated at the intersection of complex social, ecological and economic landscapes, necessitates the integration of the knowledge, mental models, and expectation of different stakeholders. Using a Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping approach, this study generated collective mental models of mahseer conservation in two Indian states distinct in their geography, ecology and socio-cultural aspects - Assam and Uttarakhand. Although many core system components were similar in the cognitive map generated for the focal states, notable divergences emerged in the drivers, perceived relationships among the components, etc. indicating regional specificity in socio-cultural governance structures and stakeholder priorities. In both states stakeholder communication emerged as the most central, and the component with highest outdegree, underscoring its shaping effect on system-wide variable interactions. The other influential components were community fishing (destructive and traditional) and human-human conflict (in Assam), and illegal destructive fishing and community involvement in decision-making (in Uttarakhand). The what-if scenario analyses simulating potential interventions, demonstrated that enhancing communication, awareness and education, promoting local identity and cultural significance of community fishing, providing subsistence fishing opportunities for the locals, and community involvement in decision-making could help in reducing human-human conflicts, illegal fishing, and strengthen stakeholder collaboration for mahseer conservation in both states. Our results also indicate that these improvements alone are insufficient to result in measurable mahseer conservation outcomes until cultural revitalisation and governance reforms are integrated with habitat restoration, improved hatchery performance, evidence-based policies and strict law enforcement. We discuss various leverage points that emerged from the FCMs of both focal states and their implication for a broader mahseer conservation policy with a scope for integrating region-specific characteristics.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Among domesticated animals, equids are unique; they serve as both companion and production animals, with estimates showing around 112 million working equids supporting 600 million people worldwide. Furthermore, the horse sport industry is a global multi-billion-dollar sector. However, these roles inevitably expose horses to potential physical and psychological harm. Consequently, being able to monitor behaviour accurately is critical to meeting their welfare needs. Here, we describe the design and evaluation of machine learning models capable of recognizing equine gaits and (semi-)natural behaviours using the Edge AI platform, Edge Impulse. Accelerometer motion data were collected using the Nordic Thingy:53 prototyping platform located on the chest of the horse. Both gaits and behaviours were detected with high mean training and testing accuracies (>95.00%), including idle, walk, trot, canter, fly-twitch, eating hay, head down or up, grazing, and rolling. While transformation types (Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) vs. Wavelet transform) were compared, they were not found to have a drastic effect on model performance. Instead, model accuracy and sensitivity were most impacted by the volume of training data included. This suggests that while transformations may refine model selection, sufficient training data is the single most important factor in defining effective Edge AI models. This study extends the evidence detailing the utility of accelerometers for equine movement and demonstrates that the accessible Nordic Thingy:53 platform can be used to develop highly accurate models for behavioural analysis. This is an important first step towards building effective monitoring methods that can recognise subtle behavioural changes that indicate alterations to emotional or physical states in equines", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

We present the first systematic evaluation of AF3 on disordered systems, revealing a striking dichotomy. For monomers, AF3's pLDDT scores reliably predict disorder (MCC: 0.693), matching AlphaFold2 and rivaling dedicated predictors. This consistency across fundamentally different architectures confirms that disorder prediction emerges from training data, not model design. For multimers, the picture grows complex. Despite comparable aggregate performance (mean DockQ: 0.563 vs 0.571), AF3 and AF2 achieve these results through fundamentally different mechanisms. Conventional structural features explain 58% of AF2's variance but only 42% of AF3's. Users cannot predict when AF3 will succeed or fail from interface properties alone. On disorder-to-order transitions (MFIB benchmark), both models perform equally well, successfully predicting final folded states. Yet seed variance analysis reveals AF3's failures are deterministic: the model converges to identical structures across independent runs, whether correct or incorrect, indicating rigid structural priors override available information.

However, the specific immunological cues that drive the robust expansion and functional preservation of this self-renewing, multipotent subset remain unknown. Here, utilizing multi-omic systems immunology in a pediatric cohort immunized with live attenuated influenza vaccine, we identified the determinants governing the expansion of influenza virus-reactive TSCM cells. We show that a pre-existing state of innate antiviral readiness, defined by a plasmacytoid dendritic cell-associated type I interferon signature, is the requisite condition for a robust TSCM expansion. Mechanistically, this baseline innate state enhances antigen priming and enforces a qualitative divergence in T-cell fate, driving responders toward a functionally poised, Th1-dominant phenotype while non-responders default to a dysfunctional, hyper-proliferative state. To determine the clinical relevance of this cellular subset, we analyzed an independent controlled human influenza challenge study. This validation revealed a critical functional division of labor in host defense: whereas pre-existing antibodies primarily mitigated symptom severity, the baseline frequency of influenza virus-reactive TSCM cells was the strongest predictor of rapid viral load clearance. These findings establish that the expansion of durable cellular memory is not stochastic but is predetermined by the innate cytokine environment, providing a predictive biomarker for patient stratification and a validated target for adjuvants designed to expand the TSCM reservoir deliberately.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

{"title": "Population Genetics of Fluctuating Selection among Individuals (FSI): a New Paradigm of Molecular Evolution", "doi": "10.64898/2025.12.08.693052", "authors": "Gu, X.", "abstract": "The FSI (fluctuating selection among individuals) theory of population genetics postulates that the fitness effect of a mutation may fluctuate among individuals with the same genotype (heterozygote or homozygote), whereas the wildtype fitness remains a constant. We conducted a comprehensive population genetic analysis and demonstrated profound impacts on the current wisdom of population genetics and molecular evolution. First, genetic drift induced by FSI, FSI-genetic drift for short, may play an important role in molecular evolution when the N_e-genetic drift is weak, i.e., the effective population size is not very small. Second, FSI toppled the golden-standard of neutrality in molecular evolution: the substitution rate equals to the mutation rate if and only if the mutation is strictly neutral. Instead, the concept of selection-duality claims that, under FSI, slightly beneficial mutations may be subject to a negative selection, resulting in a substitution rate less than the mutations rate. Consequently, there are three types of neutrality under FSI: the fixation neutrality (substitution rate equals to mutation rate), the generic neutrality (the population mean of selection coefficient is zero), and the FSI-neutrality (the midpoint of fixation neutrality and generic neutrality). Intriguingly, our theoretical analysis shows that the null hypothesis (=0) of MacDonald-Kreitman (MK) test exactly corresponds to the FSI-neutrality. Rejection of the null that, say, favors the alternative >0, could lead to two interpretations: when the observed  is below a threshold, the selection-duality is favored; otherwise an adaptive evolution is favored. We calculated the threshold for several mammals (human, macaque, lemur and vole), and found that all those observed  values (from 3.5% to 29%) were below the threshold and so they be interpreted by the selection duality rather than adaptive evolution.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Background: There has been much debate about the benefits of supervised versus unsupervised learning on genomes. Answering the question of 'which is better?' requires the development of comprehensive benchmarks spanning representative functional and evolutionary tasks. Importantly, such benchmarks need large sample sizes to enable well-powered ranking of models under equivalent evaluation, such as L2-regularized probing (linear evaluation). Results: Having developed such an assessment (GUANinE v1.1), we can conclude that the answer is both: each paradigm outperforms on certain tasks and offers key advantages over the other. Supervised sequence-to-function models excel at annotating functional states characterized by chromatin accessibility, histone marks, or CTCF binding, while unsupervised language models outperform on evolutionary conservation and related tasks without being limited to data-rich organisms. Our hundreds of new evaluations since v1.0 provide evidence for a direct tradeoff between input context size and model parameter count when on a fixed compute budget, which we depict with novel metrics like parameters/base pair. We also describe two new large-scale variant interpretation tasks: cadd-snv measuring proxy deleteriousness, and clinvar-snv measuring clinical pathogenicity. We find that conservation scores, and by extension, language models, dominate deleteriousness prediction, but successfully translating deleteriousness to pathogenicity remains challenging. Conclusions: GUANinE v1.1 is a large-scale and thorough evaluation of pretrained genomic models. We identify uniquely performant models across tasks, and we conclude by suggesting hybrid-supervised language models may define the next era of genomic sequence modeling.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Despite this, limited genomic investigation at the One Health interface constrains current understanding of BA transmission and of the ecological and host factors shaping its diversity and population structure. This includes the possibility of host-specific BA lineages, given that anthrax outbreaks often disproportionally affect individual species. This study characterises the genomic diversity of BA in an endemic area, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), in northern Tanzania. We analysed 213 BA genomes from livestock, wildlife and humans from cultured isolates combined with a culture-free targeted capture (TC) approach. NCA sequences formed a distinct genetic cluster compared with those from surrounding areas, and we observed surprisingly high levels of strain diversity within apparent epidemiological clusters, as well as within single animals, though strain diversity was lowest at the within host scale. We found limited evidence for seasonal clustering of cases as well as for BA lineages clustering by host species. This indicates that disproportional impacts on certain species during outbreaks are more likely driven by host ecology factors or, hypothetically, by accessory parts of the bacterial genome not represented in our data. TC-derived data significantly expanded the range of host species and geographic locations for genomic analysis, demonstrating the value of this approach. Although TC data may contain artefactual variation, shared SNP profiles between isolate- and TC-derived genomes gave confidence in its use for genotyping. Our analysis demonstrates unexpectedly high BA strain diversity and limited population structure in this endemic area across a range of spatial scales, including within-host. It further highlights the need for high density sampling and adaptable sequencing strategies to generate adequate BA genomic datasets that can enable informative molecular epidemiological studies of anthrax at the One Health interface.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

The geometric framework for nutrition (GFN) provides a powerful means to visualize nutrient interactions, but when more than two nutrients are considered, most empirical studies employ right-angled mixture triangles (RMTs). While convenient, this coordinate system can introduce visual artifacts that can bias inference. Here, we reintroduce the equilateral mixture triangle (EMT) as a complementary and biologically meaningful framework that preserves proportional relationships among nutrients and connects directly with the design principles of mixture experiments in engineering disciplines, where it is more commonly known as a simplex. The simplex provides a consistent bridge between theory and experimentation, allowing the same geometric representation to be used for choice and no-choice assays. For choice experiments, we extend GFN theory to show that animal feeding trajectories are bounded by the convex hull of available foods, show how it can scale to higher-dimensional nutrient systems, and develop statistical tests to distinguish between random choice and the defense of an intake target. For no-choice experiments, we demonstrate how simplex mixture designs can be integrated with response surface methodologies to model multivariate performance landscapes, identify optimal nutrient ratios, and avoid biologically unrealistic regions of nutrient space. For both types of experiments, we provide simulated case studies on how to design studies around the simplex. Together, these developments refine both the theoretical and experimental foundations of nutritional ecology, providing clear guidance for designing, visualizing, and interpreting multidimensional studies of nutrient regulation with diverse applications across ecological and agricultural disciplines.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

More than 90% of PDAC tumors harbor KRAS mutations, and several KRAS inhibitors, such as off-state, on-state, mutation-specific, and pan-RAS inhibitors, are being tested in preclinical and clinical settings. However, the response to these inhibitors as single agents is less than optimal, indicating the need to identify novel combination therapies to improve treatment outcomes. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a ring-shaped clamp protein that regulates DNA replication, repair, and resolution of transcription-replication conflict, which are critical processes for pancreatic cancer survival. AOH1996 is a first-in-class, selective PCNA inhibitor in Phase I trials. Here, we found that AOH1996 treatment is efficacious in various PDAC models in vitro. PCNA and KRAS are predicted to be synthetic lethal partners, and RNA sequencing of AOH1996-treated PDAC cells reveals enrichment of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. Combination of AOH1996 with KRAS inhibitors demonstrates strong synergy across KRAS G12C and G12D mutant models. Treatment with a combination of AOH1996 and KRAS inhibitors induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PDAC cells. Robust antitumor activity of AOH1996 in combination with RMC-6236 was observed in PDAC tumoroids. In vivo, the combination of AOH1996 with sotorasib or MRTX1133 reduced tumor growth rates compared to single-agent therapy, with no impact on mouse body weight. Residual tumor analysis showed sustained pERK and Myc inhibition in the combination arm. In conclusion, combination of AOH1996 with KRAS inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-driven PDAC, warranting further clinical investigation.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Z.; Agudelo, L. Z.", "abstract": "Energy conservation is at the basis of evolutionary optimization in living systems. Yet, how cells maintain function during metabolic stress while preserving adaptive capacity remains unclear. Here, we use a functional genomics approach to identify metabolic human accelerated regions (mHARs) genomic hubs (evolutionarily tuned regions) in adipose tissue that coordinate adaptive responses to nutrient deficit. During fasting, cooperative regulators PGC1A, YY1, and CTCF activate these hubs, promoting chromatin contacts that regulate lipid cycling genes such as Dgat1 and Atg4c. This activation maintains lipid and pH homeostasis while limiting oxidative stress, thereby preserving cellular plasticity. When disrupted, nutrient-stress adaptations are impaired leading to metabolic dysfunction and glucose intolerance. This is driven by NCOA7, an oxidative stress mediator that impairs lysosome function and transcriptional plasticity, triggering an inflammatory response. In cellular models, this mechanism blocks pH-mediated PGC1A droplet plasticity, further inhibiting mHAR-genomic hub activity and metabolic homeostasis. Human adipocytes show enhanced transcriptional activity of these genomic hubs compared to murine cells, with multi-enhancer mHAR regulation suppressing disease-associated variants linked to ANGPTL3 and PCSK9. Loss of this cooperative plasticity shifts cells to maladaptive responses, activating STAT1-driven disease gene expression. Our findings reveal that investigating the contextual activity of evolutionary adaptations can uncover functional hubs critical for stress resilience. This also shows that cells exploit nutrient fluctuations to drive tunable transcriptional organizations that lead to durable adaptations, identifying actionable targets for metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

While acute treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been shown to suppress food intake and reward-seeking behaviors in rodent models, the impact of prolonged exposure on preclinical measures of motivated behavior remains insufficiently characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of chronic administration of semaglutide on both the acquisition and expression phases of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA), a behavioral paradigm used to assess the attribution of incentive salience to a food-paired cue. The influence of chronic semaglutide on the conditioned reinforcing properties of the food-associated cue, performance on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for food reward, and ad libitum consumption of the food reward were also assessed. Results: Chronic semaglutide administration did not significantly alter either the acquisition or the expression of PavCA behavior. However, relative to vehicle-treated controls, semaglutide markedly enhanced responding for the food-associated cue during a conditioned reinforcement test and increased PR responding for the food reward. In contrast, semaglutide reduced both free consumption of the food reward and homecage chow intake. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that chronic semaglutide administration potentiates the incentive value of food-paired cues and increases motivation for food reward under restricted access conditions, yet attenuates overall food consumption when food is freely available. This dissociation highlights the nuanced effects of semaglutide on motivated behavior and suggests an amplification of the reinforcing properties of discrete, limited food rewards and associated cues.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

We created a biofeedback paradigm to distinguish the effects of reduced muscle-force capacity from compensatory increases in neuromuscular activity on effort-based decision-making. Human participants made risky choices about prospective physical effort before and after repeated fatiguing exertions under two biofeedback conditions: force biofeedback, which required increased neuromuscular drive, and EMG biofeedback, which constrained the increase in neuromuscular drive. Both biofeedback conditions led to similar reductions in muscle strength and feelings of fatigue. Using computational modeling of choice behavior, however, we found that the Force biofeedback condition, which required compensatory neuromuscular activation, caused a significantly greater increase in the subjective cost of effort than EMG biofeedback. By combining neuromuscular manipulation with computational modeling, our study demonstrates how various physiological processes affect feelings of fatigue and decisions to exert effort in response to fatiguing exertions. These results suggest that fatigue may consist of separate components that collectively serve to motivate behavior while simultaneously protecting and restoring bodily homeostasis amid physical challenge.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated associations between microstructural metrics derived from the Standard Model (SMI) in white matter (WM) and the Standard Model with EXchange (SMEX/NEXI) in gray matter (GM) with two MT measures differing in specificity and sensitivity to myelination: the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) and the inhomogeneous magnetization transfer ratio (ihMTR). Measurements were performed in WM and GM in ten healthy subjects scanned at 3T. In WM, the strongest significant association was observed between ihMTR and the axonal water fraction, consistent with higher myelination in regions of elevated axonal density and limited extra-axonal space. This correlation exceeded that of MPF, supporting the greater specificity of ihMTR to myelin. Interestingly, ihMTR displayed a gradient along the longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum, in agreement with previous histology measurements. Correlation between ihMTR and the extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity (De{perp}), a putative myelination biomarker, was not significant, whereas MPF and De{perp} exhibited a moderate significant positive correlation. Since a negative correlation is expected if reflecting myelination, these results suggest that in healthy tissue De{perp} is mainly influenced by microstructural factors like fiber coherence and packing, the latter most likely affecting MPF but not ihMTR. In GM, ihMTR correlated significantly only with the exchange time (t), confirming tex as a proxy for cell membrane permeability modulated by myelin. MPF correlated exclusively with the cell-process fraction (f), suggesting the latter is modulated by total (neuronal and glial) cell membrane density. Overall, findings underscore the complementary and concurring microstructural information captured by these metrics, highlighting their potential to disentangle distinct tissue mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions.

Moreover, methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant whose use is linked to high HIV prevalence, significantly worsening clinical outcomes for people living with HIV and hastening onset of systemic illness. Overall, pathologies associated with HIV infection/METH use comorbidity include neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, synaptodendritic damage, and resulting cognitive dysfunction. However, mechanisms underlying this neuropathogenesis remain elusive due to the scarcity of human brain-specific experimental model systems. Therefore, we created a next-generation three-dimensional (3D) human brain model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Specifically, this 3D in vitro cerebral assembloid model integrates functional microglia derived from hiPSCs with cerebral organoids. Microglia are key contributors to HAND symptoms associated with HIV/METH comorbidity. We show that the presence of microglia in this assembloid model allows productive infection with HIV, which is enhanced by METH exposure, resulting in increased glial activation, inflammatory responses (namely IL-1{beta} and IL-6 release), and neurotoxicity marked by neuronal cell death and synaptic protein loss. Importantly, in this model, we observed markedly decreased levels of the microglial receptor TREM2, which is implicated in microglial functions including phagocytosis, apoptosis and inflammatory responses following HIV infection and METH treatment. Analysis of our model showed that decreased TREM2 function may lead to HIV- and METH-associated pathological changes. Overall, our assembloid model could be a valuable tool for future analyses of HIV/METH/CNS interactions and mechanisms underlying HAND, which could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to decreasing the CNS viral reservoir.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Because corollary discharges are necessary for the computation of internal models, we tested the hypothesis that IO-related corollary discharge is necessary for the emergence of a functioning cerebellar internal model during development. First, by conducting extracellular recordings in the IO at P12 and P20, we confirmed the presence of twitch-related corollary discharge at both ages; however, whereas the IO at P20 responded to limb stimulation, the IO at P12 did not. Next, using a protocol for selectively lesioning the climbing fibers that connect the IO to the cerebellum, including the interpositus nucleus (IP), we confirmed that lesioning at P12 prevents the IP's expression of corollary discharge at P13. Finally, we assessed the necessity of IO input to the cerebellum for the emergence of an internal model by lesioning climbing fibers at P12 or P19 and testing for the expression of a cerebellar internal model in the thalamus at P20. Only when the lesions occurred at P12 was the expression of the internal model severely disrupted.

Public beliefs and experiences with local wildlife are central to the success of place-based conservation initiatives, such as urban rewilding, because they impact public attitudes and tolerance of those species within neighbourhoods. Few studies, however, have examined whether people's beliefs align with their real-life observations of wildlife within their local area and, more importantly, whether (or how) their beliefs might impact public attitudes independently of local experiences with those animals. The current study addressed this gap by assessing whether public beliefs about a conspicuous human-wildlife conflict - bin-raiding behaviour - aligned with residents' own local experiences with a familiar and widespread urban carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). The study also examined whether beliefs about bin-raiding predicted attitudes towards foxes even when people lacked firsthand observations of such behaviour within their area. Beliefs and attitudes towards foxes were evaluated using a nationwide questionnaire administered to 1,275 participants in the United Kingdom. Ecological surveys were also conducted in the city of Hull, UK, to compare public attitudes and beliefs (N= 248 households) with objective data on outdoor bin disturbances (N=4,239 bins) from the same area. Nationally, most respondents (59.3%) believed that foxes raid bins despite significantly fewer of these people (21.7%) having witnessed it firsthand within their neighbourhood. In Hull, <1% of bins showed evidence of disturbance even though significantly more residents (16.9%) believed foxes raided bins than the number of residents who had actually seen it happen. Among national and local Hull residents with no local experience observing bin-raiding foxes, these beliefs were nevertheless associated with more negative attitudes towards them.

A key challenge when interpreting these models is that their parameters are not uniquely determined: many different parameter choices can encode the same sequence-function landscape. These ambiguities, known as \"gauge freedoms,\" must be resolved before parameter values can be meaningfully interpreted. Resolving gauge freedoms requires imposing mathematical constraints on parameters that remove these degrees of freedom, a procedure called \"fixing the gauge.\" We recently developed mathematical methods for fixing the gauge of a large class of commonly used models, but the direct computational implementation of these methods is often impractical due to the need for projection matrices whose memory requirements scale quadratically with the number of parameters. Here we introduce GaugeFixer, a Python package that exploits the specific mathematical structure of gauge-fixing projections to achieve linear scaling, thus enabling application to models with millions of parameters. As one application, we analyzed the local structure of peaks in an empirical fitness landscape for translation initiation. GaugeFixer reveals striking similarities, but also fine-scaled variation, in ribosome binding preferences at different positions relative to the start codon, thereby aiding the interpretation of an otherwise unwieldy fitness landscape.

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of 3D chromatin architecture across six brown algae species and one outgroup, spanning the phylogenetic breadth and biological complexity of this key photosynthetic lineage. We show that compact genomes lack chromatin domains whereas larger, transposable element rich genomes of morphologically complex taxa tend to exhibit structured organization including TAD-like domains. We investigate chromatin folding patterns and gene expression over evolutionary time and uncover 3D chromatin features associated with transitions in sexual systems. Moreover, we reconstruct the ancestral brown algal karyotype, revealing deeply conserved macrosynteny and providing a new framework for interpreting chromosome-scale genome dynamics.

Peaks are identified within resolution-dependent regions of interest using image-processing techniques, and an ambiguity score is introduced to quantify detection confidence. Benchmarking against widely used methods (apLCMS, centWave, and gridmass) shows that MRH consistently achieves higher F1 scores across concentrations, particularly excelling at low concentrations where competing tools fail. MRH also provides accurate localization of peaks and low ambiguity in detections, highlighting both robustness and precision.

Y.; Sun, T.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arises almost exclusively in chronic liver disease (CLD), yet the classical etiological drivers of injury insufficiently explain why only a subset of patients progress to cancer. Here, we identify disruption of liver metabolic zonation, specifically, aberrant expansion of {beta}-catenin activity from pericentral to periportal territories as a previously unrecognized tumorigenic risk state that emerges across etiologically diverse CLDs. Using spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry from murine liver disease followed by human sample validation, we demonstrate that MASLD/MASH, alcohol-associated hepatitis, viral hepatitis, and immune-mediated cholangiopathies share a striking periportal induction of pericentral {beta}-catenin target programs, indicating a conserved zonation disturbance independent of disease etiology. Since {beta}-catenin expansion occurs alongside inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction in human CLD, its direct oncogenic contribution remained unclear. To functionally isolate the tumorigenic consequence of zonation disruption itself from these confounding disease processes, we employed hepatocyte-specific deletion of ZNRF3 and RNF43-negative regulators that physiologically restrict {beta}-catenin to the pericentral zone. Lineage tracing demonstrates that ZNRF3/RNF43 deletion drives selective periportal hepatocyte proliferation, zonal reprogramming, and tumor initiation in a {beta}-catenin-dependent manner, establishing zonation disruption as a direct mechanistic driver of carcinogenesis. The resulting tumors exhibit a distinct metabolic and immunologic phenotype, including heightened mitochondrial respiration, preserved periportal identity, and T-cell competence, and correspond to a molecularly defined subset comprising 5-10% of human HCCs. Together, these findings reveal {beta}-catenin zonation expansion as a conserved and previously unrecognized HCC risk factor that mechanistically links chronic liver injury to malignant transformation. They further establish ZNRF3/RNF43 deletion as a tractable model of zonation-driven hepatocarcinogenesis and identify a distinct human HCC subtype with unique therapeutic vulnerabilities, opening new avenues for mechanism-based risk stratification, early detection and preventive therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic liver disease.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here we test how NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contributes to adaptive decision-making by combining targeted genetic ablation in mice and systemic pharmacology. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to eliminate the obligate GluN1 subunit, we induced spatially confined NMDAR hypofunction in mPFC and compared its effects to systemic pharmacological blockade with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 during performance of a touchscreen-based restless bandit task. Prefrontal NMDAR ablation impaired value discrimination, weakened the use of negative feedback, and reduced mutual information between recent outcomes and current choices, indicating disrupted reward-history integration. Reinforcement-learning models incorporating a choice-kernel term best captured behavior and revealed that NMDAR ablation selectively dampened learning and choice-history parameters governing flexible updating. Systemic MK-801 produced broad impairments in control animals, reducing accuracy, mutual information, and outcome sensitivity, yet exerted only modest additional effects after NMDAR ablation, suggesting that prefrontal NMDAR loss occluded much of the pharmacological disruption. Simulations using fitted RLCK parameters reproduced these patterns, showing convergent flattening of choice dynamics under MK-801 and persistent deficits in GluN1 ablated animals. Together, these findings demonstrate that prefrontal NMDAR signaling is necessary for effective value updating and feedback-driven learning, and that its loss recapitulates core features of systemic NMDAR hypofunction. This work establishes a mechanistic bridge between localized cortical glutamatergic dysfunction and the reinforcement-learning disturbances characteristic of schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

For example, [Ca2+]e; decreases during intense neuronal activity and epilepsy, whereas it rises during sleep. Similarly, [Mg2+]e; varies with the sleep/wake cycle and is reduced in epilepsy. Lowering either [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e increases intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the action potential (AP) threshold, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we confirm that reducing [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e enhances intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the AP threshold of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Physiological reductions in [Mg2+]e (0.8 to 0.4 mM) have minimal effect, whereas decreases from supraphysiological levels (2.0 to 0.4 mM) robustly increase excitability. Using pharmacology and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identify the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) as a key mediator of these effects. The calcilytic NPS-2143 mimics and largely occludes both the intrinsic excitability increase and the AP-threshold hyperpolarization, while genetic reduction of CaSR produces similar outcomes. We further show that AP-threshold hyperpolarization induced by low divalent cations involves both Kv1 and Nav1.2 channels. Together, these findings reveal CaSR as a critical link between external divalent cation levels and intrinsic neuronal excitability through the modulation of Kv1 and Nav channels.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Herein, we report the identification of Z17 as a novel and selective CHI3L1 inhibitor which directly bind to CHI3L1 an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 6.0 M. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, Z17 acted as a dual-action regulator by reinstating astrocytic function and suppressing inflammation. Additionally, Z17 rescued CHI3L1-induced impairment by dose-dependently restoring A{beta} uptake and normalizing lysosomal proteolytic activity and pH. Furthermore, Z17 effectively blocked CHI3L1-driven activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in human astrocytes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the functional rescue. The in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of Z17 demonstrated favorable drug-like properties for CNS development.

We investigated the relationship between Ab burden, tau pathology, presynaptic density, and spatial learning and memory in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic (TG) mouse model of amyloidosis. Methods: Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Barnes maze test in male TG and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, aged 6, 12, and 18 months. Gross visual function was assessed indirectly in 18-month-old animals using the light/dark exploration test. Brains were collected for autoradiography of tau pathology and presynaptic density with [18F]Flortaucipir and [3H]UCB-J, respectively, while Ab plaque load was measured by immunohistochemistry. Correlation and linear mixed-effects regression analyses were used to assess relationships between behavioral and pathological measures. Results: APP/PS1 mice showed normal cognitive performance at 6 months, a selective long-term memory deficit at 12 months, and severe impairments in learning and retention at 18 months, independent of visual confounds. Age-dependent increases in [18F]Flortaucipir binding and Ab plaque load were observed in all brain regions of TG compared to WT mice, whereas [3H]UCB-J binding was increased in a region-dependent manner in 18-month-old TG vs. WT animals. Barnes maze performance during the final day of testing correlated negatively with both Ab and tau pathology across all areas examined. Linear regression revealed a significant association between tau and age and between tau and Ab in the cortex, indicating that memory decline in ageing TG mice was driven by the combined effects of these pathologies. Conclusions: Deficits in memory retention precede impairments in task learning performance in APP/PS1 mice. Spontaneous tau accumulation contributes to the progressive cognitive decline, capturing key aspects of the Ab-tau interaction observed in human AD.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

The RSV G glycoprotein's central conserved cysteine-rich domain (CCD) contains a CX3C motif implicated in immune modulation, but the relationship between CCD redox state, structure and function is unresolved. We recombinantly expressed a CCD peptide (Gpep, residues 149-196) and combined structural and biophysical characterizations with cellular immunology and human serology to define how redox-dependent conformations govern immunogenicity and immunomodulation. Reduced Gpep is compact and rapidly folds via a dominant intermediate into an oxidized, extended monomer; at higher concentrations intermolecular disulfide isomerization produces covalent oligomers. Functionally, monomeric Gpep potently suppresses innate and adaptive activation inhibiting LPS- or UV-inactivated RSV-induced maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, reducing antigen-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation and IFN-{gamma} production, and attenuating multiple human neutrophil responses (chemotaxis, CD11b upregulation, ROS, MPO release and NET formation), without cytotoxicity. Oligomerized Gpep lacks these suppressive activities. To link molecular mechanism and human exposure, analysis of sera from an ambulatory pediatric cohort (0-72 months) showed a progressive transient increase in the anti-F/anti-G IgG ratio with repeated early RSV exposures, maturating into a functional 2 to 3 ratio. This serologic shift is consistent with previously reported enrichment of F-directed neutralizing immunity.

Given the central role of platelets in atherothrombotic disease, understanding how circulating NPs exposure influences platelet function is critical for cardiovascular health. Methods: Washed platelets and citrated whole blood from healthy volunteers were exposed to fluorescent carboxylated polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs; 100 nm). PS-NPs association, internalization, and activation were quantified by flow cytometry (side scatter, forward scatter, PS-NPs fluorescence, and CD63). Fluorescence microscopy visualized the PS-NPs uptake kinetics. A whole-blood coagulation assay assessed PS-NPs-induced clot formation under varying Ca2+ concentrations. Results: PS-NPs rapidly associated with human platelets in a concentration and time-dependent manner, with near-maximal internalization achieved within 10 minutes. PS-NPs uptake induced marked structural remodeling (increased FSC/SSC), pseudopod formation, and concentration-dependent CD63 externalization, indicative of robust platelet activation comparable to that induced by thrombin stimulation. PS-NPs association remained non-saturable across tested doses (0.3-20 ug), suggesting high-capacity, non-specific uptake mechanisms. In whole blood, PS-NPs induced dense fibrin clot formation exclusively under Ca2-permissive conditions, and PS-NPs were incorporated into fibrin networks, consistent with their role as catalytic pro-coagulant surfaces. Supernatant fluorescence confirmed PS-NPs sequestration into clots. Conclusions: PS-NPs rapidly bind and activate human platelets, promote pro-coagulant platelet phenotypes, and integrate into fibrin-rich thrombi.

Crop rotation (CR) was incorporated into a modeling exercise using remote sensing data, fieldwork, and farmer surveys. A multi-year classification model with seven cropland classes was developed using data collected from 534 fields across 2022-2024, including 189 soil samples. Each cropland field was represented as a polygon delineating its boundaries and indicating its dominant crop cover.

A Random Forest classifier was used as the baseline model. The cropland classification model demonstrated strong overall performance, with F1 scores ranging from 0.81 to 0.98 across the different classes.

We profiled 75 primary low-grade pNETs by whole-exome and RNA sequencing, including 25 percent with lymph node and/or liver metastasis, and integrated genomic and transcriptomic data to connect pathway lesions with expression state. Metastatic tumors showed a slight increase in mutation frequency but conserved base-substitution spectra relative to non-metastatic cases, and adverse clinicopathologic features were enriched in Grade 2 disease. Aggregating alterations to pathways revealed broad convergence on canonical networks, with transcriptomic analyses demonstrating cohort-wide enrichment of Calcium, WNT, and KRAS/PI3K-AKT programs in metastasis. Intersection of significantly mutated genes with differentially expressed genes identified a focused 29-gene overlap, including RYR1 and ZNF273, that marks these convergent axes and distinguishes metastatic from non-metastatic tumors. Gene set enrichment confirmed preferential activation of Calcium, WNT, and PI3K-AKT signaling in metastatic tumors, consistent with a network-intensity model of progression. Finally, upstream-regulator analysis (iPathwayGuide) and gene-centric perturbation mapping (Gene2Drug) nominated candidate targeted and repurposable agents predicted to reverse the metastatic expression phenotype and flagged drugs unlikely to provide benefit, yielding a prioritized, testable therapeutic shortlist which includes fasudil and spaglumic acid. Convergent, domain-specific mutational patterns in highly mutated genes such as ZNF273 and CLCA1 define a molecular signature that could stratify metastatic risk in low-grade pNETs.

Although model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster provide well-established systems for studying oviposition, disentangling foraging from egg-laying decisions remains challenging because females use the same substrates for feeding and reproduction. Here, we identify a pair of sister mosquito species that exhibit contrasting oviposition strategies and provide a promising system for investigating how divergence in sensory information processing shapes behavioral shifts between generalist and specialist taxa. Using binary-choice assays, we tested oviposition preferences in 1,046 gravid females from both field and laboratory populations. Anopheles gambiae females were highly selective and deposited nearly all eggs in a single water source, consistent with specialist behavior. In contrast, females of its sibling species, An. coluzzii, adopted a generalist strategy marked by a more even distribution of eggs across available substrates. To identify chemosensory receptor genes that diverge between the cryptic species and may underlie these behavioral differences, we analyzed amino acid substitutions across odorant, ionotropic, and gustatory receptor families using whole-genome sequencing data. Although differentiation was limited at the gene-family level, several individual divergent loci associated with carboxylic acid, amine, and other volatile detection pathways emerged as candidate drivers of species-specific oviposition behavior. These findings suggest that shifts in sensory perception during egg laying may facilitate behavioral and ecological specialization, and that phenotypic divergence in environmental sensing can arise before substantial genome-wide differentiation.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

We then embedded the model into a closed-loop virtual reality system, allowing a real fish to interact in real time with a virtual conspecific whose movements were governed by the same interaction rules. This biohybrid setup revealed that the model captures key social interactions underlying coordinated swimming. Our results establish a robust validation framework linking data, models, and behavior, paving the way for hybrid biological-digital collectives.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

G.; Draye, X.; De Vleeschouwer, C.; Chevalier, C.; Lobet, G.", "abstract": "This study investigates the challenge of creating datasets for training multiclass deep-learning segmentation models, specifically for segmenting multi-species canopy images. Creating training sets for deep-learning based segmentation of multispecies canopies is currently too labor-intensive and time-consuming to be viable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline that uses fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) to transition from single-species images to segmented multi-species images. This paper demonstrates that FCNNs can effectively generalize learning from single-species canopy images to multispecies canopy images, achieving accurate pixel classification in mixed species canopies even when the network was trained only on images of single-species canopies. Additionally, we introduce Interactive Machine Learning and pseudo labeling as a method for generating a single-species canopy training set in a matter of minutes. We also present two software packages to implement our approach and extensively evaluate them against several baselines. Our findings demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce the human time load required for semantic segmentation of multispecies canopy images, achieving over 90% accuracy in less than 10 minutes. This new method has the potential to greatly facilitate the study of multispecies canopies.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

To colonize distant organs, cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to adapt to diverse environmental challenges. Therefore, elucidating the metabolic pathways that drive cancer metastasis will uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we integrated published datasets and systematically analyzed metabolites across multiple cancer cell lines. This large-scale bioinformatic analysis revealed distinct metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with organ-specific metastasis, and underscored the crucial role of tissue of origin in shaping the metabolic landscape of metastatic tumors. Notably, the transsulfuration pathway (also known as the cysteine and methionine metabolism) was strongly enriched in cancer cells with high metastatic potential. We validated this finding in pancreatic cancer, where the pathway enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and its metabolic products were highly expressed in metastatic cancer cells. Targeting the transsulfuration pathway either by methionine deprivation or pharmacological inhibition of CBS significantly impaired the migration and invasion of metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, our study not only provides a global view of the altered metabolic landscape in metastasis, but also identifies the transsulfuration pathway as an oncogenic driver and a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer metastasis.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Preclinical studies suggest that masitinib can modulate mast cell activity and neuroinflammation, making it a potential therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases. However, clinical outcomes remain inconclusive, which may be linked to a lack of understanding of its molecular mechanism of action and potential off-target effects. Using a panel of cancer cell lines, we found that masitinib suppresses mTORC1 activity while simultaneously inducing AKT phosphorylation. Interestingly, thermal proteome profiling analysis revealed that lysosomal proteins were the most thermally affected by masitinib. Using large unilamellar vesicle systems that mimic the lipid composition and physicochemical environment of lysosomal membranes, we observed that masitinib preferentially accumulates in acidic vesicle membranes, consistent with a pH-dependent trapping mechanism. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that masitinib disrupts autophagy by impairing lysosomal acidification. Together, these findings elucidate the lysosomal accumulation of masitinib, providing a molecular basis for its mechanism of action.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed proximity-labeling proteomics to map the interactomes of each NSG protein. Unlabeled mass spectrometry identified over 1,000 significantly enriched interactors compared with a cytoplasmic control, revealing substantial overlap between NSG1 and NSG2, and a more divergent profile for NSG3. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis confirmed established associations with glutamatergic synapses and endosomal trafficking, while also uncovering unexpected links to presynaptic machinery, inhibitory synapses, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein translation, particularly for NSG3. Reciprocal biotinylation patterns and co-immunoprecipitation revealed novel heteromeric complex formation between NSG1 and NSG2, with limited interactions involving NSG3. All three NSGs biotinylated core AMPA receptor subunits and auxiliary proteins, while NSG1 and NSG2 also associated with NMDA receptors, GABA receptor subunits, as well as multiple presynaptic proteins. Moreover, NSG1 and NSG2 specifically biotinylated components of multiunit tethering complexes including neuron-specific retromer, and biotinylated a preponderance of ADAM10 substrates, reinforcing their role in proteolytic processing. Finally, despite the relatively divergent interactomes of NSG1 and NSG2 compared to NSG3, all family members robustly biotinylated amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting possible synergistic or competitive interactions that could shape APP proteolytic processing and/or trafficking. Together, these data provide a comprehensive systems-level view of NSG protein interactions, establishing a molecular framework for future investigations into NSG-mediated neural plasticity and disease mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

To test this hypothesis, we propose a hierarchical and mechanistic model that explains how equiluminant border ownership signals can be achieved in the ventral stream. Our simulation results suggest that model equiluminant neurons are highly color-selective while exhibiting similar orientation and border ownership selectivity as their luminance counterparts. Additionally, our model equiluminant cells indeed exhibited the above postulated pattern of responses. We suggest that these neurons are the missing links in the equiluminance channels in the ventral stream that transform equiluminant oriented edge signals in V1 to equiluminant object-centered shape representations in V4. Our findings point to the importance of re-examining the border ownership neuron population to further detail their role in equiluminant channels in the ventral stream.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

M.; Kurze, C.", "abstract": "Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, pose a concerning threat to global biodiversity, particularly to terrestrial ectotherms like insects. While lethal effects of thermal stress are widely studied, very little is known about sublethal carry-over effects of heatwaves experienced during development on adult fitness. Addressing this fundamental knowledge gap is crucial for key pollinators such as bumblebees, which face alarming population declines. Therefore, we used a highly controlled in vitro approach to expose Bombus terrestris pupae to ecologically relevant cyclic thermal stress, and studied their emergence success, subsequent adult longevity, and morphological traits. We found that cyclic thermal stress caused significant acute pupal mortality (up to 30% reduction in emergence). Most notably, this developmental stress resulted in deferred mortality, significantly reducing adult longevity (HR = 1.81) in both workers and males. Furthermore, we identified antennae and wing deformations as a powerful hazard indicator (HR = 2.50) that strongly predicts premature adult mortality. Our findings reveal that cyclic thermal stress during pupation imposes irreversible developmental damage that undermines adult physiological resilience. We argue that life-stage specific carry-over effects should be considered more in the future to avoid underestimating the long-term impact of climate change on crucial insect pollinator populations.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Although existing probabilistic models provide frameworks for composition estimation, they are often based on the assumption that log-ratio-transformed compositions are normally distributed. This assumption is problematic, as it often fails to capture the significant skewness inherent in these transformed compositions.

ZIFA-LSNM integrates a zero-inflation component to handle excess zeros, employs factor analysis for dimensionality reduction, and, critically, utilizes skew-normal priors on the latent factors to explicitly model data asymmetry.

How such asymmetries influence long-term proteostasis stability has not been quantitatively evaluated. Here, we develop a stochastic generational model linking replication-derived mutation asymmetry to proteotoxic load dynamics under age-dependent declines in clearance. Mutations are drawn from symmetric (H0) or strand- and timing-asymmetric (H1) Poisson processes, converted into proteotoxic load through a binomial misfolding mechanism, and cleared with linearly declining proteostasis efficiency. Proteostasis collapse is defined as a first-passage event when total load exceeds a capacity threshold. Across homeostatic and near-failure regimes, replication asymmetry modestly increases steady-state proteotoxic load (approximately 1-3%) and leads to modestly earlier collapse. Under clearance-compromised or stress-test conditions, asymmetry substantially amplifies collapse probability and accelerates failure. These results demonstrate that replication-associated asymmetry acts as a weak perturbation when basal load dominates but becomes a significant modifier of collapse risk when proteostasis capacity is reduced. The framework provides a quantitative basis for evaluating how replication dynamics shape long-term proteostasis stability in proliferative tissues.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

B.; Iraji, A.; Calhoun, V. D.", "abstract": "Resting-state fMRI studies increasingly emphasize the dynamic nature of brain networks. While most approaches examine temporal fluctuations in connectivity, we focus on the spatial dynamics and complexity at voxel level - how networks expand and contract, and change their structural complexity over time. Using dynamic independent component analysis (ICA), we investigate the hierarchical structure of the resulting time-varying spatial networks, from their broad periphery to their most active core. We combine this with fractal dimension (FrD) as a measure of a network's spatial complexity and analyze temporal changes (dynamic flexibility) in a network and synchronized fluctuations between network pairs (fractal dimension coupling, FrDC). We refer to this approach as 'dynamic spatial network complexity and connectivity (dSNCC)'. Using a combined cohort of 508 subjects (315 healthy controls, 193 schizophrenia patients), we found that schizophrenia is associated with higher mean FrD in several networks, suggesting more irregular patterns/boundaries and a disorganized network structure. Critically, patients showed significantly reduced dynamic flexibility, indicating their networks are 'stuck' in a less adaptable state. This robust finding is evidenced by a synergistic loss of temporal standard deviations in both network volume and FrD across multiple networks and activity thresholds. This maladaptive complexity was associated with cognitive impairment, with several dSNCC measures showing significant associations with subject scores for processing speed, visual learning, and verbal learning. Higher complexity in these networks and more significantly, their reduced dynamic flexibility as seen in patients, were particularly associated with impaired performance. Furthermore, we found aberrant connectivity (FrDC) in schizophrenia, with certain network pairs exhibiting overly synchronized complexity changes. Our results demonstrate that dSNCC is a powerful tool for characterizing network dynamics and may potentially provide a measurable mechanism for maladaptation in schizophrenia, where the brain's inability to fluidly change its complexity may contribute to cognitive deficits and symptoms like disorganized thought. These findings highlight the importance of studying the intrinsic spatial dynamic properties to reveal the fundamental principles of brain network organization in health and disease.

Here, we show that extracellular dietary lipids like oleic acid and cholesterol shift caveolae at the plasma membrane to highly spherical invaginations. Within 3 hours of lipid treatment caveolin1 accumulates specifically to lipid droplets. Correlative fluorescence FIB-SEM and split-APEX proteomics revealed no caveolar vesicles at the lipid droplet but caveolin1 alone. Mechanistically, caveolin1-lipid droplet trafficking is regulated by EHD2 at the plasma membrane level, followed by caveolin1 localization to EEA1- and Rab5-positive endosomes within 1 hour of oleic acid treatment, and subsequently lipid droplet accumulation. Caveolin1-lipid droplet trafficking does not depend on lysosomal activity. Surprisingly, the deletion of the central caveolin1 {beta}-barrel (Cav1-F160X), a mutation found in lipodystrophy patients, abolished caveolin1-lipid droplet trafficking and lipid droplet growth.

Through quantitative modeling, we identify contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL)-where cells actively retract and move away upon contact-as a key mechanism that enables sparse mesenchymal networks to sustain macroscopic tension while flowing like a fluid. Simple continuum equations relate observable cell-scale parameters to the emergent remodeling dynamics observed in both experiments and simulations.

Single cell genomic technologies enabled the profiling of thousands of individual cells from tumors to understand their role in cancer progression. In this study, we are characterizing pericytes from tumor microenvironment single cell data of human cancers to assess associations with patient prognosis and achieve mechanistic insights. Design: we have characterized pericytes from tumor microenvironment (TME) single cell datasets of different cancers to assess associations with patient prognosis and achieve mechanistic insights. Methods: For comprehensive pericyte characterization, 23 publicly available single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets corresponding to 15 cancers and 1 benign tumor were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and Tisch repositories. The datasets were processed using a uniform workflow, including quality control, normalization, variable gene selection, clustering, and cellular annotation (based on automated and manual markers). The annotation of the pericytes was performed based on the score calculated using our previously validated pericyte gene signature. The differential gene expression analysis between pericytes and fibroblasts in each dataset was performed to identify pericyte signature. Comparative analysis of the signatures was performed to identify a universal pericyte signature that was evaluated for pericyte specificity using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) data. The universal pericytes signature genes were evaluated for cancer outcome associations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets using the Survival Genie Platform. Furthermore, pathway and gene-network analyses were performed to understand the biological significance of the pan cancer universal pericyte signature. Results: We conducted an analysis of 23 single cell RNA-sequencing datasets from 14 cancers: breast, pancreatic, bladder, ovarian, non-small cell lung, cervical, prostate, basal cell, colon, head and neck, papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancers, as well as melanoma and lymphomas; and a benign tumor (neurofibroma). The pericytes gene set enabled the identification of a distinct pericyte cluster comprising more than 50 cells in the majority of datasets. Differential gene expression analysis between pericytes and fibroblasts identified heterogenous pericyte signatures for different cancers. Initial cell/cell communication analysis in anaplastic thyroid cancer indicated that pericytes are highly communicative cells, ranking among the top ligand-secreting populations, and actively engaging with anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and T cells. A comparative analysis of pericyte signatures generated from different cancers yielded a core signature of 100 genes that were consistently overexpressed in more than 60% of the cancer datasets. Notably, 78% of these genes were not expressed in PBMCs, supporting their pericyte specificity. Survival analysis using TCGA datasets identified a 19 genes pan-cancer pericyte signature associated with poor prognosis (HR>1 in at least 30% datasets). This pan-cancer pericyte signature included genes such as TPM2 and EHD2, whose overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival across multiple aggressive cancers, including bladder, head and neck, lung, pancreatic, skin, and thyroid cancers. Interestingly, many of these genes showed a strong positive correlation (e.g. PDGFRB) with T cell exhaustion-related genes in the TCGA pan-cancer cohort (n=10,293 samples), suggesting a potential mechanistic link between pericytes and T cell exhaustion. Importantly, we have also identified a unique tyrosine kinase (TK) receptors gene signature in pericytes compared to fibroblasts or other cell types by heatmap analysis across the different cancers. Conclusions: This large-scale scRNA-seq analysis of multiple datasets defines a pan-cancer pericyte signature and sheds light on pericyte activity, particularly their communication with T cells, suggesting a role in T cell exhaustion, a key factor in the failure of many cancer therapies. This study underscores the pivotal role of pericyte population enhancement as a critical regulator of the TME, facilitating immune evasion and driving disease progression. TK expression in pericytes may serve as a predictive biomarker for TKI responsiveness, offering a cellular target whose expression pattern may guide therapeutic decisions and improve patient stratification in TKI-based treatment regimens. Translational significance: These findings provide clinically actionable insights by identifying pericyte derived molecular targets that may refine patient risk stratification and support personalized treatment approaches. The pericyte associated markers uncovered here show strong prognostic value across multiple cancer types, highlighting their potential to improve outcome prediction. Moreover, the specificity of these targets positions them as promising candidates for therapeutic intervention and for incorporation into future biomarker-driven clinical trials.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Previous work from our lab provides evidence that exosomes purified from media of insulin resistant adipocytes or T2D patient plasma likely drives these outcomes by delivering miRNAs that exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in several breast and prostate cancer models. Here, we build on our previous findings to investigate whether treatment with metabolic medications attenuates the tumor promoting effects of exosomes. We found that human DU145 cells, a model for prostate cancer, treated with plasma exosomes from T2D patients, shows patterns in global gene transcription that resolve by patient treatment with metformin. To test the effects of metformin experimentally, we used a murine model of insulin resistance (IR). Treating DU145 cells with miRNAs purified from the plasma exosomes of IR mice, we found that cells transfected with miRNAs from the metformin-treated IR group displayed significantly less migration than cells transfected with miRNAs from the unmedicated IR group. We suggest that metformin may partially reverse effects of T2D to exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by modifying the miRNA payload of plasma exosomes.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools to determine VHS and VLAS have been developed which may reduce variability and save time. Two manual methods for measuring VHS and VLAS on right and left lateral canine thoracic radiographs were compared. Measurements of VHS and VLAS made by deep learning enabled program, MetronMind, were compared to a trained observer on right and left lateral radiographs from 1058 client-owned dogs including 80 breeds with a variety of heart sizes, thoracic conformations and radiographic quality. This was a retrospective, single center, method comparison study. Pearsons correlation, Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression were used to assess agreement. Correlation between traditional and modified manual measurements for VHS and VLAS were strong (r=0.994 and r=0.974 respectively), with minimal bias (-0.10 and 0.04 vertebrae respectively) indicating that the modified methods closely approximate traditional measurements obtained from right lateral views. MetronMind measurements of VHS and VLAS from right lateral radiographs correlated well with the human observers modified measurements (r=0.947 and r=0.811 respectively), showing small mean biases (0.08 and 0.07 vertebrae respectively). Correlation between left and right lateral radiographic measurements of VHS (0.87 and 0.91) was higher than for VLAS (0.73 and 0.64) and bias was larger for VHS (0.26 and 0.31 vertebrae) than VLAS (-0.13 and -0.10 vertebrae) for humans and MetronMind respectively. MetronMind can therefore assist veterinarians with measuring VHS and VLAS in dogs and right lateral radiographs are preferred.

While dimensional subtyping using functional connectivity (FC) has advanced the field, the intrinsic instability of FC limits its power to identify stable trait-like biomarkers. This study provides a direct comparison of latent factors derived from both FC and a stable morphometric measure, Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND), within the same ASD cohort. We hypothesized that stable structural factors would provide a more behaviorally relevant and biologically grounded account of ASD heterogeneity. Our findings reveal an important dissociation between functional and morphometric features. Latent factors derived from morphometric similarity (MIND) significantly correlated with core ASD behavioral traits (SCQ, SRS), while functional factors showed no association. This dissociation was also found at the neural level. Specifically, we observed weaker structure-function correspondence in the ASD group compared to the healthy control group (HC). Moreover, the stable structural factors were linked to trait-like neurodevelopmental mechanisms: the association with the CB1 receptor (important for synaptic pruning) observed in the HC was notably missing in the ASD group. Conversely, the functional factors were associated with a state-like arousal system (the norepinephrine transporter, NET). Collectively, our results demonstrate that stable morphometric-based factors, rather than time-varying functional ones, are predictive of behavioral traits in ASD. This work validates MIND as a robust approach and suggests that the link between structural organization and its neurodevelopmental (CB1) underpinnings is a more powerful and stable target for developing biomarkers in autism.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Though storage of experience dependent memory is key to survival, post-traumatic memories are detrimental to the physical and emotional wellbeing. The generation of any form of long-term memory culminates from synaptic plasticity and potentiation through persistent change in protein synthesis. Drosophila has been a robust model for the study of memory mechanisms; olfactory memory paradigms have been enormously successful in elucidating neuroanatomical, molecular, physiological and signalling pathways underlying the process. Long-term memory (LTM) has been induced by protein synthesis dependent mechanisms followed by a post-learning consolidation process whereas a medium-term anaesthesia resistant memory (ARM) is mediated by the Radish protein in flies. Here we present a novel and simple memory paradigm in adult flies for inducing sustained stress-induced memory paradigm, where a single attractive odorant is associated with an aversive stimulus- copper sulfate, which provides bitter taste as well as sustained malaise due to toxicity. We find that the elicited memory is a combination of ARM and LTM which is dependent on the number of training cycles. The eight-cycle training paradigm leads to robust, CREB and protein synthesis dependent memory persisting for about 7 days. The mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells neurons as well as the dopaminergic input neurons (PPL1 subset) are involved in the formation of memory mediated by enhanced calcium as well as synaptic elaboration in the {gamma} subset of the MB neurons.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Enhancing inhibitory neuron activity via gene therapy may restore excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We developed a compact 410-bp glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter (cmGAD67) that enables strong, selective transgene expression in inhibitory neurons while preserving AAV packaging capacity. When delivered systemically, AAV vectors carrying cmGAD67 preferentially targeted parvalbumin interneurons and supported effective circuit manipulation. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) under cmGAD67 (AAV-GAD65) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) epilepsy models. Systemic AAV-GAD65 suppressed abnormal delta oscillations, reduced seizure-like events, normalized anxiety-like behavior, and improved survival in a severe PTZ paradigm. Biochemical analyses confirmed increased cortical and hippocampal GABA levels, linking behavioral and electrophysiological improvements to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis. Prior clinical evidence indicates that AAV-GAD65 delivery to the subthalamic nucleus is safe and effective in Parkinson's disease.

Traditional group-level neuroimaging analyses fail to capture individual differences, while normative modeling offer a promising approach to quantify individual deviations from healthy brain structure patterns, facilitating the identification of biological subtypes and offering a data-driven framework to dissect this heterogeneity. METHODS: Using 1,190 healthy controls (age 22-37), we constructed normative developmental trajectories of gray matter volume (GMV) across 246 Brainnetomedefined regions using Bayesian linear regression. Deviation maps were derived for 398 MDD patients. k-means clustering was employed to identify GMV-based biotypes. Then, the clinical characteristics and anatomical differences among these subtypes were explored, along with the post-treatment clinical features and treatment responses of participants who completed the 8-week antidepressant treatment within each subtype. RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited widespread yet individually variable GMV deviations. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes: Subtype 1 displayed predominantly negative deviations in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, whereas Subtype 2 showed widespread positive deviations in temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Subtype 1 had higher extraversion and symptom-linked deviation patterns; in Subtype 2, deviation burden correlated with generalized anxiety. Longitudinally, Subtype 1's GMV deviation changes predicted symptom improvement, while Subtype 2's deviations correlated with baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS: Normative modeling of GMV reveals marked neuroanatomical heterogeneity in MDD and identifies subtypes with distinct clinical and treatment-related characteristics, laying a foundation for precision psychiatry and individualized interventions.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

However, a subgroup of TFs known as pioneer factors (PFs) can recognize motifs covered by nucleosomes and initiate chromatin opening.

Here, we show that LexA, a bacterial TF with poor nucleosome binding in vitro, can rapidly invade into a well-positioned nucleosome from a motif positioned at the dyad when expressed ectopically in yeast. This striking contrast between LexA binding in vitro and in vivo raises the possibility that TFs can exploit nucleosome dynamics in vivo to access occluded sites. Surprisingly, we find that LexA-mediated chromatin opening can occur in the absence of DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, histone turnover, and a few histone chaperones. Instead, nucleosome invasion by LexA and a native PF, Cbf1, is promoted by the cohesin complex, illustrating intriguing a connection between cohesin and TF binding. Together, our results demonstrate that even non-pioneer TFs like LexA can bind and displace nucleosomes in vivo, through a process facilitated by cohesin.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

GTP-RAB5 activates VPS34-CII, by binding to a helical insertion in the C2 domain of VPS34 on the BECLIN1/UVRAG-containing adaptor arm of the complex. The autophagy complex, VPS34 complex I (VPS34-CI), features a unique ATG14L subunit in place of the VPS34-CII UVRAG subunit, and we found that this distorts the adaptor arm to alter the VPS34 RAB-GTPase binding pocket so that it preferentially binds GTP-RAB1. Surprisingly, our higher-resolution single-particle cryo-EM structure of VPS34-CII showed a second GTP-RAB5 binding site on the VPS15 solenoid region. This site (VPS15-RAB5-site) appears to be the primordial RAB5-binding region. A mutant in the helical insertion of the C2 domain of human VPS34 that mimics the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequence abolishes RAB5 binding to VPS34. Mutation of the VPS15-RAB5-site ortholog in S. cerevisiae VPS15 resulted in defective CPY sorting, loss of colocalization with the RAB5 ortholog Vps21, and loss of binding to Vps21 in vitro.

The POI rats were administered low or high doses of hUC-MSCs via tail vein transplantation. Ovarian function was evaluated through monitoring of the estrous cycle, serum hormone analysis, ovarian histomorphology, follicle counting, and mating assays. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the expression of proteins related to apoptosis and angiogenesis. Additionally, in vitro co-culture assays were conducted to evaluate the immunomodulatory capacity of hUC-MSCs. The results indicated that hUC-MSC transplantation restored estrous cyclicity, normalized hormone levels, increased follicle counts, and improved pregnancy outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analysis indicated a reduction in atretic follicles and an enhancement of ovarian structure. Mechanistically, hUC-MSCs were found to attenuate apoptosis by modulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 and to promote angiogenesis through the upregulation of VEGF. In vitro, hUC-MSCs demonstrated significant immunomodulatory effects, including the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and the promotion of regulatory T cell expression.

However, experimental screening methods remain time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, various machine learning and deep learning models have been developed, yet their performance is still constrained by the limited availability of experimentally validated data. In this study, we propose a generative AI-driven data augmentation (GDA) framework and predictor, GDA-Pred, to improve the prediction performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) classifiers for identifying IL-6 and IL-13 inducing peptides. GDA expands the training dataset by generating novel peptide sequences using three types of generative AI models: generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models (DMs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The GDA framework is defined by four key parameters: the type of generative model, the sequence identity cutoff, the probability threshold (PT) for selecting generated peptides, and the augmentation ratio (AR) between generated and real peptides. Since optimizing these parameters is challenging with small datasets, we adopt a case study-oriented proof-of-concept approach using a moderately sized dataset of anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) to derive interpretable optimal settings. The performance of the optimized GDA was evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation with cluster-based partitioning and a hold-out test on benchmark datasets. The optimized GDA was then applied to SOTA classifiers, collectively termed GDA-Pred, to identify IL-6 and IL-13 inducing peptides, both of which are limited by small dataset sizes.

Approach and Results: We analyzed RNA-seq data from 1,013 liver cancer patients and constructed a multi-layered reference dataset. Using a customized pipeline, we identified an average of 60 neoTSTs per patient, significantly surpassing mutation-derived neoantigens (neoMuts).

Mechanistically, neoTSTs were generated via retained introns, transposable element activation, HNF4A-regulated alternative promoters, and de novo transmembrane domain (TMD) generation. Single-cell analysis revealed neoTSTs cover >75% of tumor cells and identified antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (apCAFs) that enriched in immunotherapy responders and amplified CD4 T-cell responses via MHC-II presentation.

Here, we introduce a chemically switchable CAR platform that enables graded, reversible regulation of CAR-T activity while retaining full therapeutic capacity. Using engineered CAR-T cells, we evaluate drug-controlled activation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release against CD19 tumor cells and screened clinically approved NS3/4A inhibitors to identify optimal small-molecule controllers. Compared with conventional CAR-T cells, switchable CAR-T cells exhibited minimal background activity in the OFF state, preventing antigen-driven activation and cytokine release in the absence of drug. Upon drug addition, CAR expression was rapidly restored, with full-length CAR detectable within 1 hour and ~80% of maximal expression achieved by 4 hours. Reversible suppression of CAR expression protected normal CD19 B cells once malignant cells were eliminated, addressing the clinical challenge of persistent CD19 CAR-T activity that can lead to B-cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent infections. Furthermore, switchable CAR-T cells displayed reduced exhaustion, enhanced persistence, stable CAR expression, and preferential central memory differentiation following tumor clearance.

Mechanistically, fumarate modifies RPA1, an essential factor for ATR-CHK1 activation through succination, a post-translational modification. Succination of RPA1 occurs mainly at cysteine residues 481 and 486, which reduces its binding affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). RPA1 succination leads to deficient recruitment of TOPBP1 to ssDNA, resulting in attenuated CHK1 activation and defective cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Succinated RPA1 compromises homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair.

SCAF1 deficiency induced via auxin-dependent degradation in neuron differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) results in neuronal commitment defects, mediated by altered mRNA isoform usage that impacts expression of key neuronal genes. These findings highlight the importance of mRNA isoform usage and underscores the key role for SCAF proteins in its regulation though polyadenylation site selection.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

While foraging, dispersal, and migration are the most widely studied movement types, they operate at distinct spatial and temporal scales, and no single resource currently integrates these processes across taxa, traits, and ecosystems. We present MacroMove, a comprehensive global movement database containing 92,207 observations from 4,329 (4,167 using GBIF backbone) species, spanning 36 classes and 648 families across 205 countries, with data sourced from 6,234 references and 36 meta-analyses/databases. It includes both vertebrates and invertebrates from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. The database includes various movement metrics - home range area, dispersal distance, migration distance, day range, routine speed and maximum speed - including summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, maximum) where available. Records are reported at individual, population, or species levels and include standardised metadata describing species identity (binomial name, class, family), research methods (e.g. sampling method, sampling level and sampling dates) and location (e.g. country, location and coordinates). The dataset was assembled from published meta-analyses/databases and original studies included in these meta-analyses. Trait information (body mass and locomotion mode) from original studies and associated metadata was incorporated, with additional data sourced from established trait databases and reputable online resources. In the final dataset, body mass is available for 98 % and locomotion for 100% of species. Taxonomy was harmonised using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) backbone taxonomy. The database is supplied in comma-delimited text (.csv) format to maximise accessibility and compatibility with a wide range of workflows. By consolidating existing movement data into a single, standardised and openly accessible resource, MacroMove fills a major gap in available biodiversity data. It serves as a practical and extensible foundation for synthesising movement information across taxa and ecosystems, advancing data-driven research on the ecological and evolutionary correlates of animal movement.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Truffles have become a promising source of new compounds because they contain a wide range of biologically active ingredients. In addition, they are a consortium of symbiotic microorganisms that produce natural products. The aim of this study was to study the antibiotic and growth stimulating effects of methanolic extracts of truffle fruiting bodies collected in Russia in 2020-2022. The extracts demonstrated inhibitory activity against St. carnosus, E. persicina, and kanamycin-resistant E. coli. Also, for the first time, we have demonstrated that truffle extracts have biological activity in terms of stimulating the growth of C. vulgaris.

H3K4 methylation is deposited by the SET1 (A/B) and MLL (1-4) multi-protein complexes, but discovering how these essential enzymes shape H3K4me3 has been extremely challenging due to their multiplicity. This has also made determining whether SET1/MLL complexes control transcription through H3K4me3, or non-catalytic activities, an impenetrable problem. Here, we overcome these challenges through leveraging genome-engineering and combinatorial SET1/MLL protein depletion, integrated with genomics, proteomics, and live-cell transcription imaging. We uncover a new SET1B complex and reveal that SET1 and MLL1/2 complexes synergise to define H3K4me3 at gene regulatory elements. Unexpectedly, by decoupling SET1/MLL complex occupancy at promoters from H3K4me3, we discover they primarily control transcription independently of H3K4me3 through counteracting promoter-proximal termination and supporting transcription burst size.

However, an underexplored dimension of referentiality is the ability to process the direction in which a vocalisation is emitted as a cue towards its referent. Here, we replicated an experimental design previously applied to dogs, chimpanzees and human infants to investigate whether domestic goats (Capra hircus) can use human voices as a directional cue in a hidden-object task. Twenty-nine goats from a UK sanctuary participated in three experimental conditions. In each condition, goats were individually presented with a human experimenter obscured by a barrier, and two identical containers, one of which was baited with food. In the reward directed speech condition, the experimenter vocalised excitedly towards the baited container while sitting closer to the un-baited container, and then the goat was able to select which container to explore. While substantial inter-individual variation existed, on average, subjects chose the baited container at above chance level across the four trials. Two control conditions explored alternative explanations for this result: a no speech condition, in which the experimenter was silent but remained in the same location as in the test condition, and a non-reward directed speech condition, in which the experimenter directed their voice away from both containers. Subjects showed no evidence of choosing the baited container at above chance level in either of these control conditions. We conclude that goats, like dogs, but not chimpanzees, are capable of attending to the directional cues provided by human voices, and discuss the possible role of domestication in the taxonomic distribution of this ability.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Recent efforts have assembled this data into terabytes of unitigs, an efficient k-mer set representation that can reduce data size by an order of magnitude. However, these unitigs were compressed on a per-accession basis, leaving substantial cross-sample redundancy unexploited. While co-compression of related samples offers high space-saving potential, existing tools lack targeted decompression: the ability to retrieve specific documents at a cost proportional to their individual sizes rather than that of the entire collection. This paper introduces the \"inverted de Bruijn graph\" property, formalizing the concept of efficient targeted decompression, and presents kloe, its first implementation. kloe is a compression method for large, highly similar k-mer multi-sets, such as collections of unitigs from related samples. Unlike existing approaches that map k-mers to colors (samples), kloe takes a complementary route by performing color-to-k-mer mapping, associating samples with their respective k-mer sets. This enables targeted decompression of any chosen sample's k-mer content. At its core, kloe utilizes a new sequence construct called \"monochromatigs\", drawing on concepts from simplitigs and monotigs to achieve both significant space savings and efficient retrieval. Finally, a central aim of this work is to highlight this novel problem area, which we argue is critically understudied compared to colored de Bruijn graphs.

Current predictive tools often fail to integrate three-dimensional structural constraints and cancer- specific dynamic information, limiting their biological relevance and translational potential. To address this, the present study constructs SPARK, a machine learning framework that integrates multi-modal features within cancer-specific contexts. These include data-driven features (such as phosphoproteomic co-expression, mu- tual information, protein-level abundance, and phosphosite-level abundance), knowledge-driven features (e.g., STRING protein-protein interactions), and structural features (ESM-2 embeddings compressed via an autoen- coder). The training of the model was done with the adoption of the XGBoost classifier on data from eight CPTAC cancer cohorts. SPARK demonstrates strong predictive performance across different cancer types, with AUROC values ranging from 0.929 to 0.957 (mean: 0.944) in normal tissues and 0.941 to 0.958 (mean: 0.948) in tumor tissues. The accuracy of these predictions was further validated against experimentally determined kinase-substrate specificities. Using SPARK's predictions, tissue-specific phosphorylation signaling networks are systematically reconstructed. These SPARK-derived networks reveal distinct phosphorylation patterns and kinase activation landscapes across cancers while identifying several highly tissue-specific kinases as promis- ing therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we present PhaLP 2.0, a significantly enhanced database designed to overcome key challenges in the computational study of lysins by integrating the newly identified lysins obtained from thousands of metagenomes. To expand the known diversity of lysins beyond those from cultured phages, we developed SUBLYME, a protein embedding-based machine learning Software designed to Uncover and classify Bacteriophage Lysins in Metagenomic datasets. Using embeddings derived from the prior well-curated protein sequences of the original PhaLP database, we trained support vector machines to distinguish lysins from non-lysins in viromes and classify them as either endolysins or virion-associated lysins. The models achieved an average F1-score of 98% on held-out lysin clusters. SUBLYME enabled the discovery of 743,000 new lysin sequences from EnVhogDB, a virome-derived protein database, increasing the number of known lysin clusters by a factor of 40, from 1,000 to 40,000. PhaLP 2.0 entries were annotated by integrating Pfam functional predictions to the refined delineations obtained with SPAED, an algorithm that leverages the predicted aligned error matrix from AlphaFold predictions to identify domain boundaries.

This means that nucleotides important for binding (consensus nucleotides, CNs) experience the pressure of negative selection and, therefore, are highly conserved. However, for some regulated genes, the strongest possible repression or activation may not necessarily be optimal (i.e. provide the highest fitness). Here, we show that, along with CNs, nucleotides causing relatively weaker binding (nonconsensus nucleotides, NCNs) are sometimes preserved by negative selection. We then consider several possible reasons for the conservation of NCNs and demonstrate that NCNs depend epistatically on other loci of the same TFBS for a substantial fraction of TFBSs.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Altered excitatory neuronal transmission is an early functional defect in these diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neuronal activity can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting a potential link between altered excitability and genomic instability. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TDP-43 is involved in neuronal activity-induced DSBs. Moreover, we show that ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations (A90V and A315T) disrupt this mechanism, leading to the accumulation of DSBs and altered neuronal activity compared to wild-type TDP-43 protein. Using the BLISS technique, we mapped genome-wide DSBs in primary mouse neurons expressing wild-type or mutant (A90V, A315T) TDP-43 and found enrichment of DSBs within genes regulating excitatory transmission. Mechanistically, the TDP-43 A90V mutation impairs topoisomerase II{beta} function, resulting in enzyme trapping and/or DNA supercoiling that predisposes DNA to breaks. Notably, this impairment is partially rescued by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) overexpression. These findings uncover a novel mechanism linking aberrant neuronal activity and DNA damage, bridging two key pathological hallmarks of ALS/FTD associated with TDP-43 dysfunction. It also paves the way for developing novel therapeutic approaches that rely on targeted DSB repair and/or modulating topoisomerase II{beta}-DNA complexes.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

The underlying neural mechanisms of healthy spatial attention and these drowsiness-related spatial biases remain contested. Competing theories propose that attention is governed either by the interaction of two bilateral networks (dual-network model) or by a dominant right hemisphere (right hemisphere dominance model). To adjudicate between these models, we investigated how effective connectivity within the auditory cortical hierarchy is modulated by drowsiness. We recorded high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) in 32 healthy participants performing a lateralised auditory localisation task in both awake and drowsy states. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis revealed that arousal states become decodable approximately 150 ms post-stimulus. We used Parametric Empirical Bayes and Dynamic Causal Modelling to map arousal-dependent changes in effective connectivity between left-sided and right-sided auditory stimuli. Consistent with the right hemisphere dominance model of spatial attention, right-sided stimuli elicited stronger bidirectional information flow between bilateral inferior frontal gyri during wakefulness. However, we observed a significant reduction in right-hemispheric frontoparietal connectivity alongside a strengthening of a left-hemispheric pathway from the inferior parietal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus during drowsiness. This finding supports the dual-network theory and conflicts with the right hemisphere theory's prediction of a bilateral decrease in activity during drowsiness. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how diminishing arousal shifts cortical processing from a bilaterally integrated network to a left-lateralised state. Our results therefore support the dual-network model of spatial attention while retaining elements of the right hemisphere model.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Its contribution to vocal emotion decoding, however, remains insufficiently understood. While prior work has linked the cerebellum to attentional control and predictive coding, direct evidence for its role in modulating prosody recognition under explicit versus implicit attentional demands is lacking. This study investigated how cerebellar stroke, controlled for time since stroke in months, and with an equal number of left- and right-lateralized lesions, alters vocal emotion processing depending on attentional focus. We aimed to disentangle sensory encoding and integration from decisional contributions of the cerebellum by combining behavioral analyses, drift diffusion modeling (DDM), and functional MRI in cerebellar stroke. Fifteen patients with chronic, isolated cerebellar stroke and fifteen matched controls performed two tasks on vocal stimuli expressing anger, happiness, or neutrality. In the explicit task, participants categorized the expressed emotion; in the implicit task, they categorized speaker gender while ignoring emotional tone. Behavioral performance was analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression and DDM (angle model). Functional MRI analyses included conventional contrasts as well as model-based regressors derived from behavioral and computational parameters. Patients showed lower accuracy than controls, with deficits particularly pronounced in the explicit task. Performance also varied by emotion: gender recognition for angry voices (implicit processing) was relatively preserved, whereas happy and neutral voices were more vulnerable. Contrary to predictions, DDM parameters did not differ between groups. Instead, task effects dominated: implicit processing yielded higher drift rates, larger boundary separation, faster non-decision times, and stronger attentional focus compared to explicit recognition, suggesting that explicit evaluation imposes additional cognitive costs. At the neural level, patients recruited extended networks during explicit processing, including orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior insula, and cerebellar lobule IX, alongside cerebello-cortical tracts. Implicit processing was associated with more restricted activations, particularly in frontal opercular and cerebellar regions (lobule IX). Model-based analyses further revealed that successful categorization in patients relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and pre-supplementary motor area, although these effects were not significant when controlling for time since stroke. Our findings demonstrate that the cerebellum does not primarily shape decision dynamics but optimizes sensory representations of prosodic cues for downstream evaluation. When predictive tuning is compromised, patients maintain intact decision processes yet rely on compensatory cortical recruitment, particularly during explicit tasks. This pattern supports predictive coding accounts of cerebellar function in socio-emotional communication and highlights the need to consider subtle socio-affective deficits in cerebellar patients.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

To explore this, we colonized germ-free female mice with fecal samples from probiotic- or placebo-treated preterm infants from the PRIMAL trial. Microbiota composition was vertically transmitted and stable across generations. At steady-state, 3-week-old pups colonized with probiotic-conditioned microbiota exhibited markedly reduced populations of innate immune cells, particularly in the colon, with subtler effects in the small intestine and spleen, while adaptive immune subsets were less affected. Upon enteropathogenic Escherichia coli challenge at day 5, pups harboring probiotic-conditioned microbiota displayed reduced growth and impaired bacterial clearance, correlating with diminished numbers of key innate immune cell populations. These findings demonstrate that probiotic-driven shifts in human-derived microbial communities can attenuate immune cell development in mice and alter early-life infection outcomes.

We introduce a framework for restriction-weighted q-space trajectory imaging (ResQ) that incorporates diffusion-time effects via the restriction-weighting tensor, and we evaluate it in a longitudinal study of prostate cancer xenografts treated by external radiotherapy. Methods - We proposed a novel gradient waveform design that yields controlled restriction weighting and applied a set of four waveforms at a 9.4 T pre-clinical MRI system. Mice were inoculated with human prostate cancer cells (LnCaP) and assigned to groups that were untreated controls or treated by external beam irradiation. ResQ produced parameters of diffusivity (D), isotropic diffusional variance (VDi), and microscopic diffusion anisotropy (VDa) as well as their diffusion time dependence ({Delta}D, {Delta}VDi, {Delta}VDa). Analyses were performed to characterize parameters longitudinally and across groups. This included a model that neglects time-dependence to highlight the consequences of ignoring restriction effects. Results - ResQ revealed clear diffusion time dependence across all tumors, with marked longitudinal differences between treated and untreated groups, most prominent in D, {Delta}D, and VDi. The ResQ signal representation could capture the signal dynamics, whereas the diffusion-time-independent formulation did not. Neglecting diffusion-time dependence led to substantial parameter bias, most notably a pronounced overestimation of microscopic diffusion anisotropy. Conclusion - Diffusion-time effects are non-negligible in prostate cancer and must be considered when using tensor-valued diffusion encoding. The ResQ framework enables controlled restriction weighting and improves the interpretability of diffusion MRI parameters, providing a principled approach for microstructural imaging and potentially enabling novel imaging biomarkers for oncological diagnostics and beyond.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

While disruptions in the structural integrity of the striatum are well documented, less is known about how the underlying functional impairments relate to the disease. We developed a large-scale modeling framework based on intrinsic ignition to uncover functional anomalies during HD progression. We first measured how much a spontaneous event in one brain region influences the rest of the brain, then systematically perturbed the activity of the striatum to predict the empirical changes in functional connectivity (FC) by re-optimizing the model parameters and conducting in-silico experiments. Results showed that disruption of the activity dynamics in the caudate, and to some extent the putamen, are the key factors that explain a substantial amount of the variance in FC alterations during HD progression. We then assessed the ability to recover whole-brain functional activity by driving the caudate and putamen activity towards a healthy-like regime and found that, by tuning the local bifurcation parameter of caudate and putamen, it is possible to recover whole-brain healthy functional activity, albeit moderately. Surprisingly, although the functional disruptions in the caudate better explained the alterations in FC, the recovery of the dynamics was more effective in the putamen. Overall, our results suggest that the disruptions of the dynamics in the striatum can explain the gross functional connectivity changes in HD.

This user-administered setup provides a training platform for researchers at all levels, with beginners in cryo-EM achieving proficiency to independently operate the microscope within a month of regular use and training. We have demonstrated routine high-quality low-resolution reconstructions using a Ceta CMOS camera and high-resolution reconstructions enabling building of atomic models using a Falcon C direct detector.

Although existing experimental screens and machine learning-based designs have advanced their discovery, these strategies remain context-restricted, typically requiring new cell-type- or state-specific libraries or datasets for each context, thus limiting their generalizability and scalability for broad biomedical applications. Because transcription factor (TF) activity naturally varies across cell types and cellular states, a high-coverage library of TF-responsive synthetic enhancers provides a universal starting point for identifying cell-type- or state-specific elements across diverse biological contexts. Harnessing this principle, we developed the TREND (transcription factor-responsive enhancer discovery) platform, a massively parallel reporter assay framework comprising 57,715 designs covering 1,068 TFs. To demonstrate its utility, we applied TREND to ovarian cancer and identified cancer-selective synthetic enhancers that discriminate cancer cells from normal epithelial cells. Building on these synthetic enhancers, we developed a protein-interaction-based AND-gate circuit that enables tighter control and enhanced transcriptional strength. In murine ovarian cancer models, these synthetic enhancers and AND-gate circuits achieved tumor-restricted activity and potent antitumor efficacy when driving combinatorial immune payloads. Extending TREND to immune cell engineering, we identified synthetic enhancers with stronger inducibility in the activated state and lower basal activity than conventional NFAT-motif-based enhancers in T cells. Together, these findings position TREND as a more generalizable framework for identifying synthetic enhancers with high contextual specificity, offering a versatile tool for precise gene regulation and context-aware therapeutic design.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

As an alternative, antibody repertoires can be synthesized by recombining human antibody genes and introducing random mutations in their complementarity-determining regions. Synthetic repertoires can deliver binders quickly and without associated animal-welfare concerns, but the resulting antibodies often fail to exhibit drug-like biophysical properties. We developed a principled structure- and energy-based strategy, called CADAbRe, for designing repertoires of human antibodies that are stable by design. Every antibody was programmed to ensure its stability while maximizing the structural diversity of the entire repertoire. We also developed a cost-effective strategy for repertoire assembly and, as a proof of concept, synthesized over 500 million unique antibodies based on hundreds of human antibody gene combinations and designed CDR H3 sequences. Structurally diverse binders against four unrelated antigens exhibited affinities, specificities, and drug-like properties seen in therapeutic leads. CADAbRe is the first programmable structure-based strategy for antibody-repertoire design, enabling design-test-learn cycles towards high-quality universal and customized repertoires.

They increase their glucose uptake, relying on aerobic glycolysis for generating biomass while switching to glutamine to fuel energy production. Here we have identified a requirement for human Bcl-2 family, Noxa, in the metabolic switch to glutamine dependence in activated CD8+ T cells, that is independent of its canonical role in apoptosis at the end of the immune response. Using an in vitro co-stimulation model, we demonstrate that Noxa is induced in CD8+ T cells and remains elevated during the proliferative and differentiation phases of the response and through the onset of apoptosis. Noxa protein induction requires glutamine, is mediated via mTOR, and is independent of glutaminolysis. Glutamine, in turn, requires Noxa to facilitate its conversion to glutamate. CD8+ T cells lacking Noxa showed reduced levels of intracellular glutamate but no impairment of mitochondrial or effector function, and decreased dependence on glutamine for both respiration and growth during the proliferative phase. NOXA knockout CD8 T cells also displayed significantly higher viability in the apoptotic phase of the immune response. CD8+ T cells from a human NOXA gene-replacement mouse responded normally to in vitro stimulation and in vivo acute infection. However, human Noxa-expressing murine CD8+ T cells displayed a distinctly proliferative gene signature in their transcriptome following activation, supporting an early growth-promoting role for this BH3-only protein.

Selecting probiotic candidates based on evolutionary genomic decay signatures of host dependency offers a potential solution. The Ruegeria strain B4 of the population MC10, identified by such signatures, has shown persistent colonization in corals. To understand the putative mechanisms behind this, we characterized its functional profile using an integrated multi-omics approach, comparing it to non-candidate Ruegeria strains isolated from the same coral colony and compartment (mucus). This controlled for host genotype and microenvironment, both of which influence colonization outcomes. We show that MC10's genome is uniquely enriched for host-interaction functions, such as siderophore-mediated iron acquisition and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, which were confirmed phenotypically by enhanced siderophore production and biofilm formation. Subsequent proteomic analysis showed that the MC10-B4 proteome underwent a \"motility-to-sessility\" reprogramming upon exposure to host metabolites, a response distinct from its non-candidate sympatric relatives. Our findings suggest an evolutionary shift toward host dependency, marked by genomic decay on one hand and compensated by the gain and expression of functions that enable stable colonization on the other. MC10's functional profile, particularly its sensitivity to oxidative stress, would likely have excluded it from conventional probiotic screens that prioritize robust in vitro performance. This validates an evolution-guided approach that prioritizes innate colonization potential over pre-defined in vitro functionalities, informing the rational design of next-generation probiotics.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the metabolic basis enabling the efficient assimilation of PE oxidised scission products and its prevalence in microbial communities naturally colonising plastic surfaces. Metabolomic profiling of weathered PE (W-PE) leachates revealed a highly diverse pool of oxidised aliphatic compounds varying in chain length and oxidation state. Different plastic-degrading bacteria consumed this complex mix of metabolites to distinct extents, with consumption efficiency positively correlating with the number of redundant genes associated with the {beta}-oxidation pathway in their genomes. Comparative proteomic analysis of two Alcanivorax species exhibiting contrasting PE-leachate consumption capabilities confirmed that this functional redundancy was fully activated in response to the chemically complex PE-derived substrate pool. In contrast, it remained largely uninduced in the presence of the single, structurally simple alkane hexadecane. Hence, our results indicate that efficient PE assimilation requires a broad and redundant enzymatic repertoire capable of funnelling structurally diverse oxidised aliphatic intermediates through {beta}-oxidation. Metagenomic analysis of plastisphere communities further revealed enrichment of fatty acid degradation genes in biofilms colonising both pristine and W-PE--as expected more strongly in W-PE--compared with wood and surrounding water controls, supporting the ecological relevance of this mechanism for PE biodegradation. Together, these findings identify {beta}-oxidation metabolic redundancy as a key trait underpinning microbial PE assimilation and suggest that plastic degradation may be occurring under natural environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

The human upper respiratory tract is co-colonized by commensal and pathogenic streptococci, but how CCC systems mediate their interactions remains unclear. Here, we investigated the TprA/PhrA quorum-sensing system, composed of the transcription factor TprA and its cognate signaling peptide PhrA, across Streptococcus mitis and S. pneumoniae. Comparative genomics showed that this system is broadly distributed across both species, with most strains sharing identical phrA alleles that enable interspecies signaling. In both species, the tprA/phrA module is commonly linked to the streptococcin E (sce) locus, encoding a putative bacteriocin. We show that activation of the sce operon enhances the competitive fitness of S. mitis in biofilm and infection models. In S. mitis strain C22, two diverse copies of tprA/phrA are present and differentially regulated, coordinating expression of tprA/phrA and the downstream sce locus through both shared and independent pathways. Transcriptomic analyses revealed redundancy, additivity, and cross-regulation between the two systems, linking them to the control of bacteriocin production, competence, and oxidative stress responses. Distinct promoter architectures and TprA-binding motifs underlie the functional divergence of these paralogues, highlighting how regulatory diversification can expand quorum-sensing outputs.

However, these traits are usually quantified independently, growth is quantified with endpoint biomass measurements while respiration is quantified by monitoring oxygen or carbon dioxide. Because the two physiological traits are collected at different temporal and volumetric scales (hours-to-days for growth versus minutes-to-hours for respiration), reconciling them is challenging and often introduces scale-mismatch bias, obscuring causal links between metabolism and environmental drivers. In this study, we develop a novel method for quantifying the rates of bacterial growth and respiration concurrently from a single dissolved oxygen time series. Our approach introduces a model that couples exponential biomass growth with biomass-specific respiration, enabling the simultaneous inference of both rates in real time. We applied our high throughput method to 15 bacterial strains isolated from natural environments. Our approach yielded growth estimates in close agreement with measurements based on popular methods using optical density or flow cytometry with no evidence of taxon-specific bias. We also tested our approach in quantifying the effects of temperature on respiration, growth and carbon use-efficiency in Pseudomonas sp. Our method yielded typical unimodal thermal response curves for growth and respiration where rates were highest at moderate temperatures, while carbon-use efficiency increased from cooler temperatures, peaked around the thermal optimum, and declined at high temperature. By quantifying respiration and growth simultaneously and in high throughput, our approach effectively enables measurement of microbial metabolic strategies and adaptations to stress.

Such tigh regulations is essential for mechanical and chemical resistance of dental enamel and makes it the hardest tissue in the body. Using Tent5a knock-out (KO) mouse model, we demonstrated that TENT5A, a non-canonical poly-A polymerase is crucial for the stability, translation, and secretion of EMP mRNAs, particularly Amelx, during amelogenesis. TENT5A belongs to the Terminal nucleotidyl transferases (TENTs) superfamily and is responsible for protecting mRNA from degradation, ensuring stability, and promoting mRNA translation. TENT5A-deficient mice exhibited Amelogenesis imperfecta, characterized by enamel hypomineralization, thinner enamel layers, and disrupted ultrastructure, as revealed by micro-computed tomography. Through nanopore direct mRNA sequencing, we identified that TENT5A polyadenylates Amelx and other mRNAs encoding secreted proteins, enhancing their stability and translation in the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, a more recent study found that m as low as 0.02 (i.e., one migrant per generation) can cause estimates of linkage disequilibrium effective population size (NeLD) to underestimate a subpopulation's true Ne.

Compared to existing enzymes, these enzymes are superior in thermostability and the ability to hydrolyse different high-molecular weight PUR oligomers and nylon textiles. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of enzymes capable of hydrolysing longer chains of PUR and nylon. This study significantly increases the number of known PURases and nylonases and provides starting points for optimization campaigns through protein engineering and for in silico discovery.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Currently, pharmaceutically relevant CBs are primarily extracted from Cannabis, a process that presents challenges related to yield variability and purity. To overcome these limitations, microbial platforms are being explored for the sustainable production of specific CBs. Compared to conventional microbial hosts, the photosynthetic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii offers plant-like post-translational modifications, low-cost cultivation, CO2 fixation, and low endotoxin contamination, making it a potential chassis for CB biosynthesis. Here, we expressed a codon-optimized, soluble aromatic prenyltransferase (NphBG286S/Y288A) from Streptomyces and Cannabis sativa cannabidiolic acid synthase (CBDAS) in the nuclear genome of C. reinhardtii; transformants were screened for integration, gene expression, protein accumulation, enzymatic activity, and CB production. Our results provide evidence of functional NphB expression in C. reinhardtii, with in vitro CBGA production reaching up to 633 {+/-} 58 g/L. Although CBDAS transcripts were detected under multiple construct designs, neither protein nor CBDA was accumulated, suggesting limitations in expression, localization, or post-translational processing in C. reinhardtii. Our study provides the first demonstration of in vitro CBGA biosynthesis in the photosynthetic model microalga C. reinhardtii, highlighting its potential as a future platform for CB production. It also highlights key challenges in nuclear expression of plant-derived enzymes, such as CBDAS, emphasizing that improved regulatory control, subcellular targeting, and mRNA processing will be required to achieve full pathway reconstruction in C. reinhardtii.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Despite its far-reaching personal, clinical, and economic impact, affecting hundreds of millions worldwide after surgery, trauma, and burns, no effective treatments exist to halt or reverse pathological scar formation. Scarring results from uncontrolled TGF-b1 signaling, which drives excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen-I/III and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), producing rigid, dysfunctional tissue. Here, we present a mechanistically guided approach targeting this unmet clinical need, leveraging the natural antifibrotic peptide hormone relaxin-2 (RLX-2) to actively remodel dermal architecture. RLX-2 signals via its G-protein coupled receptor RXFP1, upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibiting aberrant ECM production. In TGF-b1-activated dermal fibroblasts across 2D and 3D in vitro models, ex vivo healthy and scarred human skin samples - cultured under physiological and pathological tension - and in an in vivo murine burn wound model, RLX-2 robustly suppresses fibrosis, restores regenerative tissue features, and rescues dermal architecture. Importantly, RLX-2 achieves this result without compromising the normal wound healing process, highlighting its potential as a transformative therapy for both prevention and reversal of pathological scarring.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Stabilization of GQs by small-molecule ligands inhibits telomerase activity, motivating extensive efforts to develop GQ-targeting anti-cancer therapeutics. However, how interactions between successive GQs and bound ligands influence small-molecule accessibility remains poorly understood. Here, we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and stepwise photobleaching analysis to quantify the binding stoichiometry of a fluorescently-labeled oxazole telomestatin derivative (L1Cy5-7OTD) to telomeric overhangs capable of forming 1-6 GQs (30-162 nt long), spanning much of the physiologically relevant range. We find that longer overhangs accommodate more ligands on average but exhibit consistently lower binding stoichiometry than the theoretical maximum, saturating at six molecules even in constructs with twelve binding sites. This trend was further supported by experiments showing increased L1Cy5-7OTD binding when the inter-GQ spacer was extended from 3-nt to 9-nt. This effect was independently confirmed by ensemble fluorescence enhancement experiments utilizing N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) as a ligand. Complementary modeling with a one-dimensional lattice model describing equilibrium ligand binding to partially ordered telomeric overhangs revealed positive cooperativity between folding of successive GQs, negative cooperativity between ligands bound opposing (top and bottom) faces of successive GQs, and reduced binding affinity to GQs located at the junction of double stranded and single stranded telomeres. Together, these findings demonstrate how telomeric overhang architecture governs ligand accessibility and provide mechanistic insight to guide the rational design of GQ-targeting anticancer agents.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Since perception ultimately guides action, the way photoreceptors transform light into neural signals constrains an animal's behavioural repertoire. Yet, the physiological role of the highly conserved calcium-dependent chloride current in cone photoreceptors has remained elusive. Whereas calcium-activated currents typically provide negative feedback, we identify a counter-intuitive positive feedback mechanism that enhances detection of slow motion. Using genetics, electrophysiology, and behavioural assays in zebrafish, we show that loss of this current exaggerates the biphasic character of cone impulse responses and diminishes their voltage response amplitude to low temporal frequencies (<1 Hz). These changes in photoreceptor properties translate to behaviour, reducing the gain of the optokinetic response to slow-moving stimuli. Mechanistically, the calcium-dependent chloride current acts as a positive feedback loop that sustains the photovoltage response and counteracts strong adaptation within the cone phototransduction cascade.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we isolated 15 VH3-53/3-66-encoded bnAbs from elite neutralizers who experienced sequential SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections. These bnAbs exhibit exceptional potency and breadth against circulating variants and, as members of a long-lived public antibody lineage, likely contribute to durable humoral protection. Genetic analysis of VH3-53/3-66-encoded bnAbs reveals a convergent somatic hypermutation pattern at seven positions in and around the CDR loops that emerges with repeated viral exposures and distinguishes them from non-bnAbs. Grafting these combined mutations onto clinically escaped antibodies broadens their breadth and restores neutralization activity. Structural analysis shows that these convergent mutations cooperatively remodel CDRs to bind and tolerate virus receptor-binding domain mutations. Using an AI-based antibody language model trained on data linking somatic hypermutations to binding affinity and neutralization, the model is able to identify mutational patterns predictive of breadth, enabling the discovery of a rare bnAb with protective activity against the latest variants from early-pandemic antibody repertoires.

Using this Genotype by Environment by Rhizosphere Microbiome (GERMs) model, we studied three cereal genotypes: two inbred maize lines with contrasting heat sensitivity, and a sorghum inbred that displayed moderate heat tolerance. Plants were grown under optimal and heat stressed conditions across two soil treatments. We developed a systems-level metatranscriptomics approach to examine both plant and microbial transcriptomic profiles and integrated them with microbiome compositional data and plant phenotypes. We compared our strategy to amplicon profiling and found that our metatranscriptomic strategy offers greater functional and taxonomic resolution, allowing us to characterize active microbial pathways and analyze them jointly with plant gene expression profiles within a single system. We show that the microbiome functional profile is driven by host genotype and environmental factors and can enhance plant resilience. Our analyses identified plant genes and microbial pathways consistently associated with heat tolerance and key host-microbe interactions. Specifically, we identified D-amino acid metabolism as a plausible mechanism underlying a synergistic response to heat stress. These results demonstrate that the rhizosphere microbiome is not a passive component but an active participant in plant responses to abiotic stress.

The molecular basis of this activation is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SpNanR binds N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate, a metabolite of sialic acid catabolism. SpNanR exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium, and N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate binding strongly stabilizes the tetramer. Crystal structures and site-specific substitutions demonstrate that N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate bridges and stabilizes the SpNanR tetramer. SpNanR binds its DNA recognition sequence with nanomolar affinity. Notably, the effector N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate does not affect the affinity of SpNanR for DNA. The DNA binding domains are not structurally coupled to the sugar isomerase domains, explaining why N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate binding does not affect DNA binding. Structural analysis reveals that sequence specificity arises through distortion of B-DNA and an unusual {pi}-stack formed by two arginine residues in the minor groove, while affinity is driven by backbone contacts. We propose a mechanism by which S. pneumoniae regulates sialic acid metabolism, consistent with our biophysical experiments and in vivo regulatory behavior.

Here, we reveal that mechanical force induces Gq activation of mGlu2, a balance modulator residing in kinocilia, but not other 7 mGlu members. Force activates mGlu2 through a conserved N-terminal force transduction motif (FTM) via a unique cis mechanism. We engineered a potent FTM-derived peptide agonist that recapitulates force-induced activation and resolved cryo-EM structures of apo-mGlu2, FTM-mGlu2, LFTM-{Psi}EK-mGlu2 and LFTM-{Psi}EK-mGlu2-Gq. The structures reveal that an atypical FTM binding to a previously uncharacterized pocket induces asymmetric 7TM domain rearrangement, enabling Gq coupling via an ICL1-TM3/6/7 interface, fundamentally distinct from the glutamate-induced Gi coupling mode of mGlu2. Compared with Gi-coupled mGlu2, the 5 helix of Gq rotated by 180{degrees}, penetrating deeper (8 [A]) into a hydrophobic pocket. Disruption of the M7947.32-F7806.57-F7766.53 hydrophobic triad core and a conformational propagation path predominantly comprising TM6-7 residues are identified as key elements mediating force induced mGlu2 activation.

We investigated reef fish behaviour in response to predator presence within and outside a protected area in the South Andaman Islands, India. We used 3D printed models to simulate the presence of two different types of predators; a sit-and-wait predator, a grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea) and a wide-ranging pursuit predator, a barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda). We recorded foraging, vigilance, and movement behaviours of herbivorous and invertivorous fish encountered in each plot. Overall, we found that fish were significantly more vigilant in response to both predator models compared to a non-predator control within protected areas but not outside protected areas. Foraging behaviour was suppressed by the predator treatments; however, herbivorous and invertivorous fish responded differently within protected areas. Fish movement behaviours also differed across predator treatments, prey foraging guilds, and areas. Anti-predator responses are thus highly contingent on habitat and both predator and prey traits.

Ecologically it is often overlooked due to its short compact underground stem that makes it appear stemless, or acaulescent. However, across the central US Gulf Coast S. minor is polymorphic for trunk type, with some individuals identified as caulescent, bearing an above-ground trunk that can reach up to two meters in height. Methods: We adopt a population genomics approach to characterize the genetic diversity of S. minor and to identify whether the caulescent and acaulescent forms of this temperate palm represent phenotypic variation within a single species. Key results: The caulescent and acaulescent forms are not reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting these two forms are phenotypic variants of a single species, S. minor s.l. Genetic clustering does not correspond to stem phenotype but rather reflects five discrete biogeographic clusters that span the native range. These geographic clusters indicate phylogeographic breaks along the Tombigbee River with a history that appears to be influenced by the delta of the Mississippi River. Two ecologically divergent populations, one in White Lake and another in Central Texas, show high genetic differentiation from surrounding populations indicating the presence of ecological barriers to gene flow. Conclusions: Population genetic structure of S. minor does not reflect stem morphotype (caulescence or acaulescence) supporting the current taxonomic recognition of one polymorphic species rather than two. However, populations of S. minor show genetic structuring corresponding to known phylogeographic barriers illustrating the dynamic roles regional landscape features played in shaping contemporary S. minor .", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

Combining unsupervised learning of homologous WW sequence data with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and path-sampling methods, we design mutational paths of putative WW domains interpolating between two natural WW domains with either distinct or similar specificities. Sequences along the designed paths are then experimentally validated with high-throughput in-vitro binding assays against 3 peptides of different classes. The vast majority (93%) of intermediate sequences along the designed paths are responsive to the initial or/and final peptides. On the contrary, domains along scrambled paths, in which the same mutations are introduced in random order are not functional, emphasizing how successful design crucially depends on the ability to model epistatic interactions. Interestingly, switch in specificity between classes I and IV whose representative peptides bind to different pockets on the WW domain appears to be smooth, with intermediates displaying some level of binding cross-reactivity with all tested peptides.

In this study, we systematically investigated the physiological stress responses of Pseudomonas putida during heterologous protein production using a modular monitoring system consisting of a plasmid encoding a heterologous protein fused to eGFP and a chromosomally integrated capacity reporter. Our findings reveal that translation is the main bottleneck, with translational capacity becoming saturated under high expression loads. While increasing the strength of the RBS improved protein production for non-burdensome proteins, this effect was not observed for larger fusion proteins. Variations in fusion protein size suggested that it is not the overall mass of the produced protein, but rather the length of the mRNA transcript, that contributes to metabolic burden. We further evaluated how resource availability affects protein expression by modifying the metabolic regime or supplementing with amino acids. While the carbon source affected cellular capacity, it did not significantly alter heterologous protein production. Amino acid supplementation alleviated the growth defects of MBPeGFP-producing cells and modestly improved protein production rates. Together, these findings emphasize that metabolic burden is influenced not only by the size of the produced protein but also by transcript architecture, resource allocation, and the physiological state of the host.

Here, we analyze a large and diverse plasmid database to examine the distribution of partition system types and find that plasmids encoding multiple partition systems are more common than previously recognized. Notably, many plasmids encode multiple partition systems of the same type, an organization that has not been previously investigated. To further investigate, we employ the Streptomyces linear plasmid SCP1, which encodes two type I ATP- and CTP-dependent parABS partition systems, as a model. Sequence analysis shows that both SCP1-encoded ParBs harbor less conserved CTPase domains than their chromosomal counterparts, suggesting they might diverge from canonical ParB functions. However, using chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing, biochemical assays, and targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that both proteins are bona fide ParB CTPase proteins: they recognize distinct parS sites on SCP1, bind and hydrolyze CTP, and slide to accumulate on DNA. Despite both systems being functional, only parABS1, but not parABS2, is crucial for SCP1 maintenance under standard laboratory conditions.

In the course of investigating how Rgy affects genome organization in the archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, we find that Rgy suppresses heat-induced clustering of AT-rich genes, most of which bear signatures of horizontal gene transfer. This function depends on the topoisomerase active site of Rgy, underscoring a critical role of its action on DNA topology. The clustering of AT-rich genes is accompanied by their aberrant recruitment of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, indicative of extensive DNA melting.

The optical and physiological descriptors documented can assist in developing quantitative models for predicting Sargassum biomass in the Atlantic", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Revisiting the lineages of the Cohanim using data from next-generation sequencing", "doi": "10.64898/2025.12.08.692646", "authors": "Lipson, J.; Bohrer, S. G.; Weinstein, S. C.; Cooper, L.; Revivo, D.; Staetsky, D.; Maeir, P.; Runfeldt, G.; Skorecki, K.", "abstract": "Background: Early studies using a handful of Y-chromosome markers showed that many self-declared Jewish priests (Cohanim) share related haplotypes, but the limited resolution left open how many priestly lineages exist, when they arose, and how they map onto Jewish population history. Objectives: We used whole-Y sequencing and modern phylogenetic tools to (i) catalogue Y-chromosome clades that are robustly enriched among Cohanim, (ii) date their most-recent common ancestors (TMRCAs) with pedigree-calibrated clocks, (iii) reconstruct their geographic dispersal across the Jewish Diaspora, and (iv) offer a stable, SNP-block nomenclature for future work. Methods: We generated 104 new Big Y-700 sequences from rigorously documented Cohanim spanning 20 diaspora origins, and incorporated 215 legacy samples re-typed for diagnostic SNPs. Phylogenies and branch TMRCAs were built on the FTDNA and YFull backbones. A branch qualified as \"Cohen\" (CB) if 5 or more men and 50% or more of branch members self-identified as Cohanim. Results: Nine Cohen branches met these criteria, and for the current study were designated CB-01 to CB-09 with numbering based on antiquity of SNP-block coalescence. CB-01 is the largest (c. 45 % of all Cohanim sampled), the most ancient (TMRCA c. 850 BCE), and the only lineage present in every major Jewish community. Its internal topology shows explosive branching between 700 and 300 BCE, stasis through the Roman-Byzantine era, and renewed expansion after 800 CE, mirroring known demographic pulses. CB-02 (TMRCA c. 700 BCE) and CB-03 (c. 550 BCE) likewise trace to Iron- or late Classical-period Judea but are geographically narrower. CB-04 through CB-07 are Near-Eastern clades whose priestly status may have crystallized 0-1000 CE, while CB-05, CB-08 and CB-09 appear to derive from Mediterranean host populations. Twenty percent of Cohanim fall outside any current CB, indicating that additional, rarer lineages remain to be characterized. Conclusions: High-resolution sequencing reveals a small set of divergent paternal lines comprising the Jewish priesthood, dominated by a pre-exilic Levantine lineage whose branch structure traces three millennia of geographically dispersed Jewish demographic history. The CB nomenclature, SNP catalogues and open dataset provided here supply a reproducible framework for genetic and historical studies which illustrate the broader power of dense uniparental phylogenies in population-genetic inference.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Multilevel Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Ferroptosis in Aging: Sex- and Exercise-Dependent Effects on Histological, Molecular, and Genetic Markers", "doi": "10.64898/2025.12.08.692947", "authors": "Ji, F.; Rheem, H.; Lee, H.; Eom, M.; Kim, J.-H.", "abstract": "Background: Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to aging-associated skeletal muscle degeneration and dysfunction. However, the interactive effects of aging, sex, and exercise modality on ferroptosis regulatory markers at the histological, protein, and gene expression levels remain poorly understood. Methods: Male (n = 23) and female (n = 23) mice aged 7 (young) and 17 (aged) months were assigned to sedentary control, voluntary wheel running, or forced treadmill exercise. Ferroptosis in the quadriceps muscle was assessed using histological markers (e.g., fibrosis, Fe3+; accumulation, 4-HNE, MDA), protein-level markers (e.g., GPX4, SLC7A11, p-AMPK, MDA, GSH/GSSG), and gene expression markers (e.g., SLC7A11, GSS, ACSL4, POR). Results: Aging significantly elevated histological indicators of ferroptosis, fibrosis, lipid peroxidation, and iron overload, regardless of sex. At the protein and gene levels, sex-dependent differences were evident: aged females exhibited lower MDA and GSSG levels and upregulation of antioxidant-related genes, compared with aged males. Both exercise interventions modulated ferroptosis markers, with forced exercise exerting more pronounced effects than voluntary exercise. Notably, aged females demonstrated the most substantial reductions in ferroptosis-related markers in response to forced exercise, indicating a significant sex-by-exercise interaction. Conclusion: Aging markedly increases ferroptosis-related changes in skeletal muscle, with partial sex-specific differences at the molecular level. Forced exercise provides more robust regulatory effect against ferroptosis than voluntary exercise, especially in aged females. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of sex-specific, targeted exercise interventions for mitigating ferroptosis-mediated muscle deterioration during aging.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

H.; Liang, Z.; Ren, B.; Yan, K.; Zhang, P.", "abstract": "Currently, the widely accepted approach to addressing pollen allergy primarily through altering the immune system of patients. However, the great potential of genetic engineering for downregulating allergenic proteins and reducing allergenicity is often overlooked in previous studies. Here, we report an effective solution to reducing plant allergenicity by utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) technology to calibrate levels of pan-allergenic proteins Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP 70) and Profilin 3 (PFN 3) in transgenic Arabidopsis, Tobacco, and Osmanthus. This has been shown in research to effectively mitigate and prevent allergenic reactions in humans. 21-bp long siRNA sequences encased by Polyethyleneimine modified carbon dots (PEI-CDs) are synthesized to constitute a nanoparticle-mediated delivery system to efficiently deliver small- interfering RNA (siRNA) vectors into plants. Afterwards, RNA was extracted from Osmanthus fragrans and Gardenia jasminoides and underwent reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The result indicated the expected suppression of mRNA corresponding to the targeted proteins, proving the functional aspect of RNAi in allergen suppression trunk injection and suggesting its applicability in real-life scenarios.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

G.; Faber, C. G.; Gerrits, M. M.; Smeets, H. J.; Sandoz, G.; Gasull, X.; Comes, N.", "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is commonly accompanied by hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, which is driven by regulation of several ion channels, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) that stabilize the resting membrane potential. The TWIK-Related Spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, K2p18.1) is predominantly expressed in sensory ganglia, where it provides major background K+ conductance. We describe a heterozygous c.1107del frameshift mutation in KCNK18, encoding TRESK, found in a patient with painful small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia. This C-terminal c.1107del mutant is predicted to generate an elongated C-terminal domain, with an altered protein sequence. Whole-cell patch calmp recordings showed that the c.1107del variant reduced K+ current density, while heterozygous-like expression resulted in intermediate currents, consistent with a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Confocal imaging revealed decreased plasma membrane expression, indicating a trafficking-dependent loss of function while oligomerization with TRESK (homomeric channels) or TREK1 remained intact. In silico analysis revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern and reduced C-terminal hydrophobicity in the mutant TRESK. Overall, these findings support c.1107del as a pathogenic KCNK18 variant causing TRESK haploinsufficiency, offering mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Korenek, A.; Vintila, S.; Wilmes, P.; Kleiner, M.", "abstract": "Metaproteomics characterizes and compares molecular phenotypes of organisms in communities by comprehensively analyzing their protein expression profiles using statistical methods. However, not all statistical methods are suitable for determining differentially abundant protein groups in metaproteomic analyses. Statistical challenges in metaproteomics include: data sparsity, non-normality, compositionality, and large between-sample variability. These challenges can potentially be addressed with several data processing steps, including imputation, normalization, transformation, and selection of the appropriate statistical tests. The potential combinations of different processing methods create a complex matrix of analysis options and it is currently unclear how these combinations impact the results of statistical tests on metaproteomic data. To determine what data processing methods and statistical tests are best for identifying differentially abundant proteins in metaproteomics datasets, we generated a set of thirteen metaproteomic samples with known compositions, known differences, and differing levels of complexity. These defined metaproteomes address the general challenges outlined above, using various scenarios in metaproteomic data analyses. We compared over 110 different statistical analysis combination options, including regression-based tools, general statistics inference, and machine learning techniques. Our work enables improved assessment of statistical methods for metaproteomics by establishing a framework for testing statistical approaches, including comprehensive raw mass spectrometry data and reproducible benchmarking code. We found that several combinations within the frameworks of limma, edgeR, MaAslin2, custom linear and Bayesian linear models, and random forests all offer suitable evaluation options, and highlight key recommendations for differential expression analysis in metaproteomics.", "date": "2025-12-10", "journal": ""}
