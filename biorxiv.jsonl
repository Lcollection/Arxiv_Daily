E.; Jones, C.; Kerou, M.; Sousa, F.; Hallin, S.; Biasi, C.; Schleper, C.", "abstract": "Microorganisms are key players in the global cycling of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), controlling their availability and fluxes, including the emissions of the powerful greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Characterizing the microbial functional guilds driving these processes is crucial for understanding ecosystem functioning and predicting their responses to environmental changes. Standard sequence-based characterization methods often reveal only a limited fraction of their diversity in nature because of their low relative abundance, the insufficient sequencing depth of traditional metagenomes of complex communities, and limitations in coverage of PCR-based assays. Here, we developed and tested a targeted metagenomics approach based on probe capture and hybridization to simultaneously characterize the diversity of multiple key metabolic genes involved in inorganic N and CH4 cycling. We designed comprehensive probe libraries for each of the 14 target marker genes comprising 264,000 unique probes. These probes were used to selectively enrich the target genes in shotgun metagenomic libraries. In validation experiments with the mock communities of known microorganisms, targeted metagenomics yielded gene profiles similar to those of the original communities. Only GC content had a small effect on probe efficiency, as low GC targets were less efficiently detected than those with high GC, within the mock communities. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the marker genes obtained using targeted or traditional shotgun metagenomics from agricultural and wetland soils were significantly correlated, indicating that the targeted approach did not introduce significant quantitative bias. In addition, using archaeal amoA genes as a case-study, targeted metagenomics identified substantially higher taxonomic diversity and a larger number of sequence reads per sample, yielding diversity estimates 28 or 1.24 times higher than shotgun metagenomics or amplicon sequencing, respectively. Notably, shotgun metagenomics detected only three out of the 84 amoA gene phylotypes detected using targeted metagenomics. Our results show that targeted metagenomics complements current approaches to characterize key microbial populations and functional guilds in biogeochemical cycles in different ecosystems, enabling more detailed, simultaneous characterization of multiple functional genes.\n\nManuscript contribution to the fieldMetagenomic sequencing often yields limited numbers of sequences of rare microbial taxa or functional genes, preventing in-depth analyses of specific populations and functional groups. Amplicon-based approaches enable the higher diversity coverage of target populations, but the drawback is the difficulty in designing unbiased primers that cover the highest intra-group diversity. Targeted metagenomics overcomes these challenges and results in similar community structure as traditional amplicon sequencing, while expanding the sequence space in a less biased metagenomic-based approach. Therefore, targeted metagenomics is an invaluable tool for studying the diversity of specific populations within complex natural microbiomes. Here, we present and evaluate a probe library designed for targeted metagenomics of nitrogen and methane cycling genes in complex communities.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Matrix components can be produced by the microorganisms themselves but can also originate from the environment and then be incorporated into the biofilm. For example, we and our collaborators have recently shown that collagen, a host-produced protein that is abundant in many different infection sites, can be taken up into the matrices of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, altering biofilm mechanics. In an infection, the biofilm matrix protects bacteria from clearance by the immune system, and some of that protection likely arises from the mechanical properties of the biofilm. P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia pseudomallei are human pathogens notable for forming biofilms in vitro and in vivo in tissues rich in collagen such as lung and skin. Here, we show that the incorporation of Type I collagen into P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. pseudomallei biofilms significantly enhances biofilm elasticity and hinders phagocytosis of biofilm bacteria by human neutrophils. Additionally, enzymatic degradation of collagen using collagenase reverses these effects, increasing biofilm susceptibility to neutrophils.

Examining frontal LFP and ECoG recordings from mice and macaques, these two burst types occupied the same 15 to 30 Hz frequency band yet showed minimal temporal overlap, indicating independent phenomena probably with distinct neural generators. Crucially, when task demands shifted between high and low cognitive control states, BoC bursts were enriched during demanding phases, whereas BoP bursts dominated routine phases.

Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in a non-social arthropod species, the jumping spider Phidippus regius. Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the 'interest' of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders' identities.

The role of oncogenic RAS signaling in modulating the cellular response to ferroptosis is controversial. While seminal studies described that oncogenic RAS transformation drives a synthetic lethal vulnerability to archetypal ferroptosis inducers including erastin (eradicator of RAS and ST-expressing cells) and RSL3 (Ras selective lethal 3), more recent work suggest that oncogenic RAS signaling may confer ferroptosis resistance. Thus, the impact of oncogenic RAS expression on ferroptosis sensitivity is still poorly understood. Here, using orthogonal cellular systems across multiple classes of ferroptosis-inducing agents, as well as in silico therapeutic drug-response analyses, we provide unifying evidence that oncogenic RAS signaling suppresses ferroptosis. Integrated proteo- and transcriptomic analyses in oncogenic RAS-transformed cells further uncovered that RAS signaling upregulates the ferroptosis suppressor GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) via transcriptional induction by the transcription factor ETS1 downstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. Targeted repression of Gch1 or of Gch1-controlled tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis pathway is sufficient to sensitize RAS-mutant cell lines to ferroptosis in 2D and 3D cell models, as well as in tumor organoids and tumor xenografts, highlighting a mechanism through which RAS promotes resistance to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, we found that GCH1 expression is clinically relevant and correlates with RAS signaling activation in human cancers. Overall, this study redefines oncogenic RAS signaling to be a ferroptosis suppressor, and identifies GCH1 as a mediator of this effect and a potential clinical target for the sensitization of RAS-driven cancers to ferroptosis-inducing agents.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

One hypothesis, formalized in a prominent reinforcement learning account, holds that replay plans routes to current goals. However, recent puzzling data appear to contradict this perspective by showing that replayed destinations lag current goals. These results may support an alternative hypothesis that replay updates route information to build a \"cognitive map.\" Yet no similar theory exists to formalize this view, it is unclear how such a map is represented or what role replay plays in computing it. We address these gaps by introducing a theory of replay that learns a map of routes to candidate goals, before reward is available or when its location may change. Replay is then focused on current goals (as with planning) and/or potential future goals (like a map), depending on the animal's expectations about future goal switching. Our work thus generalizes the planning account to capture a general map-building function for replay, reconciling it with data, and revealing an unexpected relationship between the seemingly distinct hypotheses. The theory offers a unifying explanation why data from tasks with different goal dynamics have seemingly supported different hypotheses for the function of replay, and suggests new predictions for experiments testing these effects.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) is traditionally considered a brain region that functions as an interface between processing visual inputs and generating eye movement outputs. Although its role as a primary reflex center is thought to be conserved across vertebrate species, evidence suggests that the SC has evolved to support higher-order cognitive functions including spatial attention. When it comes to oculomotor areas such as the SC, it is critical that high precision fixation and eye movements are maintained even in the presence of signals related to ongoing changes in cognition and brain state, both of which have the potential to interfere with eye position encoding and movement generation. In this study, we recorded spiking responses of neuronal populations in the SC while monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task and found that the activity of some of the neurons fluctuated over tens of minutes. By leveraging the statistical power afforded by high-dimensional neuronal recordings, we were able to identify a low-dimensional pattern of activity that was correlated with the subjects' arousal levels. Importantly, we found that the spiking responses of deep-layer SC neurons were less correlated with this brain-wide arousal signal, and that neural activity associated with changes in pupil size and saccade tuning did not overlap in population activity space with movement initiation signals. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for understanding how signals related to cognition and arousal can be embedded in the population activity of oculomotor structures without compromising the fidelity of the motor output.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

RecA{middle dot}ATP binds and cooperatively polymerises in a 50-nucleotide (nt) poly deoxy T (dT)50 ssDNA to form a dynamic filament with SSB competing for binding, but B. subtilis DprA (DprABsu) counters the inhibitory effects of SSB on RecA{middle dot}ATP filaments.

The increasing pace of sequencing technology development has made solving this challenge in a high-throughput manner even more important. Functional metagenomics offer a sequence-naive and cultivation-independent solution. Unfortunately, most methods for constructing functional metagenomic libraries require large input masses of metagenomic DNA, putting many sample types out of reach. Here, we show that our functional metagenomic library preparation method, METa assembly, can be used to prepare useful libraries from much lower input DNA quantities. Standard methods of functional metagenomic library preparation generally call for 5 ug to 60 ug of input metagenomic DNA. We demonstrate that the threshold for input DNA mass can be lowered at least to 30.5 ng, a three-log decrease from prior art. We prepared functional metagenomic libraries using between 30.5 ng and 100 ng of metagenomic DNA, and found that, despite their limited input mass, they were sufficient to link MFS transporters lacking substrate-specific annotations to tetracycline resistance and to capture a gene encoding a sequence novel GNAT family acetyltransferase that represents a new streptothricin acetyltransferase, satB.

We investigated the influence of the nucleus by reconstituting cell cycle oscillations in droplets of frog egg extract in the absence or presence of a nuclear compartment and monitoring dynamics by time-lapse microscopy. We found that the cell cycle time increased in the presence of nuclei, which grew larger with each cell cycle. The correlation between increasing nuclear volume and a longer cell cycle period was maintained across extracts and nuclei from various Xenopus species and persisted upon inhibition of DNA replication or transcription. However, inhibition of nuclear import or the kinase Wee1 impacted the relationship between the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and the cell cycle period. To conceptually capture these experimental observations, we developed a computational model that incorporates cell cycle oscillations, nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization, and periodic nuclear envelope breakdown and reformation.

We previously identified an enigmatic population of IL-10 producing CCR6+B-helper T-cells and investigated here their relationship to Th17-cells and STAT3 signalling requirements. Methods: Human blood lymphocytes were analysed by multiparametric flow cytometry in healthy donors and AD-HIES patients. Analysis was performed by conventional gating or with bioinformatic tools. FACS-purified T-cell subsets were activated in vitro and Th17 differentiation assessed. T-cell antigen specificities were assessed by activation with heat-killed pathogens or antigenic peptide pools. B helper capacities were determined according to antibody secretion in B-T co-cultures by ELISA. Results: CCR6+Th-cells that lacked subset-defining differentiation markers were mostly non-polarised central memory T-cells (TCM) that produced IL-10 and expressed RORgt. They were pre-committed to a Th17 fate, since TCR stimulation in the absence of polarising cytokines induced efficient Th17 differentiation. The latter was promoted by an autocrine loop of STAT3-activating cytokines. CCR6+Th-cells were reduced in patients with DN-STAT3 mutations but contained activated CCR6+TCM that produced IL-10 and responded vigorously to AD-HIES-associated pathogens. These residual CCR6+Th-cells provided B-cell help for IgG and IgE production. Conclusions: Th17 differentiation in AD-HIES patients was not completely impaired but arrested at an intermediate stage of IL-10 producing pre-Th17-cells.

However, the mechanical influence of membrane curvature on these elastic filaments has largely been ignored. A previous model was proposed to describe how the anchoring process may control the deflection of individual microtubules seeking to minimize bending on a cylindrical cell. We incorporate this process into a model of interacting microtubules and find the cell curvature influence to be significant: the array favours orientations parallel to the direction of elongation rather than the expected transverse direction. Even without elasticity, the geometry of large cells hinders robust microtubule organization. These results suggest the necessity of additional processes to overcome these factors.

These newly identified ORFs are embedded within annotated sequences, both coding and non-coding, and reveal layers of overlapping genetic information. We here report the discovery of MTALTCO1, a 259 amino-acid protein, the longest mitochondrial alternative protein identified to date, encoded by an ORF located within the human cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, in the +3 reading frame. We confirm the expression and mitochondrial origin of MTALTCO1 through multiple independent lines of evidence, including a custom-designed antibody, mass spectrometry-derived peptides, sequence analysis, and inhibitors of mitochondrial expression. Despite encoding AGR codons as arginine, contrary to the prevailing view that these function as stop codons in the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, MTALTCO1 shows strong evidence of mitochondrial translation, challenging established models of mitochondrial codon usage and gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitations and pull-down assays delineate MTALTCO1's interaction landscape across major cellular pathways. Lastly, we present the first in-depth analysis of conservation for a mitochondrial alternative ORF overlapping a reference protein-coding gene and discuss the results in light of MTALTCO1's suggested role in protein scaffolding.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, the brain is fundamentally a rhythmic and dynamical system, and how disrupted neural synchronization underlies USN remains unknown. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs; 3 - 30 Hz flicker) in stroke patients with USN, without USN, and healthy controls. Only the USN group exhibited significant hemispheric asymmetry at 9 Hz, driven by exaggerated responses in the intact hemisphere rather than suppression in the lesioned hemisphere. This effect appeared only during stimulation, not at rest, indicating its specificity to sensory processing. The enhanced 9 Hz entrainment in the intact hemisphere was accompanied by increased phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha phase and gamma amplitude, reflecting systematic coordination of high-frequency activity. Transfer entropy analysis further revealed increased feedforward information flow from the right visual to the left frontal cortex, highlighting large-scale asymmetry. To explore the mechanism underlying this frequency-specific bias, we implemented a coupled-oscillator model. The model showed that the hemispheric asymmetry arises from resonance between intrinsic alpha rhythms and external input, amplified by asymmetric right-to-left interhemispheric coupling. These findings suggest that USN arises from a selective impairment of alpha-band synchrony capacity. This study offers a novel framework conceptualizing USN as a disorder of disrupted oscillatory dynamics underlying spatial attention, and points toward frequency-specific neuromodulatory intervention as a potential therapeutic approach.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses of the retina, these local Ca2+ signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis, endocytosis, and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites for sustained neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca2+ signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca2+ indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca2+ transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). We observed that a Ca2+ transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca2+ indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca2+ indicator, and the estimated Ca2+ levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 M in response to a 10-millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca2+ indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca2+ diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca2+] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca2+ levels may vary between ribbons of different RBCs and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca2+ signals is found to correlate with ribbon size and active zone extent.

Many types of TreMs are associated to large old trees and show slow ontogenical processes. The rarity of such TreMs (particularly in intensively managed forests) hinder the estimation of their occurrence rate along tree growth. Here, we used a continental meta-analysis on TreMs occurrence rate along tree growth to build informative priors for a model of trunk-base rot-hole occurrence on oaks within the Gresigne forest, France --- a context where stand management and tree DBH were confounded. We explored whether the use of informative priors could improve the identifiability, the precision of estimates and the predictive abilities of the model. Without prior information, the low variance of tree DBH within management modalities rendered the model poorly identifiable and prevented the detection of an effect of tree DBH per se across the range of explored tree DBH. By contrast, using informative priors contributed to improve the precision of estimates and lead to detecting a positive effect of tree DBH per se. Informative priors did not degrade the model fit and clearly improved predictive abilities on new stands. In particular, while the model without prior information did not predict the occurrence of trunk-base rot-holes significantly better than a purely random guess, the model with informative priors did. Irrespective of the prior used, models suggested that the high recruitment of trunk-base rot-holes in Gresigne may be a temporary management effect in stands undergoing conversion from coppice-with-standards to high forest through sprout thinning, which will lead to conservation issues for cavicolous saproxylic species when all conversions are complete. Because using informative priors was simple and beneficial in our study, it should be further explored in other local applied contexts to orientate forest management.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Invasive alien species pose a growing threat to global biodiversity, underscoring the need for evidence-based prevention strategies. Species distribution models (SDMs) are a widely used tool to estimate the potential distribution of alien species and to inform blacklists based on establishment risk. Yet, data limitations and modelling decisions can introduce uncertainty in these predictions. Here, we aim to quantify the contribution of four key sources of uncertainty in SDM-based blacklists: species occurrence data, environmental predictors, SDM algorithms, and thresholding methods for binarising predictions. 2. Focusing on 82 of the most invasive plant species on the Hawaiian Islands, we built SDMs to quantify their establishment potential in the Pacific region. To assess uncertainty, we systematically varied four modelling components: species occurrence data (native vs. global), environmental predictors (climatic vs. edapho-climatic), four SDM algorithms, and three thresholding methods. From these models, we derived blacklists using three alternative blacklisting definitions and quantified the variance in establishment risk scores and resulting species rankings attributable to each source of uncertainty. 3. SDMs showed fair predictive performance overall. Among the sources of uncertainty, thresholding method had the strongest and most consistent influence on risk scores across all three blacklist definitions but resulted in only minor changes in blacklist rankings. In contrast, algorithm choice had the most pronounced effect on blacklist rankings, followed by smaller but important effects of species occurrence data and environmental predictors. Notably, models based only on native occurrences often underestimated establishment potential. 4. SDMs can provide valuable support for planning the preventive management of alien species. However, our findings show that blacklist outcomes are highly sensitive to modelling decisions. While ensemble modelling across multiple algorithms is a recommended best practice, our results reinforce the importance of incorporating global occurrence data when available and carefully evaluating the trade-offs of including additional environmental predictors. Given the strong influence of thresholding on risk scores, we emphasise the need for transparent, context-specific threshold selection. More broadly, explicitly assessing uncertainty in SDM outputs can improve the robustness of blacklists and support scientifically informed, precautionary decision-making, particularly in data-limited situations where pragmatic modelling choices must be taken.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Although complex physiological processes usually involve dozens of enzymes, empirically it is found that the rates of these processes often obey the Arrhenius equation, which was originally derived for single-enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Here we have examined the temperature scaling of the early embryonic cell cycle, with the goal of understanding why the Arrhenius equation approximately holds and why it breaks down at temperature extremes. Using experimental data from Xenopus laevis, Xenopus tropicalis, and Danio rerio, plus published data from Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Drosophila melanogaster, we find that the apparent activation energies (Ea values) for the early embryonic cell cycle for diverse ectotherms are all similar, 75 +/- 7 kJ/mol (mean +/- S.D., n = 6), which corresponds to a Q10 value of 2.8 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- S.D., n = 6). Using computational models, we find that the approximately Arrhenius scaling and the deviations from the Arrhenius relationship at high and low temperatures can be accounted for by biphasic temperature scaling in critical individual components of the cell cycle oscillator circuit, by imbalances in the Ea values for different partially rate determining enzymes, or by a combination of both. Experimental studies of cycling Xenopus extracts indicate that both of these mechanisms contribute to the general scaling of temperature, and in vitro studies of individual cell cycle regulators confirm that there is in fact a substantial imbalance in their Ea values. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay between temperature and complex biochemical processes, and into why biological systems fail at extreme temperatures.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

We previously presented an algorithm for optimizing TI using two arrays of electrodes and showed that it can achieve more focal stimulation compared to optimized high-definition transcranial electrical stimulation (HD-TES) and conventional optimized TI using two pairs of electrodes, especially in the deep brain areas such as the hippocampus. However, those modeling studies were only performed on an averaged head (MNI152 template) and three individual heads without exploring inter-individual variability. Existing TI works in the literature mostly utilize a common (possibly optimized) montage of two pairs of electrodes on different individual heads without considering inter-individual variability. Material and method: Here we aim to study the inter-individual variability of optimized TI by applying the same optimization algorithms on N = 25 heads using their individualized head models. Specifically, we compared the focality achieved by different stimulation techniques at six different regions of interest (ROI; right hippocampus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left motor cortex, right amygdala, right caudate, and left thalamus) under both individually optimized and unoptimized montages. We also conducted numerical sensitivity analysis on the individual optimization and performed phantom recordings to test our models. Results: As expected, there is a variability in focality achieved by TI of up to 1.2 cm at the same ROI across subjects due to inter-individual differences in the head anatomy and tissue conductivity. We show that optimized TI using two arrays of electrodes achieves higher focality than that from optimized HD-TES at the same level of modulation intensity at 5 of the 6 ROIs. Compared to using a common montage either optimized from the MNI152 template or from the literature, individually optimized TI using two pairs of electrodes improves the focality by up to 4.4 cm, and by up to 1.1 cm if using two arrays of electrodes. Focality achieved by the individual optimization is sensitive to random changes and can vary up to 9.3 cm due to the non-lienarity of TI physics. Experimental recordings on a head phantom confirms the drop in TI stimulation strength when using unoptimized montages as predicted by our in silico models. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the need of individually optimizing TI to target deep brain areas, and advocates against using a common head model and montage for TI modeling and experimental studies.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

To address this limitation, we present Phyla. Phyla introduces a hybrid state-space and transformer architecture that jointly process multiple sequences and is trained using a tree-based objective over 3,000 phylogenies spanning diverse protein families. Phyla achieves state-of-the-art performance in evolutionary reasoning, outperforming the next-best model by 13% on tree reconstruction and 10% on taxonomic clustering. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, Phyla applies to real-world settings: it reconstructs biologically accurate branches of the tree of life and infers whole-genome evolutionary relationships from Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. These findings suggest that evolutionary reasoning is not an emergent property of large-scale sequence modeling. Instead, Phyla shows that models trained with phylogenetic supervision can reason about evolution more effectively, offering a biologically grounded path toward evolutionary foundation models.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a central role in mammalian non-shivering thermogenesis, dissipating mitochondrial membrane potentials through the activity of uncoupling protein UCP1 to release heat. Inner membranes of mitochondria are known to be permeable to potassium ions (K+), which enter the matrix either through ATP-sensitive channels (MitoKATP) or leakage across the bilayer driven by inner membrane potentials. Mitochondrial K+ influx is associated with increased osmotic pressure, promoting water influx and increasing matrix volume. Since BAT mitochondria have lower inner membrane potentials due to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activity, we hypothesized this could involve compensatory changes in MitoKATP activity, and thus tested MitoKATP involvement in brown adipocyte activities under basal and stimulated conditions. We find that cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation in mice modulate BAT MitoK levels, the channel portion of MitoKATP. Genetic ablation of the gene that codes for the pore-forming subunit of MitoKATP in human pre-adipocytes decreased cellular respiration and proliferation, compromising differentiation into mature adipocytes. In mouse cell lines, the absence of the protein limited cellular oxygen consumption in the precursor stage, but not in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of MitoKATP in mature adipocytes increased adrenergic-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that shutdown of this pathway is important for full BAT thermogenesis. Similarly, MitoKATP inhibition increased oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria isolated from mice treated with beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MitoKATP regulates differentiation and metabolism of brown adipocytes, impacting on thermogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that telomerase insertion of 6-thio-dGTP prevents synthesis of additional telomeric repeats but does not disrupt telomerase binding to telomeres. Specifically, 6-thio-dG inhibits telomere extension after telomerase translocates along its product DNA to reposition the template, inducing a non-productive complex rather than enzyme dissociation. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that 6-thio-dG treatment inhibits telomere synthesis by telomerase in cancer cells. In agreement, telomerase-expressing cancer cells harboring critically short telomeres are more sensitive to 6-thio-dG and show a greater induction of telomere losses compared to cancer cells with long telomere reserves.

We focus on signaling to the nucleus stimulated by three different Gs-coupled GPCRs that are each endogenously co-expressed in human embryonic kidney cells but differ in their ability to internalize after activation: the adenosine-2B receptor that does not detectably internalize, the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor-1 that internalizes very rapidly, and the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor that internalizes less rapidly. We show that each GPCR produces a distinct signaling profile differentiated by endocytosis. Our results support a model in which endocytosis compresses chemical information sensed by distinct GPCRs into a spatiotemporal cAMP code by setting receptor-specific differences in the amount and duration of cAMP production from endosomes relative to the plasma membrane and that this is \"decoded\" downstream in the pathway through sequential layers of processing by cytoplasmic and nuclear PKA activities.

Analyses in the chick have identified key molecular candidates for the confinement of CNCC migration to stereotypical pathways as Colec12, Trail, and Dan. The effects of these factors on CNCCs in vitro are known, but how they confine migration to discrete streams in vivo remains poorly-understood. Here, we propose and test several hypothetical mechanisms by which these factors confine cell streams and maintain coherent migration, simulating an expanded agent-based model for collective CNCC migration. Model simulations suggest that Trail enhances adhesion between CNCCs, facilitating movement towards stereotypical migratory pathways, whereas Colec12 confines CNCCs by inducing longer, branched filopodia that facilitate movement down Colec12 gradients and re-connections with streams. Moreover, we find that Trail and Colec12 facilitate the exchange of CNCCs and the formation of CNCC-bridges between adjacent streams that are observed in vivo but poorly-understood mechanistically. Finally, we predict that Dan increases the coherence of streams by modulating the speed of CNCCs at the leading edge of collectives to prevent escape.

While most seizures are self-limiting, those lasting over five minutes, termed status epilepticus, require medical intervention. Benzodiazepines, the first-line treatment, terminate seizures by enhancing GABAergic inhibition, but fail in approximately 36% of cases. In this paper, we employ a neural mass framework to investigate how different interventions influence brain dynamics and facilitate seizure termination. As seizures are characterized by persistent firing, we extend the classic Wilson-Cowan framework by introducing a term called sustenance which encodes factors that promote or discourage perpetual firing. The resulting model captures transitions between normal activity and seizure and provides a tractable framework for analysing diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. We first show how various dysfunctions - such as hyperexcitation, depletion of inhibitory neurotransmitters, and depolarizing GABAergic transmission - can all give rise to seizures, with overlapping but distinct dynamics. Building on this foundation, we turn to the central question of intervention: how different treatments act on these mechanisms to terminate seizures. We find that while enhancing GABAergic inhibition is generally effective, it fails when GABA becomes depolarizing. In such cases, interventions like levetiracetam that suppress sustained excitatory activity remain effective. These findings highlight the importance of aligning interventions to the specific underlying dysfunction for effective seizure termination.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, methods that can resolve cell-type identity in a principled way, while simultaneously scaling to thousands of neurons, are currently lacking. Here, we introduce spikeMAP, a pipeline for the analysis of large-scale recordings of in vitro cortical activity that not only allows for the detection of spikes produced by single neurons (spike sorting), but also allows for the reliable distinction between genetically determined cell types by utilizing viral and optogenetic strategies as ground-truth validation. This approach tightly integrates the data analysis pipeline to an optogenetic, viral, and pharmacological protocol allowing for the dynamical probing of distinct cell-types while simultaneously recording from large populations. The novelty of spikeMAP is to combine a stream of well-established analysis techniques in an end-to-end fashion, creating a unified framework as follows. First, individual spike waveforms are fitted by spline interpolation to estimate their half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations. These values are then entered in a principal component analysis with k-means clustering to identify uncorrelated signals from single channels on the array. Optimal separability of clusters is assessed by linear discriminant analysis. Finally, each channels source location is identified using spatiotemporal characteristics of spike waveforms across the array. We show that spikeMAP can resolve cell type identity in high-density arrays by analyzing activity monitored from mouse prefrontal cortex in vitro slices with an array of 4,096 closely-spaced channels. Using an optotagging functional strategy, we show an effective distinction of regular-spiking excitatory neurons from fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons using measures of action potential waveform, Fano factor, and spatially-dependent cross-correlations. In sum, the approach introduces a toolbox, validated by an experimental pipeline, that allows for a comprehensive characterization of neuronal activity obtained from different cell-types in high-density multielectrode recordings.

Two-component systems, which are widespread in bacteria, are key regulators of antibiotic production in Streptomyces species, yet their activating signals remain poorly understood. CutRS was the first two-component system identified in the genus Streptomyces and deletion of cutRS in Streptomyces coelicolor was shown to enhance antibiotic production, although its CutR regulon does not include any biosynthetic genes. Here, we used Streptomyces venezuelae to further investigate CutRS function. We show that deletion of cutRS leads to an increase in growth rate and a reversal of the typical glucose-mediated carbon catabolite repression typically observed in Streptomyces species. We also demonstrate that CutR DNA binding is glucose-dependent, but CutR does not directly regulate genes involved in growth, antibiotic biosynthesis, or glucose metabolism. The only CutR targets conserved in both S. coelicolor and S. venezuelae are the foldase genes htrA3 and htrB, which are involved in the protein secretion stress response. Consistent with this, we show that CutS homologues all contain two conserved cysteine residues in their extracellular sensor domains and that changing these residues to serine constitutively activates S. venezuelae CutRS. We propose that failure of a disulfide bond to form between these cysteine residues indicates secretion stress and leads to activation of the CutRS system and the secretion stress response.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Using an infection model based on human airway epithelial cells, cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI), we simulated the infection process of P. aeruginosa to investigate the colonization dynamics and virulence potential during infection in ALI models from non-CF and CF donors, and the BCi-NS1.1 cell line. Infections by reference strains and clinical isolates from pwCF revealed four infection clusters based on virulence, epithelial damage, and localization within the epithelium, in a strain-specific manner regardless of the type of ALI model or clonal lineage. Modulator treatment to restore CFTR channel function did not change infection patterns in CF ALI models.

Existing LBCE predictors rely on having access to large volumes of data from a wide range of pathogens to train generalist predictive models, which can result in biases towards widely studied organisms and compromise performance when focusing on neglected or emerging pathogens. We introduce EpitopeTransfer, a phylogeny-aware transfer learning strategy that results in noticeable gains in expected predictive performance.

However, most balance models depend on a model of the base-of-support (BOS) of the feet to calculate how well someone is balancing. Here, we evaluate the functional base-of-support (fBOS) during standing: the convex polygon on the bottom of the foot that can support a large fraction of the body's weight. First, we develop a geometric model of the fBOS by measuring the center-of-pressure (COP) and kinematic data of the feet of 27 younger adults instructed to move their body in large loops without taking a step. Next, we extract a planar convex polygon that contains the COP data. Finally, we compare the area of this fBOS model to a marker-based BOS model before evaluating if the fBOS differs across four common conditions: footwear, stance-width, foot dominance, and during single and double-stance. We found that the fBOS is much smaller (23% the size) than a marker-based BOS model. Our analysis suggests that using the fBOS, rather than a marker-based BOS, can improve the accuracy of the margin-of-stability by 20% of foot width and 16% of the length. In addition, we found that the fBOS area does not differ across footwear (p=0.88), stance-width (p=0.88), and foot dominance (p=0.68), but during single stance, the fBOS is 17% (p=0.0003) larger than during double-stance.

IDP/IDRs are heterogenous, existing in a conformational ensemble of various interconnected states without a definitive tertiary structure. The high dynamicity of IDPs/IDRs limits ensemble protein characterisation techniques from capturing their properties, and measurements at the single-molecule level are hampered by the necessity to label the protein or modify its microenvironment, affecting their biophysics. Consequently, our understanding of IDPs/IDRs is limited, translating to a lack of knowledge of their roles in related diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various cancers. This work presents the first experimental observation of unmodified IDP/IDR conformational dynamics in vitro, at the single-molecule level in real time, achieved by trapping individual IDPs/IDRs in a nanoscale volume using nanoaperture optical tweezers. Our results reveal that IDPs/IDRs exhibit significantly larger conformational variations in solution compared to globular proteins of similar size, as expected. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of native tau-441 by glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3{beta}-tau) induces compaction and reduced conformational dynamics. We further observed a disorder-to-order transition during binding of an IDR, the N-terminal region of Src-associated protein in mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68), to G8.5 RNA.

Phages interact dynamically with their prokaryotic hosts and play a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of microbial communities. Previous approaches for inferring phage-host interactions (PHIs) from metagenomic data are constrained by low sensitivity and the inability to accurately capture ecological relationships. To overcome these limitations, we developed PHILM (Phage-Host Interaction Learning from Metagenomic profiles), a deep learning framework that predicts PHIs directly from the taxonomic profiles of metagenomic data. We validated PHILM on both synthetic datasets generated by ecological models and real-world data, finding that it consistently outperformed the co-abundance-based approach for inferring PHIs. When applied to a large-scale metagenomic dataset comprising 7,016 stool samples from healthy individuals, PHILM identified 90% more genus-level PHIs than the traditional assembly-based approach. In a longitudinal dataset tracking PHI dynamics, PHILM's latent representations recapitulated microbial succession patterns originally described using taxonomic abundances. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PHILM's latent representations served as more discriminative features than taxonomic abundance-based features for disease classifications. In summary, PHILM represents a novel computational framework for predicting phage-host interactions from metagenomic data, offering valuable insights for both microbiome science and translational medicine.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Mirroring some well characterized effects of gestational challenges in rodents, maternal immune activation (MIA) during the lactational period disrupts maternal physiology, decreases milk quality, and is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. This occurs without MIA significantly affecting maternal care. While gestational MIA models are responsive to environmental interventions, which beneficially alter maternal milk composition and associated offspring outcomes, the milk-borne mediators underlying resilience remain poorly understood. Given their ability to transport and deposit biologically active cargos, we propose that milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) are vehicles that deliver environmental programming signals (e.g., miRNAs) from nursing mothers to their offspring. Using a rat model, we show that lactational MIA altered MEV miRNA cargo and expression of hippocampal miRNAs in offspring. Several miRNAs in MEVs were also found in the hippocampus of matching offspring. Remarkably, the miRNA dysregulation observed in MEVs and hippocampus was rescued when dams were raised in an enriched environment, suggesting environmental enrichment protected from the effects of MIA, as also observed in the behavioral phenotype. RNA-seq of adult offspring hippocampus showed long-term transcriptional changes associated with the gene targets of early-life regulated miRNAs. Our results position MEV miRNA cargos as dynamic programming signals by which maternal experience is communicated to offspring, encoding both stress-induced and protective cues that influence development. This suggests that breastfeeding interventions can regulate the genetic cargo of the milk, programming the life of developing infants.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

By evaluating widely used gene clustering and pangenome tools, we observe how clustering thresholds (often hard-coded and provided without explanation) and paralog handling impact gene family composition. Parameters unrelated to clustering thresholds, such as decimal precision (0.8 vs. 0.80), output selection, and even CPU and memory allocation, are demonstrated to alter gene family assignments, in striking contrast to the standard assumption that broadly the same parameter values will yield consistent results. Additionally, tools often fail to report biologically meaningful or representative sequences for gene families, leading to misguided downstream analyses. This work highlights key limitations in current gene clustering and pangenome methodologies, demonstrating their potential to influence biological interpretations.

For example, in 10g to 10kg birds flight speed increases with scale while wingbeat frequency decreases. Existing hypotheses propose that aerodynamic and biomechanical factors may drive these trends. Predictive simulation models have used these drivers to computationally synthesize flying birds. However, only a small number of species have been simulated and so this approach has not explained the kinematic trends observed across different scales of birds.\n\nThis work uses predictive models to synthesize flight across all scales and shows that profile drag of the avian aerofoil is the key physical driver of self-selected kinematics. Profile drag causes the monotonic increase in flapping speed across scales and the near-constant ratio of flapping speed to flight speed (Strouhal number). The most efficient kinematics minimize Strouhal number to minimize the cost of transport, with the minimum cost of transport being bounded by the aerofoil maximum lift-to-drag ratio. The decrease of wingbeat frequency and increase of wing elevation amplitude with scale are attributable to balancing induced drag and the lateral component of profile drag.\n\nThe modular models presented provide transparency in understanding how modelling choices influence flight predictions.

Macrophages, as central components of the innate immune system, play critical roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to infections. Here, we find that aging induces sex-specific remodeling of peritoneal macrophage transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes. Consistently, peritoneal macrophages undergo sex-specific functional remodeling with aging (i.e. female-specific phagocytic decline and metabolic rewiring). Modulation of gonadal hormone signaling showed that changes in circulating estrogen levels likely contribute to aspects of female-specific macrophage age-related changes. Importantly, multi-omic analysis identified candidate transcription factors whose sex-specific age-regulated expression may drive aspects of sex-specific 'omic' remodeling with aging. Specifically, Irf2 downregulation in female macrophages recapitulates distinct transcriptomic and metabolic aspects of macrophage female aging phenotypes.

S.", "abstract": "Movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease, happen because of unusual patterns in the connections between the cortex and basal ganglia, often caused by timing issues in feedback pathways. This study uses a two-delay nonlinear dynamic model, based on the delayed the van der Pol oscillator, to examine how delays in the feedback loops of the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways lead to unusual movement patterns and resonance. A thorough analysis of resonance looks at how the ratios of delays and the time it takes to respond affect the system's frequency, showing when internal resonance occurs and how frequency stabilizes under different conditions. We examine how stable the system is by looking at changes in its behavior and measuring the Lyapunov exponent across distinct types of nonlinear feedback setups. Simulations demonstrate transitions from stable oscillations to chaos with varying delays and saturation strength. Our results reproduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as resting tremor, dyskinesia, and freezing, demonstrating how delayed inhibition or hyperactivity destabilizes motor function. The discussion supports these findings, indicating that early problems start in the striatum, with complex effects in the globus pallidus that worsen motor symptoms. This model explains the temporal evolution of Parkinson's disease symptoms and highlights the timing of feedback and saturation as key therapeutic targets. Overall, this research offers a biological explanation for motor problems caused by delays and supports novel approaches for brain stimulation using flexible methods.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted a metagenomic survey of microbial diversity in three ponds - Vermelha, Grande, and Furnas - situated within the Atlantic Rainforest biome in Brazil. Vermelha and Grande are natural, remote, and minimally impacted by human activity, whereas Furnas is an artificial pond with greater human accessibility. Using a long-read nanopore shotgun metagenomics approach, we sequenced DNA extracted from pond water, assembled metagenomes, and performed taxonomic classification and functional annotation. Furthermore, 21 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered. Our results reveal pond-specific microbial community structures and functional profiles. Although direct comparison between the ponds would require more samples across the same time period, the microbial snapshots provided attest the striking biodiversity contained within ponds, the current data offer compelling snapshots of microbial diversity. Vermelha was characterized by high abundance of Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetota, while Furnas displayed broader taxonomic diversity, and more notable Actinobacteria and Patescibacteria. Viral communities, including dsDNA bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, also varied across sites, with only Prasinovirus consistently detected in all ponds. Functional annotation identified putative antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), most of them in Furnas, potentially reflecting human impact. Besides ARGs, cyanotoxin biosynthesis genes, especially those linked to microcystin production, were predominantly found in Vermelha. Our findings underscore the ecological distinctiveness of each pond and demonstrate the utility of nanopore-based metagenomics for investigating microbial biodiversity in understudied freshwater ecosystems. This work provides knowledge on microbial community structure and anthropogenic influence in tropical pond environments, with implications for conservation and biotechnological exploration.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

We used three of the phages to deplete another Variovorax, SCN45, from complex communities to test correlation network-based hypotheses of thiamine interdependencies. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that specific taxa decreased in relative abundance following Variovorax depletion and could be rescued by thiamine supplementation.

Genetic monitoring has become essential for detecting fragmentation and tracking its progress. However, the coherent interpretation of genetic monitoring data and understanding the genetic consequences of fragmentation require frameworks that accurately represent real-world complexity. Existing theoretical frameworks typically rely on simplified spatial structures and do not adequately capture the heterogeneous migration patterns of natural populations. Here, we integrate network theory and mathematical population genetics to develop a framework for studying the genetic consequences of fragmentation processes, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous connectivity and temporal dynamics. We apply this framework to examine how different fragmentation processes affect genetic measures commonly used in genetic monitoring. We find that different fragmentation scenarios produce substantially distinct trajectories in key genetic measures, sometimes exhibiting rapid transitional dynamics, suggesting that the interpretation of genetic monitoring data must be tailored to ecological contexts. Furthermore, fragmentation can cause deviations from classical theoretical expectations, such as the expected correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance) or between genetic diversity and connectivity. Finally, we propose and demonstrate detectable early warning signals in genetic monitoring data that precede rapid transitional phases. Our framework thus provides a practical interpretation of genetic monitoring data, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical models and real-world connectivity dynamics.\n\nSignificance StatementLandscape fragmentation threatens the persistence of species worldwide. Genetic monitoring is often used to track the genetic health of populations, but the relationship between real-world landscape connectivity and genetic measures remains difficult to model. Here, we integrate network theory with mathematical population genetics to develop a framework that addresses this challenge and enables interpretation of genetic measures along fragmentation processes in networks. We show that different fragmentation scenarios can generate qualitatively different genetic outcomes and violate classical population genetic principles. We also demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify early warning signals in genetic monitoring data before populations suffer significant declines in genetic health. Our framework bridges population genetic theory and conservation practice.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

More than 1,200 metabolite features were detected in methanolic extracts of pea seed flours. Of these, nearly 300 features were identified using mass spectral libraries and advanced computational tools. Approximately 40 metabolites were found to be associated with location effect, independent of cultivar type. Organically grown pea samples showed lower level of the main pea triterpene glycoside soyasaponin I and higher levels of nitrogen-abundant amino acids indicating increased nitrogen availability in soil. More than 100 metabolites were associated with the location-independent cultivar effect. Two cultivars resistant to downy mildew and pea wilt, Akooma and Greenway, showed the most distinct metabolome with greater levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and lipid oxidation products known to give  beany off-flavors. The most commonly cultivated pea variety, Ingrid, had significantly lower levels or was completely devoid of hydroxycinnamic acid amides such as caffeoyl, feruloyl, and coumaroyl aspartates that were present in all other cultivars. Three chloroauxin metabolites, reported here for the first time, were identified through molecular networking within GNPS platform and propagation of annotation from a computationally predicted indole-3-acetic acid catabolite.

Improved colour learning has been demonstrated using differential conditioning with reward-aversion paradigms in insects like wasps, bumblebees, and honeybees, where substances that induce strong aversion, such as quinine, enable more accurate discrimination. Although learning outcomes of differential conditioning are closely tied to the perceived reward and aversion, few studies have compared the role of negative reinforcements in shaping associations, and their relevance across insect groups.\n\nIn our study, we compare the role of aversive substances for differential in the hummingbird hawkmoth, Macroglossum stellatarum, a diurnal moth that relies on vision for foraging. Tying to previous learning studies in insects, we paired a sugar-rewarded target with a distractor that was paired with either quinine, salt, citric acid, water, or was presented with no aversive substance. Learning outcomes were compared by inverting a strong colour preference between perceptually close or distant colour pairs, to provide tasks with disparate challenges. Contrary to results from other insect species, we found that moths trained with quinine were worse at switching preferences between similar colours compared to training with citric acid and appetitive-only differential conditioning. We also show that quinine interferes with sucrose perception, potentially impairing target acquisition during training. Additionally, we link differences in the learning arising from the negative reinforcements to their impact on exploration during foraging.

However, while the influence of sporulation temperature on spore behaviour has been widely studied, the data concerning the influence of other factors such as water activity (aw) is scarce. We reported that reducing the aw of the sporulation medium from the optimum (aw 0.99; Scontrol spores) to 0.98, using sodium chloride (Ssalt spores) increased their wet heat resistance, yet by unknown means. The present work aimed to examine the mechanism behind the increased wet heat resistance observed in the spores produced in the presence of high salinity.\n\nCrust morphogenetic protein CotY was required for the increased wet heat resistance observed in spores of Bacillus subtilis formed in the presence of salt. Interestingly, this protein was also related to increased H2O2 resistance. Proteomic analysis of coat extracts from Ssalt and Scontrol spores revealed markedly different protein profiles. Specifically, Ssalt spores displayed significant increase in abundance of proteins involved in redox homeostasis, structure of the coat and also, others involved in favouring or establish cross-linking. Increased cross-linking, such as disulfide bond formation in the coat and the cysteine-rich crust is known to influence resistance to both agents. Furthermore, deletion of CotY increased DPH lipid probe mobility regardless of sporulation condition, indicating that it plays an active role in stabilizing the IM. Therefore, all the presented data suggested that increased coat cross-link directly or indirectly related to CotY in Ssalt grants enhanced wet heat resistance by protecting the IM, which was supported by DPA release data under lethal heat stress.

PHTS individuals display heterogeneity in phenotypes, which has been linked in part to the diverse genetic alterations in the PTEN gene and the multifaceted functions of this protein. Indeed, while PTEN primarily functions as a PIP3 lipid phosphatase in the cytosol, regulating PI3K/AKT signalling, a pathway commonly deregulated in cancer, it also plays crucial roles in maintaining chromosomal stability through nuclear activities such as double strand (ds) DNA damage repair. Recent studies have identified a subset of missense PHTS variants that cause nuclear exclusion of PTEN, impairing its nuclear functions. Here, we present our findings from one such pathogenic variant, PTEN-R173C, frequently found in PHTS and somatic cancers. Using cell biological and mouse modelling approaches, we show that PTEN-R173C has higher PIP3 phosphatase activity than wild-type PTEN, resulting in effective regulation of canonical PI3K/AKT signalling. However, PTEN-R173C is unstable and excluded from the nucleus. Aligning with their near normal PI3K/AKT signalling, Pten+/R173C mice display a low incidence of solid tumours compared to Pten+/- mice. Pten+/R173C mice also exhibit lymphoid hyperplasia and macrocephaly which correlates with compromised nuclear functions of PTEN-R173C. That nuclear functions are compromised is demonstrated by reduced dsDNA damage repair in Pten+/R173C mice. Integrating PHTS patient data with findings from our mouse model, our study indicates that nuclear dysfunction of pathogenic PTEN variants is a key factor in predicting the onset of the different PHTS-associated phenotypes.

A.; Ryan, M. J.; Taylor, R. C.; Hunter, K. L.", "abstract": "Across many taxa, males gather in leks to perform multisensory courtship displays for females. At a lek, changes in the sensory scene over the course of mate evaluation are inevitable. This dynamic nature makes a females ability to recall the location of individual signalers an important component of female mate choice. It is hypothesized that complex (especially multimodal) displays may improve a females ability to remember and thus discriminate amongst potential mates. To test this hypothesis, we presented female tungara frogs (Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus) with male calls (auditory) and robotic frogs (visual) that could later be obstructed from view via the lowering of blinds. Specifically, we asked if the visual component of a multimodal display improves the ability of a receiver to remember a signaler. While our initial experiment did not find memory instantiation in female frogs, subsequent experiments with a longer presentation time and a brief period of silence successfully instantiated memories in females. Moreover, females continued to demonstrate significant preferences for calls associated with the visual cue even after 25 s following the obstruction of the visual stimulus (robotic frog). Thus, we propose that the duration of presentation and/or the silent period impact memory capability. Silence is common in choruses, and our data suggest that complex, multisensory stimuli may have evolved to help females remember their preferred mate even with such fluctuations in signal production.\n\nLAY SUMMARYMultisensory signals function to stimulate one or more of a receivers senses, and in doing so, may make signalers more memorable to receivers. Multisensory signals are common in mating displays, including the advertisement of a male tungara frog: a call (acoustic) and a vocal sac inflation (visual). Here, we demonstrate that female tungara frogs were more likely to remember a multisensory male display over a unisensory display, but only after fluctuations in the signals intensity.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Recent efforts have focused on screening many autism genes at once for functional and phenotypic convergence, and identified subsets that are crucial for many early steps of neurodevelopment. Few studies have screened later steps of neurodevelopment, circuit function, circuit plasticity, or behaviors. We screened twenty conserved autism-associated genes for impact on experience-dependent neuron remodeling in C. elegans. Loss of unc-44/ANK2, set-4/KMT5B, daf-18/PTEN, gap-2/SYNGAP1, and chd-1/CHD8 increased, while CACNA2D3/unc-36 decreased, neurite outgrowth of the GABAergic DVB neuron in adults. Although daf-18/PTEN, set-4/KMD5B, and unc-44/ANK2 had convergent phenotypes, they arise from distinct temporal trajectories with differential impact on DVB pre-synaptic morphology. Screening for the DVB regulated spicule protraction behavior identified multiple autism genes involved, but only unc-44/ANK2 and CACNA2D3/unc-36 were shared between screens.

Brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) contribute about one third to the invertebrate megabenthos assemblage between 3,800 m and 4,800 m water depth in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ, Northeast Pacific). Starfishes (Asteroidea) are present in lower densities. In the CCZ, Ophiuroidea are often seen near Xenophyophoroidea and attached to glass sponge (Hexactinellida) stalks. We hypothesize that (1) the observed relationship between Ophiuroidea, Xenophyophoroidea, and Hexactinellida is a predator-prey relationship, where Ophiuroidea feed on foraminifera- and sponge-derived organic matter. (2) Ophiuroidea have a reduced dependency on fresh phytodetritus. (3) Brisingida (order of Asteroidea), often clings to stalks to have easier access to particulate organic matter sinking to the seafloor. To test these three hypotheses, we combined bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses of fauna (Ophiuroidea, Asteroidea) and sediments with the analyses of seafloor images from the eastern CCZ. Faunal specimens and sediments were collected during three research expeditions between 2019 and 2022, and previously collected seabed images were re-analysed to quantify the major behaviours in which Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea engage. All investigated Echinodermata species had a high trophic level. Phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) used as biomarkers suggest that Silax daleus consumes sedimentary detritus that is processed by its gut microbiome. Ophiacantha cosmica is likely a top consumer or scavenger, Ophiosphalma glabrum is an opportunistic omnivore ingesting phytodetritus, bacteria, Crustacea, and Foraminifera, while Ophiuroglypha cf. polyacantha is a more selective omnivore. Freyella benthophila sits mostly on stalks of Hexactinellida and uses this elevated position to catch phytodetritus and zooplankton. Freyastera cf. tuberculata, in comparison, sits mostly on polymetallic nodules from where it preys upon Crustacea moving on the sediment surface. This study confirmed the hypothesis that Ophiuroidea in the CCZ are less dependent on phytodetritus than Holothuroidea in the Peru Basin.

Many patients present to the clinic with symptoms at end-stages of CAVD, when the disease may be irreversible. The ability to identify and live-trace calcific lesion emergence in-vivo would allow for the identification of disease biomarkers and discovery of therapeutic targets at earlier, more treatable stages. In this work, we establish a new multimodal in-vitro CAVD platform consisting of lineage traced-VEC and VIC cells in a 3D model combined with live optical coherence and fluorescence microscopy to unravel VEC, VIC, and matrix transitional events during calcific lesion formation. We discover that fissuring of the endothelial monolayer combined with the formation of dense aggregates in adjacent regions is a key biomarker of the onset of lesion formation. This coincides with the formation of dense VIC and ECM conglomerates under endothelial aggregates, an additional biomarker of pathogenesis. Further, we discover that fibrotic tissue compaction is correlated with but not necessary for lesion formation. Additionally, we identify RhoA activation in disease-treated samples. We demonstrate that RhoA inhibition through ROCK, but not Rac1 inhibition, prevents delamination of the endothelial monolayer, fibrotic remodeling, and emergence of calcific lesions.

Similarly, in vitro generation of germline and amnion is associated with mesoderm induction regardless of differentiation platform. Yet, the lineage relationships between amnion, germline and mesoderm remains unresolved. By adding Basement Membrane Extract (BME) to the media, we demonstrate emergence of TFAP2A+/SOX2- epithelial progenitor cells which develop in response to BMP receptor signaling. We track the order of embryonic events that take place from this progenitor pool revealing that amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells (PGCLCs) are specified first. Shortly after, gastrulating mesoderm-like cells (MeLCs) arise that undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). These results highlight the interconnected role of basement membrane deposition and BMP receptor signaling in the specification of human germline, amnion and mesoderm from TFAP2A+ embryonic progenitors.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Here we studied the function of Diversin in Xenopus embryo morphogenesis and its subcellular localization at different locations in superficial ectoderm cells. Depletion of Diversin in the neuroectoderm inhibited apical domain size and neural tube closure and disrupted the polarized localization of endogenous Vangl2, another PCP protein. Whereas Diversin puncta were randomly distributed in early ectoderm, they acquired planar polarity in the neuroectoderm in a stage- and position-specific manner. We find that Diversin is accumulated at the cell junctions adjacent to apically constricting cells at the Xenopus neural plate border and the gastrula blastopore lip. Moreover, Diversin cytoplasmic puncta redistributed in the direction of the pulling forces from the cells with constricting apical domains, suggesting a mechanosensitive process. PCP complexes of Dishevelled (Dvl2) and Diversin or the mechanosensitive adaptor ADIP exhibited planar polarity in the neural plate and the wound edge and promoted wound healing. We propose that Diversin- and Dvl2-containing PCP complexes control morphogenesis in a tension-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Upon signaling cues, this asymmetry can be dissipated by various phospholipid scramblases, allowing cells to respond to stimuli and adapt to different physiological contexts. The prevailing view in the field is that phospholipid scramblases on the plasma membrane act without headgroup preference. Here we report contrary experimental evidence based on a phospholipid scrambling assay that quantifies the fluorescence polarization of nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled phospholipids for kinetic monitoring of phospholipid scrambling on the plasma membrane of living cells.

However, the precise pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used Trim32 knockout C2C12 murine myoblasts to investigate the impact of Trim32 loss on myogenesis. We found that Trim32 deficiency leads to impaired myogenic signaling and reduced expression of key myogenic regulatory factors ultimately leading to delayed and abnormal myotube formation. Further, we discovered that absence of Trim32 disrupts the transition from proliferation to differentiation by limiting the necessary down-regulation of the proto-oncogene c-Myc, thus delaying and altering the onset of differentation. Interestingly, unlike previous reports that emphasized protein-level regulation, our data reveal that Trim32 regulates c-Myc at mRNA stability level. Contrasting the sustained c-Myc level is able to partially recover the myogenesis defects observed in the absence of Trim32, suggesting that the Trim32 - c-Myc axis may represent a promising therapeutic target for treating LGMDR8.

Editing two or more genes to express multiple fluorescent fusion proteins in a single cell line has proven to be a powerful strategy for uncovering spatio-dynamic, and therefore functional, relationships among different proteins, but it can take many months to edit each gene within the same cell line.

This occurs within the bone marrow microenvironment, which consists of various stromal populations and structural components that support skeletal growth, repair and homeostasis. MSCs also promote self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and regulate their differentiation. Analysis of our own and publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the murine non-immune bone and bone marrow indicates that Slc6a6 expression is enriched in MSCs. Slc6a6 encodes for an ion-dependent transporter of taurine (TauT). Although taurine supplements have been shown to mitigate the onset of bone defects in aged populations, the absence of TauT expression in osteolineage cells suggests that taurine's effect on bone may be secondary to its function in other populations, such as MSCs. Using young TauT genetic loss-of-function murine models we find that TauT loss impacts MSC populations in vivo and impairs MSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro. This correlates with decreased bone mineral density and bone strength in young TauT knockout mice. Importantly, shRNA-based knockdown of SLC6A6 expression in primary human MSCs reduces osteogenic differentiation, indicating a key role of taurine uptake in human MSC function. Consistent with a decline in MSC function with TauT loss, we find that TauT null MSCs are unable to support self-renewal and expansion of co-cultured hematopoietic stem/progenitor populations. Mechanistically, our RNA-sequencing analysis identifies downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in MSCs in the absence of TauT. These cells also show reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased ROS levels, indicating that impaired Wnt signaling and elevated oxidative stress may contribute to the observed defects in osteogenic differentiation capacity. Collectively, our data identify taurine uptake as a key regulator of mesenchymal stromal cell maintenance andosteogenic fate determination.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Here we show that its paralogue, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), undergoes phase separation via a distinct mechanism. PYK2 forms cytoplasmic condensates primarily driven by its kinase-FAT linker (KFL) region. Overexpression of PYK2 induces condensates enriched in its autophosphorylated form, which sequester paxillin from focal adhesions and impair cell adhesion. We uncover an autoregulatory mechanism involving the KFL, linking self-association, autophosphorylation, and condensation. Uncommon among known phase separation drivers, KFL condensation is phosphorylation-independent and its sequence belongs to the Janus class. Using a transformer-based protein language model, we identified non- homologous sequences with similar features, many from adhesion and cytoskeletal regulators. We validated the phase-separating potential of several of these sequences in cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking phase separation with kinase activation, and demonstrate distinct condensation behavior in close homologues.

Centrioles build on the cartwheel scaffold that assembles in interphase and disassembles in mitosis following centriole growth, yet what underlies these cartwheel dynamics remains obscure. Here we identify ALMS1, an intrinsically disordered, disease-linked protein, as an external cofactor that preserves cartwheel-forming capacity without itself entering the cartwheel. Introducing disease-linked mutations disrupted cartwheel dynamics, enabling cartwheels to expand and shed from growing centrioles, and, in turn, form additional centrioles, leading to reciprocal amplification. Molecularly, we identified CEP152, CEP63, and PCNT as ALMS1-interacting proteins that form aggregates devoid of ALMS1, which function as seeds for cartwheel assembly independently of centrioles. These cartwheel seeds (CSs) form in interphase and exhibit a nanoscale, concentric ring comprising CEP152 and CEP63 from which the cartwheel grows. Upon mitotic entry, CSs transiently recruit ALMS1 before disassembling into components that associate with ALMS1 in proximity, matching the cartwheel dynamics. Depleting ALMS1 abolished CS assembly from components, thereby eliminating centrioles, while reintroducing ALMS1 generated de novo centrioles with diverse shapes that were inheritable. Thus, centriole biogenesis is grounded on ALMS1-mediated CS assembly and disassembly that operates outside the cartwheel-centriole relationship, a system, we hypothesize, involving memory.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, the influence of genetic factors on these benefits remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored genes linked to red wine and created a curated gene set that intersects with those related to centenarians, who are markers of exceptional longevity. Utilizing over 190 databases, we identified and validated a curated list of genes, and conducted gene set enrichment analysis as well as enrichment analysis of annotations and diseases. Our findings highlighted 43 genes connected to centenarians, suggesting that these genes play a crucial role in stress response and apoptosis, which are essential for cell survival and renewal. Additionally, we noted that these genes were enriched in pathways associated with smooth muscle cell proliferation, neuroinflammation, nucleotide excision repair, and lipoprotein metabolism (false discovery rate, FDR < 3 x 10-07). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated significant tissue expression in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Furthermore, the disease-gene enrichment analysis pointed to associations with the diseases related to the tissues, including cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic diseases, immune diseases, and cancer (FDR < 9.37 x 10-6); notably, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death, suggesting that the genes may be protective against those diseases.

While potentially oncogenic somatic mutations have been demonstrated to persist and expand in healthy organs, what triggers a subset of cells harbouring deleterious mutations to transition into a neoplasm or an aggressive adenoma with poor prognosis is not well-understood. Unlike normal, healthy cells, benign cells harbouring mutations perceive inflammation in chronic disease differently, potentiating the progression from physiological inflammation to tumorigenesis. Here, we reveal that a subset of epithelial cells with mutations are poised to transition from pre-neoplastic state to early neoplasm, through rewiring of epithelial IL-1{beta} responses and inflammatory macrophage recruitment. We characterise this process by leveraging a mouse model of biliary tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), in which deleterious mutations are introduced to tumour suppressor genes in common cancer pathways (Trp53 and Pten), and by quantifying differences in cell states and corresponding gene expression dependencies in the absence or presence of liver inflammation. Critically, we find that targeting the epithelial-derived signals of tissue-wide inflammation (namely COX2) is insufficient to limit tumorigenesis; rather, targeting the reactivation of oncogene-induced developmental signals, such as NOTCH, prevents this pre-neoplastic to neoplastic transition, demonstrating that oncofoetal switching is a pharmacologically-tractable target in patients with a high risk of developing cancers on the background of inflammation.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Accurate characterization of ECM composition and architecture is essential for understanding how CRC evades therapy, yet most protocols either assess ECM components in isolation or remain technically challenging. Here we present a robust yet simple protocol for spatial characterization of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) organization within the CRC tumor microenvironment (TME). Our method combines Alcian Blue and Picrosirius Red staining procedures with standardized tissue processing and imaging protocols. The protocol enables simultaneous visualization, assessment, and quantification of collagen and GAG distribution patterns in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Key methodological advances include optimized dual-staining approach with distinct blue-red coloration for straightforward spectral separation on digital imaging systems, standardized reagent preparations, and validated imaging parameters. The complementary wavelengths facilitate both visual interpretation and potential digital separation, offering advantages over multi-component stains with overlapping spectral ranges. Validation across multiple CRC patient specimens demonstrates excellent reproducibility with consistent staining intensity using standard histology equipment. Because the resulting spatial maps can be compared directly with engineered or ex vivo tumor models, the protocol also provides a practical benchmark for microenvironment validation. This standardized approach to ECM visualization will advance TME research, support morphological studies, and enable comparative analyses across CRC subtypes. The methodology can be adapted to other solid tumor types and integrated with complementary techniques including digital pathology workflows for comprehensive microenvironment characterization and enhanced analysis capabilities.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Material and methods: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 30 participants (80% female, mean age 37.41+- 3.7 years). The questionnaire was developed through literature review, expert consultation, and focus group discussions, covering six domains: demographics, health history, MP knowledge, plastic use behaviors, environmental attitudes, and cognitive screening (AD-8). Validity was assessed using Pearson correlation, and reliability was measured via Cronbach alpha. Result: The questionnaire demonstrated strong validity for knowledge (r=0.379, p=0.039), behavior (r=0.726, p<0.001), and attitude sections (r=0.385, p=0.036), with acceptable reliability (=0.623). Neurocognitive assessment revealed significantly lower AD-8 scores in participants with cognitive decline (mean=11.14) versus normal cognition (mean=18.03, p=0.038). Key findings included high single-use plastic consumption, limited awareness of MP regulations (70% uninformed), and an attitude-behavior gap in mitigation efforts. Discussion: The tool effectively identified MP knowledge gaps and behavioral risks while suggesting a plausible link between plastic exposure and cognitive impairment. The sensitivity and specificity of the AD-8 supported its utility for screening, though the modest sample size limited statistical power for correlation analyses. Conclusion: This validated questionnaire provides a critical foundation for assessing MP-related cognitive risks in Indonesia. Future studies should expand validation in larger cohorts and investigate causal mechanisms. The findings underscore the need for public education and policy interventions to reduce plastic exposure.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

For example, such solutions are needed to simplify spatially extended neuron models, to understand frequency-dependent response properties, to elucidate the interaction between synaptic inputs, and hence to reveal the effective compartmentalization of dendrites into functional subunits. Nevertheless, these methods have not been implemented in modern software tools. This works describes the NEural Analysis Toolkit (NEAT), a Python toolbox that implements classical algorithms to compute response properties of spatially extended neuron models, and that leverages these algorithms to simplify them. Packaged with this are a range of useful utilities to plot morphologies and spatial quantities defined on the morphology, to distribute locations on the morphology, and to select parts of the morphology to e.g. apply morphological ablations or alter the membrane properties. The resulting models can be exported to NEURON and NEST, two commonly used simulators, the former focused on detailed single neuron model simulations, and the latter geared towards distributed network simulations. As a consequence, this toolbox provides a missing link between single neuron computation and large-scale network analysis, substantially facilitating the study of the role of dendritic computation in shaping emergent network dynamics.

Here, we analyzed data of 890 subjects (459 women, age 22 to 35) from the Human Connectome Project using Granger causality analyses (GCA) with the sgACC as the seed and 268 regions of interest from the Shen atlas as targets. Individual connectivities were assessed with an F test and group results were evaluated with a binomial test, both at a corrected threshold. We identified brain regions with significant input to and output from the sgACC. Clustering analyses of Granger causality input, but not Granger causality output or resting state connectivity features revealed distinct subject clusters, effectively distinguishing individuals with severe and mild depressive symptoms and those with comorbidities. Specifically, weaker projections from the fronto-parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, anterior insula, temporal cortices, and cerebellum to the sgACC characterized five clusters with low to high scores of depression as well as comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Machine learning using a logistic classifier with the significant GCA-in features and 5-fold cross-validation achieved 87% accuracy in distinguishing subject clusters, including those with high vs. low depression.

How cargo and Golgi-resident proteins traverse this organelle has long been debated. Recent studies have identified a molecular machinery that sorts resident proteins into retrograde-directed COPI vesicles during cisternal maturation. Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is a key component of this system; however, its physiological relevance and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we show that GOLPH3 depletion in mice disrupts both protein and lipid glycosylation, causes partially penetrant embryonic lethality, and severely impairs growth and bone mineralization. At the molecular level, we find that GOLPH3 is regulated by functionally antagonistic S-acylation events that control the topology of its membrane association. To mediate retrograde trafficking of Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases, GOLPH3 must bind their cytosolic tails. This occurs via a negatively charged surface region, which is correctly oriented only in one of the S-acylated GOLPH3 conformations. Together, these findings reveal a lipid-mediated regulatory mechanism for intra-Golgi trafficking and establish the critical role of GOLPH3 in vertebrate development.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

By simulating the optimal metabolic strategies of different phytoplankton functional types across a latitudinal gradient, we found that cyanobacteria are more vulnerable in warmer tropical regions due to greater heat sensitivity and lower storage capacity, indicating a potential ecological niche for larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms, in a warming ocean.

Genomic changes may precede or succeed the onset of parthenogenesis and may directly or indirectly contribute to the success of this reproductive transition and fitness of parthenogenetic animals. To gain greater understanding of genomic changes accompanying the transition to parthenogenetic reproduction, we have characterized genomic differences between a sexually reproducing and parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum. This revealed three large (2.6-9 Mbp) inversions present on Muller element B and a 30-fold length expansion of heterochromatin on Muller element F. Comparisons of these genomic changes and parthenogenetic ability in 18 D. mercatorum strains collected in South America, North America, Hawaii, and Africa indicates no clear correlation of these genomic changes with geographical origin. However, these changes are minimal in strains collected in Brazil suggesting this is the origin for the ancestral strain and that both chromosome inversions and increased heterochromatin have likely preceded the transition to parthenogenetic reproduction. Parthenogenetic ability correlates most strongly with expansion of chromosomal element F. We speculate that this increased heterochromatic environment of genes on element F influences gene expression to either enhance parthenogenesis directly or redirect the activity of another factor contributing to it, in a manner analogous to the known influence of heterochromatin on gene activity in position effect variegation.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

While docking methods offer computational efficiency, they often lack the precision required for reliable affinity ranking. In contrast, molecular dynamics (MD)-based approaches such as MMGBSA provide more accurate binding free energy estimates but are computationally intensive, limiting their scalability. To address this trade-off, we introduce an active learning framework that automates molecule selection for docking and MD simulations, replacing manual expert-driven decisions with a data-efficient, model-guided strategy. Our approach integrates fixed - partly pre-trained deep learning - molecular embeddings (MolFormer, ChemBERTa-2, and Morgan fingerprints) with adaptive regression models (e.g. Bayesian Ridge and Random Forest) to iteratively improve binding affinity predictions. We evaluate this approach retrospectively on a new dataset of 60,000 chemically diverse compounds from ZINC-22 targeting the MCL1 protein using both AutoDock Vina and MMGBSA. Our results show that incorporating MMGBSA scores into the active learning loop significantly enhances performance, recovering 79.9% of the top 1% binders in the whole dataset, compared to only 6.7% when using docking scores alone. Notably, MMGBSA exhibits a stronger correlation with experimental binding affinities than AutoDock Vina on our dataset and enables more accurate ranking of candidate compounds in a runtime efficient way. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a one-at-a-time acquisition active learning strategy consistently outperforms traditional batched acquisition, the latter achieving just 78.4% recovery with MolFormer and Bayesian Ridge. These findings underscore the potential of integrating deep learning-based molecular representations with MD-level accuracy in an active learning framework, offering a scalable and efficient path to accelerate virtual screening and improve hit identification in drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

The integration of metagenomic sequencing with advanced bioinformatics tools surpasses traditional wet lab methods, leading to the discovery of millions of plasmids from diverse origins. However, the rapidly growing number of unannotated plasmids necessitates comprehensive characterization of their multi-faceted properties, such as risk indices and ecological contexts, to support various downstream applications. Achieving this goal is hindered by several challenges, including the limited availability of plasmid characterization tools, the inadequacies of alignment-based methods for novel plasmids, and inconsistencies in manual annotations across plasmid reference databases. To address these issues, we present PlasRAG, a novel tool that integrates two key modules: multi-faceted property characterization of query plasmids and plasmid DNA retrieval based on textual queries. At its core, PlasRAG employs a bidirectional multi-modal information retrieval model that aligns DNA sequences with textual data, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. Specifically, within the characterization module, PlasRAG leverages the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and the Llama-3 large language model (LLM) to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that PlasRAG delivers robust performance and enhanced analytical capabilities, underscoring the effectiveness of its architectural design.

Trained on 8,613 matched Tx-Mx-Px samples from TCGA and CPTAC, Proteomizer achieved a Tx-Px correlation of r = 0.68, representing the highest performance reported to date for this task. We further developed a Monte Carlo simulation framework to evaluate the impact of proteomization on differential expression analysis.

Here, we employed a newly developed extraction and LC-MS method to simultaneously quantify and compare levels of five steroids and thirteen peptides in brain, pituitary, and gonads. As expected, testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) were higher in male tissues, while estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were elevated in the female pituitary/ovary and brain, respectively.

Similarly, SNa and SNb were more abundant in the female brain and pituitary, and markedly higher in testes than ovaries. Several smaller SN fragments were detected at low levels, with patterns suggesting sex-specific enzymatic processing.

Archaeal histone sequences are much less conserved than their eukaryotic counterparts, yet insight into how they structure DNA is limited to only a few species that fail to represent the diversity of the archaeal domain. Archaea have adapted to the most diverse and extreme environments on our planet, requiring protection of the genome against a multitude of external pressures. Here, we use bioinformatics, structure prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations to survey the diversity of histone-like sequences in all available archaeal genomes and to understand how they might interact with DNA. We have identified five distinct types of histones which are combined in seven different strategies, involving either single histones, multiple histones of the same type, or combinations of several types of histones in one genome. We show that some strategies correlate with environmental pressures, and some are phylogenetically restricted.

In this study, we comprehensively investigated the function of PEs in the human brain and assessed the impact of pathogenic variants on their splicing. A comparative analysis of 957 eukaryotic transcriptomes revealed that humans exhibit the highest enrichment of NMD-targeted transcripts. To delineate the full landscape of PEs in the human transcriptome, we considered conserved (PhyloP score [&ge;] 20) alternatively spliced exons, less than 300 base pairs (bp) long, with the ability to introduce PTCs positioned more than 150 base pairs (bp) downstream of the transcription start site and outside the last two exons of the transcript. Our analysis identified 12,014 PEs in the human genome.

Overall, we identified 117 PEs uniquely found in the human brain, 1,214 PEs with brain-specific differential splicing compared to other tissues, and 1,610 PEs which splicing change during brain development. Integrating ClinVar and SpliceAI, we identified 1,877 annotated pathogenic variants predicted to affect the splicing of 891 PEs in the human brain.

Despite the explosion of genomic data, a significant proportion of human protein-coding genes remain poorly characterized (\"ghost genes\"). Due to sociological dynamics in research, scientific literature disproportionately focuses on already well-annotated genes, reinforcing existing biases (bandwagon effect). This literature bias often permeates machine learning (ML) models trained on gene annotation tasks, leading to predictions that favor well-studied genes. Consequently, standard ML performance metrics may overestimate biological relevance by overfitting literature-derived patterns. To address this challenge, we developed GhostBuster, an encoder-decoder ML platform designed to predict gene functions, disease associations and interactions while minimizing literature bias. We first compared the impact of biased (Gene Ontology) versus unbiased training datasets (LINCS, TCGA, STRING). While literature-biased sources yielded higher ML metrics, they also amplified bias by prioritizing well-characterized genes. In contrast, models trained on unbiased datasets were 2-3x more effective at identifying recently discovered gene annotations. Notably, one of the unbiased channels (TCGA), combined minimal amounts of literature bias with robust performance, at a test ROC-AUC of 0.8-0.95.

Here we identified a specific top-down input from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the dysgranular zone of the retrosplenial cortex (RSCd) that becomes active exclusively at reward locations. Activity of these ACC neurons is both necessary and sufficient for shaping the hippocampal saliency map. Unlike dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, which respond to reward irrespective of the context, this class of ACC neurons encodes reward-context associations. Their optogenetic activation induces a reduction in locomotor speed, a behavioral correlate of saliency detection, while their inhibition disrupts the formation of the hippocampal place map.

The developmental mechanisms shaping this axis remain elusive. Here, we present converging multispecies evidence supporting the Multinodal Induction-Exclusion in Network Development (MIND) model, in which S-A patterning is governed by competing processes of induction and exclusion, driven by opposing transcriptomically-defined identity programs emerging from different nodes. Key molecular and connectional features of association cortices arise through pericentral programs, originating around fronto-temporal poles and partially regulated by retinoic acid. They progress inward toward central territories of the naive neocortex along fronto-temporally polarized trajectories. Central programs are induced through interactions between topographically separated first-order sensorimotor thalamocortical inputs and the neocortex, promoting the formation of primary areas while excluding pericentral programs. Influenced by SATB2 and ZBTB18, these evolutionarily conserved programs compete for the same territory and create spatial compartmentalization of axon guidance, cell-cell adhesion, retinoic acid signaling, synaptogenesis, Wnt signaling, and autism risk genes. Notably, PLXNC1 and SEMA7A exhibit anti-correlated expression and repulsive functions in shaping cortico-cortical connectivity along the S-A axis. These processes of induction and exclusion establish an S-A equilibrium and topography in which primary sensorimotor areas emerge as focal islands within the broader ocean of distributed associative networks. The MIND model provides a unifying framework for understanding experimental, evolutionary, and clinical phenomena, revealing induction and exclusion as antagonistic complementary principles shaping the S-A axis and processing hierarchies.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Although the neural mechanisms underlying acoustic information processing along the auditory pathway are well-documented, the connections supporting auditory-related cognitive and emotional processing, particularly in comparative studies between mice and human adults, are not yet fully clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate connections between the auditory cortex and brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional processing using retrograde fluoro-gold (FG) tracer in mice and 3-tesla high-resolution diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) in human adults. The FG injections into the primary (AI)/ secondary (AII) auditory cortices showed afferent connections with cortical (olfactory bulb, piriform, orbitofrontal, cingulate, motor, primary somatosensory, insular, visual, parietal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices), subcortical (amygdala, hippocampus, globus pallidus, claustrum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, diagonal band of the Broca and medial septal nucleus) and brainstem (raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine nucleus and locus coeruleus) structures. The DTI data obtained from human adults mostly corresponded with the experimental findings. Auditory cortical processing integrates auditory signals with other sensory, limbic and motor inputs. The connections collectively may suggest its role in cognitive and emotional functions. The auditory cortex is likely a critical hub within the neural circuitry underlying multisensory integration, decision-making, prediction, learning and memory functions. Understanding the connectivity of the auditory cortex can deepen our insight into its contribution to cognitive/emotional functions, offering new perspectives on the underlying mechanism linking hearing deficits with cognitive/emotional disorders.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Cre-selective CRISPR-dCas9 systems allow for cell-type specific, epigenomic-based manipulation of gene expression with gene-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and have potential to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying striatal subtype mediated behaviors. Conditional transgenic Rosa26:LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were recently generated to allow for robust expression of dCas9-p300 expression with Cre-driven cell-type specificity. This system utilizes p300, a histone acetyltransferase which regulates gene expression by unwinding chromatin and making that region of the genome more accessible for transcription. Rosa26-LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were paired with Drd1-Cre and Ador2a-Cre mice to generate Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 mouse lines and underwent behavioral phenotyping when sgRNAs were not present. Both Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 have cell-type specific expression of spCas9 mRNA. Baseline behavioral assessments revealed that, under a sgRNA absent nontargeted state, Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice display repetitive spinning behavior, hyperlocomotion and enhanced acquisition of reward learning in comparison to all genotypic littermates. In contrast, Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 do not exhibit any changes in behavior in comparison to their littermates. Electrophysiological recordings of dorsal striatum D1-SPNs revealed that Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice have increased input resistance and increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude, together suggesting greater excitatory drive of D1-SPNs. Overall, these data demonstrate the necessity to validate CRISPR-dCas9 lines for research investigations.

Tubers are wide-spread across angiosperms with some species such as Solanum tuberosum L. (potato) serving as a vital crop for human consumption. Genes responsible for tuber initiation and disease resistance have been characterized in potato including StSP6a, a homolog of Flowering Time, that functions as tuberigen, the equivalent of florigen. To elucidate additional molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying potato biology including tuber initiation, tuber development, and stress responses, we generated a developmental and abiotic/biotic-stress gene expression atlas from 34 tissues and treatments of Atlantic, a cultivated tetraploid potato. Using the haplotype-phased tetraploid Atlantic genome assembly and expression abundances of 129,218 genes, we constructed gene coexpression modules that represent networks associated with distinct developmental stages as well as stress responses. Functional annotations were given to modules and used to identify genes involved in tuberization and stress resilience. Structural variation from a pan-genomic analysis across four cultivated potato genome assemblies as well as domestication and wild introgression data allowed for deeper insights into the modules to identify key genes involved in tuberization and stress responses.

This symbiont can block Plasmodium transmission in mosquitoes, and it can spread through mosquito populations and be sustained over generations by vertical and horizontal transmission. These characteristics make Microsporidia MB a potential candidate for symbiont-based malaria vector control. However, the mechanistic basis of interactions between Microsporidia MB and Anopheles arabiensis is poorly characterized. We investigated how the presence of Microsporidia MB affects transcriptomics profiles and the gut microbiota composition and diversity in non-blood-fed and blood-fed (24, 48 and 72 hours post blood meal) An. arabiensis mosquitoes. We observed that mosquito infection with Microsporidia MB upregulated farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase, a gene linked to juvenile hormone biosynthesis in the non-blood-fed mosquitoes. In addition, blood feeding in Microsporidia MB positive mosquitoes was associated with an activation of immune-related genes 24 hours after a blood meal, where several genes including the lipopolysaccharide tumor necrosis factor gene were upregulated. Interestingly, we also observed that Microsporidia MB positivity was associated with a microbiota shift to favor the proliferation of microbes including Pseudomonas and Serratia 24 hours post blood meal. There were indications of immune system activation in Microsporidia MB positive mosquitoes up to 48 hours after a blood meal where factors such as the peptidoglycan recognition SC2-like and lysozyme c-1 were upregulated. Notably, an upregulated immune system at this time point was associated with downregulation of genes associated with metabolism and the restoration of Serratia, Pseudomonas and other key microbes to relative abundances similar to those recorded in non-blood-fed mosquitoes. At the 72-hour time point, Microsporidia MB positive mosquitoes exhibited a downregulation of genes associated with immunity, including cecropins and defensins, while metabolic processes were predominantly upregulated. Our results provide insights into the effect of Microsporidia MB infection on the An. arabiensis gene expression and gut microbiota profiles.

To control for item difficulty, we selected a subset of vocabulary items with similar and low difficulty in adulthood. Both vocabulary types showed non-linear growth patterns, with emotional vocabulary exhibiting earlier and faster development, reaching near-asymptotic levels by early adulthood. General vocabulary showed a more gradual increase and later inflection point. A joint nonlinear mixed-effects model confirmed significant differences in developmental timing, with emotional vocabulary peaking approximately four years earlier than general vocabulary. These findings support theoretical models emphasizing the early emergence and adaptive relevance of emotional concepts and highlight adolescence as a sensitive period for emotional vocabulary acquisition.

CAR engineering with CD70 and IL-15, while designed to enhance persistence and metabolic fitness, did not prevent hypoxia-induced impairment. Given the mitochondrial disruption, we then explored whether DRP1 ablation could mitigate hypoxia-induced dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of DRP1 restored mitochondrial content and cytotoxic function. To confirm the role of DRP1, we generated CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DRP1 knockout NK cells, which preserved mitochondrial load and membrane potential under hypoxia. When armed with CD70-CAR-IL-15, DRP1 knockout cells retained cytotoxic activity under hypoxic conditions.

We developed a faithful in vitro model for CD8 T cell terminal dysfunction as a platform to advance T cell immunotherapy. Using TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells, we found that 1-week peptide stimulation, mimicking conditions in previous models, failed to induce a stable exhaustion program in CD8 T cells. In contrast, prolonged stimulation for 2-3 weeks induced T cell dysfunction but triggered activation-induced cell death, precluding long-term investigation of exhaustion programs. To better mimic in vivo exhaustion, we provided post-effector, chronic TGF{beta}1 signals, enabling survival of chronically stimulated CD8 T cells for over 3 weeks. These conditions induced a stable state of terminal dysfunction (TDysf), marked by loss of effector, cytotoxicity, and memory programs, along with mitochondrial stress and impaired protein translation. Importantly, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses confirmed the development of terminal exhaustion-specific signatures in TDysf cells. Adoptive transfer of TDysf cells revealed their inability to recall effector functions or proliferate after acute LCMV rechallenge.

Clonally expanded and highly differentiated CD8+ T cells have been observed in individuals with TDP-43 proteinopathies and therapeutics modulating the T cell response have recently been found to extend survival.

In birds, urbanisation can either increase or decrease avian malaria infection, depending on host species, parasite or study location. However, temporal coordination between parasites and hosts, which may impact infection outcomes, has not been studied in urban ecology. To fill this gap, we collected blood samples from wild blue tit nestlings (Cyanistes caeruleus) in urban and forest habitats to examine how their hatch dates affected the prevalence and intensity of malaria infection. To separate parasites and quantify parasite load, we newly developed a species-specific qPCR assay. We found that Leucocytozoon prevalence was strongly affected by urbanisation, but effects depended on study year. This was driven by hatch date: nestlings that hatched earlier in the spring had a lower probability of being infected, independent of habitat type. In the few heavily infected nestlings, intensity of infection was associated with low body weight, suggesting fitness effects of infection. These results highlight the importance of breeding early to avoid early-life infection with malaria parasites, and that apparent urbanisation effects on infection arose from phenological differences between urban and forest habitats. Underappreciated phenological changes may underline other ecological effects of urbanisation.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In a pilot deployment in Hong Kong, we tested a novel 3D-printed structure -- modular tiles made of porous terra cotta with complex surface structures intended to enhance micro- and cryptic biodiversity -- for coral reef restoration. Over four years, we monitored the condition and growth of 378 outplanted coral fragments through diver assessments and photogrammetric measurements. Changes in biodiversity were evaluated using visual surveys and eDNA metabarcoding. We recorded high survivorship, with 91% of transplanted corals alive and securely attached at end of the monitoring period. Greater fish and macroinvertebrate abundance were observed at the restoration site than at a nearby unrestored area. eDNA analyses indicated a 23.5% increase in eukaryote ASV richness at the restoration site relative to the unrestored site, and a 13.3% increase compared to a natural reference coral community. As the first example of eDNA being used to detect changes in eukaryote diversity associated with coral reef restoration, this study demonstrates the tiles' dual function: (1) sustaining coral growth and (2) enhancing cryptic reef biodiversity, an outcome often overlooked in conventional reef restoration design and monitoring.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Most commonly, populations respond to environmental variation by shifting the timing of reproductive events (phenology). Or more profoundly, populations may (partly) shift their mode of reproduction from sexual to asexual. Life cycle variation can impact reproductive success, gene flow, genetic diversity, and, ultimately, the evolutionary trajectory of populations. Understanding the factors that influence life cycle variation is essential for grasping the biology and ecological roles of species. This study investigates the variation in life cycles and its effects on the genetic diversity of a brown seaweed, Dictyota, across its European range. Location North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Taxon Dictyota dichotoma (Hudson) J.V. Lamouroux (Phaeophyceae, Dictyotales) Methods We monitored phenology, fertility and lifespan in Atlantic and Mediterranean populations at its northern and southern boundaries, and used microsatellite markers to assess how these factors influence genetic and genotypic diversity. Results We observed significant differences in phenology, reproductive strategies, and genetic diversity among northern and southern European populations. In Mediterranean populations, D. dichotoma exhibited sporophytic dominance with gametophytes being extremely rare, suggesting a shift towards asexual reproduction. In contrast, North-East Atlantic populations displayed more pronounced seasonal reproductive patterns with higher frequencies of gametophytes, indicating predominant sexual reproduction. However, genetic analysis showed lower allelic richness and unique alleles in northern populations, whereas southern populations were genetically more diverse, reflecting historical biogeographic processes. Clonal reproduction was more pronounced in the Mediterranean populations, influencing the spatial genetic substructure and contributing to lower genotypic diversity compared to Atlantic populations.

These structures participate in the mechanosensing process, transmitting forces from the cellular microenvironment to the cytoskeleton. The interaction between cells and their environment, along with the role of focal adhesion proteins, are areas of significant research interest. Accurate, quantitative analysis of adhesions structures in microscopic images is essential for advancing our understanding of the subject. However, the high variability and complexity of those structures in cells makes image analysis challenging, both in terms of subjectivity and time consumption. Methods We present a novel semi-automatic script for the detection of adhesion structures and analysis of their parameters, developed in MATLAB 2021a, to address the challenge of accurate image analysis of focal and fibrillar adhesions in cells. Results Our script offers a more time-efficient and less subjective alternative to manual analysis, while still allowing the user to retain control over the analytical process. It detects adhesion structures in confocal images and measures key parameters such as shape, orientation, and spatial distribution within cells, additionally providing visual label maps of the identified adhesion structures. The second add-on enables the calculation of correlation coefficients between two confocal microscopy image channels representing different stained cellular structures within the same cell, and generates visual colocalization maps, further enhancing the analysis of cellular architecture. Conclusions The presented open-source script offers a robust solution for the comprehensive, quantitative analysis of adhesion structures in microscopic images, based on user-defined analysis parameters.

In particular, MDS, a low dimensional representation of data points, is frequently used in early stages of data analysis pipelines, for QC, batch effect detection and hypothesis generation. However, interpreting representations in more than two dimensions necessitates the mental integration of multiple 2D plots - a process that greatly benefits from an interactive GUI, where such plots can be easily and iteratively customised without the need for programming. Results: Here, we present MDSvis, a Shiny application for user-interactive customised visualisation of MDS projections. MDSvis is based on the Bioconductor package CytoMDS for calculating MDS coordinates. We describe the functional workflow of the application, and illustrate two different use cases, which are detailed in the package vignettes. The first use case pertains to cytometry data analysis, which was the original motivation for building the application. The second use case demonstrates how to extend the use of MDSvis to MDS visualisation of any sample distance matrix.

However, HVG selection is often confounded by technical noise inherent in the scRNA-seq measurement process, leading to the misidentification of biologically relevant genes. In this study, we propose a novel HVG selection method based on the RECODE-denoised variance. RECODE is a recently developed noise reduction algorithm that models technical noise in scRNA-seq data as a random sampling process and removes it through a theoretically grounded denoising procedure. Benchmarking on 10x Genomics PBMC data revealed that our method outperformed conventional approaches in capturing known marker genes. Moreover, it demonstrated robustness to changes in normalization parameters and downsampling of cell numbers. Importantly, the same denoised data used for HVG selection can be directly reused in downstream analysis, ensuring consistency throughout the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

The invasion of cancer cells into the ECM is significantly influenced by cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, and the generation of traction forces. However, the complex interplay between these different aspects makes it difficult to disentangle their roles in the invasive process, hampering our mechanistic understanding of collective cell invasion. Here, we combine integrin knockout experiments in Hs578T and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines with a computational cellular Potts model to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms underlying invasive cell behavior. By tuning the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion parameters in our computational model, we establish a quantitative mapping with the experiments. Our work reveals that strong cell-matrix interactions promote invasion, while strong cell-cell adhesion promotes the formation and dissemination of multicellular clusters. Moreover, our model delineates a threshold for invasion and predicts that tumor morphology - particularly the number of branches from the primary tumor - correlates with its invasive potential, suggesting that morphological tumor features may serve as a proxy for metastasis. Our approach highlights the importance of combining biological experiments with computational and predictive modeling, offering new insights into the mechanisms driving cancer cell migration.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

We present a computational framework integrating AlphaFold3-predicted structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3 subunit (nAChR-3) with multi-force-field molecular dynamics (MD) refinements to design peptide biopesticides. Crucially, we introduce \"Dipeptide Probing\", a high-throughput MD-based screening strategy employing 20 phenylalanine-containing dipeptides (F-X) to map dynamic binding sites. Unlike rigid docking or static free energy calculations, this approach captures transient interactions and cooperative binding phenomena, identifying Phe-Met (FM) as the top binder through hydrophobic contacts and multiple hydrogen bonding, while {pi}-stacking contributed minimally to complex stability, contradicting conventional paradigms. Additionally, MD simulations revealed an unexpected Aggregation-Induced Hydrophobicity Binding (AIHB) mechanism: FM dipeptides self-assemble via hydrogen bonds, orienting hydrophilic groups toward solvent and exposing hydrophobic surfaces to the target, thereby stabilizing complex formation to the helix bundle surface of nAChR-3. This cooperative behavior, undetectable by docking (e.g., AutoDock Vina failed to predict FM binding) or static energy methods, resolves limitations of reductionist approaches. Our work establishes \"Dipeptide Probing\" as a generalizable paradigm for dynamic binding-site mapping and underscores AIHB's potential to revolutionize peptide-based agrochemical design by leveraging emergent intra-/inter- multi-molecule interactions.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

The barn swallow subspecies complex has been the main focus of many latest papers, focusing mainly on the Eurasian and Levant subspecies (H.r. rustica and H.r. transitiva). The remaining subspecies have either not been studied or few complete mitogenome sequences have been obtained. We present a comprehensive phylogeographic analysis of 580 complete mitochondrial genomes of barn swallows representing all recognized subspecies. We identified 553 unique haplotypes, 166 of which are novel, with high haplotype diversity and notable nucleotide diversity among subspecies. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum parsimony supports a single maternal ancestor and reveals five main haplogroups, confirming and refining prior classifications. A novel, distinct haplogroup (E) was identified for H.r. tytleri, previously classified as a sub-branch of H.r. erythrogaster. The inclusion of 66 hybrid individuals confirmed extensive maternal introgression and revealed multiple cases of mitogenome-subspecies mismatches, notably in savignii, transitiva, and tytleri populations. We further integrated 13 mitogenomes from 12 other Hirundo species, three of which are newly sequenced, to contextualize H. rustica evolution within the genus. Our findings support a southern African origin with subsequent diversification and a northward expansion. This study significantly enhances resolution of barn swallow mitogenomic diversity, revises phylogenetic relationships, identifies new haplogroups, hints at inter-subspecies gene flow and refines coalescent-based divergence times, offering key insights into the evolutionary history and hybridisation patterns of this iconic migratory species.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

To address this, we used a dCas9-based system to target histone H3 methylation modifiers to defined genomic loci. Targeting methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 had little effect on recombination at selected hotspots, whereas targeting H3K4me3- and H3K36me3-associated enzymes often silenced the endogenous genes. The strongest effect was observed with the demethylase JMJ14, which reduced local H3K4me3 levels and decreased crossover frequency within the targeted interval. This was accompanied by reduced transcription of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located at the hotspot and altered crossover topology. Suppressed recombination was also seen at neighbouring, untargeted hotspots. Conversely, directing the transcriptional activator VP64 to the same region elevated lncRNA expression, increased crossover frequency, and raised H3K4me3 levels. Our results reveal a causal relationship between H3K4me3, transcription, and local crossover activity, demonstrating that H3K4me3 levels are tightly associated with both transcriptional output and recombination frequency at specific genomic sites.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Due to its hierarchical folding property, RNA secondary (2D) structure is usually used as input for 3D structure prediction to improve accuracy and efficiency. However, the extent to which the accuracy of input 2D structure affects the performance of 3D structure prediction remains to be further investigated. Additionally, whether and how the input base-pairing interactions are modified during the 3D structure modeling process is another question worth exploring. To address these issues, here we comprehensively benchmark five representative 3D structure prediction models on extensive datasets, using 2D structures of varied accuracies as input. Our results indicate that there is a pervasive cross-talk between RNA 2D and 3D structure predictions, where the performance dependence of 3D structure prediction on the accuracy of input 2D structure is closely associated with the 3D models ability to modify the input base-pairing interactions during structure modeling. Furthermore, we also observed that RNA 3D structure prediction performance is more sensitive to the occurrence of false positive base pairs in the input 2D structure than to true positive base pairs, suggesting a worthy direction to further improve the model performance.\n\nAuthor summaryThree-dimensional (3D) structural modeling of RNAs with large sizes and complex topologies remains challenging despite the availability of (predicted) 2D structures as constraints. Exploring the potential cross-talk between 2D and 3D structure predictions is a worthy direction to improve the performance of RNA structure modeling. In this study, we found that all tested popular RNA 3D structure prediction models were able to modify the original base pairing interactions contained in the input 2D structure during the 3D modeling process. Especially, all of these models presented increased F1-score for the optimal combination of RNA 2D and 3D structure prediction models. The results suggest that a worthwhile direction to further improve the performance of RNA 3D structure prediction is to minimize the incidence of incorrectly predicted base pairing interactions during modeling process without compromising or even improving the presence of correct interactions in the input 2D structure.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Leveraging (discrete) histological annotations and (continuous) data-driven trajectories, we quantify the dynamics of cellular density, heterogeneity, function and signaling along the reference-adenoma-carcinoma axis, which is concordant in its spatial and molecular definition. This combination of analytical approaches across different data views let us chart tissue transformation across dimensions (physical/transcriptional) and scales (cell/tissue). We resolve {approx}3.5 million cells into 43 epithelial, immune, and stromal subpopulations that exhibit a bifurcating tumor evolution: On the one hand, LGR5+ stem-like epithelial cells are enriched in highly homogeneous proliferative tumor cores. On the other hand, MMP7+ fetal-like states are restricted to immunosuppressive invasive fronts, rich in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages. These subpopulations form concentric spatial layers that organize transformed regions, and their compound aligns with histological malignancy. We further define 'transition crypts' - single colonic crypts with divided histological and transcriptional makeup - that arise from rare crypt fusion or abrupt transformation events. Finally, we trace MMP7+ fetal-like tumor cell states and concomitant myofibroblast-like FAP+ CAFs to lymphovascular invasion sites and matched lymph node metastases, thereby recapitulating invasive programs at single-cell resolution and across sites. In all, we present single cell- and WTx-resolved spatial data that are among the first of their kind.

Stipules are widely present in extant vascular plants, but their origins in geological history remain obscure and must have involved convergent evolution more than once, perhaps as early as the late Paleozoic emergence of forested terrestrial ecosystems. Based on extraordinary collections from the early Permian Wuda Tuff Flora, the earliest known stipule structure in the plant kingdom has been identified in marattialean tree ferns Psaroniaceae, the dominant element of Permo-Carboniferous wetland forests. Psaroniaceous stipules are consistent with protection of juvenile fronds and the stem apex as well as retention of a functional role in mature and withered fronds.

The initial experiments used 12 mice to identify the lowest antinociceptive doses of fentanyl (0.1 mg/kg) and morphine (1 mg/kg). Twelve additional mice were implanted with telemeters to simultaneously record EEG, electromyogram, motor activity, and subcutaneous body temperature. Doses of fentanyl (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) and morphine (1, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg) caused significant (P<0.05) increases in wakefulness and decreases in NREM and REM sleep. Fentanyl (0.1 to 3 mg/kg) and morphine (3 to 30 mg/kg) significantly increased motor activity. Body temperature during wakefulness was significantly decreased by fentanyl (1, 3 mg/kg). Morphine increased (3 mg/kg) and decreased (30 mg/kg) body temperature. Mediation analyses showed that the increase in wakefulness caused by fentanyl and morphine was partially mediated by motor activity, but not by changes in body temperature.

Here we report that in fish, males exhibit stronger antiviral immune responses, which are driven by the male-biased gene Cyp17a2 rather than by hormones or sex chromosomes. First, we observed that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral resistance compared to females, and notably, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes. Through transcriptomic screening, we found that cyp17a2 was specifically highly expressed in male fish. Cyp17a2 knockout males were equivalent to wild-type males in terms of sex organs and androgen secretion, but the ability to upregulate IFN as well as antiviral resistance was greatly reduced. Then, Cyp17a2 is identified as a positive IFN regulator which located at endoplasmic reticulum, and specifically interacts with and enhances STING mediated antiviral responses. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2 stabiles STING expression by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, which facilitates K33-linked polyubiquitination. The capacity of IFN induction of Cyp17a2 was abolished when STING is knockdown. Meanwhile, Cyp17a2 also attenuates viral infection directly to strengthen the antiviral capacity as an antiviral protein, Cyp17a2 degrades the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) P protein by utilizing USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination.

Naive CD4+ T cells were cultured under conditions that mimicked mucosal environments. This included signaling through MAdCAM-1 in the presence of Retinoic Acid (RA) and TGF-{beta}. This combination of stimuli primed naive CD4+T cells to adopt a TRM phenotype. However, to fully differentiate into TRMs an additional soluble factor provided by memory T cells was required. Our results identified IL-6 as a key factor that induces the expression of TRM -associated markers, including CD69, CD103 and CCR5. This unique combination of stimuli promoted TRM differentiation despite low level proliferation. TRM differentiation was mediated through JAK/STAT signaling, and antagonists that target JAK/STAT pathways suppressed MAdCAM-1 mediated TRM cell formation. Our findings revealed that MAdCAM-1 works together with TGF-{beta}, RA and IL-6 in this process.  Such information may aid in the design of next generation adjuvants and effective mucosal vaccines.

The recent cryoEM study of Fontimonas thermophila AlkB-AlkG complex (FtAlkBG) revealed its architecture, including a dodecane (D12) substrate in the diiron active site. However, the molecular mechanism of action of FtAlkBG remains unknown. Here, we examined the FtAlkBG dynamics and interactions by multiscale computations, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, elastic network model (ENM), and QM/MM study of the oxidative mechanism at the catalytic site of AlkB. D12 remained stably bound to the catalytic site during MD runs, coordinated by hydrophobic residues I267, L263, L264, and I133, critical to substrate stabilization. MD simulations further showed that D12 could exit the catalytic site via a well-defined translocation pathway gated by I54, S49, and F46, through two intermediate states before nearly leaving the protein, and diffuse back to the active site. Several salt bridges and conserved AlkB-AlkG contacts were enhanced upon substrate binding. Substrate binding also mediated the association/dissociation events required for efficient electron transfer. It promoted tighter coupling between the diiron center in AlkB and the iron in AlkG. The allosteric effects relevant to enzymatic activity regulated by the substrate binding and channeling were further delineated by ENM analysis which confirmed a strong coupling spanning the site of entry from the membrane, the catalytic site and the AlkB-AlkG interface. Our study provides new insights into key sites that could be targeted for developing AlkB-variants with desirable alkane conversion functions.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-actin-based membranous connections-mediate the exchange of diverse cargoes between distant cells. Unlike other cellular protrusions, TNTs exhibit unique ultrastructural features and are enriched in the adhesion molecule N-Cadherin. Here, we dissect the role of N-Cadherin in the formation and function of TNTs in SH-SY5Y human neuronal-like cells. We show that N-Cadherin, via its effectors -Catenin and p120-Catenin, is a central regulator of TNT architecture and their cargo transfer capability. Regulators of cortical tension p120-Catenin, ROCK, and non-muscle myosin II also emerge as critical for TNT functionality, highlighting a mechanosensitive component to TNT regulation. Moreover, we reveal that NMIIA can be processive inside TNTs and transfer through them using actin's retrograde flow. Finally, we identify the Cdc42-IRSp53-N-WASP pathway as a downstream effector axis enhancing intercellular transfer downstream of N-Cadherin. Together, our findings uncover a structural and functional link between N-Cadherin signaling and TNT-mediated intercellular communication.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

A.; Lindner, S. R.; Osho, A. A.; Tessier, S. N.; Rabi, S. A.", "abstract": "Background: Cardiac transplantation is limited by a persistent shortage of donor organs. While hearts donated after circulatory death (DCD) could expand donor pool, their use is hindered by high rates of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) due to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced metabolic injury. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate (BT) to restore metabolic function in cardiomyocytes following I/R. Method: Adult human ventricular cardiomyocytes were used for in vitro cell perfusion (IVCP). Following a period of warm ischemia, butyrate (BT) was introduced into a prechilled UW solution to mimic the standard in situ cold flush performed during heart explant. Cells were then reperfused with cultural media for 1h at 37oC, after which both cells and perfusate were harvested for spectrometric metabolite profiling and molecular analyses using standard methods. Results: BT reprograms cardiac substrate use from glucose to BT, enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, as evidenced by increased lactate clearance and upregulated mitochondrial BT-oxidation enzymes. This metabolic shift restores redox balance by elevating NAD+/NADPH pool and reducing ADP/ATP ratio, while suppressing histone deacetylation and promoting gene expression linked to mitochondrial biogenesis, damage repair, recycling, and turnover via enhanced mitofusion and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. BT subsequently reduces mitochondrial ROS, enhances electron transport chain activity, and preserves oxidative phosphorylation, thereby lowering caspase-3/7 activity, preventing apoptosis, and promoting cardiomyocyte metabolic recovery. Conclusion: BT restores mitochondrial and metabolic function, preserves ATP synthesis after I/R injury, and mitigates metabolic maladaptation, offering strong potential to improve cardiac viability, graft function, and transplantation outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Its impermeable eggshell has restricted the use of small-molecule interventions during embryogenesis. Existing genetic approaches for rendering the embryo permeable to acute small molecule treatment have increased the accessibility of early embryogenesis of pharmacological manipulation but compromise long-term viability for use in studies of later developmental processes or post-exposure physiology. Here, we describe the use of an optimized enzymatic eggshell digestion protocol coupled with a minimal, serum-free culture media that supports the survival and normal development of ex ovo embryos through larval maturation and adulthood. We show that this approach renders embryos permeable to a wide range of small molecules, enabling precise temporal manipulation of developmental processes previously inaccessible through conventional genetic or physical methods. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through the application of small molecule fluorescent dyes, the pharmacological modulation of key cytoskeletal components including microtubules and actin, as well as the minus-end-directed microtubule motor protein dynein, highlighting applications for study of cell division, morphogenesis, and neuronal cell biology, especially in later stages of embryogenesis.

Our analysis shows that published findings on unc-43 function were obtained from studies using numerous loss-of-function alleles, leading to potential challenges in aligning research findings.

Accurately identifying miRNA targets is crucial for understanding miRNA modes of action. To this aim, a plethora of algorithms have been developed to predict miRNA targets, each employing distinct methodologies and relying on different features. The limited overlap among target predictions generated by various algorithms underscores the necessity for comprehensive and independent benchmarks to evaluate their performance. (2) Methods: We selected seven algorithms among the most popular ones to perform a benchmark with an original approach using recently published datasets of miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing at the single-cell level. We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to assess algorithm's capabilities to predict sets of targets statistically anti-correlated in expression with miRNAs. We worked with both co-sequencing datasets of human and mouse single-cells. (3) Results: Our benchmark shows high performances for mirDIP, which corresponds to the consensus result of 24 different algorithms, for human miRNAs. In human cell lines, Diana microT, TargetScan, miRmap, and miRDB also provide excellent results, while RNA22 and miRWalk exhibited poorer results. In mouse primary cells, Diana microT leads, closely followed by miRmap. Intriguingly, RNA22 performs better in mouse primary cells than in human cell lines.

Here, I present an integrated computational pipeline for de novo protein design targeting TEM-171, combining quantum-inspired diffusion models with evolutionary optimization. This dual-platform approach employs RFDiffusion for scaffold generation (n=2048) and BindCraft for interface refinement (n=67), guided by AlphaFold2 structural predictions (mean pLDDT score: 93.2) and ProteinMPNN sequence optimization. The designed inhibitor demonstrates exceptional structural stability (RMSD: 1.2[A]-1.5[A]) and binding affinity ({Delta}G: -12.3 kcal/mol) in microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, with force-displacement profiles revealing peak unbinding forces of 1500-1700 kN/mol. The designed inhibitor maintains stable contacts with critical catalytic residues including Ser70 and maintains conformational integrity across varied physiological conditions (pH 6.5-8.0, 298-310{degrees}K).

N.; Singh, V.; Murphy, P.; Claffey, K.

Aberrant tumor vasculature in the TME limits nutrient and drug delivery, inhibits anti-tumor immunity, and contributes to a lack of cancer therapy efficacy. Utilizing publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, this study characterizes differences between normal breast and breast tumor endothelial cells (EC), provides insights into tumor endothelial cell subtypes, endothelial anergy, and identifies novel, tumor-specific vascular therapeutic targets. Methods: Gene expression data from normal and breast tumor tissue samples were integrated, and the EC subset was extracted via canonical gene marker expression. The EC subset was clustered and evaluated for cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes (DEG). Normal EC (NEC) and tumor EC (TEC) markers were further assessed for correlation to bulk gene expression and patient survival outcomes in cBioPortal and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Cell type gene expression specificity was evaluated in the 3CA single-cell RNA-seq datasets across multiple cancers. Results: This analysis revealed differences in NEC and TEC subtype populations. Breast NEC contained similar proportions of venule and capillary populations, while breast TEC demonstrated a majority of the venule subtype. Further, TEC venules were phenotypically distinct from the NEC venules. Consistent with endothelial anergy, suppression of the key adhesion protein SELE was noted, as well as several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL6, CCL2, and CXCL8, likely downstream of aberrant NF-kB signaling. Differential gene expression analysis identified several TEC specific up-regulated genes compared to NEC, including CLEC14a, IGFBP4, EMCN, and ADM5. CLEC14a, EMCN, and ADM5 were further validated in the single-cell Curated Cancer Cell Atlas (3CA) to be highly specific to the endothelial cell clusters across multiple tumor types, while IGFBP4 was diversely expressed in endothelial, fibroblast, and some malignant cell types. ADM5, a novel tumor vascular marker, was enhanced in TEC venules and less so in arteriole or capillaries. High expression of ADM5 was associated with poor breast cancer patient survival in the basal PAM50 cancer subtype compared to normal and luminal subtypes. Further, across multiple cancer types, high ADM5 expression was associated with reduced patient survival in anti-PD1- and anti-CTLA4-treated patients but not in anti-PDL-treated patients. Conclusions: Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data identified an anergic-like response in breast TEC and multiple, highly specific markers to TEC not found in normal breast tissue. CLEC14a and EMCN were validated as TEC markers, extending their annotation in breast TEC, and implicated ADM5 as a novel TEC marker in breast and other cancers. These TEC markers have potential relevance as specific TEC biomarkers or anti-angiogenic targets. Moreover, as ADM5 is associated with reduced patient overall survival, this data suggests that a better understanding of ADM5 and other TEC-specific response pathways may provide novel approaches to reactivate anergic TECs and lead to effective therapeutic interventions for cancer patients.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, the majority of cancer cells are non-mitotic and must be analyzed in interphase, where it is difficult to discern extrachromosomal amplifications from chromosomal amplifications. Thus, there is a need for methods that accurately predict oncogene amplification status from interphase cells.

In this study, we analyzed the expressed proteins of clonal cell lines to identify intrinsic characteristics of effective IAV producers. We compared proteome changes in two IAV-infected monoclonal suspension MDCK cell lines: C59, a low-yield IAV producer with fast cell growth and small cell diameter, and C113, a high-yield IAV producer with average cell growth and large cell diameter. We examined growth rate, size, metabolism and IAV production. A total of 5177 host cell proteins were detected in both cell lines using DIA-PASEF mode with a TimsTOFpro mass spectrometer. Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that fatty acid oxidation and branched-chain amino acid degradation were upregulated in highly productive cells. In contrast, steroid biosynthesis and DNA replication were more active in faster-growing cells. Following infection, 122 proteins were significantly upregulated (p<0.05, log2-fold change [&ge;]1) in the high-producing cell line. These proteins were associated with membrane trafficking, interactions with the IAV-NS1 protein and virus production.

In the high-yield C113 clone, only proteins associated with apoptosis and the target of rapamycin kinase (TOR) were expressed following infection.

In reptiles, these deformities are relatively common in captivity, but reports from wild populations are also frequent. Since the 2000s, the number of published cases and affected species has increased considerably. However, most observations still appear as natural history notes or brief reports, often treating spinal deformities as mere curiosities without examining their aetiology, pathology, or prevalence. As a result, we know virtually nothing about the potential ecological impacts of spinal deformities on the life history of affected individuals or populations. Here, based on a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, complemented by unpublished observations gathered through standardized social media inquiries, I present the most comprehensive database and review of spinal deformities in wild reptiles to date. I identified 351 observations from 139 sources, covering 103 species across 24 families and 35 countries. Unpublished observations accounted for 13.3% of the database. Spinal deformities appear across all major reptile clades, though Testudines are clearly overrepresented (59.8%), likely due to their greater popularity, visibility, and research attention compared to other groups. Prevalence data were available or could be extracted from 51 records (36 species). A phylogenetic meta-analysis revealed a global prevalence effect size of 0.23%. However, no significant effects of phylogeny, habitat use strategy, or habitat type were detected, though this may reflect limitations of the dataset. Kyphosis appeared more frequently in (semi)aquatic Testudines than in primarily terrestrial squamates, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for scoliosis. Nonetheless, the underrepresentation of (semi)aquatic squamate taxa in the dataset urges caution when interpreting these phylogenetic inferences. Spinal deformities may substantially impact key life-history traits such as survival, growth, and reproduction, but direct evidence remains scarce and mostly anecdotal. To enhance ecological relevance, future studies should adopt more detailed and standardized reporting, incorporating occurrence frequency, habitat characteristics, morphometrics, imaging data, and assessments of behavioural or locomotor limitations.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In its invasive range, An. stephensi larvae have been found to colonize artificial containers, many of which are shared with Aedes aegypti. The success of Ae. aegypti as an invasive vector is often attributed to the use of artificial containers and the ability of Ae. aegypti eggs to remain viable in the absence of water for months. While An. stephensi is found in artificial containers, it is unclear whether the eggs can remain viable without water for extended periods. Anopheles stephensi eggs were reported to remain viable in soil for up to 12 days in a study done almost 100 years ago, but this work has not been revisited since. Thus, in this present study, we used egg batches (>100 eggs per batch) from two laboratory strains of An. stephensi (SDA500 and STE2) from South Asia and one Ae. aegypti strain (LVP-IB12) to evaluate 1) whether An. stephensi eggs can remain viable like Ae. aegypti when egg substrates are completely dried following standard insectary methods for drying out Aedes aegypti egg sheets, and 2) assess egg viability duration at varying temperatures (15C, 20C, 25C 30C, 35C) when eggs are held on a moistened substrate in a high humidity environment. Anopheles stephensi egg viability and subsequent larval survival was observed consistently when moistened egg sheets were held at 15C in a high humidity (>75% RH) environment for up to 14 days in both strains. Anopheles stephensi eggs were not viable when dried following standard insectary Aedes aegypti methods for drying out egg sheets, except when the protocol was amended to include a 15C storage temperature. Though egg viability and larval survival was observed in the amended protocol for SDA500 and STE2 (16% and 21% respectively), it was significantly less than that of LVP-IB12 (83%) and was only observed in the egg batches stored for the shortest timepoint (seven days post egg collection, three days post complete drying of egg sheets). These findings suggest that An. stephensi may remain viable if eggs are transported under ideal conditions (15C and >75% RH) through trade or commerce routes. Thus, the persistence of An. stephensi eggs in the absence of water should be considered in programs that engage in surveillance and control of An. stephensi in Africa.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Climate change is reshaping Antarctic ecosystems, forcing cold-adapted species to migrate to maintain their climatic niche. The study surveyed the circum Antarctic lecideoid lichen diversity and modelled the impacts of two climate change scenarios on their distributional range shifts across Antarctica. Myco- and photobiont symbionts of lecideoid lichen species from a circum-Antarctic sampling were classified using classical barcoding methods. The climatic niches of nine common mycobiont species and four photobiont OTUs were modelled, and range shifts were projected across four Antarctic bioregions under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: (a) SSP1-2.6: sustainable development (2.6 Wm-2, +3 deg C) and (b) SSP5-8.5: continued dependence on fossil fuels (8.5 Wm-2, +5.1 deg C). DNA barcoding revealed altogether 34 species of lecideoid lichens and 9 photobiont OTUs for the Antarctic continent. In addition to the already known lichen species in Antarctica, three newly detected species of the genus Lecidella could be identified. The calculated climate change scenarios across bioregions predict greater range expansion for mycobiont species and photobiont OTUs than climate-induced habitat loss. While niche contraction is expected in maritime Antarctica, species distributions are expected to expand in continental regions, primarily due to inland shifts. These inland areas may serve as emerging climatic refugia for certain mycobiont species. Overall, these results suggest that, under future warming, lecideoid lichens undergo an overall range expansion, particularly in previously uncolonized inland areas in continental Antarctica.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

ELISA clonal binding assays to anti-A/B antibodies confirmed the functional performance of ABO-clones and aligned with next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the mixed clones.

Comparison of antibody binding responses in sera from 31 healthy donors to ABO-LiGA with an ABO-Luminex-based method revealed consistent responses to LiGA-ABO but also minor deficiencies of ABO-LiGA such as low robustness of the current assay format and a limited ability to detect low intensity antibody responses. Some results point to undesired interactions of serum antibodies with small-footprint glycans conjugated to phage via the bulky DBCO moiety.

B.; Ahmed, J. O.; Veyrier, F.

Shotgun metagenomics may address these hypotheses, which previously relied on PCR or culture. However, the problem of determining the presence/absence of a given species of interest is not trivial, particularly when closely related species are present in the reference database or metagenomic sample. Reference-based methods to detect species-level taxa mostly rely on thresholding of aligned reads or mapped k-mers or derivative metrics like genomic coverage, and create a tradeoff between recall/completeness and precision/purity. Three methods for species-level profiling (YACHT, metapresence and sylph) have recently been published. Here we test the performance of these methods to detect related species of interest using simulated metagenomic samples from genomes in the families Mycobacteriaceae and Neisseriaceae, which contain closely related genomes. Among methods tested, metapresence, when used with an alignment quality filter, and sylph offer the best overall performance. Sylph maintains high precision but requires a depth of coverage greater than approximately 0.1x to reliably detect a genomes presence. Metapresence has a lower limit of detection of hundreds of reads but this is balanced against relatively lower precision. Both methods are robust to the presence of reads from genomes outside the groups of interest.

The framework leverages our established method of transforming gene expression data into two-dimensional structured images for use with convolutional neural networks by effectively capturing both global and fine-grained transcriptomic features, overcoming the limitations of flat classification approaches that ignore hierarchical relationships between cell types. scHDeepInsight dynamically adjusts loss contributions to balance performance across the hierarchy levels.

Using 94 representative individuals spanning Eurasia and North Africa, we recovered two deeply divergent sister lineages (Eastern and Western Palearctic), with cytonuclear discordances suggesting historical plastid capture events in the western group. Admixture analysis revealed four genetic clusters, including signatures of secondary contact and hybridization in the Western lineage. Filtered ITS sequences of E. sylvatica recovered from holobiont genome skimming reads enabled phylogenetic reconstruction, revealing two fungal clades that broadly mirror their host's evolutionary history in the West. PACo and ParaFit analyses supported partial co-divergence between hosts and endophytes. ENM projections identified climatically stable glacial refugia for both B. sylvaticum main lineages during the Last Glacial Maximum and asymmetric postglacial expansion, with moderate niche shifts in the West and stronger turnover in the East. Evidence of niche overlap and similarity indicated niche conservatism among clades, suggesting that geographic isolation, rather than adaptive divergence, was the primary driver of lineage splitting. IBD and IBE patterns significantly influenced divergences in the Western, but not the Eastern, group, highlighting contrasting demographic and ecological dynamics.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of the DREAM(ZS) algorithm, a multi-chain adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for generating VPop. Using the Van De Pas model of cholesterol metabolism as a case study, we compare DREAM(ZS) to the single-chain Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm introduced by Rieger et al. Our comparison focuses on convergence behavior, parametric diversity, and posterior coverage, in relation to the ability of each method to explore complex parameter distributions and maintain correlations. DREAM(ZS) demonstrates superior exploration of the parameter space, reducing boundary accumulation effects common in traditional MH sampling, and restoring parameter correlation structures. These advantages are attributed in part to its adaptive proposal mechanism and the use of a bias-corrected likelihood formulation, which together contribute to a better parameters space sampling without compromising model fit.

However, 5-azaC treatment causes gene dysregulation inconsistent with DNA hypomethylation changes, suggesting alternative mechanisms of action by 5-azaC. As a ribonucleoside analogue, 5-azaC is more readily incorporated into nascent RNA. Here, we demonstrate that RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) depletion by 5-azaC treatment, particularly at early time points, is sufficient to induce leukemia cell death. In contrast to its DNA demethylation function, the RNA-dependent effect of 5-azaC causes transcriptional repression, disrupting genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Mechanistically, 5-azaC impairs two specific m5C-mediated transcriptional regulatory pathways. First, depletion of m5C in chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) disrupts the MBD6-mediated H2AK119ub deubiquitination. In parallel, this also impairs SRSF2 recruitment and the downstream H3K27ac deposition by p300. Indeed, loss of the caRNA methyltransferase NSUN2 caused prolonged cell cycle, defective DNA repair, and shifted hematopoietic lineage commitment toward erythropoiesis, mirroring the effects of 5-azaC treatment. Furthermore, we performed a leukemia cell line screen and identified that TET2 and IKZF1 depletion can sensitize 5-azaC treatment, consistent with the observed RNA-dependent cytotoxicity of 5-azaC in leukemic cells.

While previous studies have highlighted very slow recovery of pollination networks in ecological restoration, the reassembly process of plant communities focusing on floral traits that influence pollination networks remains underexplored. We hypothesised that plant species with flowers that allow visits by various pollinators (generalist flowers) would recover more easily than those with flowers which limit pollinators (specialist flowers) during grassland restoration. We investigated floral trait assemblages, interaction patterns with pollinators, and pollination success for each floral trait (floral tube and colour) across 28 pollination networks. We examined their temporal change patterns within restored grasslands (2-75 years old) and compared them with reference old grasslands (>165 years old). Our results revealed that generalist (open/shallow and white/yellow) flowers have recovered rapidly, interacting with many pollinator species with similar traits in the early stages of restoration. In contrast, specialist (long-tubed and blue/purple) flowers exhibited more delayed recovery due to low pollination success, taking approximately 75 years for the recovery to the levels of reference old grasslands. Importantly, we found that functional specialisation was crucial for the recovery of these specialist flowers. Corresponding to temporal changes in floral trait assemblages, pollinator composition has shifted from dipteran dominance to a greater abundance of long-tongued bees, with interaction patterns of each trait group approaching those of old grasslands. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of floral trait reassembly in influencing temporal changes in pollinator community, network structure, and pollination function during grassland restoration.

To assess and mitigate zoonotic hazards in these ecosystems, we analyzed 1,549 individuals from 18 small mammal species sampled along a forest anthropization gradient using both targeted and broad-spectrum serological and molecular methods. We detected nine bacteria and several Apicomplexa that are potentially pathogenic to humans. Zoonotic pathogen richness and community composition varied significantly across host species, sites and sampling periods. Richness was lower in forested urban parks, possibly due to the absence of vectors or intermediate hosts within cities. It was higher in urban adapter species, even within a given forested habitat, emphasizing the important role of specific life-history traits. Pathogen community structure was similarly shaped by forest anthropization and host ecology, with marked differences between urban and rural forested environments and between urban adapter and dweller species within forested urban parks. The (sero-)prevalence of key pathogens (e.g., Bartonella, Orthopoxvirus, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Sarcocystidae) showed spatial, temporal, and host-specific variation. Site-level differences often exceeded those between general habitat types, highlighting the importance of local ecological context. Nevertheless, some patterns reflected the influence of forest anthropization and species urban adaptation strategies for certain zoonotic agents. Forest anthropization had a positive impact on Bartonella prevalence, for urban adapter species within parks, emphasizing a potential dilution effect of these pathogens.

How evolution shapes gene composition as pathogens compete for hosts remains largely unexplored, even though these two trait axes map to those of Modern Coexistence Theory. We address this question with a stochastic computational model for the transmission of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite and the birth-death gene dynamics of the var multigene family encoding for its major surface antigen. Selection alone cannot maintain the stable ratio observed for two gene groups within parasite genomes, suggesting that group-based classifications do not clearly reflect transmission strategy and virulence. When a trade-off exists between the two axes, strong immune selection attenuates functional selection for traits associated with absolute fitness and favors fast-recombining genes for antigenic diversification. Thus, the proportion of high-R0 genes in individual genomes (and in the population) inverts along the transmission intensity gradient, with differences between genes becoming increasingly frequency-dependent. Overall, strong immune selection increases invasion probability of novel antigens and niche differences between parasite genomes, while reducing gene variance in transmissibility, virulence and infection duration.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

The precision of prediction is constrained by the heritability of the target trait when applying a single-trait genomic prediction model. To overcome this limitation, a multi-trait genomic prediction model leveraging high-heritability secondary traits co-heritable with the target trait can boost predictive ability for the target trait. However, this is practically challenging because it requires additional phenotyping effort and prior knowledge of trait co-heritability. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of multi-trait genomic prediction models powered by secondary traits derived from high-throughput phenotyping data when predicting important leaf functional target traits, i.e., nitrogen (N) content and specific leaf area (SLA) in diverse sorghum accessions. Since these traits can be predicted from hyperspectral reflectance data, there is significant potential for other wavelengths within the existing dataset to meet the criteria needed to improve prediction accuracy using multi-trait approaches. Therefore, experiments were performed on traditional direct measures of leaf N content and SLA, plus partial least squares regression predictions of them (Leaf N-PLSR, SLA-PLSR), i.e., four target traits in total. Three secondary, \"synthetic traits\" (S1, S2, S3), each a ratio of two wavelengths within the hyperspectral data, were identified based on high co-heritability with a given target trait. Single-trait GBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor) was fitted as a baseline model, followed by three multi-trait GBLUP models using synthetic traits and target traits together. Model performance was assessed using k-fold (k=5) cross-validation (CV), which consisted of single-trait, CV1, and CV2 schemes. The synthetic traits' high genetic correlation and heritability met the requirements for their use as secondary traits. There was a significant increase in accuracy when synthetic traits were used in the multi-trait genomic prediction model compared to a single trait alone for all four target traits. It improved prediction accuracy while using secondary traits derived from hyperspectral high-throughput phenotyping data in the multi-trait genomic prediction model, suggesting that this approach could be broadly applied in a post-hoc fashion to many datasets without any additional phenotyping effort.

In spatially resolved transcriptomics, delineating higher-order anatomical structures is critical for understanding how cellular organization affects tissue and organ function. Since 2020, more than 50 spatially aware clustering (SAC) methods have been developed for this purpose. However, the reliability of current benchmarks is undermined by their narrow focus on Visium and brain tissue datasets, as well as incorrect interpretation of manual annotation as ground truth. Here, we present SACCELERATOR, a community-driven, extensible framework that standardizes data formatting, method integration, and metric evaluation, and is designed to rapidly incorporate new methods and datasets. SACCELERATOR currently includes 22 SAC methods applied to 15 datasets spanning 9 technologies and diverse tissue types. Our analysis revealed substantial limitations in the generalizability and reproducibility of SAC methods across tissues and platforms. We also demonstrate that anatomical labels commonly used as ground truths are often biased, potentially error-prone, and, in some cases, unsuitable for benchmarking efforts. Rather than scoring and comparing methods, we propose a consensus-guided workflow that aggregates clustering results to generate consensus representations. Descriptive spatial metrics highlight areas of high entropy where method disagreement is highest, enabling targeted feedback for tissue experts.

We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation.

Although FDA-approved FLT3 inhibitors exist, their clinical efficacy is often undermined by resistance and off-target effects, underscoring the critical necessity for more effective and selective agents. Here, we employed a structure-based computational approach combining pharmacophore screening via Pharmit and the MolPort compound library to identify novel FLT3 inhibitors. Pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, and docking identified two promising leads, MolPort-002-705-878 and MolPort-007-550-904, with binding affinities of -11.33 and -10.66 kcal/mol, correspondingly. These compounds were further characterized through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA), free energy landscape (FEL) analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ADMET profiling. MD results supported the integrity of the FLT3-lead complexes; DFT revealed favorable reactivity, and ADMET predictions indicated drug-likeness with low toxicity, pending experimental confirmation.

As these technologies have advanced, there have been changes in device shape and surface coating to enhance aneurysm embolization while reducing stent thrombogenicity. Drug eluting stents have been used with great success in the targeted delivery of rapamycin, a mTOR complex 1 inhibitor to prevent restenosis in coronary and peripheral artery disease. However, few studies have investigated the use of coils and stents as delivery platforms for sustained drug release to cerebral aneurysm tissue. In this study, we used the bio-compatible and degradable polymers, gelatin and PLGA and a simple evaporative coating technique to investigate the release of rapamycin over time from coated platinum coils and Pipeline flow diverting stents. Rapamycin coated coils were incubated with human vascular endothelial cells in vitro to confirm therapeutic levels of rapamycin release. The rate of rapamycin release was similar in both gelatin and PLGA coated coils and was sustained for more than three weeks. Rapamycin was bioactive, at a therapeutic dose and inhibited mTOR complex 1 in human brain endothelial cells treated with a rapamycin coated coil. The relative degree of mTOR complex 1 inhibition was greater in PLGA compared to gelatin coated coils. Coating flow diverting stents with a rapamycin-PLGA coating demonstrated continuous rapamycin release over a 35 day period. Reducing the percent PLGA polymer concentration caused a robust and sustainable release of rapamycin. The PLGA coating was resilient enough to allow device recapturing without affecting rapamycin eluting rates or device deployment and expansion.

Although the impact of donor age on reprogramming efficiency has been studied, its effect on the functionality of hiPSC-derived endothelial progenitors (hiPSC-EPs) remains unclear. This question is the focus of the current study. Methods and Results: We derived EPs from iPSCs sourced from three neonatal donors (ND) and three mature donors (MD) matched 1:1 for sex and somatic cell origin. We assessed their functional, epigenetic, and transcriptomic characteristics. Despite higher CD34? yields from MD-iPSCs, MD-hiPSC-EPs formed poorly interconnected and non-lumenized vascular structures in 3D hydrogels, compared to neonatal donor (ND) lines. In 2D culture, MD-hiPSC-EPs exhibited reduced cell density and aberrant VE-Cadherin localization. DNA methylation analysis revealed that somatic cell origin was the dominant driver of variance, but consistent differences in methylation of mesoderm commitment, angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, and cytoskeleton-related genes were observed between age groups. Epigenetic age prediction showed MD-hiPSC-EPs had more developmentally advanced signatures, potentially explaining their shift away from vasculogenic competence. Our RNA-sequencing findings confirm trends seen in the DNA methylation data and show differential expression of pathways linked to mitochondrial regulation and nitric oxide signaling. Conclusions: Donor age significantly alters the vasculogenic function of hiPSC-EPs. These findings underscore the necessity of donor-specific considerations in hiPSC-based vascular engineering and highlight potential barriers to translating hiPSC-derived therapeutics into aged patient populations.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Receivers contain five conserved active site residues that catalyze phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Some protein domains identified computationally as receivers (PF00072) lack one or more of the five key conserved residues and are termed pseudoreceivers (PsRs). Because receivers are among the most abundant protein domains in nature, PsRs are also common. PsRs are especially common in plants, where they control circadian rhythms. Little is known about PsRs in fungi and archaea. Here, we focused on bacterial PsRs. We created representative datasets of 9,153 PsR and 143,116 true receiver domain sequences from bacteria. Comparison of amino acid composition of PsR and true receiver domains at each position showed (i) many differences at positions known to be important for phosphorylation-mediated signaling in true receiver domains, consistent with diminished importance in PsRs; and (ii) greatest differences between PsR and true receiver domains in the {beta}33 and {beta}44 loops, potentially highlighting functionally important regions of PsRs.

E.; Rahmann, S.", "abstract": "When working with sequence data of human microbiomes, the first step in most analysis pipelines is the removal of human contamination. There are two reasons why the removal of human reads is a critical step in microbiome data analysis. First, many countries have strict privacy and data protection guidelines for human sequencing data. This means that microbiome data containing partly human data cannot be processed outside a hospital and cannot be published. The second and from a biological view more important reason is that human contamination may cause problems in later analysis steps, such as genome assembly and binning. Current tools are either alignment- or k-mer based. In alignment based methods, all reads are aligned against the human reference and classified as human contamination based on the alignment score of the reads. However, the alignment step needs a significant amount of time. In contrast, k-mer based tools are usually faster, because they classify the reads by querying all k-mers of the reads in an efficient reference k-mer database. We introduce Cleanifier, a fast and lightweight alignment-free tool to detect and remove human contamination. For this, we create an pangenome index of all human gapped k-mers, also called spaced seeds, that is made available online via Zenodo. If users are interesting in microbiome data from other hosts, they can alternatively build their own index using other reference genomes. In the filtering step, we query all k-mers of a read in the index and classify it as human based on the fraction of read base pairs covered by a k-mer.

T.", "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells represent a potent, programmable therapeutic that repurposes T cell cytotoxicity toward target cell elimination. Direct killing of tumor cells has been demonstrated in several cancer contexts but deficits in destroying solid tumors have been attributed to molecular and mechanical complexity. Understanding and predicting the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy requires a rigorous framework to capture the mechanistic interactions between immune cells and tumor targets. Toward enumerating such features and to quantitatively describe tumor cell survival in response to CAR T cell visitation, we propose a parametric hazard rate model for the right-censored conditional lifetime of a tumor cell, having the form of a time-discounted integral of cell:cell engagement. The model, conditioned using data on the numbers, durations, and modes of contacts made during the stochastic encounters between the two cell types, extracts mechanistic details from the experiments. We suggest two types of parameters to encapsulate features of CAR T cell killing potency ({kappa}) and the resilience of the tumor ({gamma}), respectively. These parsimonious parameters, nevertheless, generate substantial insights. Firstly, phenotypic heterogeneity from interactions mediated by substrate-engaged CAR T cells dominate killing outcomes, while those initiated in suspension contribute minimally. This emphasizes that a subset of the CAR T cell population is dominating the population outcome. Secondly, the model can be used to predict the killing as a function of time upon perturbation of the system. In this case, biasing the arrival process, toward more engagement in the adherent mode, can tune the rate of killing. Collectively, insights from the model framework imply that CAR T cell accumulation and killing efficiency depend not on the sum of individual T cell interactions, but rather on the weighted, time-dependent sum of heterogeneous interactions that are environmentally modulated. The model facilitates predictive insights into how contact sequences modulate CAR T cell responses and may provide strategies to alter therapeutic regimens.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Understanding how this dynamics changes when organisms are adapted to different thermal niches is a fundamental challenge in microbiology and biophysics. In Escherichia coli, protein diffusion under- goes a pronounced slowdown at temperatures near cellular death, coinciding with the early stages of unfolding. To determine whether this phenomenon is universal, we investigated psychrophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria. In both species, a marked diffusion slowdown takes place at the onset of proteome melting. However, while the dynamic arrest is associated with the thermal death point for the hyperthermophilic proteome, the psychrophilic proteome maintains substantial mobility well beyond the cellular inactivation. The decoupling between metabolic viability and proteome dynamics and stability suggests that the functional processes of psychrophilic bacteria are extremely temperature sensitive. This finding echoes the behaviour of psychrophilic enzymes, manifesting a large temperature gap between optimal activity and unfolding. Protein diffusion is optimised to maintain functional fluidity at the organism working conditions, but its temperature dependence is controlled by the proteome folded state.

Double Electron-Electron Resonance studies confirmed the preservation of AD-like folds across multi-generational seeding.

In this work, we present a unique application of quantum sensing in combined measurements of the power strokes of mutated EF-G and their influence on ribosome translocation steps. Two EF-G mutants, H584K and Q508K, were expressed, with the mutated residues directly interacting with tRNA. H584K, which interacts on codon-anticodon minihelix, produced a much reduced power stroke of 60 {+/-} 6 pN and induced -1 frameshifting, wherein the ribosome translocated only two nucleotides on both sides of the mRNA. In contrast, Q508K, which interacts with tRNA residue 37 immediately outside the codon-anticodon minihelix, exhibited a power stroke of 89 {+/-} 11 pN and maintained canonical 3-nt translocation, similar to wild-type EF-G.

The molecular basis of this extraordinary property arises due to the ability to crosslink glutenin subunits, the major constituent of dough, into linear and branched elastic networks. The mechanism by which the glutenin subunits self-assemble and polymerize is unknown. Here, we show, using mass spectrometry, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations that structuring of two hydrophobic residues, phenylalanine and tyrosine, in the core region of the monomeric glutenin 1Dx5 N-terminal domain (1Dx5-NTD) initiates inter molecular interactions and network formation. Upon folding of monomeric 1Dx5-NTD, two cysteine residues (Cys10 and Cys40) form an intramolecular disulfide bond and poises the third cysteine (Cys25) to engage in inter molecular crosslink with other glutenin subunits. Propagation of such a disulfide linkage pattern results in the formation of a cohesive linear gluten network. In alternate pathways, crosslinking of Cys10 with Cys25 with a third glutenin subunit results in the creation of a junction, which drives the formation of a three-dimensional network. The disulfide patterns in the networks accord well with the measured chemical reactivity of each cysteine residue and the solvent accessibility of the associated side chains during 1Dx5-NTD interactions. Our study shows that the diversity in the folding of a single glutenin subunit that exposes the third cysteine to the solvent is the key event that initiates polymerization and directs the formation of networks with differing architecture.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Surprisingly, the NPs efficiently reduced the outgrowth of Zmel tumoral masses in an experimental metastasis assay in zebrafish embryos regardless of their loading with DOX. The anti-metastatic effect of these NPs was further improved by increasing the amount of HSA coating, also resulting in higher embryo survival. Altogether, IO STMS NPs showed promising cytotoxic effects on a relevant zebrafish metastasis model, inhibiting metastatic outgrowth in vivo independently of the drug loading. This opens the door to further testing for better exploiting their targeting and drug delivery potentialities.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Despite significant progress in the development of promising therapeutic agents, cancer-targeting therapies often fail to achieve effective concentrations in the brain, limiting their therapeutic efficacy. As such, a deeper understanding of how glioblastoma tumours interact with their microenvironment and assess the chemical composition therein can reveal novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of taste receptors, particularly bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) and their ligands in cancer progression and metastasis. Activation of TAS2Rs by both natural and synthetic compounds has been associated with drug resistance, apoptosis, and the proliferation of malignant tumours. The sweet taste receptor TAS1R2/TAS1R3, or the umami receptor TAS1R1/TAS1R3, as recognised sensors of glucose levels and aminoacids, respectively, are also of interest in the context of cancer metabolism. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of TAS2Rs, TAS1R2/TAS1R3 and TAS1R1/TAS1R3 and all the taste signalling pathway machinery in glioblastoma. Our findings demonstrate that TAS1R2/TAS1R3, TAS1R1/TAS1R3, and 20 out of the 26 human TAS2Rs are present and active in glioblastoma cells, with expression differences in glioblastoma cells and human tumours. The expression of such a large number of members of this family of receptors, highlight the significance of the taste transduction pathway in this form of brain cancer, where these receptors might be essential for the crosstalk between glioblastoma and its microenvironment.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Despite its documentation since antiquity and its designation as a World Health Organisation Neglected Tropical Disease in 2023, the microbiological cause of noma remains poorly understood, with no specific organisms confidently identified as definitive aetiological agents. Here, we present the first deep shotgun metagenomic profiling of oral saliva microbiomes from 19 Nigerian children with acute noma. Our analyses reveal marked microbial dysbiosis in noma microbiomes, with machine learning and multivariate statistical analyses indicating significant enrichment of Treponema, Porphyromonas, and Bacteroides, alongside depletion of Streptococcus and Rothia, as key microbial signatures of noma disease. From the dataset we recovered 40 high-quality Treponema metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning 19 species, 14 of which were novel. Notably, a novel species designated Treponema sp. A was detected in 15 of the 19 noma participants and was entirely absent from global healthy saliva metagenomes. Re-analysis of previously published 16S rRNA datasets from children with noma in Niger also revealed Treponema sp. A to be highly prevalent in noma cases but rare in controls. This study identifies Treponema, particularly Treponema sp. A, as a strong candidate organism associated with noma pathogenesis. Additionally, analysis of antimicrobial resistance determinants detected in noma metagenomes revealed concerning levels of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in noma treatment, particularly {beta}-lactams and metronidazole, especially among Prevotella species. These findings provide the first high-resolution microbial framework for noma and offer a foundation for future research into its pathogenesis and the development of novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventive strategies in endemic settings.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

A novel non-antibiotic minocycline derivative, 10-butyl ether minocycline (BEM), was synthesized to retain the pleiotropy of minocycline while minimizing side effects such as antibiotic resistance and gut dysbiosis. Previously, we showed that BEM reduced alcohol consumption in dependent murine and porcine models of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of BEM to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroimmune and inflammatory conditions such as AUD. Here, we report that BEM showed a nearly complete loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. typhi, and C. albicans. BEM showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability as measured by the MTT assay, similarly to MINO. BEM also suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation as shown by reduced Iba1 expression in immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Inhibition of MMP-9 by BEM (IC50 = 42.2 {micro}M) was improved compared to MINO (IC50 = 60.3 {micro}M) while MMP-8 inhibition was moderate (IC50: BEM = 69.4 {micro}M ; MINO = 45.4 {micro}M). BEM was found to be effective in inhibiting VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and L-glutamine-induced ROS levels. Limited inhibition of 15-LOX activity was observed (IC50: BEM = 92.6 {micro}M ; MINO = 65.6 {micro}M). BEM was not toxic to mitochondria, even at high concentrations (200 {micro}M). By eliminating antimicrobial properties while preserving therapeutic pleiotropy, BEM presents an advancement in the development of a promising candidate with multimodal mechanisms to treat neuroimmune-inflammatory pathologies.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Indole, a microbial tryptophan metabolite, has been reported to enhance Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in vitro, and its derivatives have been inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesised that indole acts via the gastrointestinal tract to modulate glucose homeostasis, and aimed to test this hypothesis using in vitro and in vivo models. Methods: The acute effects of indole on GLP-1 secretion in vitro, and on glucose tolerance and hormone secretion in mice, were determined. Subsequently, the effects of indole on intestinal epithelial cell fate and L-cell differentiation in murine ileal organoids and in vivo were studied. Finally, the utility of chronic indole administration in a murine model of T2D was explored. Results: Indole stimulated in vitro GLP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner, and improved acute glucose control in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrate that indole drives enteroendocrine L-cell differentiation in murine ileal organoids, resulting in increased L-cell density and longer-term glucoregulatory benefits in vivo. Finally, sub-chronic indole administration improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice. Conclusions/interpretation: Our findings identify indole as an anti-diabetic molecule that acts on the gut, and raise the possibility of incorporating indole into nutraceutical supplements to aid in the treatment or prevention of T2D. This highlights the importance of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in metabolic health and opens new avenues for developing novel strategies to combat T2D.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a cold-adapted crop particularly sensitive to elevated temperatures, can serve as an ideal model for studying region-specific heat responses in leaves. Using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, we found that non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) kinetics captured additional physiological changes beyond those detected by SPAD, highlighting the added value of chlorophyll fluorescence-based assessments. NPQ kinetics traits displayed consistent spatial gradients from tip to base, with heat stress reducing NPQ induction across leaf gradients. Genome-wide association analysis of traits derived from chlorophyll fluorescence imaging across leaf gradients identified significant SNPs within multiple candidate genes, including HORVU.MOREX.r3.3HG0262630 that was consistently detected in over 90% resampling iterations under heat stress, suggesting its key role during heat responses. Transcriptomic profiling along the leaf axis revealed both conserved and region-specific heat responses between leaf regions. Conserved activations highlighted conserved heat response pathways, including the reactivation of the Arabidopsis thermomemory module FtsH6-HSP21. In contrast, the region-by-temperature interaction analysis identified 40 genes with spatial responses indicative of resource reallocation from growth to defense, including those involved in growth and transport.

Here, a non-ribosomal peptide synthase-like (PtNRPS1, with an unusual domain structure A-T-R1-R2) gene was found to play a vital role in short-term nitrogen assimilation in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In vitro biochemical assays and in vivo overexpression confirmed that PtNRPS1 catalyzed two sequential two-electron reductions of L-tryptophan to tryptophanol. Tryptophanol exhibits high structural and functional similarities to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the most typical phytohormone auxin. Surprisingly, the effective concentration of tryptophanol was lower than that of IAA by as much as 2-5 orders of magnitude for P. tricornutum. Compared with the action of IAA, a distinct molecular mode for tryptophanol was revealed by transcriptomic analysis, resulting mainly in enhanced short-term nitrogen assimilation, which was also confirmed by the elevated nitrogen uptake rates determined by stable-isotope tracking. Finally, global distribution of PtNRPS1 homologues from stramenopiles was found to be positively correlated with the abundance of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation pathways. Overall, our study provides evidence of an auxin-like derivative synthesized by an NRPS in a diatom.

A deep understanding of this process can secure healthy growth at the early phases of plant development and therefore the yield. Recent research indicates that germination is a complex process involving translational regulation. A large group of seed stored mRNAs together with newly synthesized transcripts are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms and selectively translated at different stages to support the germination process. To investigate the mechanism of translational control, we performed ribosome profiling on mRNAs of distinct physiological stages during Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination. The 3-nucleotide periodicity of the ribosome association on mRNAs identified indicates their translational potential. Dry seeds, in which translation is on hold are characterized by a unique ribosome association landscape with high association at the 5 and 3 prime UTR, compared to physiological stages that show active translation. Start codon specific stalling of ribosomes in dry seeds is associated with an adenine enriched sequence motif. Throughout germination codons encoding glycine, aspartate, tyrosine and proline are the most frequent ribosome pausing sites. Moreover, the non-coding RNAs which we identified as associated to ribosomes are indeed translated as was revealed by investigating total seed proteome data. Seed specific upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) are identified which may be associated to translational control of adaptative response during early seed germination. Altogether, we present a first ribosome profiling analysis across seed germination that illuminates various regulatory mechanisms that potentially contribute to the seeds survival strategy.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Vaccine responses depend on the Darwinian evolution of B-cells to generate high-affinity, genetically-encoded antibodies, yet B-cell decision-making is non-genetically variable. In fact, B-cell epigenetic states are fragile during selection but stable during the proliferation burst. Here we report that the iterative dynamics of epigenetic fragility and stability of B-cell fate decisions do not impair but accelerate affinity maturation, by modulating the generation and removal of high-affinity outliers on a fitness landscape that is non-monotonic defined not only by survival/proliferation but plasma cell differentiation. These insights reconcile classical B-cell clonal selection theory with experimentally observed dynamics of epigenetic variability.

Atrial fibrosis leads to reduced atrial function, resulting in diminished blood flow and an increased risk of stroke. This reduced function arises from altered myocardial electrophysiological and mechanical properties. Identifying the relative importance of these fibrosis-associated properties can reveal the most significant determinants of left atrial function impairment. In this study, we used a computational framework to investigate the relative importance of various fibrosis-associated properties. Our model, a 3D electromechanical framework coupled with a 0D circulatory model, incorporated patient-specific geometries and fibrosis distributions from clinical imaging data. Nine parameters related to fibrotic remodeling (conduction velocity, ion channel expression levels, cell- and tissue-scale contractility, and stiffness) were analyzed using two sensitivity analysis schemes: a one-factor-at-a-time setup, allowing for the analysis of isolated effects, and a fractional factorial design, enabling the examination of combined effects. As output, we tracked various metrics derived from model-predicted pressure-volume loops. Impairment of L-type calcium current (ICaL) was most detrimental (up to 64% reduction in A-loop area). Conversely, reduced inward rectifier current (IK1) led to improved atrial function (up to 27% increase in A-loop area). Fractional factorial design analysis revealed that combination with other parameter changes blunted the impact of reduced ICaL but amplified the impact of reduced IK1. Further analysis of spatiotemporal distributions linked these effects to changes in intracellular calcium handling. Future research focusing on IK1 and ICaL could be highly significant for clinical and scientific advances. Modeling work can potentially help evaluate left atrial function among larger patient cohorts, focusing on strain analysis.

It receives ascending auditory input and projects to the superior olivary complex. Further insight into TLCv function has been hampered by limited information on its connections.

Deposit of retrograde tracer into the superior olivary complex labels cells bilaterally in the TLCv, comparable to results seen in rats. Viral labeling of neuronal projections demonstrate input to the TLCv from the superior olivary complex and from the inferior colliculus. Thus, the TLCv in mice has inputs and outputs similar to those described in rats. Additional experiments with retrograde tracers revealed more extensive outputs from the TLCv. Neurons in the TLCv are labeled after deposit of retrograde tracers into the cochlear nucleus or into the inferior colliculus. The projections from the TLCv to these targets, like those to the superior olivary complex, are bilateral. These projections are much broader than those described previously.

We find that heterozygous knock-in of a MPN CALR mutation into human cell lines maintains or slightly induces surface expression of HLA class I allotypes. However, full deficiency of wild-type CRT variably reduces the surface expression of HLA class I allotypes, and MPN CRT mutants fail to restore expression for all tested allotypes. Consistent with the largely heterozygous nature of CALR mutations in MPN, surface HLA class I expression in platelets and monocytes from MPN patients with CALR mutations generally falls within the normal range, with higher average expression measured in monocytes from patients treated with interferon alpha compared with other treatments. Overall, the studies indicate that loss of HLA class I expression in cells deficient in wild-type CRT (the CRT dependency) is allele-dependent and correlates with known effects of the assembly factor tapasin.

Historically, treatment of MS has relied on disease-modifying therapies that involve immunosuppression, such as targeting of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to restrict lymphocyte movement. New therapeutic ideas in the development pipeline are instead designed to promote populations of myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes, by exploiting their innate resilience to the stressors of MS or restoring their numbers. Given the significant advancements made in immunological disease understanding due to mathematical and computational modelling, we sought to develop a platform to (1) interrogate our understanding of the neuroimmunological mechanisms driving MS development and (2) examine the impact of different therapeutic strategies. To this end we propose a novel, open-source, agent-based model of lesion development in the CNS. Our model includes crucial populations of T cells, perivascular macrophages, and oligodendrocytes. We examine the sensitivity of the model to key parameters related to disease targets and conclude that lesion stabilisation can be achieved when targeting the integrated stress response of oligodendrocytes. Most significantly, complete prevention of lesion formation is observed when a combination of approved BBB-permeability targeting therapies and integrated-stress response targeting therapies is administered, suggesting the potential to strike a balance between a patients immune inflammation and their reparative capacity.

While Gcn5, a subunit of the SAGA complex, and Esa1, a subunit of NuA4 complex, are critical for C. albicans virulence and hyphal induction, how the relative HAT activities impinge on hyphal gene expression during filamentation is less understood. We found that hyphal gene promoters are hyperacetylated at H3Lys9 and H4 upon filamentation. By creating point mutants in the HAT domains, we investigated the relative requirement of the SAGA and NuA4 HAT activities for filamentation response. We show that the Gcn5 HAT activity is essential for hyperacetylation of H3Lys9Ac and H4Ac at the promoters and the gene body. Surprisingly, Esa1 HAT domain mutation did not impair H4 acetylation at hyphal genes suggesting that Gcn5 HAT activity is sufficient for H4 (and H3K9) acetylation. Paradoxically, the Esa1 HAT mutant formed filaments constitutively and showed elevated H3Lys9Ac and H4Ac at promoters under inducing conditions.

Here, we conducted integrated and spatial analyses of transcriptomes, aneuploidy, and clinic-pathological features in 166 ovarian precancerous lesions. Four pre-cancerous subtypes were identified transcriptomically: proliferative, immunoreactive, dormant, and mixed. These subtypes varied in their frequency of germline-BRCA1/2 mutations, aneuploidy, CCNE1/MYC amplification, proliferative activity, immune-regulatory gene expression, and histological features. Notably, the immunoreactive subtype upregulated immune-regulatory genes, exhibited chronic inflammation, and was enriched in cases with germline-BRCA1/2 mutations, deletions of chromosomes 17 (harboring TP53 and BRCA1) and 13 (harboring BRCA2), leading to a double 'two-hit' involving TP53 and BRCA1/2. Tumor invasion was associated with the activation of interferon response pathways, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In summary, our results elucidate the earliest molecular landscape of ovarian precancerous lesions, serving as the foundation for future risk stratification to identify aggressive pre-cancerous lesions.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

COMSOL simulations and optical calibration using FITC-dextran confirmed that gradients form reliably within 5 minutes. The microdevice also supports long-term live imaging and is compatible with both spinning disk confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence structured illumination microscopy modalities, enabling high-resolution visualization of adhesion and endocytic structures. Localized application of the endocytic inhibitor Dyngo-4a to the front or rear of migrating cells revealed that front-targeted inhibition significantly increased the enrichment of paxillin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2 at the leading edge, whereas rear-targeted inhibition completely abolished their front-rear asymmetry. These changes were accompanied by enhanced migration speed and persistence, particularly under front-targeted inhibition. Together, these findings highlight the critical role of spatially coordinated endocytosis in sustaining polarized adhesion and persistent cell movement. Our platform offers a powerful tool for dissecting subcellular mechanisms of migration under confinement and provides a broadly applicable framework for probing spatially localized signaling in engineered microenvironments.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Migratory species, whose range varies across seasons depending on specific climatic conditions, are particularly sensitive to environmental changes and serve as indicators of ecosystem health. However, current species distribution models often fail to capture the temporal dynamics critical for migratory species, limiting their ability to provide accurate future range estimations. In this study, we address this gap by developing a time-aware deep learning species distribution model for the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic species for biodiversity conservation. Using monarch occurrence records across the Americas gathered from scientific and citizen science sources, we embed the effect of monthly climatic variables in a sequential framework. We compare the performance of our seasonal model to conventional time-static baselines, showing not only better performance in the present, where the models have been trained and validated, but also in the past. Our findings show that climatic factors such as humidity, temperature, precipitation and cloud coverage strongly influence the ecological niche of the monarch butterfly, with notable seasonal and spatial variability. Applying our model under climate change scenarios, we predict a northwestward shift in the monarch range by the end of the XXI century, with expansion in Canada and significant contraction in California and Central America, key sites for overwintering that also host resident monarch populations. These changes could severely impact the species migratory cycle and population stability. Using Shapley values, an explainable AI technique, we identify the decrease in precipitation and humidity as important environmental drivers responsible for the contraction of overwintering sites. By focusing on a species of high ecological relevance through a time-aware modeling approach, this work brings novel insights for the conservation of migratory species in the face of the challenges posed by climate change.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Butterfly wings offer an ideal system to explore these constraints as their evolution is strongly influenced by natural and sexual selection affecting colour patterns and wing shape in relation to visual signalling and flight performance. We focus on Eudamina skippers, butterflies with large-scale phenotypic convergences involving wing shape and colour pattern. Using a comprehensive morphometric dataset encompassing 176 species, we assess their morphological evolution in a phylogenetic framework. We show that hindwing tails and dorsal iridescence, proposed to signal high escape ability, have repeatedly evolved in tropical species. Hindwing tails are associated with intermediate body size, low wing loading and a forewing shape that facilitates manoeuvrability; iridescence is more common in large species with significantly high wing loading and aspect ratio, indicating high flight speed and manoeuvrability. The evolution of all tested morphometric traits is best described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, indicating stabilising selection around fitness optima in Eudamina. Models testing for random drift or early burst dynamics were rejected in all cases. We reveal a clear co-evolution between the fore- and hindwing shapes, despite both wings having different functional constraints. Hindwing tails have a significant recurrent effect on forewing shape in lineages evolving them independently, suggesting the existence of evolutionary trade-offs between flight performance and antipredator defences. Our study shows that the convergent morphologies across Eudamina have likely arisen not by neutral evolution but by ecological selection influenced by biomechanical constraints.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Existing non-absorbable middle ear ventilation tubes frequently necessitate secondary surgical removal. Bioabsorbable polylactic acid (PLA) offers a promising alternative due to its inherent biocompatibility and tunable degradation characteristics. This study aimed to design, fabricate, and comprehensively evaluate a novel PLA middle ear ventilation tube. Methods: Bioabsorbable PLA tubes were designed and fabricated based on commercial models. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed according to ISO 10993 guidelines. In vivo evaluations were performed in a guinea pig model, including otoscopic examinations, auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging, and histological analyses. Results: The PLA tubes were successfully designed and fabricated, exhibiting dimensions comparable to commercially available products. In vitro testing confirmed their biocompatibility. In vivo observations demonstrated that the PLA segments remained stable, with no significant inflammation detected. ABR measurements revealed no adverse impact on hearing function. Micro-CT imaging confirmed tube integrity and displayed initial signs of degradation over a 9-month period. Histological analyses indicated a favorable tissue response with minimal foreign body reaction. Conclusion: The developed PLA middle ear ventilation tube represents a highly promising alternative to conventional non-absorbable tubes. It demonstrates excellent biocompatibility, preserves auditory function, and exhibits a controlled degradation profile.

Though musculoskeletal models produce vast computational data, they lack a visual language which compactly communicates how joint dynamics relate to time-varying muscle activation, force and length change. We developed a novel representation of joint-level force-velocity (joint-FV) properties which shows how agonist and antagonist muscles contribute to overall joint state and its trajectory throughout a movement. Using a model of human goal-directed reaching, we used joint-FV visualisations to discern the salient joint dynamic features across joints and between different reach targets. Regardless of target, we found that the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints traversed a near circular trajectory through joint-FV space when muscle forces were dominant, but trajectories were more complex when joint-interaction forces dominated (i.e. cross-joint forces due to Coriolis, Euler and centrifugal effects). Additionally, we found that co-contraction steepens the instantaneous slope of the instantaneous joint-fv curve causing damping which helps stabilise against small perturbations. We therefore propose that our joint-FV visualisation can be used to explain the intricate features seen in musculoskeletal simulation data to reveal how intrinsic muscle properties govern the behaviour of dynamical systems.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

EABR-mediated vesicles present natural, full-length oncologically-relevant membrane proteins embedded in lipid bilayers to functionalize the nanovial cavity with cell-like membranes.

Although existing prediction tools such as NetMHCpan and MHCflurry exhibit high accuracy in predicting binding affinity between peptides and specific HLA-I alleles, they are constrained to a preset set of alleles. Consequently, they can neither directly determine whether a peptide is an epitope nor provide a holistic binding profile across the entire HLA-I allelic landscape. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two synergistic models: PHbinder (Peptide-HLA-I Binder) and PSGM (Pseudo Sequence Generation and Mapping). PHbinder integrates features from a fine-tuned ESM2 language model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), processing them through parallel CNN and Transformer branches to capture local and global patterns, which are then fused using a Cross-Multi-Head Attention mechanism. In the epitope prediction task, PHbinder achieved an accuracy of prediction of 85. 12%, significantly exceeding established benchmark models. Complementing this, the PSGM model employs a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture to generate the corresponding HLA-I pseudo-sequences. These are then mapped to the known alleles using a Hamming distance-based nearest-neighbor search. PSGM achieved 49.26% average coverage in its predictions of the Top-50 alleles. Furthermore, orthogonal validation with MHCflurry revealed that 63% of the highest affinity binding partners within its Top-50 list were new experimentally unverified HLA-I alleles.

Here we introduce a combined biomaterial and 3D-organoid model, based on a hybrid biomaterial-matrix double-network gel, whose mechanical properties are dynamically photocontrolled by the application of light. This combines basement membrane extract (Matrigel) with biocompatible polymer (poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate), and a low-toxicity photoinitation system.

Although several formation mechanisms have been proposed, a general thermodynamic driving force remains elusive. Here, we investigate a well-defined system in which the human transcription factor p53 and non-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form biomolecule-rich condensates. Introduction of dsDNA containing p53-binding motifs induces a morphological transition to hollow structures, accompanied by a material state transition from liquid-like to gel-like. In vitro assays indicate that the formation of hollow condensates is driven by p21 DNA-induced localized gelation at the condensate periphery. Guided by these findings, we developed a three-component phase-field model that quantitatively recapitulates the formation of hollow condensates. Simulations show that peripheral gelation leads to gradual depletion of protein and Random DNA from the condensate core, triggering spinodal decomposition and lumen formation inside condensates. Together, these results offer mechanistic insights into multi-component hollow condensates.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "The native states of globular proteins are typically viewed as being the most stable conformations on their respective proteins' soluble free energy landscapes. This view, known as the Thermodynamic Hypothesis, explains why many proteins can reversibly refold after being denatured. Here we report an intriguing counterexample to this paradigm. When E. coli phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is stimulated to refold upon dilution from denaturant, instead of returning to its native state, it populates an unusual misfolded form that is monomeric and native-like, but which is even more kinetically stable than its native form, as based on its resistance to thermal and detergent-induced denaturation. Moreover, this misfolded form cannot self-correct, even for days. We show that the key structural feature of this misfolded form of PGK is topological in nature by demonstrating that kinetically stable misfolded forms do not form any longer if PGK is circularized, which prevents its termini from threading through other portions of the protein. Our findings demonstrate that a misfolded protein need not aggregate or form an amyloid to become stabilized with respect to the native state, and call attention to topologically-misfolded proteins as a potential Achilles heel to the cellular proteostasis network.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

The cause and possible function of these endogenous oscillations are still not fully understood, with different hypotheses including its origin as a byproduct of misguided regulatory processes. To investigate whether such oscillations could be functional rather than incidental, we introduce Growth Mechanics (GM) as a general mathematical framework to study the dynamic resource allocation in models of whole self-replicating cells, built exclusively on the first principles of fitness maximization, mass conservation, nonlinear reaction kinetics, and constant cell density. Inspired by the physical theory of classical mechanics, we first find the simplest mathematical description the problem in terms of generalized coordinates, and then solve the optimal dynamical resource allocation for cells growing in any given medium using the Euler-Lagrange equation, resulting in analytical \"equations of optimal motion\" (EOM) that apply for growing cells in general. We then solve these equations numerically for simple growing cell models and show that, in general, oscillations are necessary to maximize cell fitness by getting more saturated reactions at the time they are most needed. We also show how the EOM predict the emergence of quasi-linear dependencies of the metabolic oscillation frequency and the ribosome protein allocation with the cell growth rate at different growth media, in line with the \"growth laws\" observed experimentally in microbes. This work contributes to the foundations of theoretical cell biology with general quantitative principles and a bridge to theoretical tools of physics.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Methods: We performed tensor-valued dMRI in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Metrics including anisotropic kurtosis (MKA) and isotropic kurtosis (MKI) were quantified to assess microstructural tissue heterogeneity. Histological validation was conducted using co-registered tissue sections. Results: We observed significant mismatches between mean diffusivity (MD), mean kurtosis (MK), as well as specifically in MKA and MKI in ischemic regions. Notably, MKA and MKI exhibited statistically significant alterations compared to contralateral regions. Moreover, these metrics strongly correlated with pathological findings. The mismatch highlighted microstructurally distinct subregions within the lesion. Conclusions: This is the first study to propose an anisotropic-isotropic kurtosis mismatch framework in vivo.

Under what conditions do transitioned niches acquire greater fitness than, and outcompete, their parental un-transitioned niches, is not well-understood. Here, we use a Cellular Potts model-based multiscale computational framework to investigate this question. Inducing an EMT in a single cell at the edge of an early-growing tumor surrounded by a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) allows us to temporally trace inter-niche competitions. We observe that the transitioned niche dominates the population it arises from and invades better when surrounded by dense ECM. An increase in cell-ECM adhesion by itself drives domination at 50% probability, such that the transitioned population invades faster and contributes further to collective invasion of the whole tumor. Decrease in inter- and intra-niche cell-cell adhesion by itself is not sufficient to achieve domination. However, added to increased cell-ECM adhesion, loss of intra-niche (but not inter-niche adhesion) restores the probability, but not the extent, with which domination by the transitioned niche is achieved by attenuating its confinement by its parental population. Our simulations reveal the forces regulating such confinement and how cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, stochastic invasion dynamics, and ECM density contribute nuancedly to distinct aspects of inter-niche competitions within tumor populations and their fitness.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Acute and chronic metabolic effects were evaluated by monitoring food and water intake, amount of urination and defecation. HFF-induced type 2 diabetic mice were treated for 33 days with ASX (30 and 60 mg/5 ml/kg b.w.) were used to assess chronic effects. In the in vitro study, ASX (1.6 - 1000 {micro}g/mL and 40 - 5,000 {micro}g/ml) decreased (p<0.001) enzymatic digestion of starch and glucose diffusion by 45.14% and 32.50%, respectively and also showed a significant inhibitory effect on the DPPH (p<0.001) over a concentration range (1.6 - 5000 {micro}g/mL) of ASX. During the in vivo experiments, oral administration of ASX (30 - 60 mg/5 ml/kg b.w.) improved oral glucose tolerance (p<0.001) as well as significantly increased (p<0.01) residual unabsorbed sucrose contents in the six segments of the gut.

Five-week-old male mice received weekly DOX (4 mg/kg) or saline injections for six weeks, with heart tissues harvested 4 days post-treatment. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) were identified by bulk RNA-seq and proteomics, validated via qPCR and western blot, respectively Key DEPs were validated in plasma samples from DOX-treated breast cancer patients. Additionally, a temporal comparison was conducted between DEPs in the mice hearts 4 days and 6 weeks post-DOX. RNA-seq revealed upregulation of stress-responsive genes (Phlda3, Trp53inp1) and circadian regulators (Nr1d1), with downregulation of Apelin and Cd74. Proteomics identified upregulation of serpina3n, thrombospondin-1, and epoxide hydrolase 1. Plasma SERPINA3 concentrations were significantly elevated in breast cancer patients 24 hours post-DOX.

Existing therapeutic strategies such as monoclonal antibodies and gene-editing approaches are limited by high production costs, potential safety concerns, and limited effectiveness in targeting intracellular PCSK9. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) represents a promising alternative capable of overcoming these limitations. In this study, we utilized computer-aided drug design (CADD) to develop a peptide-based degrader, Cadd4, aimed at selectively reducing PCSK9 levels. Through molecular docking and structural refinement, a peptide sequence with strong binding affinity to PCSK9 was identified. Functional evaluation was conducted both in vitro using human LX-2 cells and in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD) induced hypercholesterolemic mouse models. Cellular uptake, PCSK9 degradation, and LDLR restoration were assessed via confocal microscopy, western blotting, and biochemical analysis. Safety was evaluated by monitoring liver enzyme levels and general physiological parameters. Cadd4 exhibited efficient intracellular delivery and selective PCSK9 degradation in LX-2 cell. In HFD-fed mice, hepatic PCSK9 expression was reduced by 38%, accompanied by a marked increase in LDLR levels. These changes translated into a 25% reduction in total plasma cholesterol and a 29% decrease in LDL-C concentrations. Biodistribution studies indicated liver-specific accumulation of Cadd4, consistent with its intended site of action. Experiments using human liver tissue further confirmed its ability to decrease PCSK9 and enhance LDLR levels. No signs of liver toxicity or adverse systemic effects were observed throughout the study. This work introduces Cadd4 as a CADD-designed peptide-based degrader capable of lowering plasma cholesterol by promoting LDLR recovery via PCSK9 degradation. Its intracellular mechanism of action addresses key gaps in current PCSK9-targeted therapies and supports the broader utility of TPD platforms in managing hypercholesterolemia.

The cell wall polysaccharide pectin is a major Ca2+ binding structure and Ca2+ homeostasis is influenced by the cell wall architecture. LRR-extensin (LRX) proteins are extracellular regulators of cell wall development that are anchored in the cell wall by their extensin domain. The extensin-less LRX1{Delta}E14 variant of the root hair-expressed LRX1 of Arabidopsis induces a dominant-negative effect resulting in aberrant root hairs. In an effort to identify the underlying mechanism of the root hair defect caused by LRX1{Delta}E14, we isolated a suppressor of dominant-negative effect mutant, sune42. It codes for the CATION CALCIUM EXCHANGER 4 (CCX4) that localizes to the Golgi apparatus and was shown to have Ca2+ transport activity. A detailed investigation of the Ca2+ dynamics revealed that LRX1{Delta}E14 coincides with a defect in tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillation, and this effect is alleviated by the sune42 mutation. Additionally, reducing Ca2+ availability influences the LRX1{Delta}E14-induced root hair defect.

We recently reported that nociceptor depolarization itself initiates signaling by the calcium channel CaV1.2 causing acute hyperalgesia in vivo. However, whether this mechanism initiates excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling and thereby leads to long-lasting modulation of nociceptor activity remains poorly understood. Using high content imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, we here found that depolarization of nociceptors induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor (TF) cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which was affected by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) and calcineurin, but not Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of CaV1.2 confirmed its role in calcium-dependent kinase signaling and CREB phosphorylation after depolarization. In line with this, pharmacological modulation of CaV1 channels affected the expression of a subset of depolarization-regulated immediate early genes known to orchestrate a broader transcriptional response. Indeed, RNA-Seq analysis of DRG neurons from mice with a tissue-specific deletion of CaV1.2 in nociceptive sensory neurons (SNS-Cacna1c-/- mice) revealed downregulation of multiple calcium and potassium channel subunits as well as proteins involved in synaptic vesicle release and cell adhesion. Furthermore, repetitive firing of action potentials and release of the neuropeptide CGRP was impaired in CaV1.2-deficient sensory neurons. SNS-Cacna1c-/- mice showed increased sensitivity to noxious heat and exacerbated inflammatory but not neuropathic pain.

One line of evidence (Competition) indicates that interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs compete for neural resources. Another line (Self-related Facilitation) shows a link between interoceptive and self-related processing, that might also include computing the self-relevance of exteroceptive inputs. We tested these seemingly opposing views within a single experimental task. Measuring heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs, a measure of cardiac interoception) with EEG, we manipulated the self-relevance of an audio-tactile stimulus by placing the audio source either inside or outside the peripersonal space immediately around the body. This design ensured that Competition and Self-related Facilitation accounts yielded contrasting predictions. On the one hand, pre-stimulus HEP amplitudes over somatosensory cortex were linked to slower reaction times, and affected audio-tactile stimulus-evoked responses in the same area, indicating competition for shared neural resources. On the other hand, pre-stimulus HEPs over integrative sensorimotor and default-mode network regions facilitated subsequent self-relevance encoding, both in reaction times and audio-tactile stimulus evoked responses. Importantly, Competition and Facilitation effects were spatially and statistically independent from each other. We thereby reconcile the two views by showing the co-existence of two independent mechanisms: one that allocates neural resources to either internal bodily signals or the external world, and another by which interoception and exteroception are combined to determine the self-relevance of external signals. Our results highlight the multi-dimensionality of HEPs as neurophysiological markers, and thus of internal states more generally.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer others' latent mental states, such as intentions, beliefs, and strategies, and use these inferences to predict behavior. A defining characteristic of ToM is its recursive nature: individuals reason not only about what others are thinking, but also about what others think about them. Most computational models of ToM adopt a hierarchical structure in which Level-0 (L0) agents are assumed to follow simple, fixed heuristics (e.g., Win-Stay-Lose-Shift, WSLS) without mentalizing. However, this assumption overlooks the diversity of non-mentalizing strategies exhibited in human behavior, such as imitation or tit-for-tat, which do not conform to WSLS yet require no recursive reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel ToM framework (BELIEFS) that flexibly infers latent L0 strategies from behavior rather than relying on predefined heuristics. We evaluated the model in four classic dyadic games: Matching Pennies, Prisoner's Dilemma, Bach or Stravinsky, and Stag Hunt, manipulating model's learning rates and the volatility of L0 strategy switching. Predictive accuracy was assessed using cumulative negative log-likelihood (NLL) of opponent's next choice and compared against both a ToM model that assumes only WSLS at L0 and chance-level performance. Our model outperformed both baselines, particularly under low-volatility conditions and at intermediate learning rate. Moreover, to evaluate strategy inference, we computed trial-wise confusion matrices and Cohen's k; between inferred and true L0 strategies, reaching significantly above-chance classification. We further tested the model's ability to distinguish between action sequences generated by the opponent's true Theory of Mind (ToM) level (L0 vs. L1) and those generated using an incorrect ToM level. The model assigned lower negative log-likelihoods (NLLs) to sequences from the true level, suggesting an indirect method for identifying the opponent's actual ToM level. Finally, we assessed whether the model effectively tracks behaviorally distinguishable action probabilities across ToM levels. Using Fisher-transformed correlations between model-generated action probabilities at L0, L1, and L2, we found significant dissimilarities, especially in competitive games. In summary, our model introduces a flexible, probabilistic approach to Theory of Mind that captures both surface-level strategy use and recursive reasoning depth. By jointly tracking dynamic beliefs over L0 strategies and ToM levels, the model adapts to behavioral shifts and outperforms static heuristics. These advances provide a powerful framework for modeling human behavior in interactive contexts, with implications for both human-human and human-machine interaction research.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, anatomical differences suggest that each muscle is capable of generating distinct torques at the ankle, raising the possibility that each can be independently controlled to suit the needs of a given task. This possibility was explored by investigating the activation patterns of the triceps surae during two balance tasks that use different neuromechanical control strategies to maintain equilibrium. High-density surface EMG was recorded from the triceps surae of 14 healthy young adults during multiple trials of dual- and single-legged standing. Newly developed analyses examined how each muscle tuned its activity with center of pressure (COP) movement throughout 2-D space. During dual-legged standing, only the SOL and MG were active and both tuned their activity uniformly with anteroposterior COP movement. By contrast, during single-legged standing, each muscle showed robust activation and significantly different directional tuning, with the LG most active before medial COP movement, while SOL and MG were most active before lateral COP movement. Further analyses demonstrated the LG could be activated entirely independent of the SOL and MG, and vice versa, with independent activation of each muscle causing different angular deflections of the COP during single-, but not dual-legged standing. These observations reveal a sophisticated level of neural control, whereby the nervous system exploits subtle differences between highly similar muscles to tune balance corrective adjustments in a task-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

This process relies on the peptide-loading complex (PLC), a dynamic transporter-multichaperone assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to ensure high-fidelity selection, editing, and loading of peptides onto MHC I heterodimers. The PLC is the primary target for viral immune evasion, elicited in particular by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), causing lifelong infections with severe risks for immunocompromised individuals. While the overall architecture of the PLC is known, how its activity is jeopardized by viral immune evasins remains unclear. Here, we present the 2.59-2.88 [A] cryogenic electron microscopy structure of native human PLC associated with the HCMV immune evasin US6. US6 inhibits the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1/2) by latching its transmembrane helix laterally onto TAP2 and using its central disulfide-rich domain to mimic a translocating peptide. This effectively plugs the ER-lumenal exit and locks TAP in an outward-facing open conformation with closed nucleotide-binding domains and asymmetrically occluded ATP and ADP. The structure also highlights the role of the unique N-terminal transmembrane domains of TAP as dynamic scaffolds that recruit the MHC I-specific chaperone tapasin by clamping its transmembrane helix to the core transmembrane domain of each transporter subunit. Our findings uncover the molecular mechanism of US6-mediated viral immune evasion and reveal potential targets for therapeutic modulation of antigen presentation in cancer and infectious diseases.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

By functionalizing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with a langerin-specific glycomimetic ligand, we achieve selective mRNA delivery to both murine and human primary Langerhans cells with minimal off-target uptake, at the same time resulting in significantly increased mRNA translation. This targeted mRNA delivery not only enhances antigen presentation and T cell responses but also enables dose-sparing and superior anti-tumor immunity compared to conventional immunization in a B16-OVA tumor model.

T cell engineering strategies to overcome these barriers are being explored. However, strategies to simultaneously address both antigen heterogeneity and T cell longevity, while localizing anti-tumor effects at disease sites, remain limited. In this study we explore a dual antigen targeting strategy by directing independent CARs against the solid tumor targets PSCA and MUC1.

We previously showed that mice inoculated with a heat-killed (HK) chitosan-deficient C. neoformans strain lacking chitin synthase 3 (chs3{Delta}) undergo rapid, neutrophil-dependent mortality within 36 hours, despite the absence of viable organisms. Here, we investigated the immune mechanisms underlying this lethal inflammatory response. We assessed the role of inflammatory cytokines, adaptive immunity, and neutrophil-derived effector functions in this lethal response. IL-6 deficient and Rag1 deficient mice exhibited only modest survival benefits, suggesting that IL-6 signaling and adaptive immune cells play limited roles. In contrast, mice lacking NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), the catalytic subunit of the phagocyte oxidase complex required for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, were completely protected.

The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-1{beta} and IL-36{gamma} are key drivers of the disease phenotype, but the mechanisms underlying their regulation in psoriasis remain poorly understood. Generation of IL-1{beta} activity is regulated by protein complexes, termed inflammasomes. We activated the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes cultivated in three-dimensional skin equivalents. NLRP1 activation induced histological and molecular features that are highly reminiscent of psoriasis. Mechanistically, the phenotype was dependent on IL-1, which triggered a pro-inflammatory epidermal-dermal crosstalk. This included induction of expression of IL-36{gamma}, which, together with IL-1{beta}, was released from keratinocytes through NLRP1-induced gasdermin D pores. The in vivo relevance of these findings is reflected by the expression of the NLRP1 sensor and signs of inflammasome activation in lesional skin of psoriatic patients. Finally, we discovered endogenous cytoplasmic double stranded (ds) RNA, recently associated with cellular perturbations in psoriasis, as a novel activator of the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes.

We modelled the scaffold anchor of CK1 (SACK1) domain of SACK1G and used fragment-bound structures of the SACK1B (FAM83B) dimer to guide our analysis. This allowed us to computationally predict several key residues near the fragment-binding site in SACK1G that may be important for its function. We mutated these residues, introduced them into SACK1G-/- DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells and investigated their ability to bind endogenous CK1. We uncovered two SACK1G mutations, namely Y204A and I206A, that abolish interaction with CK1 similarly to the PPK pathogenic mutant A34E.

Accordingly, eDNA genomic analyses have focused on short mitochondrial regions, which often lack the resolution for accurate species identification or individual-level analysis. However, some intact mitochondrial genomes may persist in aquatic environments, and their recovery could enable noninvasive determination of complete mitochondrial sequences, providing higher-resolution genetic information. Nevertheless, most eDNA studies have overlooked long-read DNA analysis, and current protocols are not optimised to detect or utilise these longer fragments. To address this, we developed a long-read sequencing workflow to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes from eDNA. First, we selected the optimal DNA extraction method and filter pore sizes using water from aquaria containing Carassius auratus or Oryzias latipes, aiming to maximise the yield of high-molecular-weight DNA for target organism sequences. We then applied two sequencing strategies: a PCR-free approach using native eDNA and a long-range PCR-based approach targeting the complete mitochondrial genome. Using the determined DNA extraction method and a filter (1.2 {micro}m pore size), we obtained high-molecular-weight DNA suitable for long-read sequencing. In the PCR-free approach, C. auratus samples from single-fish aquaria yielded hundreds of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome, with some reads exceeding 16,000bp. These allowed de novo assembly of full-length mitochondrial genomes in several samples. In the PCR-based approach, one sample yielded over 100,000 mitochondrial reads, of which >27% exceeded 16,000bp, enabling assemblies. Comparison with assemblies from tissue-derived DNA confirmed accuracy, as sequences were nearly identical. Across samples, polymorphism analysis revealed two distinct haplotypes in C. auratus. These results demonstrate that full-length mitochondrial genomes can be reconstructed from eDNA, and that both PCR-free and PCR-based strategies are effective under appropriate sample conditions. Our results show that long-read sequencing enables the recovery of near-complete mitochondrial genomes directly from eDNA without requiring artificial fragmentation and, in some cases, without the need for enrichment steps. This approach enhances eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring by improving species identification and enabling within-population level analyses.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

An RTM look-up-table, from earlier work, was filtered by ecological criteria from 24 sites sampled along precipitation and canopy cover gradients and was inverted by using the spectral angle, as a merit function. The RF emulator allowed efficient computation and presentation of an extensive and fine-scale forest FMC data cube of interest in animal, fire and plant ecology. Our RTM-based, predictions of forest and woodland FMC had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.9% of dry matter content and explained more than 60% of variance (r2 = 0.62). This represents an improvement over previous models using reflectance data of coarser spatial resolution, particularly in terms of explained variance (r2=0.17 and RMSE=32%). The emulator model achieved similar performance to the RTM with slightly larger error (RMSE = 21.77%) and smaller explained variance (r2 = 0.54).

However, the co-existence of both tumour-promoting and tumour-restraining stromal elements necessitates extensive characterisation of the TME for effective targeting. Fibromuscular cell heterogeneity in PCa remains poorly characterised, in part due to challenges in isolating cells embedded within the desmoplastic stroma. This study therefore aimed to better characterise fibroblast and smooth muscle cell (SMC) populations as the major tissue-resident stromal cell subtypes within the PCa TME. Methods: A PCa single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset was re-analysed to define fibromuscular subtypes. Due to low fibroblast yields, an optimised tissue dissociation protocol was developed and benchmarked against two commercial kits via flow cytometry, immunostaining of clinical specimens and ex vivo culture. Dimensionality reduction and clustering were applied to the CD31- stromal fraction using a multiparameter surface marker panel. Annotation of the resulting clusters based on their surface marker profile was supported by integrating scRNA-seq and immuno-histological findings. Results: The optimised protocol yielded over twice the viable cells/mg tissue compared to two commercial kits, preserved surface marker integrity, enhanced successful cultivation of mesenchymal cells and recovered diverse stromal subpopulations from benign and malignant samples. Dimensionality reduction and clustering of flow cytometry counts identified 11 distinct CD31- stromal populations. Integration with transcriptomic data and immunofluorescence of clinical specimens identified spatially- and prognostically-distinct fibroblast subtypes, including inflammatory and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, pericytes linked to poor prognosis and a novel SMC subset associated with stromal activation.

Th subset differentiation is determined by the expression of transcription factors including IRF4. We here describe a point mutation (IRF4L116R) in the DNA-binding domain of IRF4 leading to a dysregulation of CD4-T cell subsets and their functions. This point mutation does not alter overall protein expression. In sharp contrast to IRF4-null mice, neither the CD4/CD8 ratio nor T cell activation and memory is altered in naive mice carrying the point mutation. However, IRF4L116R T cells are reduced in their capability to differentiate into Th1, Th17 and Treg cells in a dose-dependent manner, contrasting with the findings in IRF4KO T cells. Particularly striking is the loss of Th1-differentiation in T cells from homozygous Irf4L116R/L116R mice while T cells completely lacking IRF4 show no reduction in Th1 differentiation. Furthermore, despite maintained ability to generate Th17 cells, expression of the IRF4L116R variant protects mice against disease development in the Th17 cell-dependent EAE mouse model of neuroinflammation. This contrasts with IRF4 knock-out mice, where expression of one wild-type allele of IRF4 is sufficient for full disease development. Together our results show that the L116R point mutation in IRF4 can selectively alter the differentiation and function of some CD4 T cell subsets and suggest that the L116R mutation is not a classical loss- or gain-of-function variant.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

We investigated GSK-3{beta} contribution to the loss of cardiomyocyte cohesion and observed that GSK-3{beta} reduced baseline cardiomyocyte cohesion in cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac slices. Pathogenic ACM-IgGs activated GSK-3{beta} upstream of p38MAPK, leading to phosphorylation and junctional loss of {beta}-catenin. GSK-3{beta} inhibition rescued the loss of cell cohesion induced by ACM-IgGs in ACM hiPSC-CMs. Pathogenic autoantibodies targeting DSG2 are present in ACM patients and impair cardiomyocyte cohesion in a GSK-3{beta}-dependent manner. In contrast, autoantibodies are absent in murine ACM models and are non-pathogenic in some patients, healthy relatives.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Current vascular imaging-based CVR indices have been limited to single-vessel analysis and report conflicting results, for example, whether there are differences in CVR between sexes. Alternative vascular imaging-based indices can be derived from 4D flow MRI, namely intracranial pulse wave velocity and pulsatility transmission, which are based on vascular regions and offer a more comprehensive perspective on vascular function that can also scale to a global level. To date, these types of indices have not been measured with a vascular stimulus. In this work, standard single-vessel and novel regional and global CVR indices were studied in 10 healthy young adults (29 {+/-} 2 years, 5 male, 5 female) in response to hypercapnia. Consistent increases in flow, area and velocity manifested at all levels and were greater in males. Regional pulse wave velocity and pulsatility transmission offered a minimum 40% increase in the dynamic range of CVR magnitudes that may benefit cohort stratification. Notably, pulse wave velocity increased in 50% of the vascular regions (most probably due to vasoconstriction), accompanying an increase in flow; a profound observation given the common expectation of vasorelaxation with hypercapnia. Consistently reduced flow, velocity, area, pulse wave velocity, and transmission index reactivities in females may partially explain the varying pathological outcomes between sexes, evidencing the continued value of 4D flow for the evaluation of CVR in other cohorts.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, the extremely low abundance, fragmented nature and ubiquitous tissue origin of EV RNAs, alongside potential contamination from co-isolated materials, such as free DNA and bacterial RNA, pose substantial analytical challenges. These complexities highlight a pressing need for a standardized, computational workflow that ensures robust quality control and EV RNA characterization. Results: Here, we present EVscope, an open-source bioinformatics pipeline designed specifically for processing EV RNA-seq datasets. EVscope employs an optimized genome-wide expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that significantly improves multi-mapping read assignment at single-base resolution by effectively leveraging alignment scores (AS) and local read coverage, specifically tailored for fragmented and low-abundance EV RNAs. Notably, EVscope uniquely generates EM-based BigWig files for downstream analysis, a capability currently unavailable in existing EM-based BigWig quantification tools. The pipeline systematically integrates 27 major steps, including quality control, analysis of library structure, contamination assessment, read alignment, read strandedness detection, UMI-based deduplication, RNA quantification, genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination correction, cellular and tissue source inference and visualization with a comprehensive HTML report. EVscope incorporates a comprehensive, updated annotation covering 19 distinct RNA biotypes, encompassing protein-coding genes, lncRNAs, miRNAs, piRNAs, retrotransposons (LINEs, SINEs, ERVs), and additional non-coding RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs). Furthermore, it leverages two highly balanced circRNA detection algorithms for robust circular RNA identification. Notably, a downstream module enables the inference of the tissue/cellular origins of EV RNAs using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq reference datasets. EVscope is implemented as a convenient, single-command Bash pipeline leveraging Conda-managed standard software packages and custom scripts, ensuring reproducibility and straightforward deployment.

Our findings reveal that the T2 increase primarily reflects an increase in intracellular free water concentration rather than a mere expansion of cell volume. Notably, [K] elevation produced distinct cell swelling profiles and a smaller relative rise in free water at comparable volumetric changes compared to hypoosmotic stress, highlighting more complex mechanisms than straightforward osmotic effects. While T2 proved sensitive to shifts in intracellular water content, the bound pool increased linearly with cell volume expansion.

Here, through integrative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) we showed the presence, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mice, of a novel subpopulation of senescent-like neutrophils that exhibit hepatic depletion of Sepp1 in concert with the accumulation of the cellular senescence marker Cdkn1a, the immunosuppressive proteins S100a8 and 9, and the pro-angiogenic factor Vegfa. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the hepatic depletion of Sepp1, in combination with this unique subset of senescent neutrophils, drives immunosuppressive activity and further accelerates tumor growth. Mechanistically, the loss of tumor cell-derived Sepp1 impaired selenium uptake in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) by disrupting Lrp8 receptor-mediated transport, thereby suppressing intracellular selenium metabolism. This metabolic perturbation led to reduced hydrogen selenide (H2Se) production and accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), resulting in increased levels of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 protein (H3K4me3) modification in neutrophils and collectively establishing a pro-senescence chromatin landscape in tumor-associated neutrophils. Furthermore, we demonstrated that selenium supplementation not only restores Sepp1 expression but also is essential to reshaping anti-tumor immunity in HCC mice, including reversal of the senescent-like phenotype and providing synergistic effects with anti-Programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Collectively, our findings identify SEPP1 as a master regulator acting against neutrophil senescence and the potent immunosuppressive effects of senescence in HCC. We discuss the therapeutic potential of strategies to modulate senescent-like neutrophils and underscore the potential utility of selenium supplementation as an adjuvant to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in liver cancer.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death. BRAF inhibition has been associated with increased sensitivity to ferroptosis that is dependent on Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Experimental Design: In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) were used to evaluate the anticancer activity of combination BRAF inhibition and ferroptosis induction. Results: Targeting key regulators of ferroptosis-GPX4, using RSL3 and ML162, and system Xc, using erastin-induced significant cell death in all ATC cell lines. Combination of dabrafenib and RSL3 synergistically increased cell death in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC cells, and significantly inhibited cellular migration and colony formation. Mechanistically, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species levels, and intracellular Fe2+ increased significantly with combination treatment compared with each agent alone. Analysis of cell membrane iron importers and exporters showed significantly lower expression of ferroportin-1 (an iron exporter), suggesting the synergistic anticancer activity was due to increased iron accumulation and oxidative stress, leading to enhanced ferroptotic cell death. BRAFV600E-mutant ATC cell spheroids showed synergistic cell death with dabrafenib and RSL3 treatment. In vivo, combination dabrafenib and ferroptosis induction (by targeting GPX4 using C18, and system Xc; with IKE) significantly inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic ATC mouse model. Additionally, dabrafenib-resistant BRAFV600E-mutant ATC cells were more sensitive to ferroptosis induction than parental cells. Conclusions: Dual targeting of BRAFV600E and ferroptosis results in synergistic anticancer activity and overcomes resistance to BRAF inhibition.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CAC models, intestinal epithelial C/EBP{beta} is upregulated during tumor progression, correlating with exacerbated tumor burden and neutrophil infiltration. Mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Cebpb deletion (Cebpb{Delta}IEC) show resistance to carcinogenesis, accompanied by reduced neutrophil infiltration and tumor growth. Mechanistically, C/EBP{beta} transcriptionally activates CXCR2 ligands (CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5) to drive neutrophil recruitment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 phenocopies the anti-tumor effects of Cebpb{Delta}IEC deletion, further validating this axis as a therapeutic target.

Despite its high biological and pharmacological importance, the dynamics of full human eIF4F-mRNA engagement remain largely uncharacterised, hindering mechanistic understanding of translation initiation and its regulation. Here we observed human eIF4F activity with single-molecule fluorescence assays that directly visualise recognition of the mRNA cap by its eIF4E subunit. Unexpectedly, we find that inherently transient eIF4E-cap binding is repressed by full-length human eIF4G, predominantly through its C-terminus, representing an unanticipated role for eIF4G as a central rate-limiting factor in the eIF4F complex. This repression is relieved by nucleotide-bound eIF4A in the eIF4F heterotrimer, placing eIF4A as a crucial determinant of efficient cap recognition for translation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that eIF4G electrostatically modulates eIF4E-mRNA interaction to control the cap-recognition frequency. Our findings also indicate that intrinsic eIF4F-mRNA dynamics are insufficient to support cap-tethered ribosomal scanning to locate translation start sites. They illuminate fundamental design-principle differences for the overall mechanism and division of labour among eIF4F subunits during mRNA recognition in humans and yeast.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to design a multivalent immunogen to provide broad protection against diverse ACE2-using sarbecoviruses, which pose a significant threat to global health. Our analysis revealed that the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of ACE2-using sarbecoviruses segregate into three antigenically distinct clusters, including one cluster that encompasses viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. Based on these findings, we engineered a 'three-in-one' immunogen, designated as 3Rs-NC, which incorporates representative RBDs from all three clusters. 3Rs-NC preserved the natural epitope configuration of each monomeric RBD component, and efficiently elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies against representative viruses and closely related sarbecoviruses. When administered intranasally with flagellin-based mucosal adjuvant KFD, 3Rs-NC induced robust and durable RBD-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses in mice. Furthermore, KFD-adjuvanted 3Rs-NC conferred sustained protection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and SARS-like coronavirus WIV1. Additionally, 3Rs-NC immunization protected mice from lethal challenge of SARS-like coronavirus rRsSHC014S, with more efficient protection observed in female mice than male mice.

This study employs a genome-resolved eco-systems biology approach, using a high-resolution \"spinal cord-gut axis\" model system and dataset, to predict how dysbiotic gut metabolism impacts overall mammalian health. By scaling and combining temporally resolved network analytics and consensus statistical methods, key microbial species were identified that predict overall host physiology and presumably control the gut ecosystem. In silico validation by pathway-centric functional analyses and comparative genomics revealed that key bacteria, sometimes exclusively, encode functions linking microbial and host metabolisms. Notably, spinal-mediated disturbances in the ecosystem shifted gut microbial nitrogen metabolism from urease- to amino acid-dependent pathways, with patterns that varied by host sex and bacterial species.

We uncovered a unique substitution of a key nucleotide in the P-site of the small ribosomal subunit (C1160 in C. auris), which may influence ribosome-tRNA interactions and translation fidelity. Comparative analysis of ribosome inhibitor interactions showed that resistance to CHX was observed in only two Candida species examined, while BLS binding displayed no significant differences between C. auris and S. cerevisiae, although C. auris was more sensitive to it.

To distinguish the differences in the sRNA profiles of the two strains and their OMVs, RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and northern blotting were conducted to identify enrichment of discrete sRNA species in OMVs, which were also differentially expressed between the two strains. Specifically, both coding and non-coding RNAs were enriched in OMVs from NTBF and ETBF, with BF9343_RS22680 and BF9343_RS17870 being significantly enriched in ETBF OMVs compared to NTBF. To understand the effects of OMVs on pattern recognition receptors, reporter cells of Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation were treated with OMVs, demonstrating activation of TLRs 2, 3, and 7. Treatment of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells with OMVs demonstrated increased expression of IL-8.

Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context.

Hybrid genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technologies produced a high-quality 4.29 Mbp genome comprising one circular chromosome and four plasmids similar. Comparative analysis revealed a significant deletion (17,209 bp) containing 31 genes, including thiM (involved in thiamine biosynthesis) and genes encoding sulfur transporters. Additionally, we identified multiple small-scale mutations (8 deletions, 39 insertions, 10 SNPs) resulting in frameshifts in genes including a hemolysin precursor (shlA). Our findings demonstrate that, under stable laboratory conditions without the selective pressures of the host environment, S. glossinidius continues to undergo genome degradation. The loss of thiM supports previous hypotheses of complementary metabolic pathways between S. glossinidius and the primary symbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia for thiamine biosynthesis. This study provides insights into the evolutionary trajectory of facultative symbionts and has implications for paratransgenic approaches using S. glossinidius for trypanosome control.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Commonly used pesticides, such as carbamates (e.g., Aldicarb, ALD) and organophosphates (e.g., Chlorpyrifos, CPF), are widely applied in potato cultivation and household pest control. Chronic exposure to these substances has been implicated in the early onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), a protein known for its regulatory role in oxidative stress, participates in multiple biological processes. Despite its significance, the role of A2M in mitigating mitochondrial-induced neuronal apoptosis triggered by pesticide interference remains poorly understood. This study explores the involvement of A2M in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to pesticides, focusing on its impact on mitochondrial enzyme expression, inflammatory cytokines, neuronal apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, and the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Comparative analyses of control and pesticide-exposed SH-SY5Y cells revealed that A2M positively modulates neuronal stress responses. Western blot profiling demonstrated that A2M upregulates anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Nrf2, while downregulating pro-apoptotic markers, including Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9. Biochemical assays showed that A2M enhances mitochondrial enzyme activity, particularly complexes I and III, while mitigating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ALD and CPF exposure. Furthermore, A2M was found to reduce DNA damage caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are exacerbated by mitochondrial oxidative stress. These findings highlight the pivotal role of A2M in attenuating pesticide-induced neuronal toxicity through the regulation of mitochondrial function and inhibition of neuronal apoptosis.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Our lineage analyses in vitro confirmed that viral susceptibility exhibits strong heritability across cell generations, with siblings and cousins displaying remarkably similar infection outcomes. ATAC and proteomics profiling of resistant and susceptible clones revealed distinct epigenomic and proteomic states, with the transcription factor AP-1 emerging as a potential central regulator of lineage-encoded viral resistance. Inducing AP-1 activity with PMA rendered cells resistant to viral infection, suggesting a causative role in mediating resistance memory.

The accuracy of such screenings critically depends on the quality of the target structures employed.

However, AlphaFold2 models often exhibit limitations in local structural details, especially within binding pockets, which limit their utility for small molecule docking. In contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with accurate atomistic force fields can refine protein structures, but lack the ability to leverage the structural information provided by deep learning approaches. Here, we introduce bAIes, an integrative method that bridges this gap by combining physics-based force fields with data-driven predictions through Bayesian inference. bAIes enhances the structural accuracy of predicted models in regions most critical for ligand recognition. Crucially, bAIes demonstrates a superior ability to discriminate between binders and non-binders in virtual screening campaigns, outperforming both AlphaFold2 and MD-refined models. By enhancing the usability of AlphaFold2 models without requiring extensive experimental or computational resources, bAIes offers a convenient solution to a longstanding challenge in structure-based drug design, potentially accelerating the early phases of drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Microtubule function depends on dynamic instability, the apparently random GTPase-dependent switching between growing and shrinking. Microtubule dynamics derive from biochemical properties of individual tubulin subunits and how they interact with the polymer end, a complex environment where individual tubulins can have different numbers of neighbor contacts. A fundamental understanding of microtubule dynamics has been difficult to establish because of challenges measuring the number, strength, and nucleotide-dependence of tubulin binding sites on the microtubule end. We used an improved single-molecule assay to measure tubulin:microtubule interactions. In addition to the two expected classes of binding site (longitudinal and corner), we identified previously unrecognized third binding interaction. We further show that nucleotide state strongly influences the strength of inter-protofilament contacts, with little effect on intra-protofilament contacts, and that a mutation can modulate this nucleotide effect. By uncovering a new tubulin binding state on the microtubule end, clarifying how GDP influences microtubule stability, and demonstrating that the nucleotide effects are allosteric and tunable, these single-molecule measurements and accompanying computational simulations provide rich new biochemical insight into the fundamental mechanisms of microtubule dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Anecdotal evidence from people who use drugs indicates some individuals prefer fentanyl adulterated with xylazine. Systematic examination of pharmacological interactions between xylazine and opioids is needed to understand the disparate findings between preclinical studies and human reports. Objectives This study examined behavioral interactions between xylazine and opioids in rats to investigate the pharmacology underlying an emerging trend in drug use. Methods The sedative, hypothermic, subjective, and respiratory effects of xylazine and opioid-xylazine mixtures were examined in male rats. Locomotor activity was measured in an open field, and body temperature changes were measured with a rectal probe. Rats were trained to discriminate 0.04 mg/kg fentanyl, 0.02 mg/kg fentanyl, or 1.5 mg/kg xylazine from saline and were probed with fentanyl, xylazine, or both to observe whether the drug(s) generalized with the training dose. Whole body plethysmography was used to assess the effects of xylazine on respiration. Results Xylazine depressed locomotor activity and core body temperature, but considerable variability between subjects was observed. In some subjects, xylazine fully substituted for fentanyl, and prolonged the subjective effects of fentanyl. Doses of 1 and 1.78 mg/kg xylazine only partially generalized to the training dose of 1.5 mg/kg xylazine. Xylazine exacerbated the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, and atipamezole reversed the xylazine enhancement of morphine-induced respiratory depression. Conclusions Individual differences were observed in multiple behavioral measures following xylazine administration and may recapitulate the divisiveness of xylazine reported in people who use drugs.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the first shotgun metagenomic analysis of honey from two extensively managed stingless bee species: Melipona beecheii and Scaptotrigona mexicana. From these samples, we reconstructed 25 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG), 15 of which showed no match any known species, with average nucleotide identity (ANI) around 79 against its closest relative Acetilactobacillus jinshanensis, suggesting they represent novel species. Clustering revealed four distinct groups (intragroup ANI >99; intergroup ANI <80), possibly representing four new species across two new genera. Metapangenomic analysis further confirmed that reads did not align to existing Acetilactobacillus references, indicating that Acetilactobacillus-like microbes are novel and abundant. Given that Acetilactobacillus is underrepresented genomically and exhibits a long evolutionary branch within Lactobacillaceae, our findings highlight the potential importance of these microbes. Stingless bee honey has been attributed to antioxidant and antibacterial properties, which may be influenced by its microbial content.

The extent to which the same genetic mechanisms contribute to convergent evolution could reveal whether the pathway towards these optimal endpoints is flexible or constrained to follow a particular route. Convergence has long been studied in neotropical Lepidoptera, where striking mimicry of aposematic wing colour patterns plays a vital role in predator defence. However, our knowledge of the genetic basis of these convergent colour patterns is mostly restricted to a few closely-related species. Here, we study the genetic basis of mimicry across seven mimetic species of Ithomiini and Heliconius butterflies and a day-flying Chetone moth, representing lineages that diverged between ~1-120 Mya, each of which present similar colour pattern switches. In all the butterfly species, the genetic variants most strongly associated with convergent colour pattern switches are almost always similarly located in non-coding regions near the genes ivory and optix. Colour pattern variation in the moth is associated with a ~1 Mb inversion around ivory that parallels the supergene architecture of the co-mimic Heliconius numata. In contrast to previous studies, there is limited evidence of alleles shared by means of hybridization in convergence among closely-related species. Repeated parallel evolution of regulatory switches via reuse of the same two genes suggests that convergent colour pattern evolution is highly constrained, even across large evolutionary timescales.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

However, accumulating genomic evidence supports its occurrence in angiosperms, impacting both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, particularly in parasitic species that establish vascular connections with their hosts. Despite the increasing recognition of HGT in a few clades of parasitic plants (e.g., Balanophoraceae, Rafflesiaceae, and Cynomoriaceae), the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of these transfers are still not fully understood. Mitrastemon yamamotoi, a holoparasitic endoparasite in the order Ericales, invades the roots of host trees in the Fagaceae family, creating favorable conditions for HGT. In this study, we assembled for the first time the mtDNA of Mitrastemon, revealing a multipartite structure consisting of 51 circular-mapping chromosomes. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses uncovered extensive HGT from Fagaceae hosts, affecting both coding and non-coding regions. Notably, more than 60% of the Mitrastemon mtDNA is of foreign origin, and seven chromosomes are entirely foreign, with structural signatures in the donor mtDNA consistent with the recently proposed circle-mediated HGT model. Additionally, we detected six protein-coding genes of foreign origin and one chimeric gene. Remarkably, a foreign atp1 gene has replaced the missing native copy and represents a rare event of functional HGT in plant mitochondria. These results position Mitrastemon as a valuable model for studying mtDNA evolution and deepening our understanding of the HGT process.

We analyzed a flower-colour hybrid zone between two varieties of the common snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus, based on a dataset of 22,494 individuals sampled over 10 consecutive years (Field et al., in preparation). Each individual was genotyped at ~100 SNP markers. Six SNPs are tightly linked to known flower colour loci, while the remaining 'neutral' SNPs allowed us to identify 2,342 parent-offspring trios that we use to infer dispersal. We found narrow geographic clines at six SNP markers that are tightly linked to known flower colour loci, with widths ranging from 0.8 to 5.5 km. The clines have a 'stepped' shape, which is expected when strong linkage disequilibrium, generated by diffusive dispersal into the hybrid zone, increases the effective selection at the cline centre. However, the observed LD (mean [R]= 0.027) was far too weak to explain the stepped cline shapes. Instead, we show that the stepped clines are shaped primarily by the observed long-distance dispersal. We used a novel simulation framework that accounts for realistic dispersal and multilocus selection to estimate the direct selection (1.5% to 18.5%) and indirect selection due to LD (1.2% to 2.4%) on each colour locus. Finally, we show that the barrier to the flow of neutral alleles through diffusive dispersal causes negligible distortion to the clines, while the reduction in gene flow due to selection on long-range migrants is substantial (~50%). The results shed new light onto the processes that shape hybrid zones, and highlight the need to account for the effects of realistic dispersal in theoretical and empirical studies of hybrid zones.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Molecular chaperones, including the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) and the Hsp70 chaperone system, are known to interact with -synuclein fibrils, preventing further aggregation and disaggregating fibrillar species respectively. However, it remains unclear if sHsps co-operate with the Hsp70 chaperones to potentially improve the kinetics or effectiveness of Hsp70-mediated disaggregation and how disaggregation kinetics are influenced by aggregation-prone -synuclein monomers. Using thioflavin-T assays, we demonstrate that the sHsps Hsp27 (HSPB1) and B-crystallin (HSPB5) do not synergise with the Hsp70 chaperones during -synuclein seed fibril disaggregation. Moreover, the addition of monomeric -synuclein with fibril seeds results in increased aggregation that overwhelms Hsp70-mediated disaggregation. Upon addition of sHsps to this system, antagonism between the two chaperone classes is observed, likely due to these chaperones competing for productive binding to the ends of -synuclein fibrils. Overall, these results suggest that while Hsp70 and sHsp chaperones are independently capable of binding to and inhibiting fibril elongation, they do not have synergistic effects on disaggregation. Furthermore, Hsp70-mediated disaggregation is ineffectual in the presence of physiological concentrations of -synuclein monomers, conditions that actually lead to further -synuclein aggregation.

Here, we used proteome-wide structure predictions to investigate the structural context of protein modification sites and found nearly a fifth to be buried within proteins. These cryptic sites within folded domains showed evolutionary conservation across species, as well as significantly less variability within the human population. We also found significantly more modification sites to be affected by recurrent cancer mutations and disease variants, with some variants appearing to mimic the modified or unmodified state, supporting their functionality and disease relevance. To understand how these buried sites become modified, we studied 23 phosphorylation sites across seven proteins using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations revealed a range of mechanisms spanning broad timescales, ranging from picosecond fluctuations to seconds for proline isomerisation-gated phosphorylation sites. Notably, some sites remained fully buried in the native structure. Some conformational states with exposed cryptic sites resembled structures of co-translational protein folding intermediates formed on the ribosome, indicating an interplay between protein biogenesis, folding, modifications, and signalling. We propose more broadly that protein conformational fluctuations may serve as structure-specific regulatory mechanisms by kinetically burying or exposing the unmodified, and in some cases even modified, sidechains, thereby expanding the functional versatility of proteins and enabling signal transduction across diverse timescales.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

B.; Lorenz, C. D.", "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immunomodulatory receptor that plays a critical role in microglial activation through its association with the adaptor protein DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12). Genetic studies have identified rare TREM2 variants as key risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with mutations affecting both the extracellular and transmembrane domains. While the TREM2-DAP12 complex is essential for microglial activation and implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology, the structural and mechanistic effects of transmembrane domain mutations, particularly within different TREM2 isoforms, remain unclear. In this study, we employ multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of six TREM2 mutations (four in isoform 1, two in isoform 2) and one wild-type control (isoform 2) on complex stability. By integrating coarse-grained and all-atom simulations with unsupervised machine learning techniques, we reveal distinct conformational states and residue-level interactions that govern complex formation. Our findings demonstrate how mutations such as W191X in TREM2 isoform 2 disrupt critical interactions, leading to destabilisation of the complex and potential impairments in neuroimmune signalling. These results provide new insights into the structural mechanisms linking TREM2 mutations to AD and offer a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has profoundly enhanced our understanding and treatment of NSCLC, leading to the development of precision therapies, including EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This retrospective study analyzed EGFR mutation distributions and their effect on overall survival (OS) using data accessed from TCGA. Our analysis revealed that EGFR mutations are most prevalent in lung cancer, with L858R appearing as the most frequent mutation, followed by E746_A750del and T790M. Remarkably, OS analysis exhibited that C797S mutations were linked with the least OS, with T790M, G719S, L861Q, and G719A also displaying significantly decreased OS compared to L858R mutations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of T790M versus L858R cases revealed significant metabolic reprogramming in T790M mutants, noticeable by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (CPT1A, NDUFS1), lipid metabolism (HMGCR), and mTORC1 signaling. Metabolic adaptation observed in T790M indicates elevated bioenergetic flexibility and detoxification efficiency, possibly leading to therapeutic resistance. The work underscores EGFR mutation subtypes as distinct biological entities with distinctive metabolic needs, suggesting HMGCR (statin-targetable) and PPAR agonists as probable therapeutic paths for T790M-driven resistance. These understandings support for mutation-specific treatment approach and highlight the necessity to combine metabolic pathway targeting with EGFR blockade to augment responses in lung cancer.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Yet only the first 80 ms after the pulse are widely accepted to reflect genuine cortical responses to TMS, while later components have mainly been attributed to the effects of sensory co-stimulations. Here we reappraise this view by investigating the target-specificity of the spatiotemporal evolution of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). To this end, we compared TEPs elicited by TMS targeting the premotor and primary motor cortices in healthy subjects, under conditions designed to optimize the TMS effectiveness on the cortex while minimizing peripheral confounds. As a counterfactual, we conducted the same comparison on the EEG responses evoked by realistic sham TMS and high-intensity somatosensory scalp stimulation. We found that EEG responses to motor and premotor TMS can exhibit distinct spatiotemporal evolutions up to 300 ms both at the group and single-subject levels. These differences were absent or marginally present in both realistic sham TMS and high-intensity somatosensory scalp stimulation. Our findings suggest that, when effectiveness is optimized and peripheral confounds are controlled, TMS elicits specific long-lasting EEG responses that reflect genuine responses to the initial engagement of specific cortical targets. These results challenge previous assumptions and highlight how TMS-EEG can be reliably used to assess large-scale properties within corticothalamic networks.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, considering the effects of four kinds of extreme weather on solar greenhouses, four different types of heating requirements were obtained through experiences in a Liaoshen-type solar greenhouse. Four distinct heating strategies were simulated using a soil temperature prediction model. The initial temperatures for these strategies were 13{degrees}C, 11{degrees}C, 13{degrees}C, and 14{degrees}C, respectively, while the target temperature was uniformly set at 15{degrees}C. The heating durations for the respective strategies were 432,000 seconds, 432,000 seconds, 864,000 seconds, and 1,728,000 seconds. To ensure a minimum soil temperature of 15{degrees}C within the solar greenhouse, the temperature of the heating layer located 400 mm underground needed to be maintained at or above 20{degrees}C, 28{degrees}C, 18{degrees}C, and 19{degrees}C, respectively. The simulation results were validated through experimental verification, with maximum and minimum errors of 3.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Several targeted promotional suggestions were also proposed.

However, rice is highly susceptible to several dev-astating fungal diseases, including blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, sheath blight by Rhizoctonia solani, false smut by Ustilaginoidea virens, brown spot by Bipolaris oryzae, bakanae by Fusarium fujikuroi, and head blight by F. graminearum. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of rice to these fungal diseases remain unclear. Here, we report that the {beta} subunit of SnRK1, SnRK1{beta}1A, confers broad-spectrum susceptibility to these fungal diseases. Our findings reveal that diverse rice fungal pathogens have convergently evolved an effector, Gas2, which interacts with SnRK1{beta}1A to prevent its ubiquitination-mediated degradation and promotes its nuclear translocation. While SnRK1{beta}1A is expressed at low levels in healthy plants, its expression is markedly induced upon fungal infections, facilitating susceptibility by inhibiting SnRK11, the  subunit of SnRK1, whose overexpression has been shown to enhance broad-spectrum resistance in rice. Notably, rice lines with disrupted SnRK1{beta}1A are resistant to multiple fungal diseases without compromising growth and yield in the field. Together, this study demonstrates that broad-spectrum disease resistance in crops can be achieved by disrupting inducible susceptibility genes whose encoded proteins are targeted by effectors conserved in multiple pathogens.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) enrichment coupled with oxonium-ion triggered EThcD fragmentation strategy to simultaneously profile novel endogenous and glycosylated neuropeptides across eight distinct neural tissues and neuroendocrine organs of Homarus americanus. This integrative mass spectrometry-based approach led to the identification of 154 endogenous neuropeptides derived from 25 families, approximately one-third of which are newly reported, and uncovered 28 O-linked glycosylated neuropeptides in this species for the first time. These peptides exhibit strong tissue-specific expression, distinct proteolytic cleavage patterns, and confidently localized glycosylation sites.

However, most individuals undergoing weight loss will regain lost weight, resulting in weight cycling (WC), which may exacerbate metabolic dysfunctions. Here, we studied the immunometabolic impact of WC in mice. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were exposed to two cycles of weight gain and weight loss by alternating between low (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Animals were sacrificed when WC mice were weight stable for 10 weeks upon weight loss (WC-lean) and after a subsequent exposure to weight regain for 10 weeks (WC-obese), and compared to mice persistently fed LFD (LFD-lean) or HFD (HFD-obese). Results: Body weight stabilized at a higher level in WC-lean mice after two weight gain/loss cycles compared to LFD-lean controls. While insulin resistance, metabolic tissue inflammation, and hepatic steatosis normalized between the two groups of lean mice, WC-lean mice exhibited features of WAT dysfunction. In the hypothalamus, inflammatory microglia were less abundant in WC-lean mice compared to LFD-lean mice, but mean individual microglial cell volume was larger. WC-obese mice stabilized at slightly lower weight compared with HFD-obese controls. Intriguingly, WC-obese mice exhibited increased WAT macrophages and reduced WAT and liver effector T cells compared to HFD-obese mice, whereas energy intake, body composition, whole-body insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis were similar. Conclusions: Our results suggest that WC in mice differently impacts animals in the weight-stable lean and obese states. WC-lean mice display features of a novel body weight settling point, associated with hypothalamic inflammatory changes. However, metabolic dysfunctions were uncoupled from WC-induced metabolic tissue inflammation in WC-obese mice.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Accurate prediction of antigen-TCR specificity is essential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies while minimizing autoimmune toxicity. However, current computational methods struggle to generalize across diverse TCR repertoires and reliably differentiate therapeutic antigens from autoimmune-related antigens (arAgs). Here, we introduce TridentTCR, a computational framework integrating a pretrained large language model (LLM) for high-fidelity sequence embedding with a topology-aware graph neural network to capture structural insights from the antigen-TCR interaction network. TridentTCR significantly advances TCR specificity prediction by enabling robust trinary classification, distinguishing TCR interactions involving general antigens, arAgs, and non-binding. Additionally, TridentTCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in binary classification (binding vs. non-binding). Validation on independent clinical datasets demonstrated strong generalization capability for unseen TCRs and antigens. In a disease-specific context, TridentTCR identifies notable cross-reactivity between ZnT8186-194-specific TCRs and a mimotope from Bacteroides stercoris, suggesting that T cell cross-reactivity may contribute to the initiation of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, we introduced a quantitative metric, antigenic immune response entropy (AIRE), which leverages TridentTCR predictions alongside clonotype frequencies and repertoire diversity to precisely quantify antigen-specific immune responses from single-cell profiling data. Collectively, TridentTCR provides an interpretable and clinically relevant tool, enabling improved understanding of TCR specificity, cross-reactivity, and off-target autoimmune risks in clinical immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs).

Herein, we investigated the role of NANOS3 in pigs- an animal model of dual agricultural and biomedical importance. Consistent with prior reports, we found that disruption of NANOS3 expression did not affect PGC specification. Similarly, migration of PGC to the genital ridge occurs normally, but soon followed by an increase in apoptosis and a loss of undifferentiated state by embryonic (e) day 20. Although NANOS3-/- gonads initiate development as ovaries or testes, they displayed structural defects. This is especially pronounced in the ovaries after the sex determination period (e35).

This study examines the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA to assess the genetic maternal diversity of alpacas and llamas. It also evaluates this alongside the preservation initiatives of the Quimsachata ex situ germplasm bank, which aims to sustain both phenotypic and genetic diversity while advancing breeding technologies. Our analysis identified 55 maternal haplotypes with 41 variation sites, indicating significant genetic diversity (h = 0.8 - 0.9) and low differentiation (Fst = 0.01 - 0.05) within these populations. This finding is particularly noteworthy when compared to the maternal haplotypes of domestic and wild South American camelids (SAC) in other areas of South America. We did not observe any recent demographic shifts in population structure. Additionally, our research uncovers two genetic maternal clusters among alpacas and llamas, suggesting their ancestral connections to vicunas and guanacos, with indications of crossbreeding, particularly among alpacas, which show a closer lineage to guanaco-llamas. The Quimsachata bank currently safeguards a significant diversity of maternal heritage in alpacas and llamas within this region.

Using 12 site-specific antibodies, the method is capable of measuring 2^12 (4,096) potential proteoform groups. We used IMaP to measure proteoform group profiles of the tau protein, a key player in neurodegenerative diseases, using two pan anti-tau antibodies (Tau-13, Tau-216), three isoform-specific antibodies (Anti-0N, Anti-2N, Anti-4R), and seven phosphosite-specific antibodies (Anti-pT181, Anti-pS202+pT205, Anti-pT205, Anti-pS214, Anti-pT217, Anti-pT231, and Anti-pS396). The method demonstrates high sensitivity (detecting proteoforms at 0.1% abundance), high reproducibility (median CV <5.5%), and broad dynamic range (>3 orders of magnitude), outperforming conventional techniques in resolving closely related proteoform groups. We demonstrated that the method can be used on relevant biological samples by examining various neuronal models (iNeuron cells, organoids, miBrains, and mouse brains) and human samples. This examination revealed 130 distinct tau proteoform groups with as many as six phosphorylation events. The non-random distribution of these phosphorylation events suggests ordered and site-specific modification processes rather than random, stochastic accumulation. Certain combinations of phosphorylation events were more abundant than others; for example, pT217 preferentially co-occurred with pT181.

Cell shape, cytoplasmic viscosity, and membrane stability are the main determinants of erythrocyte deformability, but it remains unknown how these properties affect the merozoite's invasiveness. This study aimed to investigate computationally (i) the role of erythrocyte morphology and merozoite-induced erythrocyte membrane damage in merozoite invasion and (ii) the suitability of mechanical markers of merozoite-induced erythrocyte membrane damage for screening of invasion-blocking antimalarial drugs. Finite element models were developed to represent a human erythrocyte and a spherocyte, their invasion by a malaria merozoite, and erythrocyte compression and nanoindentation as mechanical assays for membrane damage. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics represented the erythrocyte cytoplasm, and merozoite-induced erythrocyte membrane damage was implemented with a constitutive model. The invasiveness of the merozoite decreases with increased erythrocyte sphericity associated with genetic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis. The invasiveness is larger when membrane damage is induced in the erythrocyte at an early invasion stage than throughout the invasion process. The minimum force required for a malaria merozoite to invade a human erythrocyte was predicted to be 11 pN.

However, the inherent resolution limitations of SRT in most published data restrict deeper biological insights. To overcome this resolution limitation, we propose STRESS, the first deep learning method designed specifically for resolution enhancement tasks using only SRT data. By constructing a 3D structure that integrates spatial location information and gene expression levels, STRESS identifies interaction relationships between different locations and genes, predicts the gene expression profiles in the gaps surrounding each spot, and achieves resolution enhancement based on these predictions. STRESS has been trained and tested on datasets from multiple platforms and tissue types, and its utility in downstream analyses has been validated using independent datasets. We demonstrate that this resolution enhancement facilitates the identification and delineation of spatial domains.

In this regard, harnessing the inherent ability of cellular tissues to self-organize and generate large-scale force fields offers a promising strategy for creating self-shaping living surfaces. However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct morphogenesis remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By controlling nematic order we generate tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the design of shape-programmable living surfaces.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

One proposed mechanism is the release of bioactive molecules into the interstitium and systemic circulation during exercise, which may act directly on precancerous or tumour cells to suppress DNA damage, inhibit proliferation, and preserve genomic stability. Here, we evaluated the effects of exercise-conditioned human serum on DNA damage kinetics and transcriptomic signatures in colon cancer cells. Blood samples were collected from 30 participants (age 50-78 years, body mass index [&ge;]25 kg/m2) before and immediately after a maximal incremental cycling test. LoVo cells were exposed to pre- or post-exercise serum, treated with 2 Gy irradiation, and assessed for {gamma}-H2AX foci over 24 hours. Compared to pre-exercise serum, post-exercise serum significantly reduced {gamma}-H2AX foci at 6 hours (p=0.024) and decreased the area under the curve (AUC, p=0.014), indicating accelerated DNA repair. Post-exercise serum also increased expression of the DNA repair protein PNKP in LoVo cells, both with and without irradiation (p=0.007 and p=0.029, respectively). Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism and downregulation of cell cycle and proteasome-related pathways. These findings suggest that acute exercise elicits systemic responses that enhance DNA repair and shift colon cancer cells towards a less proliferative transcriptomic state under sublethal genotoxic stress, offering a potential mechanistic explanation for the protective effects of exercise against colorectal carcinogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Somatic mutations of the CRT gene (CALR) that are drivers of a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) alter the C-terminal domain. Perturbations in ER calcium storage and signaling are reported for an MPN type I mutant, CRTDel52, and have been linked to disease pathogenesis. The effects of the mutations on calcium binding are, however, yet to be quantified. Using recombinant purified proteins, we found that residues 340-349 in the CRT C-terminal domain, conserved in both the wild-type CRT and CRTDel52, are major contributors to low affinity calcium binding measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Quantitative measurements in various engineered cell lines also indicate overall similarities in ER and cytosolic calcium levels and signals in CRT knockout (CRT-KO) cells reconstituted with wild-type CRT or CRTDel52. Notably, the CRT-KO induces transcriptional changes to various genes in the cellular calcium signaling pathways. Thus, CRTDel52 retains at least some low affinity calcium binding sites, and any measured effects of ER and cytosolic calcium signal changes in cells with CRT perturbations may not be solely determined by its calcium binding functions.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Leveraging a focused CRISPR/KO screen in parallel with a CRISPR/activation screen, both tailored on response to BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment, we identified TAZ (encoded by the WWTR1 gene) deficiency as synthetically lethal with BRAF inhibitor in ATC. TAZ is overexpressed in ATC compared to well-differentiated thyroid tumors. We demonstrate that TAZ-deficient ATC cells display heightened sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Using gene essentiality score across a large panel of cancer cell lines, we found that BRAFV600E-driven cancers are highly sensitive to TAZ loss, unlike their counterparts with wild-type BRAF and non-BRAFV600E. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that dabrafenib triggers the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) under ER stress and suppresses protein synthesis.

The detection of internal seedborne pathogens like Ustilago nuda, causing loose smut in barley (Hordeum vulgare), is challenging because symptoms only appear when teliospores replace barley inflorescences and smutted ears develop. Currently, U. nuda seed infection levels are determined from the visual inspections of extracted embryos or fields of plants used for seed production, both of which are laborious and can be unreliable. To improve U. nuda detection, we developed a multiplex qPCR method targeting U. nuda and H. vulgare DNA. Naturally infected seed lots were tested using this qPCR method and the visual analysis of embryos. We grew the same seed lots in the field over two seasons and used the observed smutted ears as the reference infection level. The qPCR results, U. nuda DNA normalized to H. vulgare DNA, better correlated with observed field infections than the number of infected embryos. Our qPCR method more accurately distinguished seed lots with infections above and below the field tolerance threshold. It offers a reliable alternative to the visual analysis of extracted embryos. The integration of our qPCR method with field observations can enhance U. nuda management and reduce unnecessary prophylactic seed treatments, thereby bolstering integrated pest management strategies.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

E.; Smirnoff, N.; Bosch, M.", "abstract": "Many plants use self-incompatibility (SI) mechanisms to prevent inbreeding by inhibiting pollen tube growth in self pistils. In Papaver rhoeas, SI is triggered by allele-specific interaction between the pollen and pistil S-determinants, activating a Ca2+-dependent signalling network that leads to rapid reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and eventual programmed cell death (PCD) in incompatible pollen tubes. Expression of the Papaver pollen S-determinant (PrpS) in Arabidopsis thaliana recapitulates Papaver SI when challenged with the cognate pistil ligand (PrsS). Using roGFP2-Orp1, a genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor, combined with measurements of mitochondrial metabolism we have revealed a complex SI response. Within minutes, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) and cytosolic acidification converge to trigger mitochondrial H2O2 production (with consequent cytosolic and plastid H2O2 increase), membrane depolarisation, decreased respiration rate, and ATP depletion. In parallel, oxidative inactivation of cytosolic GAPDH inhibits glycolytic flux, resulting in decreased TCA cycle intermediates and providing a feedback loop to enhance mitochondrial disruption. Preceding production of mitochondrially-sourced ROS, we show that SI rapidly arrests pollen tube growth via inactivation of plasma membrane localised NADPH oxidase (RBOH) mediated superoxide production. Our findings provide new insights into how different ROS signatures from NADPH oxidase and mitochondria drive distinct processes. We demonstrate that mitochondrial disruption is an early and central event in the SI-response, likely driven by positive feedback loops involving altered Ca2+ signalling, cytosolic pH and ROS. Our findings provide novel insights into how SI rapidly disrupts energy metabolism in pollen tubes through interconnected signalling networks centred on mitochondria prior to PCD.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

This study employed an ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) approach integrating Random Forest, MaxEnt, and Boosted Regression Trees to predict the species current and future habitat suitability under two climate scenarios: SSP2-4.5 (intermediate emissions) and SSP5-8.5 (high emissions) for the 2061-2080 period. High-resolution bioclimatic variables and a curated dataset of georeferenced occurrence records were used to calibrate and validate the models. To ensure robustness, variable selection was performed through correlation filtering, and models were evaluated using AUC, TSS, and Kappa metrics. Model outputs revealed a marked contraction of highly suitable habitats under both scenarios, with losses reaching up to 85% under SSP5-8.5. In contrast, areas currently classified as unsuitable are projected to gain suitability, particularly in lower elevation belts of moist Afromontane zones, and higher elevation belts in northern Ethiopia suggesting potential downslope range shifts. Delta maps and transition matrices indicated widespread redistribution, including fragmentation and quality downgrading of core habitats. These findings highlight the dual challenges and opportunities posed by climate change for J. procera. While habitat loss and ecological fragmentation threaten long-term species viability, gains in new areas may offer pathways for adaptation provided dispersal, land use, and landscape connectivity are addressed. This study underscores the need for climate-informed, spatially explicit conservation strategies. Recommendations include prioritizing in-situ protection of climate refugia, promoting assisted migration to emerging suitable zones, and restoring degraded landscapes to support ecological resilience.

Recent reports suggest that ivermectin and moxidectin possess antibacterial properties in vitro, hence there is a need to comprehensively characterize their off-target effects on the gut microbiome. In the framework of a randomized-controlled trial we collected stool samples of 204 T. trichiura-infected individuals in Cote d'Ivoire receiving albendazole (400mg), albendazole-ivermectin (400mg/200{micro}g/kg) and albendazole-moxidectin (400mg/8mg).

Specifically, we tested how food divisibility (small vs. large food items) and time since food access (TSFA; 0 hours, 1 hour, and 3 hours) influenced food sharing behavior. Results revealed that larger food portions consistently promoted prosocial interactions, while longer durations since food access shifted behavior toward individualism. A significant interaction between TSFA and food size indicates that the effect of food size on prosocial behavior varies with hunger state: increasing TSFA weakens the prosocial impact of large food portions.

K.; Yuan, H.; Ding, L.", "abstract": "It has long been established that human brains remain functionally active at rest, as demonstrated with the discovery of resting-state networks (RSNs) underlying spontaneous neural activity. Recent studies suggest that classical RSNs estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using time-domain functional connectivity measures might be driven by recurring point-process events. Due to the slow hemodynamic response, fMRI is not able to reveal such point-processes at the timescale of neuronal events while electroencephalography (EEG) holds the promise due to its millisecond temporal resolution and successful reconstruction of fMRI-like RSNs from EEG. The present study reported a set of recurring transient (<100 milliseconds) cortical co-activation patterns (CAPs) derived from resting-state EEG using a clustering algorithm with spatial-domain measures (i.e., k-means). Our results indicate that this set of CAPs exhibit strong spatial correspondence with known RSNs, not only those derived from the same EEG data using time-domain measures (i.e., independence), but also those from fMRI literature, covering visual, auditory, motor, limbic, high-order, and default mode networks. CAPs exhibit the properties of hemispheric symmetry, spatially separatable sub-systems, and intersubject variability gradient across functional systems, which have all been observed in classical RSNs. In terms of differences between CAPs and RSNs beyond their timescales, CAPs demonstrate greater intersubject reproducibility of spatial patterns compared to their time-averaged RSNs counterparts. These findings suggest that classical RSNs might be driven by recurring transient neuronal activations captured in CAPs. More importantly, CAPs can reveal much fast dynamics of such brain-wide networked neuronal activations (e.g., different CAPs exhibit significantly different occurrences and lifetimes) and benefit from their great intersubject reproducibility, thus underscoring their potential to advance our understanding on neuronal mechanisms of spontaneous large-scale brain activation phenomena.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Adaptive therapies represent a novel approach to manage the emergence of resistance, by leveraging the competition between different cell phenotypes to control tumor burden rather than aiming for complete eradication. However, the emergence of phenotypically plastic persister cells, exhibiting transient epigenetic resistance, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of these approaches, and their specific impact is often overlooked in preclinical and mathematical models. This study investigates the role of persisters within adaptive therapy using a spatial agent-based model simulating sensitive, persistent, and genetically resistant cell populations. Our simulations reveal that persisters critically undermine treatment efficacy, significantly reducing progression-free survival (PFS) by approximately 40% (average 207 vs. 344 days in simulations) as they provide a reservoir for acquiring genetic resistance. Furthermore, tumors with higher levels of epigenetic resistance (more robust persisters) showed accelerated evolution towards resistance dominance phenotypes. The model showed treatment was most effective when sensitive cells initially dominated the tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight that persister dynamics are crucial determinants of adaptive therapy outcomes, suggesting that future strategies must account for epigenetic resistance, potentially informing approaches to assess tumor composition and sensitivity to better tailor treatments and improve patient outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, global vectors of dengue, require protein from host blood to support egg development and undergo repeated cycles of blood-feeding and egg-laying. After biting, females temporarily alter their behavioral state and suppress host-seeking while using blood-derived nutrients to develop eggs. Host-seeking suppression ends once eggs are laid. While this period has generally been thought of as one of behavioral inactivity, we reveal that it instead reflects behavioral reprogramming, during which females transition from post-blood-meal inactivity into active searching for egg-laying sites. Females with mature eggs show a distinct behavioral state characterized by increased locomotor activity and a shift in circadian behavioral timing, leading to nocturnal humidity-seeking and egg-laying in an otherwise diurnal species. We show that the circadian clock gene cycle is critical for regulating this transition; its absence disrupts the timing of oviposition behaviors, leading to poor site selection and reduced predicted offspring survival.

Methods: A thorough search on various databases was performed to identify published research articles published between January 2000 and June 2025 reporting the seroprevalence of PPRV in small ruminants in South Asia. The articles were chosen on the basis of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Since the heterogeneity among the studies was significant, the pooled seroprevalence was estimated via a random effects meta-analysis model, using Stata (v19) and R software (v4.5.0). Results: In sheep and goats, the estimated pooled seroprevalence of PPR was 42.4% (95% CI: 35.0-49.9), whereas it was 41.8% (95% CI: 33.7-50.1) in goats and 44.5% (95% CI: 37.0-52.0) in sheep. Subgroup analysis revealed that the pooled seroprevalence of PPRV in sheep and goat by country and vaccination status was greater in Nepal (57.0%, 95% CI: 8.4-97.7) and in vaccinated animals (57.5%, 95% CI: 47.9- 66.9). Conclusion: This study highlights the need for coordinated actions, including vaccination, surveillance, and strict biosecurity, to control and eradicate the disease effectively. Moreover, authorities should adopt evidence-based strategies to support the global goal of eradicating PPR by 2030, as recommended by the WOAH.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

M.; Jaramillo Delgado, I. L.; Correa-Valencia, N. M.", "abstract": "Hemotropic pathogen species of Anaplasma, Babesia, Mycoplasma, and Trypanosoma are endemic to cattle populations and may cause coinfections, complicating disease dynamics and control efforts. However, the host-related factors associated with these infections remain poorly understood under tropical field conditions. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hemotropic monoinfections and coinfections in cattle and to identify host-related factors associated with coinfection under field conditions in Colombia. A total of 104 animals were included in the study: 91 cattle, 10 buffaloes, and 3 goats. Among the cattle, 34 (37.4%) exhibited hemotropic monoinfections, 47 (51.6%) were coinfected, and 10 tested negative. Among the buffaloes, 7 (70.0%) presented monoinfections, and 2 (20.0%) were coinfected; among the goats, 2 had monoinfections, and 1 was coinfected most frequently involving Mycoplasma spp. The predominant coinfection patterns were Anaplasma + Mycoplasma and Mycoplasma + Trypanosoma, particularly in Bos indicus cattle. Bivariate and multivariate analyses identified breed as the strongest predictor of coinfection, with animals of less common breeds showing a 98% lower risk (aOR = 0.02; p = 0.007). Additionally, younger cattle (7-12 months) and Bos taurus breed individuals presented reduced odds of coinfection. Our findings reveal a high frequency of hemotropic coinfections in cattle, particularly those involving Mycoplasma spp., and demonstrate that host-related factors such as breed and age significantly influence infection risk. Bos indicus cattle presented the highest coinfection rates, whereas less common breeds, such as Bos taurus, and younger animals presented lower odds. These results highlight the need for surveillance and prevention strategies tailored to the demographic and genetic profiles of livestock populations.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing {beta}-cells in pancreatic islets. The peri-islet extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex protein barrier that is lost in T1D, in part due to infiltrating immune cells. The contribution of stressed {beta}-cells to ECM degradation during T1D remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we used 12-15 week old NOD mice and pancreas sections from healthy, [&ge;]2 autoantibody positive (Aab+), and recent onset T1D donors. We focused on MMP-3 due to its role in degrading type IV collagen (COL IV) in the peri-islet ECM. Treatment with proinflammatory cytokines or hyperglycemia increased MMP-3 gene expression and protein levels in mouse and human islets. In NOD pancreas sections, increased MMP-3 expression in {beta}-cells correlates with loss of COL IV during insulitis and hyperglycemia; however, this was independent of insulitis score. We observed similar increases in MMP-3 and loss of COL IV in islets and exocrine tissue from Aab+ and recent onset T1D donors. These results suggest that stressed {beta}-cells degrade the ECM during preclinical T1D, further weakening the peri-islet ECM barrier and facilitating islet infiltration and death. Inhibiting expression of MMP-3 may represent a novel treatment to prevent islet death in T1D.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Combining multiple genetic estimates of Ne", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.26.661823", "authors": "Waples, R. S.", "abstract": "Researchers often use more than one genetic method to estimate contemporary effective population size (Ne), but few formally combine multiple estimates despite the potential benefits for increasing precision. Maximizing these benefits requires an optimal, inverse-variance weighting scheme. A precondition for combining estimates is that they must be estimating the same parameter, which can be appropriate either for estimates using the same method applied to different time periods, or for estimates using different methods applied to the same time period. Previous approaches focused on var(Ne^) for weighting, but that is problematical because Ne^ is highly skewed and can be infinitely large. A new approach is described here using weights that are inversely proportional to var(1/Ne^). 1/Ne^ is the drift signal that Ne-estimation methods respond to, and its distribution is close to normal even when Ne^ assumes extreme values. Benefits are maximized under three general conditions: the estimators have approximately equal variances; they are uncorrelated or have weak positive correlations; individual estimates have low precision (i.e., if data are limited and/or true Ne is large). Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: (1) existing theory allows robust estimates of var(1/Ne^) for the temporal and LD methods, which provide independent information about Ne -- both of which facilitate optimally combining those methods; (2) estimates for the LD and sibship methods are essentially uncorrelated when data are limited but can be strongly positively correlated in genomics-scale datasets. General theory predicting var(1/Ne^) for the sibship method is lacking, but values for specific scenarios have been published.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}

To mitigate MI pathophysiology, we previously investigated a pro-reparative decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel for treating subacute and chronic MI. Despite increasing interest in biomaterial scaffolds, single cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics have not been used to probe their therapeutic activity in the heart. Here, we utilize spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA sequencing to delineate the regional and cell-specific bioactivity of ECM biomaterials. ECM hydrogel subacute treatment induced cardiac resident macrophage preservation, fibroblast activation, and increased lymphatic, vasculature, smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte development as well as neurogenesis. Chronic treatment elicited macrophage polarization, cardiomyocyte and vasculature development, alongside fibroblast development. When comparing treatment timepoints, subacute administration had stronger immune modulation, while the chronic timepoint demonstrated higher cardiac development markers. Both subacute and chronic administration were associated with fibroblast activation and vasculature development. Thus, we elucidate undiscovered therapeutic targets of the ECM hydrogel, further demonstrating the potential of ECM biomaterials as an MI therapy.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": ""}
