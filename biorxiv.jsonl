N.; Funk, S. K.; Weir, J. R.; Vader, G.", "abstract": "In mitosis, sister chromatids are preferred repair templates for homologous recombination, whereas in meiosis interhomolog-based repair is promoted. How this switch, which is a defining event in sexual reproduction, is accomplished remains poorly understood. In budding yeast, a meiosis-specific complex consisting of Red1, Hop1 and Mek1 (RHMc) enforces meiotic interhomolog bias, potentially through inhibition of intersister-based repair. The current data points to a linear assembly governing RHMc formation: the HORMA protein Hop1 associates with Red1 via a closure-motif-HORMA domain interaction, and Mek1 kinase is recruited through phospho-mediated interactions with Hop1. Here, via expression in mitotic cells we autonomously establish the RHM complex. In vivo analysis complemented with in vitro biochemical reconstitution shows that Mek1 associates with Red1, in a manner that might resemble binding of other kinases with scaffolding activators. The NH2-terminus of Red1 contributes to Hop1 binding, suggesting cooperative binding between Red1 and the HORMA domain of Hop1, beyond closure motif-based interactions. Meiotic activation of Mek1 kinase is dictated by complex formation and upstream DNA break-dependent signaling. We find Mek1 can be activated under DNA damaging conditions in mitotically dividing cells, where activation depends on upstream Mec1 kinase function and RHMc integrity. We perform a structure-function analysis of RHMc formation and Mek1 activation. Finally, we show that activation of Mek1 in mitosis leads to rad51{triangleup}-like DNA break sensitivity, providing evidence for the model that RHMc instates meiotic interhomolog-based repair by inhibiting mitotic homologous recombination. Our analysis enables querying downstream effects of RHMc action on DNA repair. Because aberrant re-expression of homologs of Red1 and Hop1 leads to DNA repair defects in human cancer, our system can be used to study roles of these genes during tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Using Hi-C in the silkworm Bombyx mori we discover a novel chromatin folding structure, compartment S, which is \"secluded\" from the rest of the chromosome. This compartment exhibits loop extrusion features and a unique genetic and epigenetic landscape, and it localizes towards the periphery of chromosome territories. While euchromatin and heterochromatin display preferential compartmental contacts, S domains are remarkably devoid of contacts with other regions, including with other S domains. Polymer simulations show that this contact pattern can only be explained by high loop extrusion activity within compartment S, combined with low extrusion elsewhere through the genome.

TAAs consist of a passenger domain, which is secreted onto the cell surface, and a transmembrane domain, which forms a pore in the OM to secrete and anchor the passenger domain. Because the interactions between TAAs and chaperones or dedicated auxiliary proteins during secretion are short-lived, TAAs are thought to reside on the OM without forming complexes with other proteins after secretion. In this study, we aimed to clarify the interactions between an Acinetobacter TAA, AtaA, and a peptidoglycan (PG)-binding periplasmic protein, TpgA. Pull-down assays using recombinant proteins identified the interacting domains. X-ray crystallography at 2.6 [A] resolution revealed an A3B3 heterohexameric complex structure composed of the N-terminal domain of TpgA and the transmembrane domain of AtaA. TpgA-N consists of two short  helices and three antiparallel {beta} strands, yielding an {beta}{beta}{beta} topology similar to BamE. However, the regions corresponding to BamE interfaces with BamA and BamD differ in TpgA-N. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and mutational assays revealed that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to stable complex formation. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that the TAA-TpgA complex occurs in a wide range of species. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of TAAs and the cell envelope.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Evaluating these designs and reconstruction methods typically involves time-consuming and costly trials. To streamline this process, we designed a computational channel simulator, namely D2Sim, for Nanopore sequencing-based DNA data storage. This simulator mimics real experiments, generating data with certain redundancy and errors at the receiver. Integrated with DeepSimulator, D2Sim outputs signals closely resembling actual signals of Nanopore-based DNA storage. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed simulator yields 16.7% to 88.7% lower sample difference deviations than signals from DeepSimulator alone.

Notably, one of its primary functions is the inhibition of seed germination. However, the structural basis underlying coumarin's germination-inhibitory effect remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the structure-activity relationships of coumarin analogs in two plant species, white clover and Arabidopsis, and demonstrated that the benzene ring and ester bond within the coumarin skeleton constitute the minimal structural requirements for germination inhibition. The inhibitory effects of dihydrocoumarin, which lacks the double bond in the coumarin skeleton, varied among plant species, while those of various other modified coumarin analogs also differed across species. In both plant species, coumarin consistently proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors. Furthermore, the observation that dihydrocoumarin exhibited a strong germination inhibitory effect only in white clover suggests that certain coumarin analogs may act in a species-specific manner. Additionally, the mechanism of coumarin-mediated germination inhibition remains largely unclear. Using RNA-Seq analysis on Arabidopsis seeds, we uncovered a novel and critically important mechanism whereby coumarin suppresses the expression of genes encoding expansins, proteins that are responsible for loosening plant cell walls.

To address this question, we designed a fast widefield optical brain-machine interface that enables real-time detection and reinforcement of individual traveling waves that display a specific displacement at the surface of the mouse somatosensory-motor cortex. Mice learned to generate such Conditioned Waves, which became progressively more stereotyped and were preceded by a characteristic suppression of cortical activity. Conditioned Waves were typically related to a limb movement that triggered somatosensory inputs. However, only the movements that occurred in conjunction with the identified suppressive cortical state could drive Conditioned Waves. This work demonstrates that propagating cortical waves can be subject to operant control. It provides evidence for the plasticity and functional relevance of large-scale cortical dynamics, and establishes a new paradigm for manipulating mesoscale brain activity.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, capturing this replay in humans has been challenging because unlike wakefulness, sleep EEG is dominated by slow, rhythmic background activity. Moreover, each sleep stage (e.g., NREM, REM) has distinct rhythms, hindering generalisation of models trained on wake-state data. To overcome these challenges, we developed the Sleep Interpreter (SI), a neural network model that decodes memory replay from sleep EEG. In a large dataset comprising 135 participants (~1,000 h of overnight sleep; ~400 h of wake), we employed a TMR-like paradigm with 15 semantically congruent cue-image pairs to tag specific memories. SI was trained separately for NREM and REM using contrastive learning to align neural patterns across wake and sleep, filtering out stage-specific background rhythms. We also examined how slow oscillations and spindle coupling influence decoding in NREM sleep. In a 15-way classification, SI achieved up to 40.02% Top-1 accuracy on unseen subjects. To test generalisability, we followed up with two independent nap experiments in separate samples and applied the trained SI model off-the-shelf. The first probed spontaneous reactivation without auditory cues, while the second used semantic-free sounds with new images. In both, SI successfully decoded reactivation during sleep that correlated with post-nap memory performance. By openly sharing our dataset and SI system, we provide a unique resource for advancing research on memory and learning during sleep, and related disorders.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Many types of TreMs are associated to large old trees and show slow ontogenical processes. The rarity of such TreMs (particularly in intensively managed forests) hinder the estimation of their occurrence rate along tree growth. Here, we used a continental meta-analysis on TreMs occurrence rate along tree growth to build informative priors for a model of trunk-base rot-hole occurrence on oaks within the Gresigne forest, France --- a context where stand management and tree DBH were confounded. We explored whether the use of informative priors could improve the identifiability, the precision of estimates and the predictive abilities of the model. Without prior information, the low variance of tree DBH within management modalities rendered the model poorly identifiable and prevented the detection of an effect of tree DBH per se across the range of explored tree DBH. By contrast, using informative priors contributed to improve the precision of estimates and lead to detecting a positive effect of tree DBH per se. Informative priors did not degrade the model fit and clearly improved predictive abilities on new stands. In particular, while the model without prior information did not predict the occurrence of trunk-base rot-holes significantly better than a purely random guess, the model with informative priors did. Irrespective of the prior used, models suggested that the high recruitment of trunk-base rot-holes in Gresigne may be a temporary management effect in stands undergoing conversion from coppice-with-standards to high forest through sprout thinning, which will lead to conservation issues for cavicolous saproxylic species when all conversions are complete. Because using informative priors was simple and beneficial in our study, it should be further explored in other local applied contexts to orientate forest management.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Recent research has shown that previous observations based on averaged power are driven by the presence of transient, oscillatory burst-like events, particularly within the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. However, the interplay between different burst events in human WM is not well understood. The current EEG study aimed to investigate the dynamics between alpha (8-12 Hz)/beta (15-29 Hz) and high frequency activity (HFA; 55-80 Hz) bursts in human WM, particularly burst features and error-related deviations during the encoding and maintenance of WM in healthy adults. Oscillatory burst features within the alpha, beta and HFA bands were examined at frontal and parietal electrodes in healthy young adults during a Sternberg working memory task. Averaged power dynamics were driven by oscillatory burst features, most consistently the burst rate and burst power. Alpha/beta and HFA bursts displayed complementary roles in WM processes, in that alpha and beta bursting decreased during encoding and increased during delay, while HFA bursting had the opposite pattern, i.e., increased during encoding and decreased during the delay. Critically, weaker variation in burst dynamics across stages was associated with incorrect responses and impaired overall task performance. Together, these results indicate that successful human WM is dependent on the rise and fall interplay between alpha/beta and HFA bursts, with such burst dynamics reflecting a novel target for the development of treatment in clinical populations with WM deficits.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most serious types of DNA damage, as they lead to loss of genetic information and death when not repaired. In E. coli, they are recognised and processed by the RecBCD complex, which initiates repair by homologous recombination. Although the repair dynamics downstream of RecBCD has been well characterised, it is still unclear how long this complex stays attached to DNA and what triggers its dissociation in vivo. To answer these questions, we imaged RecB at the single-molecule level, and quantified its dynamic behaviour in bacterial cells exposed to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that induces DSBs. Our results show that RecB forms long-lived complexes with DSBs (10 seconds), and that its dissociation from DNA is an intrinsic property of the complex, that does not depend on the amount of DNA damage, nor the following steps in the repair pathway. Moreover, we show that we can use RecB binding to DSBs as a marker to estimate the rate of damage formation. This study provides a detailed quantitative insight into the interaction of RecBCD with DNA double-strand ends in E. coli in vivo, and into the bacterial response to DSBs induced by ciprofloxacin.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

We used this model to characterize the effect of lipid binding and mutations in variants of concern to the Orf9b:Tom70 equilibrium. We found that the binding of a lipid to the Orf9b homodimer biases the Orf9b monomer:dimer equilibrium towards the dimer by reducing the dimer dissociation rate ~100-fold. We also found that mutations in variants of concern can alter different microscopic rate constants without significantly affecting binding to Tom70.

Alpha processes were localized primarily in the posterior cortex and organized into two specialized networks - parieto-occipital and sensorimotor - showing increasing localization probability with age, while peak amplitude and frequency also followed an age-dependent inverted-U pattern.

The wealth of genomic data and available functional genetic tools make Drosophila melanogaster an ideal model species for studies at single nucleotide resolution.

FlyCADD provides impact prediction scores for any single nucleotide variant on the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate the power of FlyCADD for typical applications, such as the ranking of phenotype-associated variants to prioritize variants for follow-up studies, evaluation of naturally occurring polymorphisms, and refining of CRISPR-Cas9 experimental design.

Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated the limited efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) against melanoma cells and tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, primarily due to acquired chemoresistance. The lack of favorable outcomes in metastatic melanoma patients treated with liposomal DOX highlights the need to identify early DOX-induced resistance biomarkers and develop combination strategies to improve efficacy. This study explores early adaptive responses in B16.F10 melanoma spheroids after two sub-inhibitory DOX exposures ({approx}IC30), focusing on chemoresistance mechanisms in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasiveness. Melanoma spheroids were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates and treated with DOX in two 48-hour phases separated by 48-hour recovery periods, followed by viability, morphology, gene/protein expression, and enzyme activity assessments using RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and gelatinase assay, respectively. Functional analysis confirmed downregulation of cell cycle pathways, suppression of stress response and survival pathways (e.g., TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB and MTORC1_SIGNALING). Despite mRNA data showing cell cycle arrest (downregulated CDK1, Ticrr, Cdc20) and major DNA damage and impaired repair (downregulated BRIP1, BARD1, Rad51, Rmi2), after first exposure to DOX, cells probably bypassed cell cycle checkpoints by upregulating transcripts and proteins linked to pro-survival (Tnfrsf19, cIAP-2) and angiogenesis (VEGF, eotaxin-1), and by upregulating transcripts related to cell adhesion (Pcdh beta family members), and ECM remodeling (Ecm1, Jam2), suggesting early adaptation mechanisms to DOX. With a second DOX exposure, melanoma spheroids showed stronger chemoresistance, evidenced by enhanced angiogenesis (upregulated Aqp1, VEGF, and Ackr3), increased invasiveness (upregulated MMP-2, favored MMP-9 activity), and a 40% increase in pNF-kB levels, reinforcing drug tolerance and aggressiveness. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular drivers of chemoresistance, revealing that early DOX resistance in melanoma arises from adaptive mechanisms enhancing survival, angiogenesis, and invasiveness.

Bacterial fitness assessments revealed trade-offs between resistance-associated mutations and growth, though no systematic correlation of MIC increase and growth deficit was detected. Over 50% of the selected clones became more susceptible to aminoglycosides, clarithromycin, and colistin, while some mutation patterns resulted in cross-resistance to meropenem and fluoroquinolones. Overall, beta-lactam antibiotics reproducibly selected mutants with increased MICs, but evolutionary pathways and resulting phenotypes remain unpredictable. These findings highlight the complexity of resistance evolution and suggest that future AMR treatment strategies may need to consider strain-specific and collateral effects more closely.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Using a murine model in which prior sepsis predisposes to enhanced lung injury, we previously discovered that classical monocytes persist in the lungs after long-term recovery from sepsis and exhibit enhanced cytokine expression after secondary challenge with intra-nasal lipopolysaccharide. Here, we hypothesized that immune reprogramming of post-sepsis monocytes and altered ontogeny predispose to enhanced lung injury. Monocyte depletion and/or adoptive transfer was performed three weeks and three months after sepsis. Monocytes from post-sepsis mice were necessary and sufficient for enhanced LPS-induced lung injury and promoted neutrophil degranulation. Prior sepsis enhanced JAK-STAT signaling and AP-1 binding in monocytes and shifted monocytes toward the neutrophil-like monocyte lineage. In human sepsis and/or pneumonia survivors, monocytes were predictive of 90-day mortality and exhibit transcriptional and proteomic neutrophil-like signatures. We conclude that sepsis reprograms monocytes into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and skews bone marrow progenitors and monocytes toward the neutrophil-like lineage, predisposing to neutrophil degranulation and lung injury.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

The interplay of individual factors influencing early treatment response within this high-risk molecular subtype remains poorly elucidated. We aimed to comprehensively assess how leukemic developmental state, fusion partner, and patient age jointly influence early treatment response and drug sensitivity. Methods: To identify determinants of early treatment response to induction chemotherapy, we analysed 465 KMT2Ar B-ALL cases spanning a wide age range (1 month to 89 years) by integrating transcriptomic and genomic profiling with functional drug response and measurable residual disease (MRD) kinetics. Transcriptomic profiling was used to derive a developmental maturity score based on proximity to physiological B-cell differentiation from a normal B-lymphopoiesis reference. Using an ordinal regression model we identify gene expression programs associated with early MRD response. Results: We observed a strong inverse correlation between MRD clearance with advancing age (p=2.1E-04), proximity to early B-cell-precursor developmental state (low maturity score, p=1.3E-03) and AFF1 as fusion partner (p=7.0E-04). A combined model confirmed the predominate impact of both maturity and KMT2A fusion partner on MRD response, supporting the concept that the cells developmental state defines therapy response. Gene expression analysis identified cellular traits that relate to MRD response (e.g. chromatin organization, immune modulation and proliferation). This gene expression classifier grouped cases by MRD response but also by ex-vivo induction drug sensitivity. Notably, good responders to ex-vivo induction drugs were characterized by a higher maturity score (p=1.8E-03), whereas for less mature KMT2Ar B-ALL cases response profiles suggested higher Venetoclax sensitivity. Conclusions: Our study provides an integrative framework linking developmental phenotype, fusion partner, and MRD kinetics across the full age spectrum of KMT2Ar B-ALL. The maturity score, derived from bulk transcriptome data, offers a biologically relevant predictor of early treatment response and drug sensitivity. These insights may support future risk-adapted strategies and therapeutic targeting, particularly in immature KMT2Ar B-ALL.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

F.; Bringas-Vega, M. L.; Minati, L.; Valdes-Sosa, P. A.", "abstract": "A longstanding debate in neuroscience asks whether macroscale brain signals can be treated as purely linear Gaussian processes, or if they harbor intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. Here we present evidence that normal resting-state EEG signals contain robust nonlinearities, which appear to be concentrated in specific oscillatory components. To investigate this, we introduce BiSpectral EEG Component Analysis (BiSCA), a novel spectral modeling framework that unifies power spectral and bispectral analysis to identify inter-frequency harmonic relationships and distinguish distinct signal components. Unlike prior spectral parameterization approaches, BiSCA is designed to explicitly test for nonlinearity. Crucially, simulations confirm its ability to separate true nonlinearity from non-Gaussianity - a common confound where linear, non-Gaussian systems can produce diffuse bicoherence that might be mistaken for nonlinear interaction. We performed a nonlinear, non-Gaussian test for two large datasets of human brain recordings (1,771 intracranial EEG channels and 960 scalp EEG recordings), and with the BiSCA model we were able to apply the tests on each identified component, revealing a clear organizational principle within these signals. We found that the brain's broadband, aperiodic background (the {xi} (Xi) process) behaves predominantly as a linear, Gaussian process. In contrast, the narrowband oscillatory {rho} (Rho) components - including the prominent alpha () rhythm and other spectral peaks - are the primary source of cortical nonlinearity, exhibiting significant quadratic coupling. In fact, over two-thirds of all EEG and iEEG channels showed significant departures from linear Gaussian behavior, challenging a frequent assumption of widespread linearity in large-scale brain signals. Notably, we observed a striking dissociation between signal power and nonlinearity. While the occipital alpha  rhythm dominates the EEG power spectrum, the strongest nonlinear signatures arose from the parietal mu () rhythm. These findings suggest that nonlinear resonance phenomena are pervasive in cortical signals, arising primarily from the brain's resonant neural oscillations rather than its aperiodic activity. Our work demonstrates the utility of bispectral methods for characterizing complex brain dynamics and underscores that even at the macroscale, our understanding of neural activity will remain incomplete without accounting for these intrinsic nonlinear interactions.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Although a putative {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 mutation associated with resistance has been detected in U. stenocephala, clinical resistance to benzimidazoles has not yet been confirmed. Benzimidazole resistance is primarily linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 gene; however, the {beta}-tubulin genes of U. stenocephala have not been fully characterised. We aimed to identify {beta}-tubulin genes and confirm the coding sequences for key residues (Q134, F167, E198, and F200) in the {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 gene of the U. stenocephala genome. Two U. stenocephala specimens were subjected to Illumina sequencing, and species identity was confirmed through morphological and molecular analysis using ITS rDNA and cox-1 markers. Genome assembly revealed the presence of {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 (10 exons) and isotype-2 (9 exons), both homologous to {beta}-tubulins from other hookworms (A. caninum, A. ceylanicum, A. duodenale and Necator americanus). The {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 protein sequence of U. stenocephala contained two variable residues (S37Q and G441A) compared to other hookworm sequences.

In this regard, existing agent-based models (ABMs), such as vertex and Voronoi models, lack generality, limiting the range and richness of their applications. In particular, these models often fail to accommodate complex cell geometries or do not implement thermodynamically well-posed rules for topological transitions. These features are essential for describing the biophysics of several morphogenetic processes, where irregular cell shapes and dynamic cell rearrangements play central roles. To address the limitations of existing models, we present a novel computational framework, referred to here as the morphodynamic network model (MNM), for simulating confluent cell monolayers. The MNM is a cell center-based ABM in which the cell centers (or nodes) are connected to form a dynamic triangulation (or topological) network. The node positions and topological structure (denoting connections between neighboring cells) evolve according to a split-step approach: motion of nodes at a fixed topology, followed by reconstruction of the topological network at fixed node positions. The MNM is then applied to study some of the morphodynamic behavior of cell monolayers. These include fluidization, elasto-visco-plastic response, nematic ordering, and substrate-induced cell alignment. The MNM is designed to capture complex behaviors, offering a flexible and robust tool for studying multicellular phenomena.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness.

To achieve the goals, we used an untargeted metabolomics approach to compare chemical profiles from long-term certified organic fields, including different cover crop termination methods like flail and rotary mowing, to conventionally managed plots. We analyzed rhizosphere soil extracts using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS).

We annotated metabolites using the MS-DIAL Public VS17 libraries for features derived from MS-DIAL and the METLIN database for features derived from XCMS.

In the present study, we investigated the long-term fate (> 6 months) of organic substrates supplied in sterilised soils in which cell life was not detectable. Through a series of analytical studies performed on the water-extractable fraction of soil exometabolites using chromatography, mass spectrometry and isotope labelling, we demonstrate that sterile soil matrix incubated with [13C6]-glucose and [13C6]-citrate can spontaneously generate intermediates of the Krebs cycle, alongside by-products such as acetate and formate.

Using large-scale integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from normal colon and CRC we mapped the fibroblast subpopulations. Spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization were used for validation and computational analyses to predict developmental trajectories and transcription factors underlying CAF activation. Subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs), mucosa-associated fibroblasts (MAFs), and submucosa-associated fibroblasts (SAFs) were identified as the main colon fibroblast subtypes, and in mice, further divided into location-based subclusters.

CRCs contained normal fibroblasts as well as four cancer-specific CAF populations: inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), and two precursor CAF (preCAF) subtypes. Our data suggested that iCAFs originate from SEMFs through a preCAF1 intermediate phenotype, while mCAFs derive from SAFs/MIFs via preCAF2s.

By combining plant phosphate (Pi)-deficiency-induced promoter systems with fungal self-sustained bioluminescence systems genetically engineered into tobacco plants, we created sensor plants that emitted more light when experiencing Pi deficiency. This light emission correlated with the expressions of known phosphate-responsive genes and the total phosphorus content in plants, and decreased during Pi recovery conditions, demonstrating the responsiveness and robustness of the sensor plants in reflecting endogenous phosphorus deficiency. The sensor plants responded primarily to Pi deficiency rather than nitrogen or potassium deficiencies and were sensitive to different ranges of external Pi concentrations. Additionally, when grafted onto tomato and chili pepper plants, the sensor plants responded to external phosphorus deficiency, showing promise for monitoring stress signals in different crop species.

We investigated the microstructure, structural connectivity, and lateralization of Broca's area SWM and its relationship with language performance (Picture Vocabulary and Oral Reading Recognition assessments), in comparison to the deeper white matter connections of the frontal aslant tract and arcuate fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus demonstrated the strongest and most consistent leftward lateralization of both microstructure (fractional anisotropy, FA) and structural connectivity (number of streamlines, NoS), with structure-function associations that were bilateral in adolescents and left-dominant in adults. Interestingly, despite weaker lateralization than the arcuate fasciculus, both the SWM and the frontal aslant tract demonstrated comparable associations with language performance.

We investigated how ADGRL3 knockout affects striatal dopamine release in mice using ex vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and in vivo fiber photometry with a dopamine sensor. Ex vivo measurements showed increased electrically-evoked dopamine release across the striatum. Conversely, in vivo recordings revealed reduced task-induced dopamine signals in the nucleus accumbens during an operant fixed interval task. This reduction was not due to impaired dopamine availability, as amphetamine-evoked release was unchanged. These findings suggest ADGRL3 modulates dopamine release in complex ways via different pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, such behaviours are often transitory and dependent on factors that vary over space, time and number of individuals, making them difficult to capture with standard laboratory tasks. Here we present Aeon, an open-source platform designed for continuous, long-term study of self-guided behaviours in multiple mice and simultaneous recording of brain activity within large customizable habitats. By integrating specialized modules for navigation, nesting and sleeping, escaping, foraging, and social interaction, Aeon enables the expression of key ethological behaviours while achieving experimental control and multi-dimensional quantifications from sub-milliseconds to month-long durations. Its software architecture ensures robust data acquisition via many synchronized data streams and seamless analysis pipelines that delivers a new standardised and unified data format. Using tasks such as digging-to-threshold and social foraging, Aeon reveals how mice adapt strategies in a changing environment and in response to conspecifics. This approach therefore bridges ecological relevance with rigorous experimental control to advance our understanding of how neural circuit activity give rises to a range of highly conserved and adaptive behaviours.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

High estradiol (E2) exacerbates nicotine use outcomes in women, effects which have been modeled in preclinical nicotine self-administration (SA) studies. Nicotine SA is maintained by dopamine (DA) release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NA). E2 exerts its effects by binding to estrogen receptors (ER), including ER, ER{beta}, and G-protein coupled ER-1 (GPER-1)s. E2 action at ERs specifically has been shown to potentiate DA neuronal excitability within the VTA. Further, we have shown that ovariectomy decreases both nicotine use during SA and VTA ER{beta} protein. Despite clear evidence of mechanistic relationships between E2, ERs, DA, and nicotine, no studies to date have functionally evaluated the specific role of ER{beta} located on VTA DA cells in driving nicotine consumption during SA in females. There are currently no tools that allow for evaluations of relationships between nicotine neurobiology and ERs with cell-type specificity, as ER{beta} is also localized on other (non-DA) cell types within the VTA. As such, the goals of the present studies were (1) to build and validate a novel adeno-associated viral construct that produces long-term knockdown of ER{beta} specifically on VTA DA neurons, and (2) to determine if VTA DA ER{beta} viral knockdown reduces nicotine SA in ovary-intact female rats. Here we show that ER{beta} regulates VTA DA neuron excitability, and that ER{beta} knockdown in VTA DA neurons reduces DA neuron firing frequency. We also show that VTA ER{beta} knockdown in DA neurons reduces nicotine SA acquisition in ovary-intact female rats. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role of ER{beta} in driving nicotine use in females, underscoring the need for future studies to evaluate neurobehavioral mechanisms of smoking through the lens of sex differences.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Inhibitory brain networks, particularly within the amygdala, are disrupted by stress and implicated in stress-related psychopathologies. Using a rodent model, the current study investigated the isolated and combined effects of prenatal and adolescent stress on adult social interactions and GABAergic neurons surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Male and female rats were exposed to chronic variable stressors (CVS) prenatally (PS), during adolescence (AS), or during both prenatal and adolescent periods (PS+AS). In adulthood, all animals were tested for social behavior with same-sex weight-matched partners, and brains were collected for identification of BLA inhibitory neurons (GAD67 staining) and PNNs (Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin staining). For social behavior, AS alone robustly increased social investigation in adulthood relative to non-stressed (NS) controls and animals exposed to combined PS+AS. PS+AS subjects did not significantly differ from NS controls, suggesting that prenatal stress exposure prevented adolescent stress-induced increases in adult social investigation. An analogous data pattern was observed in the BLA. AS alone decreased the number GAD67+ neurons surrounded by PNNs (co-labeled) relative to NS controls and subjects exposed to combined PS+AS. When the percentage of total GAD67+ neurons co-labeled with PNNs was assessed, both PS alone and AS alone reduced the proportion of GAD67+ neurons surrounded by PNNs, whereas combined PS+AS had no effect. Overall, these data suggest that prenatal stress exposure prevents adolescent stress-induced disruptions to perineuronal nets surrounding inhibitory neurons in the BLA, potentially conferring resilience to adolescent stress-induced changes in inhibitory function and social behavior.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, EEG data corresponding to imagined English-language speech phonemes were used for ISR, in combination with an LLM trained on an abridged autobiography. The LLM-generated text responses guided the synthesis of EEG data from relevant phonemes, which were then used to estimate corresponding metabolic activity, and the changes in simulated neurometabolic and electrical parameters were visually represented. Notably, introducing pseudorandom variance significantly (p < 0.001) enhanced the models ability to reflect biological variability. Future directions include expanding the ISR system with lightweight or locally run LLMs, incorporating training data from larger and more diverse populations, and utilizing truly random variability sources. Further optimization for broader hardware compatibility and implementation--such as neural phantoms, emotional context integration, or human-computer interaction platforms--offer promising pathways for advancement.

Thus, larger culture volumes and time-consuming manual protein extraction and purification steps are normally required to produce sufficient quantity of protein of appropriate purity. This limits the type of assay, and number of protein variants that can be simultaneously tested in an experiment. Here we describe a HTS protocol that allows the overnight expression, export and assay of recombinant proteins from E. coli cells in the same multi-well plate tube.

The resulting protein is of sufficient purity and yield that in can be used directly in plate-based enzymatic assays without additional purification.

Through quantitative profiling of the UbK63-associated OS proteome, we identify the transmembrane fragment of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2m) as a principal cargo of the BBSome. In Bbs4-/- mice, ubiquitinated IMPG2m aberrantly accumulates in OSs, and disruption of IMPG2m ubiquitination impairs its retrieval and clearance. Because full-length IMPG2 traffics to the OS to deliver its extracellular domain to the matrix, our data support a model in which IMPG2m undergoes constitutive cycling between the inner and outer segments.

We investigate the impact of environment heterogeneity on mutant fixation in spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph. When migrations between demes are frequent, we demonstrate that environment heterogeneity can amplify natural selection and simultaneously accelerate mutant fixation and extinction, thereby fostering the quick fixation of beneficial mutants. We evidence this effect in the star graph, more strongly in the line graph, and also in a more general class of graphs. We show that for amplification to occur, mutants must have a stronger fitness advantage in demes with stronger migration outflow. In circulation graphs, where migration inflow and outflow are equal in each deme, we find that environment heterogeneity has no impact in a first approximation, but increases the fixation probability of beneficial mutants to second order.

In this respect, integrative genomics using population and functional genomic data can be employed to understand evolutionary processes that have shaped adaptation to infectious diseases in domestic cattle. This approach can be particularly informative for African cattle, which exhibit a complex mosaic of Bos taurus (taurine) and Bos indicus (indicine) genomic ancestry. Some African taurine populations have an important evolutionary adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.) that cause African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) disease. AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and causes a financial burden of approximately $4.5 billion annually. In this study we identified putative candidate genes underlying trypanotolerance through the integration of local ancestry inference (LAI) from genome-wide SNP data for multiple trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible hybrid cattle populations with RNA-seq and expression microarray transcriptomics data from multiple tissues collected across time course trypanosome infection experiments. These candidate genes included AGO2, CBL, CNOT1, EDN1, IL1B, NFKB1, RIPK1, and TRAF2.

MDZip achieves over 95% reduction in storage size across a diverse benchmark of proteins, protein-peptide complexes, and nucleic acids. Despite operating in a physics-agnostic manner, the reconstructed trajectories accurately preserve ensemble-level features, including RMSD fluctuations, pairwise distance distributions, radius of gyration, and projections onto principal and time-lagged independent components. A residual (skip-connected) autoencoder variant consistently improves reconstruction accuracy and reduces outliers. While local structural deviations can impair energetic fidelity, short energy minimization partially recovers physically reasonable conformations.

PPP2R4 (also known as PTPA) is a key activator of the phosphatase PP2A known to suppress NB. We show that AURKA and MYCN expression decreases postnatally in murine adrenal glands, suggesting that their expression may contribute to the maintenance of SAPs. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), used in place of difficult-to-isolate SAPs, AURKA contributed to transformation only when MYCN was overexpressed and INK4A/ARF was depleted. In transgenic mice expressing human AURKA (hAURKA) in adrenal glands, hAURKA mRNA was present but protein was undetectable, likely due to AURKA's short half-life, possibly limiting its role in initial transformation of SAPs. However, AURKA cooperated with MYCN to promote progression of established human SH-EP NB cells lacking INK4A/ARF. In addition, AURKA expression increased during NB progression in TH-MYCN mice and correlated with poor prognosis in human NB, supporting a role for AURKA in disease progression and maintenance. CDKN2A and PPP2R4 mRNA levels also rose during NB progression in TH-MYCN mice, possibly reflecting inadequate tumor-suppressive responses. Baysean analysis of TH-MYCN expression data supported a role for PPP2R4 in inhibiting NB maintenance. Knockout of PPP2R4 in KELLY NB cells, along with reduced mePPP2CA, the catalytic subunit of PP2A, increased AURKA protein levels, indicating that PP2A regulates AURKA abundance.

Here, we investigate the role of the small GTPase Cdc42 in salivary gland acinar cell development using a mouse model designed to knock out Cdc42 specifically at the onset of acinar cell formation. Loss of Cdc42 resulted in defective apical membrane formation accompanied by accumulation of vesicles around the apical lumen. These vesicles contained the apical water channel AQP5 and the apical recycling endosome (ARE) marker Rab11a, while the basolateral transporter NKCC1 retained normal localization, indicating an apical-selective trafficking defect. Importantly, Cdc42 deficiency caused a selective 40% reduction in the expression of the SNARE protein VAMP2, while other vesicle trafficking proteins including VAMP8, SNAP23, and EEA1 remained unchanged. Our findings reveal that Cdc42 controls apical membrane formation by maintaining VAMP2 expression, which is essential for the fusion of Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes. The accumulation of fusion-incompetent AREs near the apical surface demonstrates the critical role of the Cdc42-VAMP2 pathway in epithelial development.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a new mechanism for the internalization of receptor to activate the downstream signaling in animals. Here, we found that mutation of CME components resulted in formation of stomatal clusters and thus increased stomatal index. The adaptor protein 2{sigma} (AP2{sigma}) subunit of CME interacted with ERf. ERf receptor internalization required CME. Furthermore, the ERf receptor motifs were identified to be recognized by AP2{sigma}. Genetic analysis showed that CME components CHC2, CLC2, and CLC3 acted downstream of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 1/2 (EPF1/2) while upstream of YODA, and worked together with ERf to regulate stomatal development.

Inhibiting or knocking down Vav2 sensitized multiple cell types to CDCs, whereas blocking other Rac GEFs did not. Vav2 accounted for ~90% of Ca2+-dependent membrane repair. MEK activation rescued repair in Vav2-inhibited cells. Vav2 inhibition failed to exacerbate damage in cells lacking dysferlin or annexins, suggesting Vav2 coordinates multiple repair pathways.

The exact etiology of the disease is unknown, but T cell dysregulation and aberrant activation is associated with UC--prompting research into T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in UC patients. However, few studies have compared UC patients' TCR repertoires in flare (inflamed) and remission (uninflamed) states. Moreover, this is the first dataset to our knowledge examining multiple repertoires from UC patients over time, enabling longitudinal analyses. Methods: TCR repertoires were obtained for 21 patients across multiple timepoints, yielding a total of 58 samples. Repertoires' clonality, diversity, overlap, and gene usage frequencies were compared across all patients. CDR3 sequences were split into K-mers (sequences of length K), and enriched K-mers in flare and remission states were identified using GLIPH2. Results: Although repertoires vary across patients, there were significant differences in the usage of 20 V-beta genes across flare and remission states. Moreover, calculating the overlap in repertoires with enriched K-mers showed higher overlap scores than when using full TCR sequences. 622 unique enriched K-mers were identified in flare states and 495 in remission states, with only 57 overlapping between the two states. Conclusions: Overall, these results highlight the importance of analyzing V-beta gene usage and K-mer enrichment in TCR repertoires, particularly given the lack of public clones across patient cohorts. Future studies characterizing the specific antigenic targets associated with these features will pave the way for biomarker discovery in UC.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

To do this, we carried out a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. Our aim was to obtain insights that could inform reflection and guide future research priorities around rehoming programmes. Our study demonstrated support for laboratory rodent rehoming in all stakeholder groups. Rehomers' and technicians' comments focused chiefly on the potential benefits of rehoming to the animal and benefits to institutional openness. Researchers made similar comments, but in this group, these comments were tempered by concerns around the welfare of the animals after rehoming, the fate of animals that cannot be rehomed, rehomers' health and well-being, and the potential risks associated with the transparency of individual's and the institution's use of animals in research.

We report that Notch3 signaling levels match NSC quiescence and stemness levels. In physical space, Notch3 signaling is patterned and high signaling levels surround N3ICDlow cells, which also express the deltaA (dla) ligand. Another ligand, jagged1b (jag1b), expressed in all NSCs, positively interacts with Notch3 and sustains expression of the stemness factor Sox2. Finally, lowering jag1b preserves the structured distribution of Notch3 signaling levels in space but attenuates their variance. We propose that Notch3 signaling integrates Dla-mediated lateral inhibition and Jag1b-mediated lateral induction to control quiescence and stemness and their spatiotemporal dynamics in adult NSCs.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of siRNA profiles linked to seed viability and germination in barley (Hordeum vulgare), utilizing a unique set of seeds from a single batch subjected to controlled long-term storage. Some seeds lost viability due to moisture exposure from unsealing, creating a natural experimental model to explore vigor effects. sRNA sequencing revealed 85,728 differentially expressed siRNAs, with distinct patterns between regenerated, high-viability, and low-viability seeds. Notably, trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) showed peak abundance at different imbibition times depending on seed quality, suggesting dynamic regulation. Around 46% of siRNAs were 21 nucleotides, and 54% were 22 nucleotides long. Gene Ontology and degradome analyses confirmed siRNA target genes involved in vital biological processes such as cytochrome complex function, root development, cell maturation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Despite RNA degradation in low-viability seeds, siRNAs remained relatively stable, indicating their potential role in maintaining seed metabolic activity during dormancy release and germination initiation.

Knowledge gaps include whether molecular endotypes of psoriasis underlie distinct clinical phenotypes and the positive and negative molecular regulators of disease severity across tissue compartments. Methods We performed comprehensive RNA-sequencing of skin and blood (n=718) from prospectively-recruited, deeply-phenotyped discovery and replication cohorts of 146 subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis initiating TNF-inhibitor (adalimumab) or IL-12/23-inhibitor (ustekinumab) therapy. Results Using two complementary methods for dimensionality reduction, we defined distinct but interconnected co-expression modules and factors within skin and blood that were significantly associated with disease phenotypes and disease severity, as measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). We identified a 14-gene signature negatively associated with BMI in nonlesional skin and disease severity in lesional skin, respectively. Genotype integration revealed that HLA-DQA1*01 and HLA-DRB1*15 genotypes were positively associated with baseline disease severity. Using Gaussian process regression followed by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we defined two core drug independent and disease severity-associated gene modules in lesional skin - one positive, one negative - and a lesional 9-gene signature predictive of disease severity. Disease severity signatures in blood were only seen following adalimumab exposure, suggesting greater systemic impact of adalimumab compared to ustekinumab, in line with its side effect profile. In contrast, a gene signature in blood linked to HLA-C*06:02 status was independent of disease severity or drug.

Our analysis revealed significant age-associated changes in CM physiology, including hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. We uncovered dramatic epigenetic remodeling in aged CMs, characterized by increased chromatin accessibility and altered DNA methylation patterns. Overexpression of the DNA methylase DNMT3A in young adult mouse hearts recapitulated key features of the aged heart phenotype, establishing DNA hypermethylation as a significant regulator of age-related CM function. Furthermore, ESRRG, an orphan nuclear receptor, functions as a mediator of diastolic function in the heart.

While robust replisome progression through R-loops is observed in wild-type cells, it is impaired in RnaseH, Mph1 and Sen1 mutants. Intriguingly, we find that R-loop formation inhibits gene transcription, but this inhibition is reversed by replisome passage, demonstrating the dynamic crosstalk between replication, transcription and R-loops in a single cell cycle. Unexpectedly, we find that R-loops also have beneficial roles in reducing the density of RNAPII molecules on the gene, thereby preventing fork stalling upon high RNAPII occupancy. These findings illuminate that regulating R-loops and RNAPII density together is critical for preventing harmful TRCs.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

R.; S, A.; Roy, S.", "abstract": "Flagella-driven motility is a conserved feature across eukaryotic lineages, from unicellular plankton to mammals. In marine dinoflagellates, such as Lingulodinium polyedra, motility underlies diel vertical migration (DVM), a key adaptive strategy that enables access to spatiotemporally segregated resources in the water column. To investigate how pH influences motility, we used L. polyedra and two other dinoflagellates as a model and used a multi-particle tracking algorithm to monitor and quantitatively analyze cellular motility. Under normal pH conditions, L. polyedra displays linear, random motility with variable speeds. Upon CO2-induced acidification, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in motility speed accompanied by a striking behavioral shift: within minutes of pH reduction, over 90% of the cells transitioned to spiral motility. This effect was both reversible and reproducible, including when pH was modified chemically rather than via CO2. The rapid onset of these changes suggests a non-genomic mode of regulation, an area that remains largely unexplored in phytoplankton. We hypothesize that external pH modulates flagellar dynamics in dinoflagellates. Our findings offer new insights into the link between environmental pH and flagellar motility and provide a platform for investigating non-genomic responses to ocean acidification in marine phytoplankton.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

While current treatments such as auto/allografts, provide support, they often fail to promote adequate vascularisation necessary for complete repair. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as mediators of intercellular communication, have emerged as promising acellular nanotechnologies for tissue regeneration due to their bioactive cargo and low immunogenicity. Mechanical stimulation, a known enhancer of bone cell function, can modulate EV cargo and potentially improve regenerative efficacy. In this study, we investigated how mechanical stimulation, and the stage of mesenchymal lineage commitment influence the angiogenic potential of secretomes and EVs derived from mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Our findings reveal that both cell mechanical stimulation and their differentiation stage significantly modulate the angiogenic properties of the resulting EVs. Among the tested conditions, mechanically-stimulated osteocyte-derived EVs demonstrate superior angiogenesis, promoting endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and CD31 expression. These effects were further validated in a pre-clinical ex ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, where robust neovascularisation was observed. This work highlights the critical role of both mechanical cues and cell differentiation stage in regulating the angiogenic capacity of EVs and proposes mechanically activated osteocyte-derived EVs as a novel pro-angiogenic nanotherapeutic for bone repair.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have shown that combining MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with machine learning (ML) algorithms can accelerate AMR determination. However, these efforts have predominantly focused on bacterial pathogens. Given the significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with fungal infections and their evolving antifungal resistance to treatment, there is a need for precision medicine approaches that enable early and accurate detection of antifungal resistance. We developed a machine-learning pipeline that integrates MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data and drug features to predict antifungal resistance and identify spectral biomarkers for antifungal resistance. By leveraging the DRIAMS dataset, we included 658 pathogen spectra linked to 3,046 phenotypic antifungal resistance results. This dataset covered three drug classes and seven yeast species. The model was trained using categorical, phenotypic antifungal susceptibility testing results as ground truth. Our study systematically investigated the influence of various dimensionality reduction methods on MALDI-TOF mass spectra, antifungal encodings, and machine learning models using nested cross-validation to evaluate predictive performance. We identified that applying principal component analysis to MALDI-TOF mass spectra for dimensionality reduction, and training a multi-layer perceptron yielded the highest and most stable performance for the prediction of antifungal resistance. Our method achieved an AUPRC of 0.77 across the 10 highest-performing species-drug pairs and corresponding Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.69. The model demonstrated the best performance for the species-drug combinations of Candida albicans with micafungin, Candida parapsilosis with fluconazole, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with itraconazole and fluconazole.

Plasmer, PlasmidEC, PlaScope, and gplas2 were the highest-scoring plasmid detection tools, performing well for both Enterobacterales and enterococci. The two major determinants of accurate plasmid detection were representation in plasmid databases - with Enterobacterales plasmids being more easily detected than those from enterococci - and assembly contiguity, which was also key for successful plasmid reconstruction.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of repeated applications of five elicitors (i.e., {beta}-aminobutyric acid (BABA), (R)-{beta}-homoserine (RBH), indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3CA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA)) in three strawberry cultivars (Rowena, Soraya, and Durban). BABA and RBH significantly reduced B. cinerea lesion sizes in Rowena and Soraya, while Durban showed no induced resistance to the elicitors. Untargeted metabolomic profiling of Rowena and Soraya revealed cultivar-specific responses to elicitor treatment and infection, with distinct patterns of metabolite accumulation under both mock- and B. cinerea-inoculated conditions.

However, this approach may leave residual gene activity and typically requires sequencing-based validation. In this study, we established an efficient strategy for generating large, targeted deletions across multiple genes using dual-gRNA targeting. We first compared the efficiency of polycistronic tRNA-gRNA arrays to conventional gRNA constructs expressed under individual promoters, using the checkpoint protein gene MAD2 as a target. We found that a polycistronic construct doubled the frequency of large gene deletions compared to a conventional design. We then demonstrated that simultaneous deletion of two or four genes, targeting the katanin and TPX2 gene families, respectively, can be achieved in a single transformation event. The polycistronic system also increased deletion frequencies in the multiplex context, with up to 42% efficiency for individual genes and successful recovery of quadruple mutants. As a drawback, we confirmed that deletion efficiency varied substantially among individual gRNA pairs, indicating that gRNA design remains a critical factor in multiplex editing. This study establishes a versatile and scalable framework for generating multi-gene deletion mutants in P. patens, facilitating functional genomics and biotechnological applications requiring precise gene removal.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of the more adventitious roots1-1 (mars1-1) mutant, which exhibits enhanced regenerative potential upon wounding in tomato hypocotyl explants. Additionally, the mars1-1 fruits exhibited a rough surface due to the ectopic proliferation of subepidermal cells, which formed callus-like structures on the cuticle. The MARS1/ROUGH gene encodes a conserved lysine-specific histone demethylase, SlLSD1, which regulates a variety of processes in metazoans, including cell proliferation, stem cell pluripotency, and embryogenesis. Two CRISPR/Cas9 null alleles, mars1-2 and mars1-3, were generated and their pleiotropic phenotype was characterized. We found elevated levels of H3K4me1 in mars1/rough seedlings, which suggests that SlLSD1 is required for the demethylation of this histone mark. To ascertain the impact of altered epigenetic marks in the mars1/rough mutants on gene expression regulation, we conducted a transcriptome analysis using a variety of RNA-Seq studies on tomato hypocotyls. By employing specific bioinformatic workflows and leveraging on the resolution of directional RNA-Seq data, we have identified over several dozen distinct genomic regions that exhibit de novo expression in the mars1/rough mutants. One such region includes a novel B-type cyclin gene, which is upregulated in the mars1/rough mutants and may account for the observed phenotypes. Our findings indicate that SlLSD1 plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of silencing in specific genomic regions that are essential for tissue-specific reprogramming.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here we address the issue of how the evolving patterns of population activity can be governed by the intrinsically available mechanisms within the brain. We show how the control of the evolving activity can be represented by a high-dimensional vector field, which is an emergent effect of the integrative effects afforded by the membrane capacitance of the neurons and the weights of the synaptic connections between them. For each subnetwork of the brain, its intrinsic connectivity defines the structure of a lower-dimensional vector field with a local attractor point, towards which the subnetwork activity is constantly drawn. We show that other subnetworks, defined by having a degree of independence from but an impact on the first subnetwork, will constantly move the location of the local attractor point, causing the activity in the first subnetwork to constantly \"chase its own tail\". We show how this principle can explain how minor differences in the corticospinal control signal can produce a variety of movement patterns through the spinal interneuron circuitry. At the global level, we show how the cortical neuron population can be thought of as many concatenated subnetworks that produce diverse dynamic evolutions across the cortical neuron population globally. This operational principle can produce a dynamic population activity reminiscent of that observed across the brain in vivo and explain the foundational mechanisms underlying autonomous cortical control of its own activity evolution.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

We revealed three patterns in the BOLD signals: increased activation during inhalation, an undershoot following immediate oxygen withdrawal, and reactivation even without continued oxygen. These responses were most pronounced in the default mode network (DMN), but also exhibited spatiotemporally heterogeneous patterns across the brain, a map we term Brain Oxygen Sensitivity Topography (BOST). Functional connectivity analyses further revealed increased between-network connectivity during inhalation and enhanced within-network connectivity in the DMN during the aftereffect.

By utilizing phasor diagrams to represent the oscillatory activities, we examined the amplitudes and phases of hemodynamic fluctuations within the language network and DMN. Our findings align with existing empirical and theoretical perspectives on DMN functions and cognitive task performance, affirming the validity of our approach. We identified heterogeneous micro resting states interwoven with periods of overt speech production.

Urinary exosomes, containing miRNAs, offer a promising source reflecting systemic and renal states, yet their profile in late gestation pSLE is less studied. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the profile of urinary exosomal miRNAs in pregnant women with SLE during late gestation compared to healthy pregnant controls and to explore their potential biological roles and pathways. Methods: Urinary exosomes were isolated from 6 pSLE patients and 5 controls. Exosomes were characterized, and miRNAs were sequenced. Bioinformatics analyses, including target gene prediction and functional enrichment (GO, KEGG), were performed. Results: Exosomes were successfully isolated. Sequencing identified 29 significantly downregulated miRNAs in pSLE exosomes. Enrichment analysis of these miRNAs and their target genes indicated involvement in metabolic and immune pathways, virus infection, and cellular senescence. Target genes also enriched in protein stability and transport, and high-level analysis showed broader roles in metabolic, immune, and cellular maintenance/stress processes. Targets of top differentially expressed miRNAs linked to mRNA regulation, AMPK, and senescence pathways. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that urinary exosomal miRNAs are significantly altered in pregnant women with SLE during late gestation. The functional enrichment analysis suggests their target genes are involved in critical biological processes relevant to pSLE pathophysiology and pregnancy complications, including metabolism, immunity, viral response, senescence, and cellular maintenance.

Behaviour often plays a pivotal role in determining how well species cope with human-altered environments, but in pollinators, its significance in mitigating the exposure level to pesticides and, consequently, the accumulation of associated sub-lethal effects has received little attention. In this study, I extended the individual-based model implemented in the simulation tool BEE-STEWARD to investigate how previously overlooked behavioural processes, such as preference for mass-flowering crop, inadvertent social information (ISI) use, and a foraging bias induced by the pesticide applied on the crop may affect nectar and pollen visit rates in a common pollinator species, the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), on far and closely located crop patches. All investigated behavioural processes increased foragers' visit rate on crop patches but their impact differed substantially in magnitude and context. As expected, preference for the crop was strongly positively associated with both visit rates. ISI use increased the visit rate during nectar foraging in interaction with preference on the close crop patches, and the modelled pesticide-induced foraging bias substantially enhanced pollen visits on both close and far crop patches. Simulation results indicate that if a pesticide applied to the crop causes a behavioural alteration that reduces foragers' ability to assess the level of patch depletion correctly, an ecological trap may emerge for pollinators in pesticide-treated agricultural landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

The results of the study show that: (1) the overall pastoral production efficiency of herding households in Inner Mongolia is low, with a mean value of 0.43, which is mainly caused by low pure technical efficiency.

Dispersal is favoured in highly heterogenous and ephemeral environments where it can increase fitness. However, whilst we generally assume that unfavourable local conditions cue dispersal to elsewhere, little is known about how heterogeneity in local conditions influences dispersal expression. This is an important element of dispersal, since dispersal characteristics rely on such local cues to signal their development. 2. We assessed the role of local environmental heterogeneity on the expression of a plastic dispersal phenotype in experimental populations of the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini through a multigenerational, 18-week experiment. Populations were kept under either heterogenous, homogenous, or intermediate food distribution treatments, and at low or high population density, via culling. This allowed us to test for the effect of local environmental heterogeneity and competition on dispersal expression, but also on population size and growth. 3. We found that heterogenous environments induce greater expression of dispersal in high density environments, but not in low-density ones. Additionally, whilst culled treatments have on average larger population sizes than non-culled treatments, non-culled and heterogenous environments have similar sizes to culled treatments. Treatments did not impact population growth rate. 4. Our findings that heterogenous treatments only induce greater dispersal expression under non-culled treatments suggests that heterogeneity may exacerbate competition around feeding patches, causing infrequent access to food. We also infer that culled populations become larger than non-culled, at least in the short term, due to rapid compensatory growth causing an overrepresentation of juveniles in the population. It is unclear why unculled heterogenous environments exhibit a similarly large population size to culled environment but could be due to food being hard to access but easy to locate. 5. Overall, we find an ecologically significant impact of local heterogeneity on population size and dispersal expression, much of which may arise due to the influences of heterogeneity on competition around foraging spaces. Such findings highlight the need to distinguish between local and regional heterogeneity when modelling the evolution of dispersal, since these two alternate levels may perform significantly different roles in influencing the expression or adaptive value of dispersal.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

It offers numerous benefits, including a low glycemic index, prebiotic properties, and the ability to lower blood sugar levels. Currently, tagatose is primarily produced industrially through the isomerization of galactose, utilizing both chemical and enzymatic catalysis. While these established processes can produce tagatose, they are inefficient and expensive. Recent works have demonstrated alternative biosynthetic routes to produce D-tagatose but suffer from low theoretical yield and/or reliance on expensive feedstocks. This study demonstrates a novel biochemical pathway to produce D-tagatose directly from glucose using a whole-cell process with Escherichia coli. This process is distinct from other biosynthetic schemes and utilizes a newly discovered galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase to drive the native Leloir pathway in reverse and synthesize the substrate D-galactose directly from D-glucose. Our analysis of the phosphatase reveals how an ensemble of intermolecular hydrogen bonds governs substrate specificity. By co-expressing this phosphatase and an L-arabinose isomerase in a modified strain background, we demonstrate production of tagatose directly from glucose. In initial studies, we generated ~10.5 g/L galactose from 30 g/L glucose (35 % yield) while also producing > 1 g/L tagatose. This demonstrates the feasibility of a novel approach to tagatose production in vivo with a theoretical pathway yield of 94.6 %, which is substantially higher than previously proposed tagatose biosynthetic schemes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

HCN channels are uniquely activated by hyperpolarization, rather than depolarization, a critical mechanism for controlling the involuntary pacemaker activity of the heart. In contrast, hERG channels are depolarization-activated and mediate K currents essential for action potential repolarization. Notably, certain hERG mutations, including those associated with long-QT syndrome, can induce biphasic activation by both hyperpolarization and depolarization. Despite the diverse voltage-dependent gating behaviors observed in CNBD channels, a unified mechanistic framework remains lacking. Here, we propose an allosteric model for their electromechanical coupling, featuring a single voltage-sensor transition coupled to two distinct conformational coupling modes between voltage-sensing and pore domains. With only three or four free parameters, this model recapitulates the biphasic U-shaped and bell-shaped conductance-voltage relationships commonly seen in CNBD channels.

Here, we identified a molecular switch in NAC that allows its central barrel domain to adopt a stabilized conformation on ribosomes exposing a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). Mutations of the MTS on the nascent chain or in the NAC switch region increases NAC barrel dynamics and reduces its binding to the ribosome. This leads to an impaired ability of NAC to prevent mistargeting by SRP and causes ER stress in human cells. Our work reveals how NAC detects nascent mitochondrial proteins early in translation and prevents their promiscuous access to SRP, elucidating the structural basis that underlies this role and providing novel insights into protein targeting fidelity with broader implications for cellular proteostasis.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Previously, CYP2C9 was demonstrated to remove sulfur from different organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, such as dimethoate, diazinon and parathion. In this study, we have tested the ability of CYP2C9 to degrade other OP compounds. We investigated the metabolism of OP compounds by CYP2C9 using LC-MS/MS approaches as well as the time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 by OP compounds using the previously developed pFluor50 fluorogenic assay. We found that CYP2C9 metabolizes thions (P=S) preferentially over oxons (P=O) and there were many OP compounds that inhibited CYP2C9 activity in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, we performed molecular docking based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB)crystal structure (1OG5) of the CYP2C9 receptor in order to gain atomistic insight from the in vitro experimental results. We observed a positive though moderate correlation between the calculated binding energy and the CYP2C9 metabolism of various OP compounds (R = 0.61) as well as the time-dependent changes in inhibition of OPs with binding energy (R = 0.59). Although the R values were modest,59). These in vitro data combined with analysis of additional OP derivatives could be used to develop artificial intelligence (AI)machine learning models to predict the metabolism of specific OP compounds by CYP2C9.

Y.", "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) integrate a diverse array of inputs to achieve the exquisite control of gene expression necessary for life. In plants, this is exemplified by the deeply conserved CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) family of TFs. HD-ZIPIII activity is controlled by inputs at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. As part of their multidomain architecture, HD-ZIPIII TFs contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, a ubiquitously distributed evolutionary module that binds various types of lipophilic ligands. Here, we show that HD-ZIPIII and HD-ZIPIV proteins contain a cryptic, deeply conserved START domain which we term the disorder-containing START domain (dSTART). The dSTART domain is required for HD-ZIPIII developmental function, controlling their subcellular localization and DNA-binding properties. The dSTART domain also helps discriminate responsive from non-responsive binding sites across the HD-ZIPIII shared genetic network. Finally, we identify candidate ligands of the dSTART domain including several species of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. The identification and functional characterization of a cryptic START domain provides new mechanistic insights into a deeply conserved family of TFs with roles in nearly all aspects of plant development.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present a comprehensive structural, evolutionary, and functional analysis of the lectin gene family in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Heinz). We identified 247 lectin genes across eight major families, exhibiting diverse domain architectures, including merolectins, hololectins, and chimerolectins. Gene ontology enrichment, tissue-specific expression profiling, and stress-responsive transcriptomics highlighted key roles of lectin genes in development and pathogen defense. Comparative genomic analyses across five Solanum species and ancestral outgroups (Vitis vinifera and Amborella trichopoda) revealed both conserved and lineage-specific expansions driven by whole-genome and small-scale duplications. Evolutionary modeling indicated that most lectin gene duplications are under purifying selection, with some genes exhibit signatures of adaptive evolution. Expression and co-expression variance among duplicated paralogues revealed three distinct evolutionary fates - balance, dominance, and divergence. Notably, small-scale duplications frequently led to functional divergence, whereas whole-genome duplicates largely retained ancestral expression patterns. Functional validation through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of two GNA chimerolectins, Solyc04g077390 and Solyc07g063700, revealed their role as negative regulators of immunity. Silencing these genes enhanced resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum, reduced bacterial colonization, and triggered stronger induction of defense-related genes. Together, these findings highlight the structural innovation, evolutionary dynamics, and immune regulatory roles of lectin genes in tomato, and identifies promising targets for breeding disease-resistant cultivars in Solanum lycopersicum and related crops.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Our study aims to identify key morphometric and life-history traits that contribute to extreme longevity of bats and to describe the evolutionary patterns of bat lifespan. Using phylogenetically informed regression with dummy variables and dataset of 108 bat species, we examined the effects of body length, body weight, forearm length, diet, reproduction rate, hibernation, and climatic preference on longevity. Our analysis revealed that lifespan in bats is influenced by their body size (the proxy for which is the forearm length), reproduction rate, some specific diets (hematophagy and omnivory), and climate, while other traits showed no noteworthy effects. Moreover, we fitted several likelihood models for the evolution of forearm length, body length, body mass and lifespan. All these traits best followed an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. As the result, lifespan appeared to be a highly constrained trait with an estimated evolutionary optimum of approximately 13.5 years across Chiroptera. These findings support the idea that longevity may have been present in ancestral bat lineages and is shaped by the combination of ecological and morphological factors.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

This study investigates how substrate stiffness affects EV size and composition in mouse mammary and cardiac fibroblasts, the key stromal cell types in breast cancer and cardiac microenvironments. Importantly, we uncovered stiffness-tuned EV proteomic cargo, providing new insights into how mechanical cues can reprogram the signaling functions of fibroblast-derived vesicles. Our findings show that substrate stiffness significantly alters EV characteristics, with sizes increasing below stiffnesses of 20 kPa and decreasing on stiffer substrates. Mechanotransduction pathways involving p53 and thioredoxin were identified as regulators of these alterations, with thioredoxin dominating the modulation in mammary fibroblasts and p53 in cardiac fibroblasts.

Here, we introduce DeepADR, a multi-modal deep learning framework for predicting both the occurrence and frequency of ADRs using early-stage, readily available data. DeepADR integrates chemical structures and biological target profiles with semantic representations of ADR terms derived from a large language model. These heterogeneous parameters are fused using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which effectively models complex, non-linear cross-modal interactions to capture underlying toxicological mechanisms. Our model outperforms existing methods in predicting both ADR occurrence and frequency, demonstrating robust generalization to new chemical entities. By effectively integrating chemical, biological, and semantic datasets, DeepADR provides a powerful, scalable tool for the early-stage safety assessment and candidate prioritization.

V.", "abstract": "Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a progressive disease characterized by the destabilization of TTR tetramers, leading to monomer dissociation, oligomer formation, and fibril deposition in cardiac tissue. This study presents a mathematical model that captures the kinetics of TTR aggregation and deposition, integrating clinically relevant parameters to distinguish between scenarios of TTR aggregation in blood plasma and cardiac tissue. The governing equations are derived by applying conservation principles to the number of TTR tetramers, monomers, and oligomers within defined control volumes, such as the blood plasma or heart. The model predicts that the scenario with fibril accumulation within cardiac tissue better reflects the clinical progression of wild-type TTR amyloidosis, aligning with observed patient survival times and measured tetramer concentrations. The simulations reproduce known physiological values, including a tetramer concentration of ~4.5 M, consistent with published physiological data. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the rate of tetramer dissociation and the half-deposition time of TTR oligomers are key regulators of disease progression. Lower tetramer dissociation rates, mimicking the stabilizing effect of tafamidis, reduce fibril accumulation and biological aging. Conversely, faster oligomer deposition into fibrils leads to reduced oligomer concentrations but accelerated tissue fibril accumulation. The model predicts that, after five years of disease progression, the fraction of heart volume occupied by TTR fibrils may reach 58% in the tissue aggregation scenario, compared to 10% when aggregation occurs in plasma. These predictions are consistent with clinical observations that link higher amyloid burden to increased mortality. Overall, the findings support a pathogenic mechanism in which TTR aggregation predominantly occurs in cardiac tissue, highlighting potential therapeutic targets to modulate disease progression. A correlation is proposed for estimating biological age in humans, which incorporates both calendar age and the fraction of heart volume occupied by TTR amyloid fibrils.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Then, for first time, we mimicked the relevant drug exposure of mFOLFOX-6, CapOx and FOLFIRI protocols to predict clinical outcomes. Our pharmacokinetic-based testing on primary colorectal cancer cells accurately predicted responders and non-responders among a cohort of patients (N=6). Classical testing methods such as IC50 and GI50 did not reveal any clinically meaningful results. Furthermore, we demonstrated that even subtle changes in drug incubation times could lead to significant variations in the classification of cells as sensitive and resistant, which is not related to mechanisms of action according to categorical clustering. Finally, our pharmacokinetic-based test results were consistent with the historical clinical data on similarities of mFOLFOX-6 and CapOx schemes. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence that pharmacokinetic-based in vitro testing could bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical practice.

This study investigated sex-specific behavioural and morphological changes in a mouse model overexpressing A53T -syn. Male and female C57BL/6J mice received bilateral intranigral injections of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding mutant A53T -syn or empty vectors. Motor function was assessed at 60 and 120 days post-surgery using open field, wire hang, pole, and balance beam tests. Brains were collected for immunohistochemical analyses of -syn pathology, nigrostriatal integrity (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH), axonal degeneration, and neuroinflammation. -Syn overexpression induced early, subtle motor deficits primarily in males, despite preserved SNc neuronal density. Automated analysis of balance beam walking behaviour (DeepLabCut, SimBA) revealed increased immobility and reduced walking time in -syn males. At 120 days only, striatal TH levels were significantly reduced, driven by reductions in -syn males. Although undetected at 60 days, an axonal degeneration index (combining striatal TH optical density and axonal swellings) revealed more advanced degeneration in -syn males, suggesting faster disease progression. At both time points, -syn mice showed increased striatal astrogliosis without sex differences, indicating -syn-associated neuroinflammation. These findings support a PD model of early axonal degeneration and reactive astrogliosis preceding neuronal loss.

To validate this assay, we conducted tube test followed by platform test in cages of male and female mice. We observed stable rank in both sexes using the platform test and saw notable differences in overall cage hierarchy between tube and platform.

Cooperative behavior as measured by shared time on platform was observed across all ranks but predominantly demonstrated by subordinate mice. Corticosterone levels were significantly higher in females but showed no rank-specific differences. Neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex was not rank-dependent, however activity in the habenula scaled with rank in both sexes and was significantly correlated with dominance in males.

Here, we report a new targeted choroidal injury model using bioconjugated saporins and compare it models of systemic sodium iodate administration. Methods: Wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats were given suprachoroidal injections of anti-CD38 or anti-CD105 antibodies conjugated to saporin immunotoxin (10 ul at 0.05 ug/uL) to induce selective choroidal endothelial cell injury. These animals were compared to wild-type rats given sodium iodate (75 mg/kg) via tail vein injections, with a dose escalation study (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg) in immunocompromised (Sprague-Dawley Rag2/Il2g double-knockout) rats. Animals were examined at 1-, 2-, and 3-weeks post-treatment, and the degree of choroidal injury compared using fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Suprachoroidal administration of anti-CD38 or anti-CD105 saporins resulted in severe choroidal vascular injury localized to the injection site, without damage to adjacent choroidal vasculature, progressive injury over time, or development of choroidal neovascularization. By contrast, sodium iodate treated animals had rapid, diffuse choroidal loss which progressed throughout the study time points, with fatal systemic side effects at the highest (75 mg/kg) dose. Conclusions: Suprachoroidal injection of anti-CD38 and anti-CD105 saporins results in targeted, localized, non-progressive choroidal injury in rats.

In doing so, we engineer a biologic that enables precise, tunable control over CD45 surface localization and activity. CD45 sequestration exhibited striking synergy when administered in combination with intratumorally anchored IL-12 therapy, markedly delaying tumor progression and extending survival in syngeneic murine melanoma and carcinoma models. Immune profiling revealed that CD8 T cells are essential mediators of this synergistic antitumor response. Mechanistically, IL-12 initiates a wave of antigen generation and T cell priming, while CD45 sequestration subsequently enhances tumor-specific CD8 T cell activation, expansion, and functional states within the tumor-draining lymph node. These findings suggest that CD45 sequestration lowers the activation threshold of T cells, broadens the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire, and therefore promotes more robust tumor-specific T cell responses.

The success of LNP-based vaccines demonstrated the potential of these nanoparticles for broader therapeutic applications. As interest in LNP-based therapies expands, there is an urgent need for low-cost, reproducible synthesis protocols that can be readily implemented across a wide range of research settings. Traditional methods for LNP synthesis, such as pipette and vortex mixing, can yield inconsistent results. In contrast, microfluidic mixing offers better control over LNP properties but requires expensive equipment. This financial barrier prevents many laboratories from accessing cutting-edge LNP technology, slowing the pace of preclinical research and limiting the exploration of its full therapeutic potential. To address this, we developed a standardized protocol for microfluidic mixing using a syringe pump and a commercially available microfluidic chip. This approach offers a cost-effective and reproducible method for LNP synthesis. The protocol details the synthesis of LNPs, physical characterization via dynamic light scattering, encapsulation efficiency using the RiboGreen assay, and evaluation of in vitro transfection efficiency using the OneGlo assay, confocal microscopy, and a flow cytometer. We explored consistency through various experimental parameters, aiming to optimize the protocol and, importantly, tested user-to-user reproducibility with undergraduates without LNP experience with minimal supervision. We found consistency among assembly conditions, including mRNA/lipid concentration, flow rate, dialysis time, ionizable lipid type, and chip reusability. We tested the broader applicability of the method with four ionizable lipids (DLin-MC3-DMA, LP01, C12-200, and SM-102). High encapsulation efficiency (96-100%) was maintained across tested concentrations, with slightly larger particle sizes at lower doses. Based on the flow cytometry analysis, a 7.5 g dose was chosen for future use to conserve mRNA without sacrificing efficacy. Dialysis duration had minimal impact on encapsulation, but longer times increased particle size and reduced luminescence. The protocol consistently produced narrowly dispersed particles (PDI < 0.2), and equipment was reusable for up to six runs, potentially reducing the per-run cost. Even novice users achieved reproducible results, highlighting the protocol's accessibility and potential to expand LNP research and applications.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

To address this problem, we integrated genome-scale metabolic models with machine learning algorithms, aiming to characterize the metabolic phenotypes associated with the disease. We constructed 90 specific metabolic models from clinical and gene expression data from the TCGA-BRCA project, including 66 tumor and 24 normal samples. Metabolic fluxes were estimated using gene expression-based optimization, minimizing the weighted L2 norm. Subsequently, the Mann-Whitney test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied to identify the most discriminating reactions. We evaluated the performance of five classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. The models effectively differentiated between healthy and cancerous phenotypes, showing good overall performance, although K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines stood out with better performance, achieving accuracy values close to 0.98 and a ROC-AUC of 1.00. Analysis of the differentiable metabolic reactions revealed significant alterations in pathways such as extracellular transport (up to 60 significant reactions), fatty acid oxidation, and nucleotide interconversion. These results highlight the potential of the combined approach of metabolic modeling and machine learning to deepen the understanding of tumor metabolism, although the need for experimental validation and statistical refinement for future studies is emphasized.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Interpreting fractionated RNA-seq data poses a fundamental compositional challenge: library preparation and sequencing depth obscure the original proportions of RNA fractions, which can bias comparisons -- particularly when biological changes shift RNA distribution across fractions. This bias compromises comparisons of fraction-specific RNA profiles and limits the utility of standard differential expression methods. Existing approaches using transcript frequency ratios or standard normalization fail to account for the compositional nature of fractionated samples and cannot estimate the unrecoverable \"lost\" fraction. Results: We developed FracFixR, a statistical framework that reconstructs original fraction proportions by modeling the compositional relationship between whole and fractionated RNA samples. Using non-negative linear regression on carefully selected transcripts, FracFixR estimates global fraction weights, corrects individual transcript frequencies, and quantifies unrecoverable material. The framework includes methods for differential proportion testing between conditions using binomial GLM, logit, or beta-binomial models. We rigorously validated FracFixR using synthetic data with known ground truth and real polysome profiling data from multiple cell lines, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of fraction weights (Pearson correlation $>0.85$) and enabling detection of differentially translated transcripts between cancer subtypes.

Compared to healthy controls, PKLR-mutant erythrocytes exhibit marked reductions in ATP-dependent flickering amplitude and membrane fluidity, consistent with impaired metabolic elasticity. Strikingly, when infected with Plasmodium yoelii, these metabolically rigidified cells retain mechanical properties that appear to hinder parasite-induced membrane remodeling.

Confinement and biomechanical feedback from the extracellular environment are analysed through a neural-network-accelerated finite element solver. Combining the framework with experiments, our model reveals that stress-dependent spheroid growth can arise from a sizing checkpoint for mitosis. Under sufficient extracellular loading, cell growth is restricted by high hydrostatic forces in competition with osmotic pressure from biomolecule synthesis, which prevents cells from surpassing a critical volume.

V.; Kabir, R.; Kohr, M. J.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease is a primary cause of death for men and women in the United States. Recent epidemiologic findings, however, suggest that pre-menopausal women have inherent protection from many cardiovascular pathologies compared to age-matched men, which is lost with menopause. We and others have documented similar protective signaling in animal models, with females exhibiting protection from ischemic injury that is lost with ovariectomy (OVX). Furthermore, in recent studies, we demonstrated that the loss of alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) blocked sex-specific cardioprotection in females, but activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) provided a rescue. ADH5 and ALDH2 both metabolize formaldehyde to formate, potentially implicating formate in female-specific cardioprotection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine a role for formate during ischemic injury in female hearts using wild-type (WT) and ADH5-/- mice. We also aimed to explore estrogen-dependent effects by using ovariectomized (OVX) WT mice. To assess the protective effects of formate in intact female WT and ADH5-/- hearts, as well as OVX WT hearts, hearts were Langendorff-perfused and subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Since formate is used in one-carbon metabolism (OCM), select OCM enzymes were also probed via western blot. Importantly, we found that formate significantly reduced infarct size in female ADH5-/- hearts subjected to I/R injury, but formate was without effect in intact female WT hearts. Additionally, formate failed to reduce I/R injury in OVX WT hearts, despite OVX WT hearts exhibiting reduced ADH5 and ALDH2 activity. However, we noted that the expression of certain OCM enzymes was downregulated in OVX WT hearts vs. intact WT females, which may prevent proper formate utilization by OCM in OVX WT hearts. Furthermore, blockage of formate import into OCM in intact female WT hearts also exacerbated I/R injury. Taken together, our findings support formate utilization by OCM as a key component of cardioprotective signaling in female hearts, with estrogen acting as a potential mediator.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Core defense modules were broadly shared across cell clusters, but their activation varied in timing and intensity, with key immune receptors also showing cell type-specific expression dynamics. We identified distinct mesophyll cell populations based on their resilience patterns: after the initial response, some cells continue to express defense genes at high levels during both PTI and ETI, while others quickly reinitiate growth-related gene expression programs, but only during PTI. Gene regulatory network inference revealed WRKY-regulated modules enriched in cells sensing effectors, while SA biosynthesis regulators were activated in complementary clusters. Finally, we used the cue1-6 mutant to demonstrate that core immune responses are robust despite altered leaf architecture. In addition, we uncovered cryptic defense pathways, including sucrose-responsive modules, in this mutant.

When two unrelated stimuli frequently occur in close temporal succession, they may become associated. This process might be stronger in older adults due to age-related decline in inhibitory control, leading to deeper processing of irrelevant context. Automatic associations and their violations can be studied using visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an event-related potential component reflecting the detection of violations of regularity in unattended stimuli. In our study, younger (n=18, M=21.2 {+/-} 2.1 yrs) and older (n=17, M=69.8 {+/-} 2.8 yrs) adults viewed pairs of images presented in succession: a scene (forest or street) followed by an emotional face (happy or angry). One scene-emotional face combination occurred frequently, the other rarely, forming a contextual oddball sequence. All individual stimuli appeared equally often. Participants performed an unrelated colour-change detection task, ensuring that the scene-emotional face pairs were unattended. We expected a vMMN to the emotional face in rare pairings, especially in older adults if they formed stronger associations. A control oddball condition with only emotional faces verified automatic emotion discrimination. In the control condition, vMMN emerged for both deviant emotions (in various ranges within the 94-276 ms post-stimulus time window). However, no vMMN was observed in the scene-emotional face condition. Instead, younger adults showed an early posterior positivity (90-161 ms) to rare pairings, while older adults exhibited a later negativity (356-384 ms). These results suggest that task-irrelevant, thematically unrelated visual events can become associated through temporal proximity. However, violations of these associations evoke neural responses distinct from vMMN and vary across age groups.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

We inoculated mice with the mouse adapted A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 influenza A virus, serotype H1N1 (LD50, 2x10^3 plaque forming units), leading to pneumonitis.

We then probed for long-term effects of H1N1 pneumonitis on brain health by monitoring surviving mice for six weeks post-inoculation. Intriguingly, at this time point, when mice had recovered and showed no detectable viral proteins in the brain, levels of H2O2 and protein nitrotyrosination were significantly elevated in H1N1 survivors vs. mock-treated littermates. In addition, total -synuclein concentrations were increased in an infection-dependent manner but independent of the Lrrk2 genotype.

The increased ratio of phosphorylated-to-total tau in Lrrk2 p.G2019S animals adds to the growing evidence of interactions between specific microbial pathogens and allelic variants at the Lrrk2 locus.

Extending this paradigm to a bilateral application would enable its use to study the sensory integration of concomitant nociceptive stimuli and cognitive modulations during e.g. spatial attention tasks. This study demonstrates that bilaterally applied slow sustained periodic sinusoidal thermonociceptive stimuli using two different frequencies of stimulation (i.e. f1, f2, one on each forearm) can indeed be differentiated at the neural level by eliciting two distinct periodic responses at the respective frequency of stimulation and their harmonics.

This kind of correlation has been hypothesized to reflect a causal influence of sensory signals on decisions, a feedback influence of decisions on sensory signals, and various other factors as well. To disentangle these different possibilities, we have examined local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the middle temporal (MT) area of non-human primates performing a motion discrimination task. Compared to single-neuron spiking, LFPs have the advantage of being decomposable into different frequencies that are associated with different anatomical sources of input. More importantly, they persist when spiking activity is inactivated, which precludes a causal influence of the corresponding neural activity on behavior. We found that high frequency (70-150 Hz) LFP power was correlated with perceptual decisions and that this correlation disappeared when spikes were inactivated, consistent with a causal role for this frequency band in decision making. These signals overlapped in time with decision signals in lower gamma-band power (30-50 Hz), which persisted after spiking inactivation, suggesting a non-causal, feedback input. Interestingly, lower-frequency LFP signals (5-30 Hz) reflected both impending perceptual decisions and the outcome of previous trials. Our results therefore reveal that neural activity multiplexes different sources of information about perceptual decisions and that these types of information can be estimated reliably from different LFP frequencies.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Methods: Status epilepticus was induced in adult male Wistar rats with pilocarpine. Animals were divided into control, 1-day post-SE and 7-day post-SE groups (n = 5, 3 and 3). Hippocampi were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies against IL-1beta, IL-10, NeuN (mature neurons), and PCP4 (CA2 marker). Microglial activation states (M1/M2) were inferred from cytokine profiles: sustained IL-1beta expression indicated a pro-inflammatory milieu (M1), whereas declining IL-1beta in the presence of IL-10 suggested an anti-inflammatory or reparative state (M2). Results: The CA2 region exhibited IL-1beta immunoreactivity at 1 day post-SE, which decreased by day 7, while CA3 maintained elevated IL-1beta levels. Anti-IL-10 immunostaining was prominent across hippocampal subregions in the control group and 1-day SE group but was absent by day 7 in all regions. NeuN staining revealed limited neuronal death in CA2 at 1 day post-SE, with substantial loss across CA1, CA3, and CA4 by day 7. Significance: The CA2 subfield appears relatively protected from sustained inflammation and neuronal loss, likely owing to unique microglial responses and structural features such as perineuronal nets.

Eighteen healthy adults (4 females; 27.4 {+/-} 5.6 years) performed triangular isometric contractions at two time-points: early morning (7:00 - 8:30 a.m.) and late afternoon (5:00 - 7:30 p.m.).

High-density surface electromyography signals were recorded from the tibialis anterior and decomposed into motor unit spike trains. The prolongation effect of PICs, estimated via {Delta}F, was significantly greater in the late afternoon in both the relative and absolute force conditions. The amplification effect of PICs, estimated by the acceleration phase of the discharge trajectory, was also higher in the late afternoon, but only in the relative force condition. No time-of-day differences were found for brace height, while attenuation was reduced in the late afternoon in the relative force condition.

After each reward, brief hippocampal \"ripple\" events signalled which indirect experience was most valuable, thereby encoding that path's priority. Longer ripples carried the strongest priority signals, allowing the brain to update high value, unvisited options first and thereby optimise learning. Ripple events also coincided with selective cortical reactivation of these high-priority paths, consistent with prioritised replay.

These studies characterized regions as functionally homogeneous entities (e.g. V1 for extracting low-level visual features) or single neurons in a region as heterogeneously tuned (e.g. mixed selectivity). Here, we leverage the unprecedentedly dense IBL electrophysiological recordings in mouse brains during a sensorimotor decision-making task and computationally combine these to generate a global event-aligned high temporal precision cellular-resolution functional map. We find that individual neurons specialize in simple functions, and ordering neurons by functional similarity reveals at cellular and millisecond resolution the temporal arc of computations unfurling over the phases of a trial and across the brain, providing a way to interpret neural variance beyond sensory and motor responses. Functionally similar cells are highly dispersed across regions, and each region contains cells of nearly all response types. Functional tuning is barely predictable by cytoarchitectural boundaries or spatial coordinates, or vice versa. The primary regional distinction is between cortical and subcortical processing, with subcortical neurons carrying most of the internal computations of expert animals, from integration to decision making and movement initiation. At most, the brain exhibits regional structure in a distributional sense: the flatness of an area's distribution of different functional cell types is lowest in cortical regions, but there is no clear correlation between distributional specialization and anatomical measures of cortical hierarchy. Finally, the high temporal resolution of electrophysiological recordings and the inclusion of subcortical areas reveal the existence of a novel set of robust collective and distributed processing networks in the brain, which rapidly emerge and dissolve across phases of a trial. These results point toward the idea of spatially wide-ranging dynamical processing - winding through most brain regions and involving a subset of neurons in each - to carry out basic functions, and contrast with the idea that brain areas are functionally specialized units.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Currently, it is not clear whether any animal reaches an age comparable to a human in their 80s. Most species seem to age differently compared with humans. Some preliminary observations suggest that cats may share common patterns of aging with humans. Cats could serve as a promising model for human aging. Here, we find corresponding ages between cats, humans and other species to test whether cats can live to the equivalent of a human in their 80s. We analyzed 3,754 observations across species from sudden and gradual changes in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Some of these data are from clinical records, whereas others are from brain scans using high-resolution MRI (7T and 3T). We studied pet cats, research colony cats, and wildcats living in zoos to encapsulate species variation in the speed of development and aging. We found that cat and human brains atrophy with age, and that their age-related patterns in brain aging are sufficiently similar that we could use them to generate cross-species age alignments. We also found that human postnatal development is stretched compared with cats and mice. Interestingly, some pet cats that visit clinics are much older than those in colonies. Therefore, cats, and especially pet cats, are natural model systems of human aging. Our findings call for increased integration across veterinary and human medicine to understand aging.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In two experiments - where participants performed a visual search task in which the target was accompanied by either consistently repeated or randomly varying distractors - we attempted to replicate Chun and Jiang's (1999) study. In Experiment 1 (N = 25, M = 20.8 years), although participants became faster and more accurate over time, no significant difference emerged between repeated and new configurations. Thus, using the same experimental design, we were unable to replicate the object contextual cueing effect. In Experiment 2, we tested whether search strategy influences the effect by instructing one group to adopt an active search strategy and another to use a passive one (N = 20 per group, M = 21.8 and 21.7 years, respectively; active: actively search for the target, passive: let the unique item pop out). However, the manipulation had no effect: the contextual cueing effect did not emerge in either group. Importantly, within each group we observed substantial individual differences - some participants showed a facilitation effect, others no effect, and some even showed a reverse pattern. These findings suggest that object contextual cueing may not be a robust or universal phenomenon and may instead depend on individual cognitive styles or learning tendencies.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Welch's t-tests were used to test the hypothesis that mice undergoing MRI with prolonged anesthesia had greater levels of myelin decompaction than mice that did not experience prolonged anesthesia. Mice with prolonged anesthetic exposure during MRI had significantly higher proportions of decompacted axons than mice that did not experience prolonged anesthesia (p-value of 0.00003642).

The last part briefly describes methods for data processing. The above procedure can be used to visualize dorsal cortex via wide-field optical imaging as well as laser-speckle contrast imaging methods. The distinguishing features of our protocol are: a wide cranial window (up to 60% of the entire cortex), scull thinning (without craniotomy), ultraviolet-curable transparent coating (gel polish), measurements in awake behaving mice. During the surgery the helicopter-like headplate with its lower surface congruent to scull surface is mounted on mouse head. This headplate is lightweight and enable to fix head securely during movement to avoid frames alignment during data processing. Cranial window remains sufficiently transparent for at least 3 months. Wide-field optical imaging method enables to record brain haemodynamics and energy metabolism (FAD concentration dynamics) in wild-type mice. Use of transgenic animals expressing genetically-encoded sensors enable measurements of ions concentration (e.g. Ca2+-dynamics) and other compounds (e.g. glutamate).

The efficacy of this strategy in Rio de Janeiro remains uncertain, primarily due to the difficulty in sustaining high wMel prevalence in regions previously subjected to large-scale releases. A key contributing factor was the routine rotation of insecticides within the framework of Integrated Vector Management (IVM), which led to the use of the larvicide Spinosad for Aedes control in urban areas. This compound was associated with a precipitous decline in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, regardless the wMel infection status. While wMel-uninfected population recovered within weeks, wMel-infected population remained at low levels likely due to the fitness costs imposed by wMel on egg viability. To assess the long-term persistence of wMel following this demographic collapse, we conducted mosquito sampling across 12 neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro, 30 months after mosquito populations crashed. Our findings reveal that wMel introgression remains suboptimal, with a mean frequency of 9.87% across the sampled areas. Only two neighborhoods exhibited wMel frequencies exceeding 15%, likely reflecting ongoing localized releases. The reduced prevalence underscores the challenges of achieving self-sustaining wMel establishment in complex urban environments and highlight critical considerations for the implementation of Wolbachia-based dengue control programs in endemic regions.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, genotoxicity and immunogenicity concerns have hindered clinical translation. Due to the complex etiology associated with DMD, the post-transduction consequences of double-stranded breaks induced by AAV-CRISPR in disease models are unclear. This barrier is partially conferred by conventional sequencing methods where common outcomes of AAV-CRISPR editing often escape detection. However, recent reports of novel long-read sequencing approaches permit comprehensive variant detection using a broader sequence context. Here, we comprehensively investigated genomic and transcriptomic post-AAV-CRISPR transduction consequences in myoblast cells and a DMD mouse model following intramuscular and intravenous AAV-CRISPR therapy using both long- and short-read sequencing techniques. Structural variant characterization indicates that unintended on-target large insertions and inversions are common editing outcomes. We demonstrate that combining adaptive sampling with nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing (AS-nCATS) for long-read quantification of AAV integration is synergistic for detecting difficult-to-amplify editing events. This unbiased data suggests that full-length AAV integration is equally as probable as the on-target deletion. Further, we develop a Nanopore Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (nRACE-seq) pipeline for long-read detection of unknown 5' or 3' ends of edited transcripts. The nRACE-seq approach effectively detects the presence of AAV-Dmd chimeric transcripts, erroneous splicing events, and off-target AAV integration sites. In summary, our findings offer insights into the adaptation of AAV-CRISPR DSB-mediated therapeutics for monogenic diseases and promote the standardization of CRISPR evaluation.

We discovered that MYC-driven liver cancers catabolize alanine in a GPT2-dependent manner to sustain their growth. GPT2 is the predominant alanine-catabolizing enzyme expressed in MYC-driven liver tumors and genetic ablation of GPT2 limited MYC-driven liver tumorigenesis. In vivo isotope tracing studies uncovered a role for alanine as a substrate for a repertoire of pathways including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, nucleotide production, and amino acid synthesis. Treating transgenic MYC-driven liver tumor mouse models with L-Cycloserine, a compound that inhibits GPT2, was sufficient to diminish the frequency of mouse tumor formation and attenuate growth of established human liver tumors.

Notably, HRD and PARPi response can occur without BRCA mutations, suggesting other factors are involved. Loss of CCDC6 function can lead to HRD and PARPi sensitivity in HGSOC cells, making CCDC6 a potential therapeutic target and biomarker. Three CCDC6 missense mutations in HGSOC prompted investigation into their impact on HRD. Analyzing CCDC6 expression, localization and HRD data in the MITO16A trial aims to clarify the CCDC6-HRD relationship in a large cohort. Experimental Design: The biochemical and morphological effects of CCDC6 mutants on the native protein were examined using pull-down assays and immunofluorescence. HR-reporter and cell viability assays determined the impact of these mutants on HRD and PARPi sensitivity. CCDC6 histochemical score and intracellular-localization were assessed in MITO16A samples after immunostaining and digitalization. Results: CCDC6-mutated isoforms act as dominant-negative, preventing native CCDC6 nuclear translocation, disrupting RAD51 foci and HR-repair, and increasing PARPi sensitivity. In the MITO16A patient sample set, 66 of 185 (35%) showed barely detectable CCDC6 or nuclear exclusion (\"CCDC6-inactive\").

Conclusion: The association between CCDC6 inactivity and HRD, both at genomic and functional level, occurred even in presence of wild-type BRCA1/BRCA2 genes, suggesting that CCDC6 may play a crucial role in DNA repair pathways independent of these well-known genes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, the utility of these devices in many subjects is limited, largely due to lack of information about how neural circuits respond to implant stimulation. Recently we showed that deafened rats can use cochlear implants to recognize sounds, and that this training refined the responses of single neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Here we asked how local populations of cortical neurons represent acute implant stimuli, using electrode arrays we developed for cortical surface recordings for micro-electrocorticography ({micro}ECoG), a form of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). We found that there was a limited tonotopic organization across recording sites, relative to a clearer tonotopic spatial representation in normal-hearing rats. Single-trial iEEG responses to acoustic inputs were more reliable than responses to cochlear implant stimulation, although stimulus identity could be successfully decoded in both cases. However, the spatio-temporal response profiles to acoustic vs cochlear implant stimulation were substantially different. Decoders trained on acoustic responses showed essentially zero information transfer when tested on electrical stimulation responses in the same animals after deafening and cochlear implant stimulation. Thus while acute cochlear implant stimulation might activate the auditory cortex in a cochleotopic manner, the dynamics of network activity are quite distinct, suggesting that pitch percepts from acoustic and electrical stimulation are fundamentally different.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

ITs are dynamically regulated by behavioral context and cognitive demands, making them suitable for mapping high-level cognitive phenomena onto the underlying neural computations. In particular, IT measurements derived from single-unit activity (SUA) offer fine-grained resolution, critical for mechanistically linking individual neuron dynamics to cognition. However, current methods for estimating ITs from SUA suffer significant biases and instabilities, particularly when applied to sparse, noisy, or epoched neural spike data. Here, we introduce the intrinsic Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (iSTTC), a novel metric specifically developed to address these limitations. Leveraging synthetic and experimental single-unit recordings, we systematically assessed the performance of iSTTC relative to traditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate that iSTTC provides more accurate estimates of neural timescales across a wide range of conditions, reducing estimation error especially under challenging yet biologically relevant conditions. Crucially, iSTTC can be applied to both continuous and epoched data, overcoming a critical limitation of existing methods. Furthermore, iSTTC substantially relaxes inclusion criteria, increasing the fraction of neurons suitable for analysis and thereby improving the representativeness and robustness of IT measurements. The methodological advances introduced by iSTTC represent a substantial step forward in accurately capturing neural circuit dynamics, ultimately enhancing our ability to link neural mechanisms to cognitive phenomena.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Critically, we applied representational similarity analysis using a multimodal deep neural network (DNN) model comprising text and image encoders to dissociate language-structured and visual-structured knowledge representations. Comparisons between visualizers and aphantasics allowed us to test the relevance of voluntary imagery experience to these representations. We found that while ventral occipitotemporal regions contained shared representations across visual presence and absence, anatomically distinct regions supported different representational structures with differential associations to imagery experience: 1) the left ventral lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) encoded visual-structured knowledge representations and was linked to imagery experience; 2) the bilateral fusiform gyrus, left dorsal LOTC, and right ventral LOTC encoded language-structured knowledge representations, irrelevant to imagery experience; 3) the left superior parietal lobule encoded priorless knowledge-absent visual maintenance representation, also irrelevant to imagery experience.

Although experiments have shown how these patterns can vary across individual neurons and can change under pharmacological manipulations, the field has lacked a computational framework in which to explore the contributions of particular currents to these observations and to generate new predictions about the effects of manipulations on CWCs. In this work, we address this deficiency by presenting a conductance-based CWC computational model. This model captures the diversity of CWC activity patterns observed experimentally and suggests parameter changes that may underlie differences across cells. Bifurcation analysis of this model provides an explanation of how distinct dynamic mechanisms contribute to these differences, while direct simulations suggest how cells with different baseline dynamics will respond to variations in certain experimentally-accessible potassium and calcium channel conductances. In addition to the full model that we introduce, we present a reduced model that preserves CWC dynamic regimes. We classify the reduced model variables in terms of distinct dynamic timescales and show that the key transitions in dynamic patterns can be explained based on equilibria of the averaged dynamics of the slowest model variables, in a regime where the faster model variables exhibit oscillations. Overall, this study predicts how changes in parameters will influence CWC behavior, suggests how bifurcations contribute to changes in CWC dynamics, and provides a theoretical foundation that supports our simulation findings.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

This poses a key challenge when attempting to generalise our experience from one situation to another. How do we distinguish the aspects that transfer across situations from those that do not? One hypothesis is that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) meets this challenge by forming factorised representations that allow for increased neural similarity between events that share generalisable features. We tested this hypothesis in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Forty people were trained to report behavioural sequences based on an underlying graph structure. People then made decisions in a new environment where some, but not all graph transitions from the previous structure could be generalised. Behavioural results showed that participants distinguished the generalisable transition information. Accuracy was significantly higher in blocks in which sequence transitions were shared across environments, than those in which transitions differed. This boost in accuracy was especially pronounced during early exposure to the novel environment. Throughout this early phase, neural patterns in the entorhinal cortex (EC) showed a corresponding differentiation of the generalisable aspects. Neural patterns representing starting locations in familiar and novel environments were significantly more similar in the EC on trials where sequences could be generalised from prior experience, compared to trials with new sequential transitions. This signalling was associated with improved performance when prior sequence knowledge could be reused. Our results suggest that during early exposure to novel environments, the EC may signal dimensions of past experience that can be generalised.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Synaptic transmission between specific connection motifs undergoes plastic changes during learning process, however, exact mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity are still under intense investigation. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a widely used cellular model of synaptic plasticity occurring during learning. Here, we focused on studying LTP at excitatory synapses on layer (L) 2/3 vasoactive intestine polypeptide-expressing interneurons (VIP-INs) in the mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Methods: Acute brain slices were prepared from transgenic mice with fluorescently labeled VIP-INs. LTP was induced by a pairing protocol of postsynaptic depolarization with extracellular stimulation. Results: The pairing protocol evoked LTP in L2/3 VIP-INs in control condition, however, pharmacological blocking GABAaR inhibition enhanced LTP. Looking for mechanisms of LTP induction, we found that LTP at excitatory connections to VIP-INs is dependent on metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR-1) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type VGCC) but not on NMDARs nor mGluR-5. Next, we showed that mGluR-1 acts through G-coupled signaling, Src-family pathway, independently of transient receptor potential channels (TRPC). Analyses of paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and coefficient of variation (CV) indicated a presynaptic locus of LTP expression. Presynaptic expression of LTP in VIP-INs relies on retrograde signaling through endocannabinoids (eCBs) but not on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Conclusions: We dissected mechanisms of LTP induction and expression at excitatory inputs to L2/3 VIP-INs in the mouse barrel cortex. LTP at excitatory synapses on VIP-INs might serve as a positive feedback for enhanced VIP-IN-mediated inhibition of SST-INs, leading to disinhibition of excitatory neurons from SST-IN inhibition during learning process.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

New approaches are required to translate these results into compelling clinical metrics and meet the global challenge of preserving brain health in ageing. Changes in neuronal dynamics with ageing are observable in the power spectra of EEG and MEG recordings. Highly promising candidates for electrophysiological markers have been identified, but progress is hindered by substantial methodological variability across studies. This makes it challenging to establish a clear consensus on the frequency, location, and direction of any single reported effect within the larger body of research. We estimate a full-frequency whole-head profile of the ageing effect on eyes-closed resting-state MEG using the GLM-Spectrum. This data representation is easily sharable, facilitates meta-analyses and provides a framework for estimating statistical power of age effects for future study planning. We use this to show that the effect of age replicates across open-access MEG datasets and is robust to modelling of common covariates. Distinct components within the full frequency profile have different effect sizes, indicating that sample-size planning for ageing effects must consider the specific features of interest. The frequency profile of ageing is strongly robust to a range of common covariates and partially robust to modelling of grey matter volume. We establish that what seems a well-powered study may become underpowered when analyses target an age effect that is linearly separable from an age-relevant covariate such as grey matter volume. These results provide a pathway towards formal comparison and assessment of candidate markers for brain health in ageing.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here we explored whether integrating sensorimotor signals while interacting with a partner can lead to shared sensorimotor representations, and possibly to a recalibration of individual's multisensory perception. In detail, we investigated whether engaging individuals in dyadic activities that utilized either single (e.g., visual or tactile/proprioceptive) or combined (e.g., visuo-tactile/proprioceptive) sensory modalities would impact the behavioral and electrocortical markers associated with interpersonal cross-modal integration. We show that interactions requiring the integration of multiple sensory modalities lead to higher interpersonal differentiation resulting in reduced interpersonal cross-modal integration in a subsequent spatial detection task and alter its distributed neural representations. Specifically, the neural patterns elicited by interpersonal visuo-tactile stimuli vary based on the sensory nature of the previous interpersonal interaction, with the one involving multiple sensory modalities resulting in improved performance of a neural classifier. These findings suggest new avenues for sensorimotor approaches in social neuroscience, emphasizing the malleability of self-other representations based on the nature of interpersonal interactions.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

While neuroimaging studies have highlighted its relevance to frontal-parietal networks, it is unclear how attention affects movement-related activity from the sensorimotor regions of the brain during a motor task. In this study, participants pursued a moving target with a computer mouse, and the level of attention was manipulated via two conditions in which the target moved in either a predictable or unpredictable fashion. We compared event-related desynchronization (ERD) between rest and movement as well as coherence during movement between the predictable and unpredictable trials. We found that alpha- and beta-band ERDs in the contralateral central areas did not change significantly between the two conditions. However, unpredictable trials had larger alpha-band suppression in the frontal and parietal areas, larger beta-band suppression in the ipsilateral parietal area, and larger alpha-band functional connectivity across the central areas. Our study highlights that performing limb movements with higher levels of attention was associated with stronger cortical communication in the sensorimotor areas, rather than strengthening neural activity in these areas. However, higher levels of attention were associated with stronger activation in the frontal and parietal areas which reflects engagement in attention-related networks. This increased activation of attentional networks and stronger sensorimotor communication may facilitate the formation of neural connections that occur in motor skill training and recovery.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined how choosing what to observe can bias the inference about others' intentions. Participants played a game where they pursued a fleeing target while a computerized opponent acted competitively or cooperatively. Participants overestimated the opponent's competitiveness after the opponent acted more competitively than expected, whereas no such bias occurred when the opponent was more cooperative than expected. This asymmetry depended on the sequence of events, resembling hysteresis, a form of path dependence observed in physical systems. We found that these biases became stronger when participants chose to observe the opponent instead of their own avatar, and this choice came at the cost of losing precise control over their avatar. Our findings highlight the trade-off in selecting what to observe, as the resulting inference biases propagate differently depending on the interaction history.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Individual differences in how visual and proprioceptive cues are weighted have been related to neural substrates, such as posterior parietal regions, yet the underlying neural dynamics are unclear. This study investigated the relationship between visuo-proprioceptive perception during a bimanual pointing task and the whole-brain network dynamics using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) with both atlas-based and individually-localized ROI seeds. Our results confirm the existence of individual sensory biases, and find they have systematic influences on functional connectivity. Activity between sensorimotor regions and default mode network (DMN) nodes was related to sensory weighting (e.g. individual degree of reliance on vision versus proprioception) and may reflect updating of internal models. The ventral premotor cortex (PMv) emerged as an important node with functional connections suggesting its role for integrating motor plans, internal models, and sensory percepts. Connections from multisensory integration regions like the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the superior parietal lobule (SPL), and motor coordination regions in the cerebellum, were related to increased reliance on visual versus proprioceptive information. These findings suggest that individual sensory biases during sensorimotor behavior may be characterized by specific and specialized patterns of neural activity. This research establishes a foundational exploration of the neural systems underlying sensorimotor processing, supporting theories suggesting that learning in either the sensory or motor system may also cause plasticity in the other.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Using behavioural measures of looking time and physiological measures of pupillometry, we found that the ability to detect cardiac-exteroceptive synchrony emerges during the first year of life. Critically, this was evident only when stimuli coincided with systole, the baroreceptor-active phase of the cardiac cycle, supporting central multimodal integration interpretable within a predictive coding framework.

Traditional spindle detection methods rely on manually set amplitude and duration thresholds, but this approach can be vulnerable to false detections and could miss low-amplitude spindles due to the inflexible nature of the thresholding technique. The Better OSCillation (BOSC) detection method offers a more robust alternative by applying frequency-specific power thresholds calibrated to the signal itself and requiring a minimum number of oscillation cycles. In this study, we compared traditional and BOSC methods for spindle detection in a variety of ways. First, we created two synthetic datasets: one with synthetic spindles modelled on previous data and one with single wave pulses that had a period consistent with the spindle frequency band. These datasets were used to demonstrate each method's performance when given events that should be detected (synthetic spindles) and those that should not (single wave pulses). Second, we analyzed cortical local field potentials from recordings of rats during natural sleep using both methods to determine their relative effectiveness given biological LFP data. BOSC consistently outperformed the traditional approach in all situations, identifying more valid spindles while minimizing false (or likely false) detections. These findings validate BOSC as a superior method of spindle detection due to its better calibration to the actual signal.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

MANF plays an important role in mitigating neurodegenerative processes. Aging, the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), is associated with significant alterations in ER function. The ER, central to protein synthesis, folding, degradation and secretion (proteostasis), experiences considerable stress in NDDs, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We hypothesized that MANF and UPR is crucial for maintaining proteostasis during aging, but their efficacy declines with age, therefore increasing vulnerability to NDDs. We measured MANF levels in the brain and plasma of 1-, 4-, 11-, and 22-month-old male and female mice. A progressive decline of MANF levels was observed, with the lowest levels detected in 22 months. Reduced MANF expression was found in aged mice across several brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. There was a sex difference in MANF levels in aged mice. Aging also altered the expression of UPR and MANF interacting proteins. Using cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC)-specific MANF deficient mice, we showed that MANF deficiency impaired motor coordination in female, but not male mice. MANF deficiency weakened spatial learning and memory in both male and female mice. Male MANF deficient mice displayed increased sociability, whereas female mice exhibit social withdrawal. Taken together, MANF expression in the brain declined with age and MANF deficiency impacted neurobehaviors in the aging animal in a sex-specific manner.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In animal models, deviations from normothermia during gestation cause fetal developmental abnormalities. However, the direct and physiological manipulation of the maternal core temperature has been technologically challenging, as traditional methods involve the imposition of external thermal stress. Recent advances in the identification of thermoregulatory neurons in the mouse preoptic area have allowed precise control of maternal body temperature without altering environmental conditions. Here we show that the activation of excitatory neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPO) induces a torpor-like hypothermic state in pregnant mice. When induced during early gestation, this state resulted in pregnancy loss, likely due to implantation failure. Hypothermia in mid- and late-gestation reduced fetal liver and kidney size and caused severe growth retardation. Similar outcomes were observed following pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (Qrfp)-expressing neuron activation in the MPO, whereas inhibitory neuron activation had minimal effect. Furthermore, activating MPO excitatory neurons projecting to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus reproduced both the torpor-like state and fetal growth retardation.

While the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is traditionally associated with abstract, schematic representations, emerging theories suggest it may also contribute to constructing vivid, visual mental content. To test this, we developed a novel 7T fMRI experiment varying imagery demands across conditions: Prior to scanning, participants memorized richly detailed scenarios, more constrained, stationary objects, and finally semantic definitions for each of three abstract German words (e.g., hope). During fMRI and eye-tracking, the same word was presented across trials, but participants vividly re-engaged with one of three distinct representations (i.e., scenarios, objects, and definitions), allowing for comparison across richly different cognitive modes triggered by identical visual input. Univariate analyses confirmed previous findings; highlighting the roles of the vmPFC, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and visual- perceptual cortex in imagery-rich scenario construction. We further performed multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine distributed neural representations, which can reveal the informational content of mental imagery beyond activation magnitude. Critically, the vmPFC was the only brain region where MVPA classifier accuracy was higher for scenario construction than for object and abstract conditions, directly supporting our hypothesis that the vmPFC encodes imagery-rich details rather than solely abstract, schematic information. Eye movement variability also distinguished between conditions.

Although these hallmarks are well-defined in the literature, the mechanisms that drive genomic instability and loss of proteostasis as cells age are still largely unknown. Using budding yeast replicative lifespan as a model for aging in actively dividing cells, we identified nuclear proteins that were depleted in the earliest stages of aging. We found that many age-depleted proteins were involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in ribosome processing, or in maintenance of chromatin stability. We focused on topoisomerase I (Top1) as a novel age-depleted nuclear protein and found that its depletion in the early stages of aging was not a result of transcriptional changes or changes in protein turnover. Despite the stark depletion of Top1 in early aging, rescue of this age-dependent depletion was actually harmful to replicative lifespan. We found that Top1, when overexpressed, disrupts the stoichiometry of the RENT complex by pulling Sir2 away from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), a phenotype which is further enhanced when the overexpressed Top1 is catalytically dead. Loss of Sir2 from the rDNA via the overexpression of catalytically dead Top1 decreases RNA Pol II silencing of a reporter gene inside or adjacent to the rDNA, consistent with the lifespan defect. Finally, we found that the catalytic activity of Top1 plays an important role in the establishment of rDNA silencing, raising the possibility that rDNA secondary structure/DNA topology is important for RNA Pol I-dependent spreading of silent chromatin across the rDNA locus.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

We report that the absence of hormones creates a microenvironment rich in apoptotic cells that are engulfed by neighboring prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we found that epithelial cells alter their metabolism and gene expression during efferocytosis. Efferocytic epithelial cells adopt a more glycolytic metabolism, resulting in elevated levels of lactate production. This correlates with increased histone Lactylation over gene regulatory elements for genes regulating autophagy and catabolism. To further demonstrate that efferocytosis is necessary to remodel tissue during regression, we expressed a mutant of the receptor protein MFGE8, MFGE8-D89E to mask PtdSer in the prostate epithelium and reduce efferocytosis.

Blood vessels cannot form in growing embryos or tissues when VEGF/VEGFR2 signalling is compromised in all cells. The Anti-VEGF blocking antibody is one of the most widely used antibodies in the clinics, blocking angiogenesis in cancer, wound healing or in ischemic diseases. However, vascular resistance to Anti-VEGF has been reported. Here we used iFlpMosaics and iSuRe-HadCre to induce and track genetic mosaics of endothelial cells (ECs) lacking VEGFR2 during the entire embryonic and postnatal organ development. Surprisingly, Vegfr2KO ECs adapt, proliferate normally and compete with wildtype cells over time, forming a significant part of most organs capillaries. We found that Vegfr2KO ECs are not able to sprout during the first wave of angiogenesis in most tissues, because it is highly VEGF-dependent and favours the growth and mobilization of wildtype ECs. However, due to their inability to respond to VEGF, over time Vegfr2KO ECs become dominant in veins, which provide for a long term and continuous source of ECs for subsequent waves of VEGF-independent angiogenesis. Comparative scRNAseq analysis of ECs with acute and long-term loss of VEGFR2, revealed common but also organ-specific molecular mechanisms of adaptation and resistance to the loss of VEGF signalling. This included significant endothelial venousization and the upregulation of ligands for VEGFR1 and VEGFR3. VEGFR1 only partially compensated for VEGFR2 loss in capillary ECs, whereas VEGFR3 only compensated in arterial ECs. Loss of the three VEGF receptors did not compromise venous growth.

This study evaluated the effect of tree cover as an ecological filter on the taxonomic and functional diversity of granivorous birds within livestock mosaics. Eight livestock landscape mosaics were analyzed and classified based on tree cover into open, semi-open, and semi-closed categories. Bird surveys were conducted using point counts and mist netting, and eight morphological traits were measured across the 22 recorded species. Five functional diversity indices were calculated to assess the response to the tree cover gradient through their morphological traits. A reduction in tree cover excludes functionally specialized species and favors generalist communities with redundant traits. Semi-closed and semi-open covers harbored higher functional and taxonomic diversity, showing high levels of richness and functional evenness, with niche complementarity. Open pastures exhibited lower trait variability and clustering with reduced ecological functionality. Larger granivorous species were associated with denser vegetation, whereas smaller species were linked to more open, highly disturbed areas. Greater tree cover promotes the coexistence of granivorous bird species by increasing the availability of microhabitats and resource diversity, which are exploited by species with different functional traits. This highlights the importance of conserving structurally complex vegetation within livestock matrices, using silvopastoral systems to enhance the resilience and functionality of productive Amazonian landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here we collected vocal and auditory data for 72 bird species from 15 different orders, and tested if hearing is finely tuned to the spectral composition of their vocalizations (i.e., the matched-filter hypothesis). We found bird audition not to be predictive of vocal frequency, and mismatches between hearing and vocalizations to be widespread. We show that the source of these mismatches is allometric: the auditory tuning and the spectral composition of vocalizations scale with body weight to different degrees. Despite the general frequency mismatches, bird hearing remains remarkably sensitive to the main spectral component of their vocalizations. Our results challenge the view that sensory systems must be finely tuned only to conspecific signals for communication to be effective. Our results suggest that selection for a broad auditory tuning has allowed birds to effectively communicate with conspecifics while at the same time permitting general environmental awareness using auditory cues.

This result was amplified with increased water application rates. Some bed bugs made turns as they approached the wet zone. Bed bugs increased their speed by 38% when fleeing the wet zone relative to their approaching speed. On average, bed bugs made turns when they were 0.58 cm away from the wet zone. Furthermore, nymphs made turns when they were farther away from the wet zone relative to adults (by 60% on average). These findings suggest that overapplication of liquid pesticides may cause bed bugs to avoid treated areas, highlighting the need for precise application rates to enhance control efficacy.

Fusion-negative (FN) RMS, the predominant subtype, frequently harbors mutations activating the RAS/MAPK pathway, yet the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain poorly defined. Here, we generated vincristine-resistant FN RMS cell lines through long-term dose escalation and identified increased MAPK signaling activity, evidenced by elevated phosphorylated ERK levels in vitro and in patient tumors post-chemotherapy. MEK inhibition via trametinib or MEK1 knockdown significantly impaired growth of resistant cells and enhanced vincristine efficacy in zebrafish tumor models, reducing tumor burden and relapse. Mechanistically, trametinib induced cell cycle arrest and senescence, as marked by p21 upregulation, in resistant cells. This effect was dependent on suppression of MYC, as MYC disruption promoted senescence while MYC overexpression rescued the phenotype. Senescent cells remained partially viable via BCL-XL-mediated survival, rendering them sensitive to the BCL-XL inhibitor, A-1155463. Combined trametinib and A-1155463 significantly reduced growth of resistant RMS cells. Our findings highlight the MEK/MYC/p21 axis and BCL-XL dependency as key vulnerabilities in therapy-resistant FN RMS and support dual targeting of MAPK and senescence-survival pathways as a rational therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Although resistant weed populations have been increasing in recent years, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In a multiple-herbicide resistant line of the paddy weed Echinochloa phyllopogon, overexpression of catalytically promiscuous CYP81A P450 enzymes has been shown to confer resistance to diverse herbicides. Here, we investigated the role of these P450s in quinclorac resistance in E. phyllopogon. Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing CYP81A12 and CYP81A21 genes, previously demonstrated to metabolize other herbicides, showed low but detectable levels of quinclorac resistance. A similar activity was also observed for CYP81A24, another promiscuous enzyme present in E. phyllopogon. Moreover, Escherichia coli strains expressing these genes produced putative hydroxylated metabolites of quinclorac. In silico analyses revealed that quinclorac binds stably near the catalytic heme center of CYP81A12, CYP81A21, and CYP81A24, but not CYP81A18, the importance of spatial alignment between the substrate recognition site and the heme center in determining metabolic activity and resistance potential. Consistent with the phenotype of resistant E. phyllopogon, A. thaliana expressing CYP81A12 and CYP81A21 produced significantly less ethylene following quinclorac treatment, linking P450-mediated metabolism to the suppression of quinclorac-induced phytotoxic responses. Finally, we demonstrated that CYP81A enzymes also confer resistance to other auxinic herbicides, florpyrauxifen-benzyl and 2,4-D. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of auxinic herbicide resistance and underscore the role of CYP81A P450s in metabolic detoxification and the prevention of herbicide-induced phytotoxic responses.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

A prominent, polymerous protein of membranous cuticles is Resilin, known for its flexibility and elasticity. In the articulated legs, including the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the tibia and the tarsi, Resilin incidences in or at the joints of these podomers have been identified in various species such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the desert locust Schistocerca grigaria. A systematic, comparative work on Resilin identification in insect legs is missing. Here, using a microscopic intensity subtraction method, we identified Resilin incidences in the legs of 29 species belonging to the major insect orders. This method relies on the classical identification of Resilin based on Dityrosine (DT) bonds between Resilin monomers, Pro-Resilin, that emit blue light when illuminated with UV light. By subtracting the background intensity counts per pixel (counts) of a common blue filter from the counts obtained by a specific filter for the DT spectrum in insects (microscopic intensity subtraction method, MISM), we both confirm the presence of known Resilin locations and identify new incidences in the podomers such as a coxa-trochanter signal. Together, we find that Resilin distribution in insect legs is highly diverse with no incidence common to all species tested. This underlines that the use of Resilin follows a rapid and optimizing evolutionary adaptation.

Utilizing a longitudinal, translational monkey model of early life stress, we report the cognitive performance of adult female Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that had received social subordination stress associated with Low Social Status (LSS) since birth. Social subordination stress is the means by which macaque social groups establish their hierarchical organization. Higher ranked monkeys maintain their rank by aggression towards lower ranked animals, that in order to avoid harassment, engage in submissive behaviors. This chronic social stress in lower ranked monkeys produces physiological stress responses that over time can accelerate biological and cognitive aging. For this study, we compared 25 adult female Rhesus monkeys, 14 of which were of Low Birth Rank and had received higher levels of social subordination stress since infancy resulting in higher chronic stress. The remaining 11 were of High Birth Rank, and had committed, rather than received, social aggression/harassment on lower ranked subjects. These two groups have been followed longitudinally from birth to adolescence to assess long-term behavioral, physiological, and neural consequences of social stress. Now as they reached adulthood (ages 7-8 years), we assessed their cognitive abilities, focusing on executive function/cognitive flexibility, as a first assessment to map the trajectory of cognitive decline with aging. We trained subjects on the Intra-/Extra-dimensional shift task (ID/ED), which is a Wisconsin Card Sort analog using visual stimuli. This task is relevant for age-related cognitive decline, particularly in executive function, and cognitive flexibility. Cognitive results indicated only mild differences between High and Low ranking subjects on the simple discrimination, and the reversal learning stages of the task. We did find an interaction between High Birth Rank and performance across the three dimensional-shift stages, but no main effect of Rank. Thus, at this first age, we detected no performance differences indicating accelerated cognitive decline. We discuss other factors impacting performance, such as social housing and temperament measures and comparisons with neuroimaging data on these subjects.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, when human cortical neurons reach functional electrophysiological maturity and how their developmental trajectory compares to other species remains unknown. Here we show through patch-clamp recordings of human temporal cortex from infancy to adulthood that supragranular pyramidal neurons exhibit pronounced neoteny of their functional properties, with physiological maturation continuing well into adulthood. Comparing human and mouse developmental trajectories reveals human neurons are on a much slower developmental timeline, maturing physiologically hundreds of times slower than mouse and 2-6 times slower than would be predicted from anatomical brain growth differences between species. This reflects a fundamentally different allometric relationship between physiological and anatomical maturation; while mouse neuronal physiology closely tracks brain growth, human physiological development follows its own extended timeline. This slow maturation results in different stages of cognitive development being supported by functionally distinct neuronal populations, with the progression from infancy to middle age characterized by specific electrophysiological profiles. Notably, a neuronal subtype thought to be human-specific, with electrophysiological traits that enhance computational capacity, appears only in late adolescence or early adulthood. This extreme protraction of neurophysiological development provides a cellular basis for prolonged human cognitive maturation, demonstrating that neuronal physiological neoteny represents a fundamental evolutionary adaptation in human brain development.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

As these neurons mature, they form unique morphologies, integrate into neural circuits, and contribute to behavior. However, the integration of these developmental events is understudied. Here, we show that the same transcription factor is important for both the generation of neuronal diversity and maintaining mature neuronal identity, providing novel insights on how the generation of neuronal identity and morphology are coordinated. We utilized a previously characterized larval locomotor circuit in Drosophila, where activation of the Moonwalker Descending Neuron (MDN) triggers backward locomotion via its presynaptic connection with the premotor neuron A18b. MDN expresses the temporal transcription factor Hunchback (Hb), which has a well-characterized role in neural progenitors. Loss of Hb in the post-mitotic MDN increases axon/dendrite branching, leading to additional functional synapses on A18b and increasing backward locomotion. We conclude that the endogenous function of Hb is to restrain axon/dendrite outgrowth, including limiting MDN-A18b synapses, thereby dampening backward locomotion. Our work provides insights on how a transcription factor can have different functions throughout life - i.e. Hb generates neuronal diversity in the progenitor and regulates neuronal connectivity in the mature neuron to generate an appropriately tuned behavior.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we show with the use of single-copy gene insertion Caenorhabditis elegans models that human tau preferentially localises to neuronal processes in the nematode, consistent with its function of binding to microtubules. The expression of tau in the nervous system leads to age-associated changes in neuronal structural integrity. The observed \"buckling\" phenotype was exacerbated by exposure of the animals to different stressors which are known to enhance tau phosphorylation. Expressing phosphomimic tau or co-expressing human kinases both severely worsened the buckling phenotype. Kinase expression additionally induced tau inclusions in a small proportion of animals.

This stress mitochondrial response process involves glucocorticoid but also multiple alternative pathways that are top down regulated by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These pathways are important for many neuropsychiatric conditions that are sensitive to stress. However, the field lacks a reliable, clinically accessible stress mitochondrial response paradigm to study the process in humans. Method: We used an established psychological stress challenge combined with assaying salivary cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf mtDNA), thought to reflect heightened mitochondrial changes or disruptions, in 35 healthy individuals (21 males). We also explored if these stress induced cf mtDNA marker elevations were associated brain metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), as well as high resolution brain imaging based cortical thickness focusing on the mPFC. Results: We found that salivary cf mtDNA was significant elevated immediately after the stress challenge (p=2.0x10-7) and gradually declined after. Exploratory causal analysis showed that this cf mtDNA response was not primarily driven by cortisol response. Instead, individuals with higher baseline dACC lactate+ levels, thought to in part reflect mitochondrial dysfunctions, was significantly associated with the cf mtDNA response (r=0.80, p<0.001). Higher mtDNA response was also significantly associated with thinner dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (r=-0.52, p=0.01). Age had a U-shape effect such that cf mtDNA response trended lower in earlier adulthood but higher in older people, explaining 33.8% of the ct mtDNA response variance (p=0.003). Conclusion: This stress challenge-salivary cf mtDNA assay paradigm may offer a new, noninvasive approach to evaluate the stress-mitochondrial pathway functioning in aging, psychopharmacology, and neuropsychiatric conditions where psychological stress plays a role.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Sexually naive females interact minimally or aggressively with infants, whereas the same animals exhibit extensive care behavior, even towards unrelated infants, after parturition1-6. Here, we discovered that two distinct sets of serotonin neurons collectively mediate this dramatic transition in maternal behavior--serotonin neurons projecting to the medial preoptic area (mPOA) promote pup care in mothers, whereas those projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) suppress pup interaction in virgin female mice. Disrupting serotonin synthesis in either of these subpopulations or stimulating either subpopulation is sufficient to toggle pup-directed behavior between that displayed by virgin females and that of lactating mothers. In virgin female mice, the first pup interaction triggers an increase in serotonin release in BNST but a decrease in mPOA. In mothers, serotonin activity becomes greatly elevated in mPOA during pup interactions. Acute interruption of serotonin signaling locally in either mPOA or BNST disrupts the stage-dependent switch in pup care. Together, these results highlight how functionally distinct serotonin subpopulations orchestrate social behaviors appropriate for a given reproductive state, and suggest a circuit logic for how a neuromodulator coordinates adaptive behavioral changes across life stages.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we computationally explore the effect of two different inhibitory connectivity motifs on the retinas response to moving objects: feed-forward and recurrent feed-back inhibition. We show that both can account for motion anticipation with two different mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition truncates motion responses and shifts peak responses forward via subtractive inhibition, whereas recurrent feedback coupling evokes, via divisive inhibition, excitatory and inhibitory waves with different phases that add up and shift the response peak. A key difference between the two mechanisms is how the peak response scales with the speed of a moving object.

Here, we optogenetically stimulated serotonergic neurons in the DRN while recording large parts of the brain with Neuropixels during quiet wakefulness and performance of a perceptual decision-making task. During quiet wakefulness, 5-HT stimulation induced a rapid switch in internal state, as indicated by dilation of the pupil, suppression of hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and increased exploratory behaviors, such as whisking. To elucidate the brain-wide effect of serotonin release we performed acute Neuropixel recordings in seven target locations, a total of 7,478 neurons were recorded across 17 mice. We found that 5-HT stimulation significantly modulated neural activity in all the recorded brain regions, both during quiet wakefulness and task performance. During task performance, however, we observed no change in behavior when stimulating 5-HT. We found that the 5-HT modulation of high-dimensional neural dynamics is confined to a subspace which is orthogonal relative to the choice axis.

Focusing first on peri-implantitis versus low- and moderate-grade periodontitis, we applied microbial profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial proteomics (sp-proteomics) to uncover shared pathogenic programs linked to accelerated niche breakdown. Furthermore, to preserve spatial fidelity, each tissue was anatomically orientated along the tooth- or implant-epithelial interface, analogous sites of disease origination. Laser capture microdissection followed by microbiome analysis of unique tissue compartments revealed reduced bacterial load and diversity in peri-implantitis stroma.

Theory shows that temporally-autocorrelated environments generate a higher risk of population extinction; however, little work has been done to incorporate temporal autocorrelation into thermal performance-based projections of extinction risk. Here, we pair stochastic simulation models of population dynamics with systematically generated temperature time series to determine when higher levels of autocorrelation generate greater extinction risk. We show that autocorrelation is a significant mediator of risk under stressful temperature regimes, with important ramifications for forecasting temperature-driven extinctions in ectothermic organisms. We validate our predictions with a factorial experiment in microcosms of the single-celled protist Paramecium caudatum.

While cohesin engages chromatin in context dependent modes, the regulatory influence of chromatin state on these interactions remains unclear. Here, we show that histone hyperacetylation, induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), preferentially disrupts short range interactions within TADs but spares CTCF anchored loops, despite reduced cohesin occupancy at these sites. These findings point to two functionally distinct cohesin populations: a TSA sensitive pool within TADs, likely representing extruding, non topologically bound cohesin, and a TSA resistant population at CTCF CTCF anchors that maintains loops through topological entrapment. Using a semi in vitro system with TEV cleavable RAD21, we show that TSA resistant cohesin at CTCF sites becomes TSA sensitive after proteolytic cleavage that opens the cohesin ring, showing that it is the topological engagement with DNA that makes cohesin, and CTCF CTCF loops, TSA resistant. Notably, we also detect TSA sensitive cohesin at CTCF sites, suggesting the presence of transient, non encircling cohesin that either precedes conversion to the stable form or is halted by pre existing encircling cohesin. Together, our results suggest that cohesin exists in distinct biochemical states: an extruding form found within TADs and at CTCF sites, that is sensitive to hyperacetylation, and a topologically bound form specifically at CTCF CTCF loops that is insensitive. The former may allow dynamic changes in chromatin loops, while latter ensures robustness of CTCF anchored loops in response to chromatin state changes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Use of vapor inhalation models have translational relevance, as the majority of human cannabis user do so by inhalation (e.g., smoking, vaporization). Methods: Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (N=96, 6-12 per sex/group) were pre-exposed to vaporized THC or vehicle (Veh; 100% propylene glycol). Rats were then trained to self-administer vapor puffs of either THC (50 mg/ml training dose) or Veh under a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule. Responding was then assessed under increasing response costs (FR1-5) and different doses (50-200 mg/ml) of THC. As a secondary study aim, we assessed the effects of pre-exposure to THC (or Veh) on self-administration of THC vapor or Veh vapor. Results: There were no differences in responding for THC and Veh vapor under an FR1 schedule. As the FR increased, rats increased their responses for THC, and female rats in the THC group responded more than female rats in the Veh vapor group under FR4-5 schedules. When THC concentration was varied, rats titrated their intake in a predictable U-shaped pattern. THC vapor pre-exposure significantly increased self-administration of THC vapor, but not Veh vapor. Conclusions: Male and female rats voluntarily administered THC vapor in a sustained manner across several months, replicating what has been shown with vaporized cannabis extracts male rats. This study is the first to demonstrate that THC vapor has reinforcing properties in female rats and that pre-exposure is critical for engendering higher intake. This is a promising model of voluntary THC vapor administration.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

A.; McElligott, A. G.", "abstract": "The use of infrared thermal imaging has become increasingly popular in animal behaviour, health, and welfare research over the last decade. Yet, there is a lack of consensus regarding how this technique should be best applied when measuring peripheral temperatures in animals, including which regions of interest to favour. This fundamental issue necessitates checking the reliability and precision of thermal imaging data when taking repeated measurements, both over short and relatively long time windows. Using goats (Capra hircus) as a model, we investigated two subcategories of reliability, short-term repeatability (measurements taken in the same session) and reproducibility (over multiple sessions), as well as the precision of surface temperatures in two facial regions. We collected data from 20 goats over five measurement sessions over consecutive days. During each session, five frames were collected from approximately one-minute-long videos. From each video, we extracted the mean, maximum, and minimum surface temperatures from the left eye, right eye, and nose tip. To calculate repeatability, we compared temperature variation attributed to differences between goats against total variation in surface temperatures measured in a single session. We defined precision as the temperature deviation within which the mean temperature measured from one to five thermal images was expected to fall in relation to the mean of five image replicates 95% of the time. Reproducibility was investigated by comparing variation attributed to differences in temperature between measurement sessions against total variation in surface temperatures. Our results revealed that repeatability and precision of mean and maximum temperatures across five repeated measurements were high for all facial regions, with between 93.50% and 99.81% of total temperature variation attributable to the individual goat tested. Conversely, minimum temperatures were more variable, less repeatable, and less precise. For reproducibility, measurement sessions accounted for a high proportion of variation in nasal temperatures (74.61-85.85%), and a lower, but substantial proportion of eye temperature variation (49.59-67.01%). We conclude that mean and maximum thermal measures show promise for quantifying nasal and eye temperatures in the short term. However, surface temperature measured across several days was not readily comparable, highlighting the importance of considering ambient conditions in thermal imaging research. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the appropriate use of thermal imaging in goats and, more broadly, animal behaviour and welfare research.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Due to its essential roles in physiology and pathology, many methodologies and technologies have been developed to determine the interaction events and parameters of interaction affinity. However, due to the nature of these methodologies, interactive partner needs to be purified, and large quantities of proteins are needed. This significantly limits quantitatively understanding of protein interaction and its application in therapeutics development. Recently, a quantitative FRET(qFRET) method was developed to determine purified protein-protein interaction affinity for purified proteins in vitro. Here, for the first time, we report the development of a high-throughput approach to determining the protein interaction affinity between two un-purified proteins using a quantitative FRET assay(qFRET). Two proteins, SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, and RanGap1c, were first employed for the methodology development. We then determined the interaction affinities of Ubc9 and PIAS1 with influenza A virus NS1 protein without purifying two interactive partners. We found that both enzymes have high affinities to interaction affinity to the NS1, and this provides a kinetics explanation for the SUMOylation two-enzyme co-recognition mechanism to achieve high substrate specificity in vivo. The protein interaction affinity determination without purification provides several advantages over the current methods, including high accuracy, no tedious protein purification process, and high-throughput assay. The novel approach, so-called High-throughput determination of protein interaction affinity, KD, without purification using quantitative FRET assay, and scientific discoveries, representing a significant advancement in technology and scientific discovery, holds great potential for large-scale protein-protein interaction affinity determinations in vitro and in vivo.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

To overcome this, structure and sequence prediction models have been applied to assess design quality prior to experimental testing to save time and resources. In this study, we aimed to determine the extent to which AlphaFold2, Protein MPNN, and ESMFold can discriminate between experimentally successful and unsuccessful designs. For this, we curated a benchmark dataset of 614 experimentally characterized de novo designed monomers from 11 different design studies between 2012 and 2021. All predictive models demonstrated moderate ability to discriminate experimental successes (expressed, soluble, monomeric, and fold into the intended design structure) from failures, with many failed designs having better confidence metrics than successful designs. Among all computational models evaluated, ESMFold average pLDDT yielded the best individual performance at distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful designs. A logistic regression model combining all confidence metrics provided only modest improvement over ESMFold pLDDT alone.

This incomplete mechanistic understanding has limited their broader therapeutic application, particularly in solid tumors, where early clinical trials showed limited efficacy. Here, through the assessment of drug sensitivity in over 600 human cancer models and comparison to a non-DNA-damaging DNMT1 inhibitor (GSK-3685032), we establish DNA hypomethylation, rather than DNA damage, as the primary killing mechanism of AZA and DEC across diverse cancer types. In further support of an epigenetic killing mechanism, CRISPR drug modifier screens identified a core set of chromatin regulators, most notably the histone deubiquitinase USP48, as AZA and DEC protective factors. We show that USP48 is recruited to newly hypomethylated CpG islands and deubiquitinates non-canonical histones, establishing USP48 as a key molecular link between the two components of epigenetic gene regulation: DNA methylation and chromatin modification. Furthermore, loss of USP48, which occurs naturally through biallelic deletions in human cancers, sensitized both hematologic and solid tumors to DNMT1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of action of AZA and DEC and identify a homeostatic link between DNA methylation and chromatin state, revealing new therapeutic opportunities for DNMT1 inhibitors in solid tumors.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Using tumor-derived organoids from both mouse models and patient biopsies, we show that brief, low-dose exposure to phytogenic or synthetic CB2R ligands induces a basal-to-luminal switch, suppresses stemness, and reduces invasiveness and self-renewal. These phenotypic changes are associated with decreased tumor initiation and aggressiveness in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that CB2R activation initiates transient chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming, resulting in a stably differentiated state. Importantly, CB2R-driven differentiation sensitizes tumor cells to tamoxifen, enabling lower therapeutic doses with improved efficacy-supporting the principles of adaptive therapy aimed at long-term disease control.

Furthermore, displacement into bone tissue contaminates MRS data with noisy artifacts, often rendering them unusable. While promising solutions exist to address motion-related issues, many rely on specialized infrastructure and expertise available only at a limited number of research centers. We propose a fast and straightforward method that acquires a head scout (18 s) MRI sequence following potential motion, automatically repositions the prescribed voxel with the scanner's built-in AutoAlign function, and realigns the T1-weighted image to the updated position for anatomical segmentation. Using voxels prescribed in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and left superior temporal gyrus, we demonstrated that this realignment method successfully restored displaced voxels to their intended locations, eliminating bone contamination while improving voxel targeting through greater overlap with intended regions and more consistent voxel placement across subjects.

Using a cell-penetrating peptide-mediated delivery system, we successfully introduced mitochondria into two mesenchymal-subtype GBM cell lines, U3035 and U3046. Transplanted cells exhibited enhanced mitochondrial polarization and respiratory function, particularly in the metabolically flexible U3035 line. Bioenergetic profiling revealed significant increases in basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and glycolytic reserve in U3035 cells post-transplantation, whereas U3046 cells showed minimal bioenergetic augmentation. Transcriptomic analyses using oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis gene sets confirmed these functional findings. At baseline, U3035 cells expressed high levels of both glycolytic and OXPHOS genes, while U3046 cells were metabolically suppressed. Following radiation, U3035 cells downregulated key OXPHOS and glycolysis genes, suggesting metabolic collapse. In contrast, U3046 cells transcriptionally upregulated both pathways, indicating compensatory adaptation.

Although many cognitive domains can be affected, impairments in visuospatial/perceptual function are relatively specific for PD and DLB compared to other dementias. Across populations, cognitive impairments correlate with the presence of -synuclein (-syn) pathology in limbic and neocortical brain regions. However, the specific role that -syn pathology plays in driving cortical circuit dysfunction and cognitive impairment remains controversial. We hypothesized that inducing -syn pathology in visual cortex in mice would impair neuronal activity and encoding of visual information, leading to visuoperceptual impairments. To test this hypothesis, we injected -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) into primary visual cortex (V1) to seed endogenous -syn pathology. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon (2P) calcium imaging over 6 months, we recorded visually evoked activity of pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and quantified -syn pathology using C05-05, a fluorescent ligand that binds aggregated -syn. Injection of PFFs led to the formation of sparse Lewy-like pathology in V1 and other anatomically connected regions. Measuring population activity, we found a greater percentage of neurons in PFF-injected mice were responsive to visual stimuli with lower direction selectivity compared to controls at 4-5 months post-injection (MPI). Within PFF-injected mice, neurons with large somatic Lewy-like inclusions had significantly lower visually evoked activity compared to neighboring neurons without inclusions. Conversely, the activity of neurons without somatic inclusions showed increased activity, positively correlated with the nearby burden of -syn pathology. Measuring visuoperceptual function using a head-fixed coherent motion discrimination task, we found no impairments in visuoperceptual ability in PFF-injected mice up to 6 MPI. Our results demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that -syn pathology leads to cell autonomous reductions in neuronal activity and reciprocal changes in local population activity that may be compensatory, helping to preserve visuoperceptual function. Reflecting the early stages of neocortical -syn pathology, our model provides a framework for future studies incorporating risk factors for dementia in PD to better understand the heterogeneity of cognitive symptoms and -syn pathology across patients.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

We present the first observation of BNI effects in alkaline soil trials (pH 8.6-8.7) of elite spring wheat that carries the Lr#N short arm from Leymus racemosus. BNI was expressed as lower soil nitrate in three trials conducted in an irrigated wheat system in northwestern Mexico. In one year, we observed 24-37% lower nitrate in soil of the translocation line compared to the control after the second ammonium-N fertilizer application. Lower nitrate was observed in the row and in the furrow. The largest difference between the control and the translocation line was approximately one month after the second ammonium-N split application (73-77% less nitrate). Potential nitrification rates were 27-32% lower in soil from the translocation line compared to the control, one week after a high ammonium-N application. Higher flag leaf nitrate concentration of the translocation line could be related to the strongly reduced soil nitrate. The translocation line took longer to reach anthesis and flowering. In two experiments, the translocation line was equivalent in terms of grain yield, whereas in one experiment it produced lower yields, with fewer grains per spike and reduced number of spikes per area. Protein content and grain N uptake of the translocation line were similar to the control. We conclude that BNI reduces nitrification with a spatially and temporally significant impact under alkaline soil and high N input conditions. This finding points to the potential major environmental benefits that could be achieved also in non-acidic soil spring wheat systems worldwide.

Trauma-specific citrullinations and acetylations were validated via MS spectra. Epitope mapping identified a novel trauma-specific cleavage site and revealed coil1-BDPs as selectively released into fluid, while coil2 fragments remained intracellular in a human trauma culture model. Citrullinated GFAP-specific antibodies exhibited distinct binding patterns from those of unmodified, native GFAP in TBI patients CSF and detected unique granular aggregates in dystrophic astrocytes without staining filamentous GFAP. TBI-GFAP fragments were produced by stepwise trauma-activated calpain and caspase activities shown by in vitro inhibitor studies. Live cell imaging with fluorescent protease reporters demonstrates coexisting calpain and caspase activities, along with membrane disruption jointly identifying distinct astrocyte injury states. The trajectory of GFAP proteolysis was analyzed in CSF samples from 24 TBI patients over 10PIDs, via calibrated, band-specific scaled immunoblot densitometry. These profiles covaried with patient age and body temperature. Full-length GFAP and 45-49kDa fragments peaked on injury day and declined over time, whereas calpain-generated 37-39kDa BDPs remained elevated. Small BDPs exhibited either delayed rises or remained undetected. Compared to the 20-26kDa BDPs, 15-19kDa products were notably underrepresented, consistent with coil1-BDPs preferred release and coil2-BDPs selective cellular retainment. Fluid levels of calpain-generated GFAP fragment were time and severity-dependent in the trauma culture model. TBI CSF trajectories of GFAP-BDPs differentiated TBI patients with poor versus those with good outcomes on the extended Glasgow Outcome scale (GOSE), whereas uncleaved GFAP trajectories failed in early prediction of patient outcome at six months. These findings define trauma-specific GFAP degradome dynamics and highlight novel longitudinal proteolysis profiles for patient monitoring and stratification. This work is significant as it supports GFAP fragment profiling for potential context of use (COU) in neurocritical care TBI monitoring, and offers preliminary insights into diagnosing astroglial proteinopathy-linked neurodegeneration after TBI.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that corrective sub-movements (CSMs) -- structured, feedback-driven adjustments occurring spontaneously during naturalistic mouse reaching -- are not only encoded in anterior interposed (IntA) output neurons, but also act as instructive signals for feedforward learning. Closed-loop perturbations that trigger CSMs lead to learned shifts in the timing of future corrections, even in the absence of further perturbation. Strikingly, this learning depends on the timing of corrective responses, rather than the timing of the error itself, and is accompanied by physiological adaptation in cerebellar output neuronal firing rates. These findings reveal a cerebellar mechanism by which feedback responses train future anticipatory control signals, bridging the gap between reactive and anticipatory motor control in the cerebellum.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

V.; Kramer, M. A.; White, J.

Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been pivotal in addressing these challenges by simplifying data into interpretable, low-dimensional structures, while capturing essential network dynamics. Among DR methods, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can produce biologically meaningful representations through its nonnegativity constraint and parts-based decomposition, making it especially suited for analyzing neuronal calcium signals. To enhance accessibility and standardization in the analysis of state-dependent neuronal dynamics, we introduce Calcium Network dynamiCs (CaNetiCs), an open-source toolbox centered on NMF, integrating standardized DR methods (PCA, ICA, UMAP), geometric low-dimensional component space analyses, and neuronal network simulation modules. We validate our toolbox by applying it to two diverse experimental datasets that describe responses to graded anesthesia: whole-ganglion cellular calcium imaging of C. elegans, and two-photon imaging of murine somatosensory cortex. Our analyses recapitulate previously observed trends, such as network suppression and decorrelation with anesthesia, while uncovering novel insights into neuronal activity under differing contexts. CaNetiCs provides an accessible, modular, and interpretable framework, facilitating broader adoption of standardized dimensionality reduction methodologies for deeper exploration of neuronal network dynamics across experimental paradigms.

M.; Fischer, A. C.; Casanova, P.; Abrahams, V. M.", "abstract": "Maternal infection and chorioamnionitis are one of the leading causes of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity. The relationship and mechanisms linking bacterial infections and preterm labor are well researched, however, less is known about the mechanisms involved in how viral infections contribute to preterm labor. Previous work from our group demonstrated that following bacterial triggers, fetal membranes (FMs) express elevated miR-146a-3p which in turn acts as an intermediate danger signal by activating TLR8 to induce a robust inflammatory response. Using an established FM explant model system, the role of this and other TLR7/8-activating miRs in the propagation of viral-induced inflammation was investigated. Following exposure to the viral dsRNA mimic and TLR8 agonist, Poly(I:C), expression of FM tissue TLR7/8-activating miRs were not elevated. Despite this, FM secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 were increased in response to Poly(I:C) in a TLR7- and TLR8-dependent manner. To investigate alternative methods of miR delivery, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from FM supernatants were isolated and found to contain elevated levels of miR-146a-3p and miR-21a under Poly(I:C) conditions. Furthermore, Poly(I:C)-induced IL-6 and IL-8 responses were reduced in the presence of an inhibitor of sEV biogenesis/release, and IL-6 production was reduced in the presence of a miR-146a-3p inhibitor. Together, these data suggests that sEVs produced from virally-stimulated human FMs contain and deliver elevated miR-146a-3p which acts as a danger signal to drive perpetuate inflammation via TLR7 and TLR8 activation. This work demonstrates a novel and important role for sEV packaged TLR7/8 activating-miR-146a-3p in FM inflammatory responses to viral infections.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

A key player in the immunologic recognition of non-self is the immune synapse, where T cell receptors (TCRs) scan peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to detect and eliminate cells displaying non-self antigens. While this interaction is vital for vaccine and immunotherapy success, the underlying rules of TCR recognition remain poorly understood. This is only further challenged as the application of predictive models is very limited due to small training datasets. While traditional machine learning models excel at predicting neoantigen binding to MHC, they often struggle to accurately predict immunogenicity. To address these challenges, we developed a quantum computing approach using Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs).

PAX7 is able to both stimulate satellite cell proliferation and activate target genes involved in establishing myogenic identity, including myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) and the other myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). Upregulation of the MRFs promotes commitment to the muscle lineage by initiating withdrawal from the cell cycle, upregulating expression of muscle-specific transcripts, and directing myoblast fusion. We have previously shown that knockout of the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts results in significantly decreased Pax7 expression, an inability of the cells to differentiate into myotubes, and abnormal upregulation of osteogenic markers. Here, we use RNA-sequencing to more comprehensively determine how loss of NRMT1 affects the transcriptional profile of proliferating and differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. We see that upon inducing differentiation, NRMT1 knockout cells can downregulate cell cycle, DNA replication, and histone gene expression. Though they also have significantly downregulated Pax7 and Myf5 expression, other muscle-specific transcripts are significantly increased over wild type, indicating the muscle transcriptional program is not completely inhibited. However, signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of other types of mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineages are also increased with NRMT1 loss and expression of chemotactic genes is downregulated. Together, these data indicate that NRMT1 knockout cells can upregulate genes needed for cell cycle withdrawal and muscle specification but fail to suppress markers of other lineages and activate normal chemotactic signaling, which may lead to the observed differentiation phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Many bacteria scavenge trace metals with metallophores, small molecules that chelate environmental metal ions.

However, accurately detecting non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) metallophore biosynthesis requires expert manual inspection, stymieing large-scale investigations. Here, we introduce automated identification of NRP metallophore BGCs through a comprehensive algorithm, implemented in antiSMASH, that detects chelator biosynthesis genes with 97% precision and 78% recall against manual curation. We showcase the utility of the detection algorithm by experimentally characterizing metallophores from several taxa. High-throughput NRP metallophore BGC detection enabled metallophore detection across 69,929 genomes spanning the bacterial kingdom. We predict that 25% of all bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encode metallophore production and that significant chemical diversity remains undiscovered. A reconstructed evolutionary history of NRP metallophores supports that some chelating groups may predate the Great Oxygenation Event.

Methods: First, we co-incubated tigecycline with MAC for seven days in time-kill studies and calculated the exposure mediating 50% of maximal effect (Emax or EC50. Next, we performed tigecycline exposure-effect studies in the hollow fiber system of MAC (HFS-MAC) inoculated with the reference ATCC#700898 isolate. Third, we performed an exposure-effect study in the HFS-MAC inoculated with 5 different isolates. Finally, the target exposure (EC80) was used to identify a clinical dose of inhaled tigecycline for MAC-LD in 10,000 subject Monte Carlo experiments (MCE). Results: In time-kill studies the EC50 was 0-24h area under the concentration-time curve-to-MIC (AUC0-24/MIC) of 62.24 for extracellular and 0.14 for intracellular MAC (p<0.001). In the HFS-MAC inoculated with ATCC#700898, the EC50 statistically differed between sampling days by 2,370.7%. However, studies with five different isolates demonstrated a stable and robust day-to-day EC50 (%CV=18.18%), with an EC80 AUC0-24/MIC of 33.65. The Emax was 4.84 log10 CFU/mL. In MCE, tigecycline inhalational doses of 35-40 mg/day achieved the EC80 target in >90% of virtual patients, with and an MIC breakpoint of 256 mg/L.

Here, we uncover a critical role for RNA in reinforcing the nucleation, chromatin engagement, and oncogenic activity of ENL mutant condensates. Mutant ENL binds RNA via a conserved basic patch within its YEATS domain, and this interaction enhances condensate formation both in vitro and across diverse cellular contexts. Using a chemically inducible condensate displacement and re-nucleation system, we show that blocking ENL: RNA interactions or transcription impairs condensate reformation at endogenous targets. RNA interactions preferentially enhance ENL occupancy at condensate-permissive loci, leading to increased transcriptional bursting and robust gene activation at the single-cell and single-allele level. In mouse models, disrupting ENL:RNA interactions diminishes condensate formation and oncogenic transcription in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, thereby suppressing ENL mutation-driven leukemogenesis.

E. histolytica interacts with both the intestinal microbiota and the metabolites they produce. These bacterial metabolites play a crucial role in shaping the virulence and stress resistance of E. histolytica. One such metabolite, indole, is synthesized by bacteria from tryptophan and functions as a key signaling molecule. In this study, we investigated the impact of indole on E. histolytica by incubating trophozoites with the metabolite and performing proteomic analyses under various conditions, including trophozoites adapted to indole. Our results show that indole is toxic to E. histolytica, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.2 mM; however, the parasite can adapt to this concentration. Proteomic analyses reveal that indole-adapted trophozoites display enhanced resistance to oxidative stress (OS), upregulation of cytoskeletal proteins, and increased virulence. These trophozoites exhibit increased F-actin formation, smaller cell size, stronger adhesion to HeLa cells, enhanced migratory capacity, and more effective colonization of the mouse cecum compared to non-adapted trophozoites. Thus, indole exerts a dual effect on E. histolytica physiology. While indole is initially toxic to the parasite, adaptation to indole confers enhanced resistance to OS and promotes a more virulent phenotype. This duality underscores the complex role of microbiota-derived metabolites in modulating parasite behavior and highlights indole as a key microbial signal.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we performed a comprehensive whole-genome analysis of 25,145 publicly available C. difficile genomes, supplemented with 21 novel isolates from soil samples in Costa Rica and Brazil. Using average nucleotide identity (ANI), recombination-corrected core-genome phylogenies, and toxin gene profiling, we confirmed the presence of all known classical and cryptic clades and identified two novel classical clades (C6 and C7) and two previously undescribed cryptic clades (C-VI and C-VII). We further detected evidence for a deep bifurcation within cryptic clade C-III, supporting its subdivision into sub-lineages C-IIIa and C-IIIb. ANI comparisons revealed that cryptic clades share less than 95% identity with classical C. difficile strains but remain more similar to C. difficile than to any other Peptostreptococcaceae species, reinforcing their placement within the species boundary. Core-genome recombination analyses revealed limited gene flow between cryptic and classical clades, except for Clade C7, which exhibited intermediate recombination patterns and may represent a transitional lineage.

PE11 promotes FLCN-dependent depletion of intracellular lactate to destabilize TFEB and thereby downregulate genes essential for autophagic flux and lysosomal acidification. Using a PE11-deficient Mtb strain, we demonstrate that PE11 targets the FLCN-lactate axis to regulate TFEB stability. Exogenous lactate supplementation restored TFEB stability, enhanced lysosomal acidification, and significantly reduced intracellular bacterial burden. Lactate also synergized with frontline anti-tubercular drugs to improve Mtb clearance.

The increase in antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae and other pathogens is a significant public health concern. The streptococcal 70S ribosome is a prime target for antibiotics. Ribosomal protein L27 reaches into the peptidyl transferase center with its extended N-terminus and may be involved in the translation process. We have shown that L27 in Firmicutes, including staphylococci and streptococci, has an additional 9-12 amino acid N-terminal extension compared to Gram-negative organisms like Escherichia coli. The extension is cleaved by a protease called Prp that is absent from organisms that lack the extension. In S. aureus, Prp and the N-terminal extension of L27 are essential. Here, we have characterized the cleavage of L27 by Prp in S. pneumoniae. Prp forms dimers that efficiently cleave L27 in vitro. An inactive form of Prp (PrpC34S) binds to L27 without cleaving, whereas L27 with a mutation (F12A) of the cleavage site does not bind Prp. Overexpression of PrpC34S in vivo is detrimental to S. pneumoniae growth. Surprisingly, a S. pneumoniae {Delta}prp strain was viable, apparently due to cleavage of L27 by another, unknown protease.

All six of the isolates tested exhibited heteroresistance, indicated by a 16-fold difference between the highest non-inhibitory concentration (2 g/mL) and the minimum inhibitory concentration (32-64 g/mL) observed in population analysis profile (PAP) assays.

Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a commonly used biocide, for which previous research revealed that Escherichia coli can rapidly adapt to tolerate BAC disinfection, with consequences for antibiotic susceptibility. However, the consequences of BAC tolerance for selection dynamics and resistance evolution to antibiotics remain unknown. Here, we investigated in detail the effect of BAC-tolerance in E. coli on its response upon challenge with different classes of antibiotics. Competition assays showed that subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin - but not ampicillin, colistin and gentamicin - select for the BAC-tolerant strain over the BAC-sensitive ancestor at a minimal selective concentration of 0.0013-0.0022 g/mL ciprofloxacin. In contrast, the BAC-sensitive ancestor was more likely to evolve resistance to ciprofloxacin, colistin and gentamicin than the BAC-tolerant strain when adapted to higher concentrations of antibiotics in a serial transfer laboratory evolution experiment. The observed difference in the evolvability of resistance to ciprofloxacin was partly explained by a negative epistatic interaction between the mutations conferring BAC-tolerance and a knockout mutation in the gene encoding for the outer membrane porin F. Taken together, these findings suggest that BAC-induced tolerance can be stabilized in environments containing low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, while it also constrains evolutionary pathways towards antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a DNA virus that causes severe disease outcomes in equids. Some EHV1 strains are neurotropic and cause disease in the central nervous system, whereas others are non-neurotropic and can cause negative reproductive outcomes. The molecular mechanisms that govern pathotype of individual EHV1 strains are not understood. However, EHV1 replication in the presence of epigenetic inhibitors suggests that neurotropic and non-neurotropic EHV1 are differentially susceptible to epigenetic silencing. Aside from this evidence, little is known about EHV1 chromatin or its regulation. Here, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to characterize EHV1 lytic chromatin dynamics. Infection with neurotropic or non-neurotropic EHV1 mobilized all histones. Canonical (H2A, H2B, H3.1, H4) or variant (H2A.B, H2A.Z, H2A.X, macroH2A, H3.3) core and linker H1.2 histones were equally mobilized by either strain. Thus, there were no vast differences in histone mobility during neurotropic or non-neurotropic EHV1 infection. All histones except for H2A.B were more mobile within EHV1 replication compartments (RCs) than the surrounding infected-cell chromatin. The differential mobility of histones within domains enriched for viral or cellular chromatin is consistent with distinct mechanisms to assemble and regulate the chromatin associated with viral or host DNA. Histones were further mobilized within RCs in cells in which infection had further progressed. Such mobilization indicates that increased levels of EHV1 transcription, DNA replication, or protein expression directly or indirectly mobilize histones. The high histone mobility within EHV1 RCs is consistent with assembly of EHV1 genomes in very dynamic and unstable nucleosomes. These data support a model in which EHV1 limits genome silencing by preventing stable chromatin assembly, or destabilizing the chromatin assembled, with viral genomes during lytic infection. We propose that manipulation of histone dynamics represents a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation adopted by alphaherpesviruses to maintain genome accessibility and prevent gene silencing.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

They are commonly isolated from living tissue as it makes them easier to interrogate at the biochemical level. Thus, isolated mitochondria of sufficient quality are desired to improve translational impact. To gain a greater insight into the isolation process and optimize our current isolation protocol for quality, we implemented various fine-tuning modifications to our standard homogenization, centrifugation, and purification steps with isolated rat hepatocyte mitochondria. The following modifications we tested were: i) different homogenization speeds (10,000, 14,000, and 18,000 rpm) with varying time intervals (10, 20, and 30 sec), ii) addition of an additional purification spin, and iii) use of density gradients to further purify the isolated mitochondria from non-mitochondrial contaminants. Mitochondrial quality was approximated using the well-established respiratory control ratio (RCR). The data reveal that our original protocol yields isolated mitochondria with acceptable quality and the optimization attempts produced similar or worse mitochondrial isolates. In addition, an extra purification spin decreased RCR values and therefore is not recommended. We note that the use of density gradients did not improve the RCR, but it did remove presumed peroxisomal contamination. While this protocol can be further enhanced using additional metrics, the data indicate that our current isolation protocol is sufficiently effective since additional modifications did not yield major improvements.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, for N metagenomic samples, using full multi-against-multi binning requires N2 alignments, making it computationally challenging to apply in large-scale metagenomic studies. Here, we propose AEMB (Abundance Estimation for Metagenomic Binning), a novel mapping mode implemented in strobealign.

Compared to the hash table used in the previous version of strobealign, the indexing structure reduces peak memory usage by 25.2% with almost the same runtime. Furthermore, we implemented a fast abundance estimation method that skips base-level alignment.

While this response is well-characterized under photoautotrophic conditions, its modulation by external organic carbon sources such as glucose remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated how glucose affects chlorosis onset and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, focusing on redox control and photosynthetic electron transport. Using an integrative approach combining physiological assays, targeted metabolomics, RNA-sequencing, chlorophyll fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy, we studied responses in wild-type cells of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Glucose supplementation prevented bleaching, even when added after nitrogen deprivation symptoms had begun. This effect was associated with excess glycogen accumulation, disrupted carbon partitioning, and buildup of metabolic intermediates, indicating a metabolic overflow. Despite these physiological differences, transcriptomic responses to nitrogen deprivation were largely similar regardless of glucose supplementation, suggesting regulation at the post-transcriptional or metabolic level. Glucose also impaired photosynthetic electron transport by creating a redox bottleneck at the photosystem II (PSII) acceptor side, leading to decreased electron transport to photosystem I (PSI) and accumulation of oxidized P700. These findings suggest that reduction of the PSI acceptor side is required to trigger chlorosis. Our results demonstrate that glucose uncouples nitrogen sensing from the bleaching process by altering redox balance and photosynthetic electron flow.

These genomically-encoded technologies spread themselves through target populations by creating double-stranded DNA breaks on homologous chromosomes, into which the homing-drives are copied (homed). Homing is dependent on sequence homology between the genomic regions flanking the transgene insertion and the break site. Homing efficiency (i.e. copying rate) substantially impacts the power of these systems: less efficient homing-drives spread slower, have fewer applications and are more resistance-prone. Understanding what influences homing-drive efficiency is therefore vital to the successful use of these technologies. Here we report a novel mechanism by which a homing-drives efficiency can be significantly impaired by natural sequence variation within a population into which it is spreading. Using a kmo-targeting split homing-drive in the West Nile virus mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, we found that target-site heterology (sequence mismatch between the genomic regions flanking the target cut-site and the homing-drive transgene) of less than 10% reduced homing efficiency by up to 54%.

Capsule can differ in abundance, attachment, and length of the individual CPS chains. Long, uniform CPS chains are associated with a high level of mucoidy. Typically, mucoid CPS is produced by the hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) pathotype, which is associated with invasive community-acquired infections.

Traits like access to otherwise inaccessible substrates, increased stress tolerance and predation resistance provide ecological advantages that may scaffold the evolution of multicellular complexity.

Here, we ask how the physical size of multicellular groups affects their ability to compete for resources, focusing on marine bacteria that degrade organic matter. These bacteria compete for resources ranging from nanoscale dissolved organic matter to millimeter-scale particles. Using a theory of size-dependent fluid encounters, we identify a regime where resource encounters depend on group size. Experiments with the group-forming marine bacteria Vibrio splendidus12B01 support the prediction that larger groups encounter resources more frequently. However, analysis of per-capita resource allocation reveals a trade-off: group size is inversely related to both the mean and variance of per-capita encounters. Cells in groups obtain fewer resources per cell than single cells, but experience more consistent encounters, sheltering them from large fluctuations in resource acquisition. Stochastic simulations support this tradeoff and predict a broad range of conditions in which consistency enables multicellular groups to out-compete or coexist with single cells. Our findings suggest that group formation is a potentially widespread but overlooked strategy for resource competition in marine heterotrophic bacteria, shaped by biophysical constraints on resource encounters.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here we used metagenomics to study microbial functions and quantified growth rates using isotope labelling across seven sites in Britain, each with restored, degraded, and near-natural peatlands. We found that growth rates in restored treatments were comparable to the near-natural, but were significantly higher in degraded. This growth rate reduction in restored peatlands was dependent on the scale of degradation and the length of restoration, and was underpinned by a shift towards energetically less favourable metabolic pathways such as anaerobic respiration, fermentation, and carbon fixation. A peatland ecosystem health index estimated based on measurements of peat moisture, oxygen, pH, organic matter chemistry, and moss cover, explained a significant amount of variation in microbial ecophysiology across the gradient. We demonstrate that microbial ecophysiology changes with peatland ecosystem health in a predictable manner.

Finally, we present SWIFT as an evolutionarily conserved domain that serves as a universal binding platform for diverse TFs, suggesting approaches for modulation of cell type and disease-specific transcription.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first haplotype-resolved, chromosome-level genomes for four species of Diamesa (Diptera: Chironomidae), a genus of cold-adapted midges inhabiting glacial and high-altitude freshwater ecosystems. Using PacBio HiFi sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding, we assembled high-quality genomes with chromosome-level resolution and high k-mer completeness. Phylogenomic analyses support Diamesinae as sister to other Chironomidae except Podonominae, and genomic comparisons provide evidence for introgression between the evolutionary distinct D. hyperborea and D. tonsa. Comparative genomic analyses across 20 Diptera species revealed significant gene family contractions in Diamesa associated with oxygen transport and metabolism, suggesting adaptations to high-altitude, low-oxygen environments. Conversely, expansions were detected in histone-related and Toll-like receptor gene families, likely enhancing chromatin remodeling and immune regulation under cold stress. A single gene family encoding glucose dehydrogenase was significantly expanded across all cold-adapted species studied, implicating its role in cryoprotectant synthesis and oxidative stress mitigation. Notably, Diamesa species exhibit the largest gene family contraction at any node, with minimal overlap in expansions with other cold-adapted Diptera, indicating lineage-specific adaptation. Our findings support the hypothesis that genome size condensation and selective gene family changes underpin survival in cold environments. These genome assemblies represent a valuable resource for investigating adaptation, speciation, and conservation in cold-specialist insects. Future work integrating gene expression and population genomics will further illuminate the evolutionary resilience of Diamesa in a warming world.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

However, identifying low-PA mutants in large populations requires a cost-effective, accurate, and high-throughput screening method. Gao et al. (2007) developed a colorimetric method that is cost-effective and accurate for quantifying PA in soybeans. However, the throughput of this method was relatively low. In this study, we modified some critical steps of the original protocol to improve throughput. The accuracy and reproducibility of the modified protocol were validated by comparison with those of the original method and a commercially available PA quantification kit. The new high-throughput protocol showed high reproducibility and successfully distinguished existing low-PA mutants from their wild-type parent. The protocol was then used to screen 202 accessions from a pea diversity panel, which revealed wide genetic variation in PA content. We identified two novel low-PA accessions, JI0383 and JI3253, with 69% and 48% reductions in PA, respectively, compared to the population mean. This cost-effective method is expected to help researchers and breeders accelerate the development of low-PA crops to meet the current demands for high-quality plant-based foods.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

It is unclear whether isohydric behavior leads to smaller reversible diurnal stem shrinkage (i.e. greater nocturnal stem rehydration) during drought and a lower drought sensitivity of radial growth compared to anisohydric behavior. With synchronous high-resolution sap flow and dendrometer measurements in mature anisohydric European beech and isohydric Douglas fir trees in pure and mixed stands, we quantified declines in stem water content (SWC), stem rehydration, sap flow and radial growth during soil dry-down and determined the critical soil moisture levels (expressed as Relative Extractable Water, REW) and elapsed desiccation time until 30-90% reductions in these traits. Sap flow and growth started to decline in both species at REW ~0.6, preceding declines in stem rehydration. Water-spending Douglas fir approached 50% drops in SWC, sap flow, stem rehydration and growth during soil dry-down faster than beech, indicating higher drought sensitivity. In mixture, both species reached these reduction levels later than in monoculture, suggesting positive mixing effects on the species drought resistance.

Every feasible metabolic state of a community can be expressed as a combination of these elementary vectors.

A.", "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is critical for clearance of circulating triglycerides and for tissue fatty acid supply. LPL is primarily synthesized and secreted by adipocytes into the interstitium and must traffic from there to the abluminal/basolateral side of capillary endothelial cells. There, LPL binds glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein 1, GPIHBP1, which stabilizes the protein and facilitates its movement across the endothelial cells to the luminal side where it functions in hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglycerides. Importance of LPL traffic is supported by findings that rare mutations in GPIHBP1 cause hypertriglyceridemia. However our understanding of how LPL is secreted by adipocytes and traffics to endothelial cells is incomplete. Here we examined the possibility that secretion and traffic of adipocyte LPL might involve generation of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs/exosomes) which often mediate cell-cell communication. Proteomic analysis of sEVs secreted by adipocytes showed them enriched in LPL. To study LPL secretion and transfer we generated human derived pre-adipocytes (HPA) that stably express tagged LPL (FLAG and His epitopes). LPL pulldown and sEV isolation from HPA conditioned media documented that greater than 70% of secreted LPL is present in sEVs. The mechanism for LPL secretion in sEVs was found to involve the ESCRT-independent neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) pathway, as treatment with the nSMase2 inhibitor GW4869 reduced secretion by 80%. The above observations were reproduced using highly sensitive nanoparticle flow cytometry. The sEV associated LPL has lipolytic activity and it is released by heparin addition indicating it is on the sEV surface. In addition, using human derived microvascular endothelial cells with stable lentiviral expression of GPIHBP1 we show that LPL positive sEVs transfer LPL to these cells, but not to control cells without GPIHBP1. Our findings suggest that sEV formation by nSMase2 controls adipocyte LPL secretion and traffic, that sEVs protect LPL activity and facilitate LPL transfer to GPIHBP1 on endothelial cells.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

A potential key driver of reproductive isolation is mate choice, a behavioural mechanism that can limit gene flow based on divergence in signal traits. While the genetic basis of mating signal traits has been extensively studied, the contribution of epigenetic modifications to their variation remains underexplored, leaving the role of DNA methylation in mate choice unclear. Here, we focus on epigenetic variation and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the latter being chemical traits used for mate choice in insects. Specifically, we investigate the association between DNA methylation and regions associated with CHC variation in Timema cristinae stick insects. We integrate analyses of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between individuals from different host-plant ecotypes with genomic sequencing and phenotypic data on CHCs. We find that DMRs are significantly enriched in genetic loci associated with CHCs, suggesting a non-random relationship between DNA methylation and loci associated with these signal traits. While further work is required to clarify causality, our results highlight the potential for epigenetic marks to be associated with traits involved in mate choice. Future studies should thus aim to establish causal links between DNA methylation and signal trait variation, which would clarify the contribution of methylation to mate choice, prezygotic isolation, and ultimately, speciation.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Most extant eukaryotes inherit mitochondria from a single parent, but the mechanisms enforcing uniparental inheritance vary widely. Yet, because the first eukaryotes would not have evolved such mechanisms, sexual cell fusion would have inherently led to mitochondrial mixing. Here, we explore the evolutionary consequences of biparental inheritance of endosymbionts during host-symbiont co-evolution using a multilevel, individual-based model of endosymbiosis. Our results show that biparental inheritance introduces evolutionary conflict, as it facilitates the spread of fast-replicating symbionts, which can drive host populations to extinction. However, in a diverse environment, holobionts diversify and adapt to distinct niches, protecting the population from total collapse caused by selfish symbionts. Moreover, this conflict can be resolved through the evolution of signaling mechanisms that allow hosts to regulate symbiont cell cycles. In many cases, sexually reproducing populations not only survive but also outperform their asexual counterparts. We conclude that sexual reproduction could have appeared early during eukaryogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Adopting a comparative pangenomics approach, we performed a phylogenetically structured study on the diversity and evolution of the carotovoricin, the only tailocin present in the Pectobacterium species. We discovered that the carotovoricin biosynthesis gene cluster was domesticated by the ancestor of the Pectobacterium genus, and its overall retention and purifying selection indicate its significance in bacterial community interactions. We identified differential conservation within the carotovoricin locus with exceptional variability and phylogenetic discord in the genes encoding the tail fibers, known to play a major role in host range specificity. We identified an evolutionary mechanism involving recombination-mediated exchange of these tail fiber genes across the Pectobacterium genus, which complements the existing DNA sequence inversion mechanism to achieve tailocin polymorphism.

Cryo-EM reconstructions of the NVL hexameric assembly reveal two MM17 docking sites adjacent to resistance mutations. NVL inhibition by MM17 arrests 60S biogenesis in the nucleolus and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis through both MDM2/p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, without causing DNA damage.

Here, we discover a likely effector deubiquitinase (DUB) of the otubain subgroup from the human pathogenic microsporidian Encephalitozoon hellem, which we designate ehOTUB1. We find that ehOTUB1 selectively binds the human ubiquitin conjugating (E2) enzyme UBE2K and inhibits its ubiquitin conjugation activity independent of ehOTUB1 DUB activity. We show that ehOTUB1 obstructs docking of UBE2K onto ubiquitin E1 enzyme via steric conflict with ubiquitin in the E1 adenylation site to prevent ubiquitin transfer to UBE2K.

It identifies orthologous genes by searching a sample's protein sequences against a Hidden Markov Models marker set, containing single-copy orthologs, retrieved from the BUSCO database. In the final step, users can choose between consensus and concatenation strategies to construct the species tree from the aligned orthologs. Phyling efficiently resolves large phylogenies by optimizing memory usage and data processing. Its checkpoint system enables users to incrementally add or remove samples without repeating the entire search process. For analyses involving closely related taxa, Phyling supports the use of nucleotide coding sequences, which may capture phylogenetic signals missed by protein sequences. The benchmark results show that Phyling substantially runs faster than OrthoFinder, a Reciprocal Best Hit based method, while achieving equal or better accuracy.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Integrative genomic and transcriptomic profiling confirmed EZH2 overexpression. Disruption of the PRC2 complex was evident through mislocalization and reduced expression of SUZ12, a core component. EZH2 overexpression correlated with upregulation of mitotic regulators such as AURKB and Ki67 in human HB gene expression analysis as compared to background liver. Targeted sequencing identified variants of uncertain significance in EZH2 and SUZ12 in 11 of 11 patient tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 with EPZ-6438 reduced proliferation and sensitized HB cells to cisplatin through gene regulation, potentially modulating platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, EZH2 promotes HB progression through epigenetic silencing and noncanonical signaling pathways.

While some studies suggest SGLT2 presence and its involvement in glucagon regulation, others deny its expression in alpha cells. To clarify this dispute, we investigated the functional effects of highly selective SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, on glucose uptake, intracellular ATP levels, and glucagon secretion in alpha-TC1 cells, a widely used model for glucagon-secreting cells in culture. The SGLT2 inhibitors significantly suppressed basal glucose uptake in alpha-TC1 cells, indicating functional SGLT2 presence. However, the inhibitors did not affect glucagon secretion. Neither the SGLT2 inhibitors nor the more potent glucose transport inhibitor, cytochalasin B, altered intracellular ATP levels or glucagon secretion. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of K/ATP channels increased glucagon secretion without affecting glucose uptake or ATP levels. These results suggest that while SGLT2 is functionally present at low levels and mediates basal glucose uptake in alpha-TC1 cells, its inhibition has insufficient influence on intracellular ATP levels, and therefore glucagon secretion remains stable. Furthermore, our observations support predominant involvement of K/ATP channels in regulating glucagon secretion. Further studies in human purified pancreatic alpha cells in addition to islets are warranted to fully elucidate SGLT2's role in alpha-cell physiology.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

AdNrip1KO mice are less cold sensitive but showed no differences in whole body energy expenditure or food intake compared to control mice at room temperature. Strikingly, AdNrip1KO mice on HFD display markedly attenuated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance compared to control mice on HFD.

However, the receptor for B7-H4 and the molecular mechanisms underlying its immunoinhibitory effects remain poorly understood. In this study, using peritoneal immune cells from mice adoptively transferred with OVA-expressing tumor cells and OVA-specific OT-1 T cells, we identified Galectin-9 (Gal-9) as a binding partner for B7-H4 and elucidated its role in modulating T cell responses through this interaction. We demonstrated that glycosylation in the IgC domain of B7-H4 is required for its binding to Gal-9; while the N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (N-CRD) of Gal-9, including the R65 residue in the N-CRD, is essential for this interaction. Additionally, we found that other B7 family members (B7.1, B7.2, B7-H2, and B7-DC) and immune cell surface receptors (CD28, 2B4, CD226, and SLAMF1) also bind to Gal-9 at comparable levels to B7-H4 and T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 3 (TIM-3). In vitro functional assays revealed that B7-H4 inhibits Gal-9-induced activation of CD28 downstream signaling and reduces Gal-9-mediated T cell death. In vivo, Gal-9 deficiency in mice resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of splenic CD4+ T cells, whereas B7-H4 deficiency exhibited no observable phenotype. Furthermore, B7-H4 and Gal-9 double-knockout mice displayed no additional phenotype differences compared to Gal-9 single-knockout mice. Notably, tumor growth following tumor cell challenge was unaffected in all three knockout models (Gal-9 single-, B7-H4 single-, or double-knockout). Collectively, these findings suggest that B7-H4, other B7 family members, Gal-9, and T cell surface immune receptors form a complex regulatory network that modulates T cell activity and anti-tumor responses, although no single member exerts a major effect.

This study examines how the amount and within-plant damage variability (i.e., damage uniformity within the plant canopy) affect EFN production and ant-mediated defence in wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Previous work suggests that severe and concentrated damage is costliest to plants, leading us to hypothesize that such damage would induce greater EFN production and, consequently, stronger ant attraction and protection. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which plants were subjected to one of the following mechanical damage treatments: control (no damage), low damage (two damaged leaves, 30% of area removed each), high concentrated damage (two damaged leaves, 60% each), and high dispersed damage (four damaged leaves, 30% each; i.e., same total area than concentrated). The day after treatments, we measured EFN volume and sugar content from one nectary per plant (a measure of per-nectary EFN response), and the number of secreting nectaries per plant (a proxy for whole-plant level EFN response). Subsequently, we performed a field experiment using the same treatments to evaluate EFN-mediated ant recruitment and ant-provided protection by placing caterpillars on plants. Both high-damage treatments increased EFN volume per nectary, whereas low damage did not. However, dispersed damage was the only treatment that increased the number of secreting nectaries. In the field, plants with dispersed damage recruited more ants and exhibited a higher probability of caterpillar attack by ants. Contrary to expectations, plants subjected to dispersed damage exhibited a greater total investment in EFN, presumably via local induction of more nectaries, enhancing ant-mediated defence. This study highlights the importance of herbivory intensity and uniformity patterns in shaping ant-plant interactions.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Considering financial and logistical constraints, the reliability of research outputs is shaped by key decisions regarding study duration (how long should each individual be tracked?), sampling frequency (how often should new locations be collected?), and how many individuals should be tracked. To maximize their conservation value, studies must avoid biased estimates of key parameters related to movement behavior and space use, as this can lead to wasted resources and misguided management actions. To address these challenges, we propose a workflow for determining the optimal sample sizes for population-level inferences in movement ecology, explicitly addressing the trade-offs between sampling duration (T), sampling interval (reciprocal of frequency; {triangleup}t), and population sample size (m). While a priori study design is considered best practice, this workflow can be applied at multiple stages, including concurrent with data collection, or as a post hoc evaluation. By selecting robust methods that are sampling-insensitive, and by quantifying and propagating uncertainty through downstream analyses, we can determine whether our sample sizes (both at the individual- and population-level) are sufficient to yield robust population-level inferences, such as mean home range area or mean movement speed. Furthermore, researchers can integrate additional logistical constraints such as fix success rate, location error, and potential device malfunctions, while also accounting for individual variation. We illustrate potential applications of this workflow through empirically-guided simulations. To facilitate its use and implementation, we incorporated this workflow into the user-friendly `movedesign` R Shiny application. This application enables researchers to easily test different sampling strategies, and as of version 0.3.2, integrates population-level analytical targets.

While various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, the mechanical impact of electrode tip geometry has not been adequately quantified, and most existing evaluations predominantly rely on subjective assessments. To address this gap with a quantitative, mechanics-based framework, the current study aimed to identify an optimized electrode tip geometry that minimizes mechanical stress on the scalp even under tilted contact conditions. Finite element analysis was conducted using strain energy density (SED)- a mechanical index known to correlate with neural impulse activity- as a quantitative indicator of the mechanical influence of tip geometry on the skin. Six types of electrode tip geometries, ranging from flat to hemispherical, were defined based on the ratio of fillet radius to prong radius. These geometries were analyzed under inclination angles from 0 degrees to 5 degrees, and their peak SED values were compared. Additionally, a geometry optimization using an iterative search algorithm was performed to minimize peak SED under the 5 degrees tillt. The findings revealed that intermediate fillet geometries with gently rounded edges more effectively reduce peak SED under inclined conditions. Optimization further identified a geometry ratio of R* rate = 0.61875 as the most effective tip geometry for minimizing mechanical loading under the specified conditions.

Here, we use Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface as well-defined experimental models to study the local molecular organization of mRNA adsorbed to lipid layers.

The experiments provide detailed insights into the structure of the adsorbed layers as well as the fractions of all molecular moieties contributing to the interfacial electrostatic balance, specifically phosphates from RNA, phosphates from phospholipids in the monolayer, and elemental counterions. The mRNA forms discrete electron-dense layers tightly bound to the lipid membrane, where cationic ions accumulate at the interface together with the mRNA. This leads to an excess of anionic nucleotides relative to cationic lipids at the interface, which is more pronounced in the presence of divalent compared to monovalent cations.

We hypothesized that the adipocyte progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), from neonates of women with obesity would exhibit a differential activation of the SIRT2-FOXO1-PPARG pathway, which is crucial in the regulation of early adipogenesis. In this study we isolated Whartons jelly-derived MSCs from neonates of women with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2, OB-MSCs) and women with normal-weight (BMI <25 kg/m2, NW-MSCS) and induced them towards in vitro adipogenesis. OB-MSCs showed higher levels of FOXO1 and lower levels of acetyl-FOXO1 compared to NW-MSCs (p<0.05) and differential regulation of these proteins during early adipogenesis of OB-MSCs versus NW-MSCs (p<0.05). Further, acetyl-FOXO1 was higher in the cytoplasm as compared to NW-MSCs upon day 2 of adipogenesis (p<0.05). Finally, we found higher PPARG gene expression in OB-MSCs adipocytes compared with NW-MSCs adipocytes at day 21 of differentiation (p<0.05), denoting higher adipogenic potential.

While Shank3 deficiency has been extensively studied in forebrain regions, its role in the cerebellum, a brain area increasingly implicated in ASD pathobiology, remains comparatively underexplored. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) exhibit high Shank3 expression. However, its role in cerebellar glutamatergic synapses is poorly understood.

Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings from CGCs in ex vivo cerebellar brain slices from adult (4-6 months old) wild type (WT) and homozygous Shank3{triangleup}ex4-22 KO were performed to record miniature, evoked, and glutamate uncaged responses. Similarly, the current-voltage (I-V) relationship was analyzed with intracellular spermine and pharmacological validation of calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) was done by IEM-1460. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for microglia using IBA1 labeling. We found a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude and AMPAR-mediated response to glutamate uncaging, which indicates that the loss of Shank3 enhances postsynaptic AMPAR function. Furthermore, the KO group showed faster AMPAR decay kinetics, inward rectification, and increased sensitivity to IEM-1460, suggesting that a high proportion of CP-AMPARs with distinct biophysical properties are present at the MF-CGC synapse. Furthermore, KO mice showed less ramified microglia suggesting the possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellar cortex. Together, these findings highlight a critical role of Shank3 in maintaining the balance between CP- and CI-AMPARs at the MF-CGC synapse, which is essential for synapse maturation and proper cerebellar circuitry function. Dysregulation of this balance, with possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellum, may underscore cerebellar-related behavioral deficits in Shank3 KO mice and may suggest a potential mechanism contributing to ASD pathophysiology.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

S. C.; Kalidas, N.; Roychowdhury, S.; Chattopadhyay, K.; Ashish, F.; Sinha, B.; Ganguly, D.", "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are specialized innate immune cells which play a pivotal role in antiviral immunity by producing large quantities of type I interferons (IFNs) upon sensing nucleic acids via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) such as CpGA and CpGB, both containing unmethylated CpG motifs, are commonly used experimental TLR9 agonists. Interestingly, CpGA and CpGB elicit markedly different responses in pDCs - CpGA induces robust IFN-alpha production, whereas CpGB does not. The mechanistic basis underlying this ligand-specific functional divergence has remained unclear. Here, we identify PIEZO1, a mechanosensory ion channel, as a critical determinant of ligand-specific IFN responses in human primary pDCs. We demonstrate that unlike CpGB, CpGA self-associates into larger aggregates that generate membrane tension during cellular uptake, leading to activation of PIEZO1. This activation triggers localized calcium influx and cytoskeletal remodeling, resulting in the formation of local F-actin structures that retain CpGA within early endosomes enabling sustained IRF7 nuclear translocation and robust type I IFN production. Disruption of PIEZO1 or actin polymerization abrogates CpGA-induced IFN production, while pharmacological activation of Piezo1 enhances IFN production in response to CpGB. Thus, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized biophysical checkpoint in nucleic acid sensing, wherein membrane tension is transduced via PIEZO1 into spatially controlled TLR9 signaling. Overall, our study establishes PIEZO1 mechanosensing at the plasma membrane as a key regulatory event in nucleic acid-induced immunity, with different functional outcomes based on the cargo structure, opening potential new avenues for modulating type I IFN responses in infection and autoimmunity.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Chemical communication is one of the most important capabilities of zooplankton, yet it remains understudied. We report observations of marine parasitic isopods Gnathia marleyi and coral larvae Orbicella faveolata in an aquatic olfactometer where individuals can respond to chemical signals from host fish species and crustose coralline algae, respectively. We complement these observations with a gradient search model inspired by the theory of Braitenberg vehicles. The mathematical model allows the agent to switch between periods of motion and periods of rest, guided by the behavior of G. marleyi. We further implement a temporary coupling of the agent to the signal gradient, interspersed with periods of seemingly aimless wandering. We find a favorable comparison between the experimental and simulated trajectories. This study gives us further insight on the chemosensory behavior of ecologically important marine invertebrates using novel instrumentation and methodology and is the first to attempt to model the chemosensory behavior of these two groups of aquatic invertebrates. Further research should seek to observe and model their behavior in three-dimensional space.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "RADIALIS origin and expression suggest ancestral function in female organs of seed plants", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.30.667799", "authors": "Sengupta, A.; Howarth, D. G.", "abstract": "Premise of the study: Pairs of protein homologs may participate in competitive interactions to define morphology. How these competitive pairs evolve, whether they evolve repeatedly, and how they affect the origin of novel features are open questions. Ovules/seeds are a major innovation in plants, a trait that evolved in the ancestor of all seed plants. Within seed plants, flowers and fruits are synapomorphies arising within angiosperms, while gymnosperms retain the ancestral absence of these structures. RADIALIS and DIVARICATA are two MYB homologs whose competitive interaction is involved in fruit/carpel development and flower symmetry. RADIALIS have a protein-binding domain, but DIVARICATA have an additional DNA-binding domain. Methods: We reconstructed the phylogenetic history of these genes with a Bayesian approach. We tested the expression of these genes in Ginkgo biloba with real-time PCR. Key results: We demonstrate that DIVARICATA genes underwent two rounds of duplications at the base of vascular plants forming three clades: DIV-A, DIV-B, and DIV-C. We show that RADIALIS homologs evolved only once: from DIV-C at the base of seed plants, mediated by a premature stop codon likely generated by a single-base substitution. We surveyed the expression pattern of these genes for the first time in a gymnosperm, Ginkgo biloba. We find that Ginkgo biloba RADIALIS genes often have higher expression in ovules. This is consistent with the expression and function of RADIALIS in angiosperm carpels. Conclusions: Our work provides suggestive evidence that the evolution of seed habit may be associated with the origin of the silencing peptide RADIALIS.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we present T2T-YAO v2.0, a nearly perfect diploid genome assembly for a Han Chinese individual. We first developed Sufficient Alignment Support (SAS), a sensitive alignment-based metric that identifies both structural and base-level assembly erroneous windows by quantifying inadequate read support across sequencing platforms. Unlike conventional methods that detect erroneous k-mers (e.g., Merqury) or inconsistencies between assemblies and aligned reads from single platform, SAS integrates supportive information from various platform and avoids false positives caused by sequencing bias and artificial alignments. Employing a \"Structural Error-first\" polishing strategy, prioritizing structural error correction using ultra-long Oxford Nanopore reads, we iteratively refined the assembly with high-accuracy PacBio and Element sequencing data. This approach eliminates all detectable structural and non-homopolymer-related base-level errors outside ribosomal DNA clusters. The final T2T-YAO v2.0 assembly exhibits complete non-split ONT read coverage and free of erroneous 21-mers outside sequencing data, representing an error-free human genome by Merqury standards. Our results not only highlight the limitations of current genome quality assessment methods but also provide a roadmap for constructing high-fidelity diploid references essential for precision medicine and genome-based diagnostics.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}

Yet, directly observing these transient, non-equilibrium states under physiological conditions remains challenging. Here, we introduce NEXT-FRET (Non-Equilibrium miXTure modeling of smFRET), a solution-based single-molecule FRET (smFRET) platform integrating accessible instrumentation and a time-variant Gaussian Mixture Model (tvGMM) to identify folding intermediates without microfluidics, surface tethering, or denaturants. Using maltose-binding protein (MBP) and its biologically relevant precursor (pre-MBP) for benchmarking and validation, we uncover previously elusive intermediates, including a long-hypothesized closed conformation undetected by existing single-molecule and ensemble methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chaperones modulate folding landscapes by stabilizing distinct intermediates, some effectively arresting folding progression; a mechanism increasingly recognized as a therapeutic strategy for targeted protein inactivation. Broadly applicable beyond folding, NEXT-FRET provides a generalizable, high-resolution analytical method for resolving transient biomolecular intermediates, offering a screening-compatible platform in biotechnology and elucidating proteostasis collapse in conformational diseases.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": ""}
