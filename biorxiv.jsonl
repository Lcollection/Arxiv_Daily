Although Zika virus (ZIKV) had been detected in humans as early as the 1950s, its reemergence in South America in 2015 resulted in a global health crisis. While flaviviruses encode 10 proteins that can be post-translationally modified by host enzymes, little is known regarding post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the flavivirus proteome. We used mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify host-driven PTMs on the ZIKV proteome. This approach allowed us to identify 43 PTMs across 8 ZIKV proteins, including several that are highly conserved within the Flavivirus genus. Notably, we found two phosphosites on the ZIKV envelope protein that are functionally important for viral propagation. Both appear to regulate viral budding, while one also impacts ZIKV cytopathogenicity. Additionally, we discovered host kinases that interact with ZIKV proteins and determined that Bosutinib--an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets some of these host kinases--impairs ZIKV growth, in part by blocking phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on the envelope protein. Thus, we have defined a high-resolution map of host-driven PTMs on ZIKV proteins as well as cellular interacting kinases, uncovered novel mechanisms of host driven-regulation of ZIKV budding and cytopathogenicity, and identified an FDA-approved inhibitor of ZIKV growth.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

However, progress has been hampered by inconsistent methodological reporting and challenges comparing in vitro systems with in vivo observations. We previously established a unique method for long-term 2-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mouse IECs using an air-liquid interface (ALI) technique which appears to faithfully recapitulate homeostatic and regenerative features in vitro. Here, we further refined these methods and optimized protocols for long-term, self-organizing 2D cultivation of human IECs. During the culture, we observed that epithelial cells undergo a dynamic morphological transition from squamous to columnar shape. Using single cell transcriptomics, we identified both major lineages and minor populations, including enteroendocrine cells, tuft cells, and BEST4/CA7+ cells. Leveraging the power and scalability of a biomedical foundation model (BMFM) trained on single cell RNA sequencing data, we performed classification tasks to identify cell types across sample sources and to quantitatively benchmark our in vitro differentiated cells against cells collected from patient biopsies. We observed a striking degree of similarity between our in vitro differentiated cells and the corresponding cell types in vivo for multiple differentiated lineages. This novel approach using BMFM holds promise to expand our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms including gene-gene regulation underlying homeostasis and regeneration as well as the functions of rare and poorly understood lineages within the human intestinal epithelia. Moreover, these methods are generalizable to other organs and can be used to assess the correspondence of cells across experimental modalities.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data revealed that human and mouse mIDH1 glioma neurospheres have downregulated gene ontologies (GOs) related to mitochondrial metabolism and upregulated GOs related to autophagy. Decreased mitochondrial metabolism was accompanied by decreased glycolysis, rendering autophagy a source of energy in mIDH1 gliomas. Human and mouse mutant IDH1 glioma cells exhibited increased expression of pULK1-S555 and enhanced LC3 I/II conversion, indicating augmented autophagy. Additionally, scRNA-seq data from human mIDH1 astrocytoma patients samples showed decreased mitochondrial metabolism and increased autophagy. We further demonstrate that inhibiting autophagy in vivo by systemic administration of synthetic protein nanoparticles encapsulating siRNA targeting Atg7 sensitized mIDH1 glioma cells to radiation-induced cell death, resulting in tumor regression, long-term survival, and immunological memory. In summary, our work uncovered that autophagy is a critical pathway for survival in mIDH1 gliomas and by blocking this pathway we can elicit radiosensitivity in vitro in human and mouse mIDH1 glioma cells, and in vivo in genetically engineered mouse models.

A.", "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics are linked to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The adherens junction (AJ) and signaling protein {beta}-catenin has decreased abundance at high pHi due to increased proteasomal-mediated degradation. However, the effects of low pHi on {beta}-catenin abundance and function have not been characterized. Here, we use population-level and single-cell assays to show that low pHi stabilizes {beta}-catenin, increasing junctional, cytoplasmic, and nuclear abundance. We assayed single-cell protein degradation rates to show that {beta}-catenin half-life is longer at low pHi and shorter at high pHi compared to control. Importantly, a constitutively stabilized and pHi-insensitive {beta}-catenin mutant ({beta}-catenin-H36R), has a longer and pHi-independent half-life. We also determined that the pH-dependent stability of {beta}-catenin affects both its adhesion and signaling functions. We show that the composition of AJs changes with pHi; at low pHi, E-cadherin-containing AJs are enriched in {beta}-catenin while plakoglobin abundance is reduced. Conversely, when {beta}-catenin is lost from E-cadherin-containing AJs at high pHi, plakoglobin is increased. We also found that cell area was reduced at low pHi and increased at high pHi compared to control while cell volume was unaffected, suggesting pHi alters cell-cell adhesion. Finally, we show that low pHi increases {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity in single cells and is indistinguishable from a Wnt-on state, while high pHi reduces {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity compared to control cells. This work characterizes pHi as a true rheostat regulating {beta}-catenin abundance, stability, and function, solidifying {beta}-catenin as a molecular mediator of pHi-dependent cell processes via pH-dependent adhesion and signaling functions.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Using human neuronal and microglial cell lines, we found that microglia exhibit higher lysosomal turnover, particularly through lysophagy, whereas neuronal lysosomes display compromised degradative capacity and impaired autophagic flux. This deficiency results in less efficient degradation of aggregates in neurons. Moreover, perturbation of autophagy enhances TNT-mediated transfer of aggregate from neuronal cells to microglia. In contrast, microglia co-cultured with -Syn-containing neurons upregulate autophagy flux, enabling efficient degradation of the transferred aggregates. These findings were further validated using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived neurons and microglia.

A.; DeNardo, L. A.", "abstract": "To survive, animals must rapidly learn to avoid predictable threats. Such learning depends on detecting reliable cue-outcome relationships that efficiently drive behavioral adaptations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates learned information about the environment to guide adaptive behaviors and is critical for threat avoidance. However, as most studies have focused on well-learned threat avoidance strategies, the specific inputs that signal avoidability and drive rapid avoidance learning remain poorly understood. Dopamine (DA) inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) potently modulate prefrontal function and are preferentially engaged by aversive stimuli. Previous studies implicated VTA and prefrontal DA in aversive learning, but their findings have been constrained by limited spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we used high-resolution tools to dissect the role of the VTA-mPFC DA circuit in rapid avoidance learning. Optogenetic suppression of VTA DA terminals in mPFC selectively impaired learning of a cued avoidance response, without affecting cue-shock association learning, reactive escape behaviors, or expression of previously learned avoidance. Using a fluorescent DA sensor, we observe rapid, event-locked DA activity that emerged transiently during the initiation of learning. Increased DA encoded aversive outcomes and their predictive cues, while decreased DA encoded their omission and predicted how quickly mice learned to avoid. In yoked mice lacking control over shock omission, these dynamics were largely absent. Together, these findings demonstrate that the VTA-mPFC DA circuit is necessary for rapid acquisition of proactive avoidance behaviors and reveal transient event-related DA signals that underlie this form of learning.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

K.; Dionne, U.; Bradley, D.; Landry, C. R.", "abstract": "In signaling networks, protein-protein interactions are often mediated by modular domains that bind short linear motifs. The motifs' sequences affect many factors, among them affinity and specificity, or the ability to bind strongly and to the appropriate partners. Using Deep Mutational Scanning to create a mutant library, and protein complementation assays to measure protein-protein interactions, we determined the in vivo binding strength of a library of mutants of a binding motif on the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2, which binds the SH3 domain of the osmosensor protein Sho1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These measurements were made using the full-length endogenous proteins, in their native cellular environment. We find that along with residues within the canonical motif, many mutations in the residues neighboring the motif also modulate binding strength. Interestingly, all Pbs2 mutations which increase affinity are situated outside of the Pbs2 region that interacts with the canonical SH3 binding pocket, suggesting that other surfaces on Sho1 contribute to binding. We use predicted structures to hypothesize a model of binding which involves residues neighboring the canonical Pbs2 motif binding outside of the canonical SH3 binding pocket. We compared this predicted structure with known structures of SH3 domains binding peptides through residues outside of the motif, and put forth possible mechanisms through which Pbs2 can bind specifically to Sho1. We propose that for certain SH3 domain-motif pairs, affinity and specificity are determined by a broader range of sequences than what has previously been considered, potentially allowing easier differentiation between otherwise similar partners.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

We then demonstrated that CrHCF244 is required for psbA translation in the alga, consistent with the function of HCF244 in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis HCF244 gene also partially complemented the algal mutant. These results experimentally support the functional conservation of the homologs in green algae and land plants. Intriguingly, the CrHCF244 mutant also exhibited a relatively high rate of suppressor mutants, pointing to the presence of alternative factor(s)/pathway(s) for D1 translation control.

We present Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cells (MPAC), a computational framework that interprets multi-omic data through prior knowledge from biological pathways. MPAC leverages network relationships encoded in pathways through a factor graph to infer consensus activity levels for proteins and associated pathway entities from multi-omic data, runs permutation testing to eliminate spurious activity predictions, and groups biological samples by pathway activities to allow identifying and prioritizing proteins with potential clinical relevance, e.g., associated with patient prognosis. Using DNA copy number alteration and RNA-seq data from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as an example, we demonstrate that MPAC predicts a patient subgroup related to immune responses not identified by analysis with either input omic data type alone. Key proteins identified via this subgroup have pathway activities related to clinical outcome as well as immune cell compositions.

Path selection, and consequent therapeutic success, is driven by the fitness cost and resistance benefit of emerging mutations. Applying this framework, we independently modulated bNAb resistance or the fitness cost of escape mutants, resulting in enhanced efficacy of VIT.

C. C.; Kerr, J.", "abstract": "Climate change may introduce conditions beyond species' tolerances; to survive, species must avoid these extremes. Phenological shifts are one strategy, as species move their activity or life history events in time to avoid extreme conditions. Species may also shift in space, moving their ranges poleward to escape extremes. However, whether species are more likely to exhibit one or both strategies, and whether this can be predicted based on a species' functional traits, is unknown. Using a powerful macroecological dataset of European and North American odonate observations, we assessed range and phenology shifts between two time periods (1980-2002 and 2008-2018) to measure the strength and direction of the association between responses. Species with the greatest poleward range shifts also showed the largest phenological shifts toward earlier annual activity periods, with half of all species shifting in both space and time. This response was consistent across continents, despite highly divergent land use and biogeographical histories in these regions. Surprisingly, species' range and phenology shifts were not related to functional traits; rather, southern species shifted their range limits more strongly, while increasing temperature variability hindered range shifts. By reducing risk through phenological shifts, the resulting larger populations may be more likely to disperse and expand species' ranges. While species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, we identified a small number of species (approximately 10%) that failed to shift at all; these species are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Inbreeding is more likely in species with limited dispersal, such as cooperative breeders where non-parental individuals-often offspring from previous broods-provide parental care and frequently breed close to home. We leverage 32 years of data from a population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), an avian cooperative breeder, to investigate whether mate choice, and its lifetime fitness outcomes, affects inbreeding tolerance. We find that both sexes show shorter dispersal distances than expected under a random mating scenario. While female-biased dispersal mitigates inbreeding risk when pairing for the first time, limited movement away from the breeding territory by both sexes for later pairings (following mate death or divorce) results in higher relatedness between mates than expected under random mating. Males paired with close relatives and females that move longer distances experience equivalently reduced lifetime reproductive success. Fitness benefits of breeding site fidelity and relatively low fitness costs of inbreeding thus permit inbreeding tolerance in Florida Scrub-Jays.

Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from E.coli to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and dissolving in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent dissolution or spontaneous aggregation, respectively.

Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects.

The constrained structure and intramolecular cooperativity of tRNA complicate understanding of how it modulates codon-anticodon stability and whether it affects selection kinetics beyond codon recognition. To address these questions, we engineered functional split-tRNAs bearing a dangling anticodon in place of the anticodon loop. Our results demonstrate that split-tRNA supports in vitro translation nearly as efficiently as intact synthetic tRNA, challenging the notion that tRNA strain is essential for triggering GTP hydrolysis in response to codon recognition. Using split-tRNA architecture, we found that codon-anticodon stability is likely modulated by the dipole moments of adjacent nucleobases. Our kinetic modeling aligns with a conformational selection mechanism, where the decoding site fluctuates between open and closed states, and the correct codon-anticodon minihelix acts as an allosteric effector that permits its spontaneous closure and stabilizes the closed state.

Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only ~3 [A] and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 e per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48 - 0.65 e. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

We consistently found a pattern of within-habitat microbiome stability, with virtually no signal of gradual change in the warming period studied. The resistance to change appeared bolstered by habitat-specific dispersal processes and community-level functional redundancy, particularly via versatile carbon generalists.

We propose a novel graph representation that integrates both static structural information and dynamic correlations from molecular dynamics trajectories, enabling more comprehensive modeling of proteins.

M.; Klobusicky, J.; Hague, M.", "abstract": "Many insects and other animals host heritable endosymbionts that alter host fitness and reproduction. The prevalence of facultative endosymbionts can fluctuate in host populations across time and geography for reasons that are poorly understood. This is particularly true for maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria, which infect roughly half of all insect species. For instance, the frequencies of several wMel-like Wolbachia, including wMel in host Drosophila melanogaster, fluctuate over time in certain host populations, but the specific conditions that generate temporal variation in Wolbachia prevalence are unresolved. We implemented a discrete generation model in the new R package symbiontmodeler to evaluate how finite-population stochasticity contributes to Wolbachia fluctuations over time in simulated host populations under a variety of conditions. Using empirical estimates from natural Wolbachia-Drosophila systems, we explored how stochasticity is determined by a broad range of factors, including host population size, maternal transmission rates, and Wolbachia effects on host fitness (modeled as fecundity) and reproduction (cytoplasmic incompatibility; CI). While stochasticity generally increases when host fitness benefits and CI are relaxed, we found that a decline in the maternal transmission rate had the strongest relative impact on increasing the size of fluctuations. We infer that non- or weak-CI-causing strains like wMel, which often show evidence of imperfect maternal transmission, tend to generate larger stochastic fluctuations compared to strains that cause strong CI, like wRi in D. simulans. Additional factors, such as fluctuating host fitness effects, are required to explain the largest examples of temporal variation in Wolbachia. The conditions we simulate here using symbiontmodeler serve as a jumping off point for understanding drivers of temporal and spatial variation in the prevalence of Wolbachia, the most common endosymbionts found in nature.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding dynamics of the PHD finger and bromodomain of BPTF, both in solution and bound to either a histone H3 peptide or a full nucleosome. Our results show that BPTF adopts distinct conformational states depending on its binding context, with nucleosome engagement inducing compaction of the multidomain structure. PHD finger binding displaces the H3 tail from DNA, increasing H3 tail flexibility while promoting compensatory binding of the H4 tail to nucleosomal DNA. This redistribution of histone-DNA contacts weakens overall hydrogen bonding with DNA, suggesting localized destabilization of the nucleosome core. Despite electrostatic repulsion limiting direct reader-DNA contacts, strong Van der Waals interactions with the H3 tail stabilize binding.

This phenomenon is important to understand because climate change is projected to increase both extreme rainfall and drought. In this study, we investigated the extent to which seasonally-driven mosquito and primate behavior drove the first yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in an urban area in Brazil in nearly a century, coinciding with an equally rare drought, and to assess the role of interventions in ending the outbreak. We hypothesized that drought triggered the outbreak by driving the forest mosquitoes and non-human primates towards the city in search of water and that the mosquitoes were biting more frequently to avoid desiccation. A dynamical YFV model supports these hypotheses, showing that both behavioral changes were needed to explain the outbreak timing and incidence. Further, a combination of vector control, conservation measures, and vaccination contributed to ending the outbreak, with the strongest effects from vaccination.

Recently, more than 1,000 distinct AAV capsids were identified from human clinical samples by high-throughput, long-read DNA sequencing. In this study, we tap into this broad natural biodiversity of AAV capsids to develop liver-tropic AAV capsids. We initially screened a subset of variants derived from AAV8 (n=159) for packaging efficiency. The high-yielding variants were subjected to a barcoded vector library screen in mice and ferrets for their ability to mediate liver gene transfer. Although no variant surpassed AAV8 for liver targeting, several exhibited a liver detargeting phenotype. Among these, we focused on the N271D variant (AAV8 VP1 numbering), located in the variable region I (VR-1), which has been previously implicated in influencing liver tropism. The liver detargeting phenotype of AAV8.N271D was confirmed by single vector administration in mice. Additionally, we grafted the N271D variant onto AAV9 and MyoAAV capsids (N270D by AAV9 VP1 numbering). The AAV9.N270D and MyoAAV.N270D vectors showed a similar liver-detargeting phenotype, although muscle targeting was moderately reduced. Although we did not identify any capsid variants that outperform AAV8 in liver transduction, this study reinforces the important role of VR-1 in modulating liver tropism and highlights the potential of engineering VR-1 residues to reduce liver gene transfer and associated toxicity observed in several gene therapy studies.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Although the downregulation of ARID1B transcript levels has been observed in many cancers, the regulation of ARID1B at the protein level is comparatively less studied. Here, we identify WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel interacting partner of ARID1B. We further show that using its WW domains, WWP2 interacts with the PPxY motif within the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of ARID1B. The ability of wild-type (but not the catalytically inactive) WWP2 to modulate ARID1B protein stability was confirmed through cycloheximide chase assay. Interestingly, WWP2 appears to facilitate non-canonical K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination of ARID1B, leading to the latters proteasomal degradation. Additionally, silencing WWP2 expression results in a decrease in ubiquitination and a subsequent increase in ARID1B protein levels, indicating that WWP2 plays a crucial role in regulating ARID1B stability. Finally, based on several tumorigenic assays, we show that WWP2 may modulate ARID1B-mediated tumor suppression. Our results therefore highlight a novel mechanism of post-translational regulation of ARID1B, which may have implications in ARID1B-mediated tumor suppression.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

The evaluation of stalk mechanics has focused primarily on the end-of-season outcomes and defined differences among inbred and hybrid maize genotypes. However, there is a gap in understanding how these different end-of-season outcomes are achieved. This study measured stalk flexural stiffness in maize inbred genotypes across multiple environments and in maize commercial hybrid genotypes under different disease states. Under all conditions, stalk flexural stiffness followed a biphasic trajectory, characterized by a linear increase phase and a sustained phase. Within a genotype, the environment or disease state altered the rate of increase in the linear phase but did not impact the timing of transition to the sustained phase. Whereas between genotypes, the timing of transition between phases varied. Destructive 3-point bend tests of inbred stalks showed that the trajectory of stalk mechanics is defined by the bending modulus, not the geometry. Together, these results define a biphasic trajectory of maize stalk mechanics that can be modulated by internal and external factors. This work provides a foundation for breeding programs to make informed decisions when selecting for optimized stalk mechanical trajectories, which is necessary for enhancing resilience to environmental stresses.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Canonical population genetic models of sexually reproducing species define the rate of meiotic recombination in terms of the frequency of recombination events per site per sexual generation. This paper studies the interplay of several factors with respect to their effects on neutral genetic diversity in a facultatively sexual, diploid, unicellular species such as yeast. The relevant factors are the prevalence of meiosis versus mitosis, the recombination rate, and the selection and dominance coefficients at loci under positive selection. We assume that many generations of mitotic cell divisions are interspersed with episodes of sexual reproduction, in which all individuals in the population undergo meiosis, followed by random matings among the resulting gametes. Our findings reveal that a single hard selective sweep can reduce neutral nucleotide site diversity across the entire genome, provided that the frequency of meiotic events is sufficiently low, and that the effects of a selective sweep on levels of neutral diversity at sites linked to the target of selection can be markedly different from those predicted by standard models of sweeps based on obligate sexuality. Species that reproduce by facultative sex are thus likely to exhibit unusual patterns of genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

The northern part of this forest massif is part of the Caucasian Biodiversity Hotspot, while its southern fringe extends into the Iranian-Anatolian Hotspot. The recognition of these forests as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has focused global attention on their protection, primarily from human disturbance. While the diversity of vascular plants is well documented, other groups, such as soil-dwelling arthropods, remain underexplored. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting inventories in different sections of the Hyrcanian forests, with a focus on Collembola, a potentially diverse but understudied group of soil fauna. The study was conducted to answer the following questions: Is the naturalness and degree of conservation of these forests reflected in the biodiversity of springtail communities? To what extent does the composition and diversity of these communities vary between different sites and micro-habitats within these forests?\n\nMethodsTo answer these questions, 89 samples were collected over a two-year period from three different forest sites that had undergone contrasting forest management. Specifically, the study focused on three forest ecosystems, a preserved anthropized (planted) forest (PAF), a preserved natural forest (PNF) and a non-preserved natural forest (NPF), all located in the Bula protected area. Three types of microhabitats were sampled at each site, including moss, litter and dead wood. The springtails collected were identified and counted (approximately 3,000 individuals in total), allowing various biodiversity indices to be calculated for the communities as a whole, as well as by site and microhabitat. Soil samples were also analysed to compare soil properties between the three sites.\n\nResultsThe results reveal an impressive diversity of springtails, with 73 morphospecies identified, belonging to 39 genera and 12 families. Of these, 49 could be identified to species level. The estimated total species richness ranged from 80 to 110 species. The analyses also revealed significant differences in species richness between sites, with two preserved sites (PAF and PNF) having a greater number of species compared to the non-preserved site (NPF), and in habitats, with greater diversity observed in dead wood, followed by soil and then mosses. A more detailed analysis of the communities showed a high degree of interspecific diversity in terms of abundance and distribution, without revealing strong patterns of ecological specialization for the majority of species. An analysis of cooccurrences showed that, in most cases species interactions appeared to be neutral. However, some pairs of species showed positive associations, while negative interactions were more marginal. The results of the soil properties showed no differences between the sites and no effect on the Collembola community.\n\nDiscussionThe Bula Forest host particularly diverse Collembola communities. The results underline the importance of conserving these environments, which harbours a high diversity of springtails. Additionally, the results highlight the crucial role of dead wood as a substrate in supporting this biodiversity. The results also call for a more in-depth investigation of the factors influencing the presence, absence and abundance of species, as well as an exploration of the underlying causes of positive or negative species covariation.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

While previous neuroimaging studies have identified neural correlates of LSS integration across different stages of reading development, the specific neural signatures underlying automatic LSS integration remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to isolate neural components specifically associated with automatic LSS integration in literate adults. To this end, we developed an artificial script training paradigm in which adult native Finnish speakers were taught to associate unfamiliar foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we directly compared the audiovisual processing of newly learned and overlearned LSS associations within the same task, one day after training. Event-related fields (ERFs) and multivariate decoding revealed largely shared neural circuits of audiovisual integration for both types of LSS associations, as evidenced by multisensory interaction and congruency effects. Interestingly, the processing of congruent overlearned audiovisual associations uniquely recruited brain activity in the left parietal cortex during the 235-475 ms time window. Furthermore, temporal generalization analysis of the congruency effects revealed that while both newly learned and overlearned audiovisual associations engaged common neural mechanisms, the newly learned associations were processed systematically more slowly by a few hundred milliseconds. Our study identified the spatiotemporal neural signatures underlying automatized LSS processing, offering insights into neural markers that may help identify levels of reading proficiency.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

High agreement was observed among individuals self-identifying as White (concordance rate=98.8%), Black (97.2%), East Asian (96.1%), and South Asian (89.9%), while substantial discordance was found in those self-identifying as Hispanic (concordance rate=74.6%), Middle Eastern / Central Asian (67.9%) or Indigenous (40.7%). We quantified agreement using Cohens kappa ({kappa} = -0.01 unweighted; 0.35 weighted) and assessed admixture complexity with Shannon entropy, revealing a strong relationship between discordance and ancestry heterogeneity. Principal component analysis further revealed that tightly clustered genetic profiles often corresponded with lower admixture complexity, whereas broader, overlapping distributions were observed in groups with more heterogeneous ancestry and complex sociocultural histories. These findings underscore the complex interplay between sociocultural identity and genomic data, with discordance patterns reflecting the historical and cultural complexity of human populations. By quantifying this relationship systematically with ntRoot, our approach provides a framework for moving rigid categorical labels toward more nuanced genome-derived ancestry characterization that can improve both scientific rigor and representational equity in genomics.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

E323169 is one of only 12 available E. vonholyi genomes. To date, and across over two million pathogenic genomes scanned, only three harbour blaFRI-8 and two encode mcr10.2, yet none exhibit both genes together. This study analyzes the genomic, phenotypic, and epidemiological importance of this rare co-occurrence. Methods: Species-ID for E323169 was assigned by MALDI-TOF and then re-assigned and confirmed using a multifactorial genomic workflow. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by MIC assay. The genome of E323169 was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 1000, assembled, and annotated for ARGs, virulence factors, and plasmid replicon detection. Comparative phylogenomics used 12 E. vonholyi RefSeq assemblies, and NCBI metadata were analysed for plasmid distributions of blaFRI-8 and mcr10.2. Results: E323169 carried six ARGs: four chromosomally encoded (blaACT-91, fosA, oqxA10, oqxB9) and two plasmid-borne (blaFRI-8 and mcr10.2) co-located on IncFII(p14)-1_p14 replicon. Additional plasmid replicons: Col(MG828)&_[underscore]_1 and ColRNAI&_[underscore]_1 were also identified.

This study explores the hypothesis that injurious loading leads to cellular damage that triggers the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulting in loss of collagen content in cartilage. To investigate this, we developed a computational mechano-signaling model simulating spatial collagen loss in bovine cartilage. In the model, the injurious loading causes excessive shear strains in tissue matrix, leading to cell damage and subsequent release of MMPs. The model was compared to ex vivo cartilage explant experiments over 12 days post-injury where collagen content was assessed via Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscpy. By day 12, the simulated collagen loss aligned with our experimental findings along most of tissue depth (~30% bulk average loss in the model vs. ~35% in the experiment). The results suggest that injury-related cell damage and the downstream MMP activity could partly explain the depth-wise collagen content loss in early days after ex vivo cartilage injury. Ultimately, combining the current approach with joint-level computational models could enhance the prediction of the onset and progression of cartilage degeneration.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

We identify galectin family proteins as uniquely enriched in trastuzumab-resistant models, and show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of galectins restores trastuzumab sensitivity.

G.; Johnsen, N.; Sparsoe, L. V.; Corydon, T.; Praetorius, H.", "abstract": "Urosepsis is a life-threatening condition most frequently caused by E. coli expressing important virulence factors, including -haemolysin (HlyA). The pore-forming exotoxin HlyA releases ATP upon its insertion into cellular membranes, and the majority of the biological effects of HlyA are mediated through ATP-dependent P2-receptor activation, including the HlyA-mediated thrombocyte activation. We have recently shown that uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) bind to thrombocytes immediately after entering the blood, and the following hepatic clearance leads to early thrombocytopenia during bacteraemia. Here, we demonstrate that P2Y2-deficient mice had markedly shorter survival (LD50 of 185 minutes) compared to wildtype (340 minutes), a response paralleled in mice infused with the P2Y2 receptor antagonist AR-C118925XX. The P2Y2-/- mice exhibited a blunted sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia compared to wildtype and sepsis-induced reduction in mature neutrophils in the blood. Strikingly, the P2Y2-deficient mice had inadequate hepatic clearance of UPEC, resulting in the accumulation of bacteria in the lungs, while thrombocytes were mainly sequestered in the kidneys. Hence, it is likely that the insufficient hepatic elimination of UPEC is responsible for the reduced survival in the P2Y2-/- mice. Taken together, we show that the lack of functional P2Y2 receptors is essential for fast and proper hepatic clearance of UPEC and the survival time during urosepsis. Moreover, the data support the notion that an early reduction in circulating thrombocytes is important for a relevant host response to acute bacteraemia.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Opioids and methamphetamine, but not natural rewards, induce mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) influx via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in dopaminergic terminals of the nucleus accumbens. Optogenetic stimulation reveals that this mitochondrial Ca2+ influx occurs exclusively during high-intensity dopaminergic neuronal activation. This Ca2+ influx drives rapid ATP production, compensating for energy deficits caused by neuronal hyperactivity and enabling sustained dopamine release. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of MCU in dopaminergic neurons selectively reduces drug-induced dopamine release and prevents addictive behaviors while sparing natural reward processing in mice.

Such measurements have large potential considering the broad availability of fMRI, and the already extensive databases focusing on e.g. aging and dementia. However, limiting factors are that the measurements are not quantitative and can rarely separate contributions from different driving mechanisms due to insufficient sampling rate. Here, we present a method that translates fMRI CSF signals into quantitative flow rates associated with cardiac, respiratory and slow-vasomotion cycles, by modeling the spin-history of an oscillating ensemble of molecules. Phantom experiments showed excellent correlations between estimated and true velocities for cardiac- and respiratory-like frequencies, and moderate correlations for a slow vasomotion-like frequency (r = 0.94, 0.97, 0.58 respectively). We also applied the method in a cohort of 48 subjects from the population (68-82 years, 19 women) to characterize CSF flow at the foramen magnum at resting state. These measurements showed a CSF stroke volume of 0.86 [0.61, 1.17] mL for the cardiac, 0.44 [0.25, 0.94] mL for the respiratory, and 0.28 [0.14, 0.45] mL for the slow vasomotion cycle.

Viruses in the order Imitervirales dominated the Lake Mendota virome, exhibiting consistent presence across all seasons and years. We identified gene duplication (23% of genes) and horizontal gene transfer (29% of genes) as drivers of genomic innovation in giant viruses.

The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is notoriously flexible in this regard, and can adapt to a wide range of host niches, including the nasopharynx, lungs, and cerebrospinal fluid. However, the molecular and genetic underpinnings of this ability remain largely obscure. In this work, using infection-mimicking growth conditions we demonstrate that niche adaptation imposes genome-wide changes on multiple levels, including gene essentiality, expression and membrane lipid composition. In general, we show that gene expression and fitness profiling couple orthogonal sets of genes to environmental stimuli. For instance, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) import (manLMN) and catabolism (nagAB) genes were required for growth on this sugar, but not differentially expressed in its presence, whereas other amino sugar metabolism pathways were upregulated, but not essential. Surprisingly, we found that pneumococci do not necessarily prefer glucose over GlcNAc and that uptake of GlcNAc in absence of subsequent catabolism was toxic. Moreover, we identified a previously overlooked fatty acid saturation regulator, FasR, controlling membrane composition, rendering it important during heat stress.

Use cases included storm event monitoring, CSO impact evaluation, and on-site validation and optimization of point-of-use water potabilization treatments. ALERT One was also successfully used by citizen scientist volunteers, highlighting its suitability for decentralized community-based monitoring.

In this study, inspired by the computer game Tetris and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, we developed an abstract computational model of cooperative replicating polymer systems that avoids tracking all potential sequences. Using this model, we explored cooperative chemical ecosystems consisting of catalytic polymers conferring functions analogous to kinases, ligases, and mutation inhibitors. We show that prebiotic environments with micro-compartments with local exchanges enable multilevel selection that facilitates the survival of cooperating polymers. The ability of cooperative systems to persist is sensitive to intrinsic properties of catalysts such as catalytic efficiency and extrinsic factors such as dilution rate.

Although these genes are not involving any of the known trauma related genes and relevant gene ontology terms, they comprise a large number of genes involved in the nervous function, as well as in cellular and developmental functions, the immune system and metabolism. Also, epigenetic aging is predicted to slow down during training. In summary this pilot study yielded additional findings showcasing the potential correlation of trauma therapy and alterations of DNA methylation.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

However, this raises the concern that auto-deubiquitylation would make DUBs poor substrates for this modality. Here we describe a chemical genetics system to evaluate this issue. We find that some Dubs are readily degradable via the Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and some are not. Of the latter category, some resist turnover through auto-deubiquitylation and some are simply poor proteasome substrates.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling approach: Kinetically Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (KAMD). By combining the atomic-level accuracy of MD with the diffusive behavior of Brownian dynamics (BD), KAMD significantly improves sampling efficiency on domain/motif level while preserving equilibrium properties.

E-LightR-Cre meets the key criteria for spatial regulation of SSR in vivo, showing no detectable activity in the dark, while demonstrating robust activation upon blue-light illumination.

C.", "abstract": "The neuroendocrine ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel comprises four pore-forming subunits (Kir6.2), and four modulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1). ATP/ADP binding to Kir6.2 inhibits KATP, whereas MgATP/MgADP binding to two sites on SUR1 promotes activation. As SUR1 is part of the ABC transporter family, it can hydrolyze MgATP to MgADP. Whether or not enzymatic activity is required for KATP activation remains controversial. Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs do not activate KATP, which may reflect an inability of these compounds to bind to SUR1, their inability to promote a conformational change in SUR1 that leads to channel activation, or a requirement for ATP hydrolysis during channel gating. To explore this, we synthesized a fluorescent trinitrophenyl (TNP) derivative of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog {beta},{gamma}-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PCP). Synthesis was verified by UV-visible absorbance, fluorescence, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. Purity was assessed using TLC and reversed-phase HPLC. We can measure real-time binding of fluorescent nucleotide derivatives to intact KATP channels in cell membranes using FRET between channels labeled with a fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid and TNP-nucleotide derivatives. This technique provides us with sufficient spatial resolution to discriminate between binding to each site on KATP. Using this approach we measured TNP-ATP binding to nucleotide binding site 1 on SUR1 in fluorescently labeled Kir6.2/SUR1 channels in unroofed membranes of HEK293T cells. TNP-AMP-PCP binds to both nucleotide binding sites on SUR1 in the absence of Mg2+. AMP-PCP was able to compete with TNP-ATP for binding to NBS2, suggesting that it, too, binds NBS2. We conclude that the failure of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs to activate KATP does not stem from an inability of these nucleotides to bind to the channel, leaving open the possibilities that they are unable to induce an activating conformational change in SUR1 or that nucleotide hydrolysis by SUR1 is a prerequisite for channel activation.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Compared to conventional MD, our TREMD simulations, employing an unprecedented 200-replica setup, significantly broadened conformational sampling while preserving the basal state. Our analysis showed that, without the bound Fab30 antibody fragment, the main body of V2Rpp-bound {beta}arr1 tended to transition toward the basal conformation; however, binding of V2Rpp in the N-domain groove allosterically oriented the finger loop to point upward for core engagement with a GPCR. Furthermore, V2Rpp dissociation events suggest that its binding involves a sliding movement along the N-domain groove, during which its phosphorylated residues p3 and p4 transiently occupy the S5 site to facilitate repositioning of p5 into the S5 site, thereby triggering a zippering process of p1 to p3. The dynamic 62-residue {beta}arr1 tail explored a vast conformational space, forming transient secondary structures, and could favorably anchor on the main body's back side and within the central crest crevice.

RAS activation is also associated with resistance to other AML targeted therapies, including the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Despite the critical need to inhibit RAS/MAPK signaling in AML, no targeted therapies have demonstrated clinical benefit in RAS-driven AML. To address this unmet need, we investigated the preclinical activity of RMC-7977, a multi-selective inhibitor of GTP-bound active [RAS(ON)] isoforms of mutant and wild-type RAS in AML models. RMC-7977 exhibited potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity across AML cell lines with MAPK-activating signaling mutations. In cell line models with acquired FLT3i resistance due to secondary RAS mutations, treatment with RMC-7977 restored sensitivity to FLT3i.

To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases.

Here, we identify and characterize a previously unrecognized subset of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells displaying high SA-{beta}Gal activity that significantly increases with age. Despite exhibiting hallmark features of senescence such as DNA damage, nuclear envelope disruption, loss of heterochromatin, and pronounced dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal pathways, these SA-{beta}Gal-high naive T cells notably lack the canonical senescence marker p21CIP1 and retain robust proliferative capacity upon activation.

Despite marked success in preclinical studies, saRNA vaccines have thus far underperformed in most clinical trials. We hypothesized that non-optimal human cellular context limits saRNA expression, and that elucidating the factors underlying saRNA expression would be key in developing saRNA as a viable therapeutic modality. To identify factors involved in the regulation of saRNA, we performed a quasi-genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, which revealed that saRNA expression in human cells is linked to mitochondrial function and governed by ACSL4. We validated these findings through pharmacological intervention and single gene editing, demonstrating that ACSL4-mediated regulation is unique to saRNA and does not impact modRNA. Moreover, we show that modulating ACSL4 leads to improved saRNA expression across multiple cell types.

Here we examined LKB1 role in ENS formation using a genetically engineered mouse model that conditionally inactivates Lkb1 in neural crest progenitors during gut invasion. We conducted a comprehensive phenotyping of the ENS through histology and 3D imaging of cleared tissue, combining lightsheet microscopy with adaptive optics confocal microscopy. We found that Lkb1 loss impairs early neuronal differentiation, followed by glial degeneration, leading to hypoganglionosis and compromised digestive tissue integrity. Metabolite profiling of digestive tracts revealed an increase of oxidative stress upon Lkb1 ablation. In vitro, Lkb1 knockdown induced oxidative stress in neural crest progenitors and their glial derivatives, causing DNA damage and p53 activation. Ablation of p53 rescued glial specification under these conditions. In vivo, hyperphosphorylation of p53 was also observed; however, deletion of p53 alleles in Lkb1 mutants did not restore enteric neurons number.

We performed combined cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA) sequencing in 42 plasma samples from a longitudinal cohort of 14 PLWH (7 who develop bNAbs and 7 matched controls). This approach enabled us to non-invasively monitor the host transcriptome, viral genetic variation, and microbiome composition during HIV infection, and to identify molecular correlates of bNAb development. We find that development of bNAbs is associated with a transcriptomic signature of early immune activation that involves MHC class I antigen presentation. This signature is independent of viral load or CD4 count and declines over time. In addition to host features, we recovered sufficient viral reads to reconstruct HIV consensus sequences, supporting the utility of cfRNA for viral genotyping. Finally, we also identified an enrichment of several commensal microbiota in bNAb producers and increased coinfection with GB virus C.

Traditionally, mtDNA deletions have been studied using bulk DNA sequencing, but bulk methods average signals across cells, thereby masking the cell-type-specific mutational landscapes. Resolving mtDNA deletions at single-cell resolution is beneficial for understanding how these mutations affect distinct cell populations. To date, no specialized method exists for detecting cell-type-specific mtDNA deletions from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Notably, mtDNA possesses unique molecular features: a high copy number, stable transcription, and compact structure of the mitochondrial genome. This results in a relatively high abundance of mtDNA-derived reads even in single-cell RNA sequencing data, suggesting the possibility of detecting mtDNA deletion variants directly from transcriptomic data. Results Here, we present MitoDelta, a computational pipeline that enables the detection of mtDNA deletions at cell-type resolution solely from single-cell RNA sequencing data. MitoDelta combines a sensitive alignment strategy with robust statistical filtering based on a beta-binomial model, allowing accurate identification of deletion events even from noisy single-cell transcriptomes. To capture cell-type-specific deletion patterns, MitoDelta analyzes reads pooled by annotated cell types, enabling quantification of deletion burden across distinct cellular populations. We benchmarked MitoDelta against existing mtDNA deletion detection tools and demonstrated superior overall performance. As a practical application, we applied MitoDelta to a published single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset for Parkinson's disease and revealed distinct mtDNA deletion burdens across neuronal subtypes.

Traditional approaches for protein sequence representation often rely solely on the 20 canonical amino acids, limiting the representation of non-canonical amino acids and residues that undergo post-translational modifications. This work explores discrete diffusion models for generating novel protein sequences using the all-atom chemical representation SELFIES. By encoding the atomic composition of each amino acid in the protein, this approach expands the design possibilities beyond standard sequence representations. Using a modified ByteNet architecture within the discrete diffusion D3PM framework, we evaluate the impact of this all-atom representation on protein quality, diversity, and novelty, compared to conventional amino acid-based models. To this end, we develop a comprehensive assessment pipeline to determine whether generated SELFIES sequences translate into valid proteins containing both canonical and non-canonical amino acids. Additionally, we examine the influence of two noise schedules within the diffusion process-uniform (random replacement of tokens) and absorbing (progressive masking)-on generation performance. While models trained on the all-atom representation struggle to consistently generate fully valid proteins, the successfully generated proteins show improved novelty and diversity compared to their amino acid-based model counterparts.

Nevertheless, the efficacy of individual sgRNAs that target unique gene varies and is hard to integrate. In this study, tensor decomposition (TD) was used to integrate multiple sgRNAs as well as sgRNA profiles simultaneously. As a result, TD can discriminate between essential and non-essential genes with the competitive performances of one of SOTA, JACKS, which previously outperformed various SOTA. In addition to this, in spite of that TD is nothing but the simple linear algebra, TD can achieve the performance even without control samples without which JACKS even cannot be performed. Moreover, since raw and logarithmic values can achieve the similar performances through TD for the largest dataset among those tested, taking logarithmic values as has been done frequently is questioned. In conclusion, TD is the ever first method that can integrate multiple sgRNAs and profiles simultaneously and can achieve comparative performances with JACKS, one of SOTA.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

S.; Jordan, N.; Diong, S.; Little, M.; Keane, J.; Leisching, G.", "abstract": "Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated immune responses linked to immunometabolic perturbations. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in SLE, its cell-type-specific impact on immune subsets remains underexplored. Methods: We repurposed existing RNA-seq data from SLE patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a focus on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEmt) genes, as well as mitochondrial genes themselves, to identify differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Mitochondrial stress tests were performed on freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients and healthy donors to assess bioenergetic function. Results: RNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation. Conclusion: Our results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress. This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it participates in a variety of cellular functions related to RNA splicing, transport, and stability, as well as miRNA biogenesis. In disease, it is characteristically mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms aggregates, which contribute to neurotoxicity and prion-like cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic TDP-43. Targeting of misfolded aggregates of TDP-43 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, development of effective immunotherapeutic agents remains a challenge, as they require stringent selectivity for misfolded TDP-43 in order to maintain the essential functions of physiologically native TDP-43. To address this issue, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and intrabodies were generated against an epitope in the N-terminal domain of TDP-43 that is only exposed when the protein is misfolded, but not in its properly folded form. We show that mouse and rabbit mAbs against this epitope displayed high binding affinities by surface plasmon resonance analysis and selectively reacted with pathological TDP-43 in post-mortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and AD patients. In a cell line system, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, mAbs and corresponding intrabodies specifically reacted with cytoplasmic aggregates of transfected misfolded TDP-43 lacking the nuclear localization signal, TDP-43{Delta}NLS. Functionally, mAbs inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded TDP-43 and the seeding activity of misfolded TDP-43 from FTLD brain homogenates by novel RT-QuIC assay. Intrabodies promoted the degradation of intracellular aggregates of TDP-43 in HEK293T cells and in induced pluripotent stem cell---derived motor neurons (iPSC-MNs) from ALS patients. The results provide proof-of-concept evidence that supports selective targeting of misfolded toxic aggregates of TDP[ndash]43 as a potentially safe and effective avenue to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

In Norway, birch (Betula spp.) is the most abundant tree species, covering 42% of the forest area. Understanding the factors that shape the age structure of birch is essential for developing management practices that balance timber production, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. Using data from the Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI), we examined the age-class distribution of birch trees across various site conditions. Our analysis revealed that middle-aged trees (50-100 years) were prevalent in most regions, while older trees were notably scarce, particularly in highly productive areas. This pattern reflects management strategies prioritizing younger, fast-growing trees to maximize economic returns. In contrast, less productive sites, which are often managed less intensively, tend to support older trees. Additionally, younger birch trees revealed significantly greater radial growth than older generations when evaluated at the same biological age (e.g., at 10 years old), particularly under favorable site conditions. These findings underscore the combined effects of site productivity, forest management, and environmental factors on growth dynamics and age-class distribution.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

However, the behavioural pathways linking ALAN exposure to broader ecological impacts remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally introduced ALAN into nestboxes of a long-distance migratory bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), breeding in Gotland, Sweden, to assess ALAN effects on development and reproductive ecology. Nestlings were exposed to ALAN from two days post-hatching until fledging, and we video-recorded parental and nestling activity over 24 hours on day 8 post-hatching. From a high-resolution behavioural dataset (32,100 nestling and 3,709 parental events), we found that ALAN-exposed nestlings begged more frequently and for longer at night compared to dark controls, revealing disrupted nocturnal behaviour. These effects cascaded to parental care: both females and males in ALAN nests extended their daily activity, initiating feeding earlier and terminating later, but traded off this extension by reducing their hourly feeding counts compared to parents in dark conditions. Consequently, nestlings under ALAN fledged at an older age and had a lower fledging rate after day eight post-hatching, despite no difference in total fledging numbers compared to controls. Our findings provide the first comprehensive experimental evidence that ALAN alters the behaviour of both parents alongside their offspring and reduces reproductive success in a long-distance migrant, a species group that increasingly encounters light pollution during nocturnal migration. ALAN, though directly affecting mainly nestlings and females in nestboxes, triggered socially-mediated responses that altered the circadian behaviour of entire bird families. This study underscores the need to consider behavioural disruption as a critical mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ALAN in natural populations.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we rationally engineered AAV9 to become a modular, receptor-targeted vector for selective in vivo gene delivery. We first identified the N272A and W503A mutations as effective in ablating the native tropism of AAV9. Subsequently, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) were inserted into the GH2/3 capsid loop, redirecting vector specificity towards defined cellular receptors without compromising capsid integrity or yield. As a proof of concept, HER2-targeted DART-AAV9 vectors demonstrated highly selective transduction of HER2-positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, in both, subcutaneous and orthotopic glioblastoma models, with negligible transduction of off-target organs including liver, heart, and kidney. When equipped with immunomodulatory genes (anti-PD-1 or IL-2) HER2-DART-AAV9 mediated secretion of functional therapeutic proteins from transduced tumor cells. Additionally, our modular platform facilitated rapid generation of CD8-targeted DART-AAV9 vectors, enabling selective transduction of human CD8+ T cells. Importantly, the engineered vectors exhibited favorable resistance to neutralization by human serum and retained their specificity and potency in human blood, underscoring their potential for clinical translation.

This diversity is often referred to as intratumoral heterogeneity and is known to complicate the interpretation of single-test biomarkers. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one such biomarker, which is used to help guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment through the classification of samples as either having high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or as being microsatellite stable (MSS). One area that has yet to be addressed in depth is whether MSI itself is a heterogeneous phenomenon, such that only some subclones are MSI-H. To investigate heterogeneity in MSI status, we curated and analyzed data from several single-cell RNA sequencing studies that had paired clinical MSI status and developed a computational pipeline to infer MSI-H cells and quantify heterogeneity In MSI status. We found evidence of heterogeneity in MSI status both in individuals originally classified as MSI-H and MSS. Out of 49 individuals, 15 showed evidence of divergence in MSI status between distinct clusters of cancer cells and most had distinct MSI-H and MSS subclones. These results raise questions about the current practice of treating MSI as a binary biomarker, ignoring heterogeneity between cancer subclones. Accounting for heterogeneity may lead to improved biomarker performance and, potentially, help explain reports of intrinsic treatment resistance and low overall responder rate in MSI-H cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine the frequency of heterogeneity in this biomarker at the population level, and whether the presence of both MSI-H and MSS subclones can have clinical implications.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

However, the public databases that currently supply this data, while foundational to research, were established to aggregate results from academic experiments, not as training datasets for machine learning. Their human-centric data structure limits model performance due to redundancy, taxonomic and geographic bias, limited biological context, and inconsistent provenance.

We here present a theoretical and numerical comparison of these two metrics and apply them to a resting-state EEG dataset from individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) and a control group. We first derive theoretical entropy rate and sample entropy estimates for first-order discrete Markov processes, providing a null hypothesis for statistical testing of higher-order syntax properties. Under the first-order syntax null hypothesis, we find a close mathematical relationship between both metrics that can be expressed by the microstate transition probability matrix. An inequality is derived that shows entropy rate to be an upper bound to sample entropy under the Markov approximation. We quantify accuracy and precision of the theoretical ER and SE estimates on EEG microstate sequences from the healthy control group. We then show that ER and SE identify significant higher-order syntax properties in microstate sequences from the control and AD groups. Group comparison demonstrates that continuous microstate sequences from the AD group have lower entropy values (ER, SE), whereas jump sequences from the AD group have higher entropy values compared to control. Finally, we introduce a new syntax metric that normalizes ER and SE values with respect to their first-order syntax levels, to assess differences that only depend on syntax order. This metric revealed no differences between control and AD groups for either continuous or jump microstate sequences. This study provides further insights into higher-order microstate syntax and how it can be quantified with respect to the underlying first-order syntax. Similarities and differences between ER and SE as syntax metrics are highlighted and exemplified on experimental data.

Various studies reported high-level visual and cognitive functions under CFS, which, however, has more recently been questioned and at least partially attributed to low-level stimulus. A key but unsettled issue is the extent to which the responses of V1 neurons, where inputs from two eyes first merge, are affected, as severely suppressed V1 responses would not sustain high-level processing. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record the responses of V1 neurons to a grating stimulus under CFS in awake, fixating macaques. The results revealed that CFS substantially suppressed V1 orientation responses. Ocularity-wise, it nearly completely eliminated the orientation responses of V1 neurons preferring the masker eye or both eyes, while also significantly suppressing the responses of those preferring the grating eye.

S. X. E.; Seung, H. S.; Murthy, M.", "abstract": "Sexual dimorphisms are present across brains. Male and female brains contain sets of cell types with differences in cell number, morphology, or synaptic connectivity between the two sexes. These differences are driven by differentially-expressed transcription factors, which set the stage for disparate sexual and social behaviors observed between males and females, such as courtship, aggression, receptivity, and mating. In the Drosophila brain, sexual dimorphisms result from differential expression of two transcription factors, Fruitless (Fru) and Doublesex (Dsx), and genetic reagents driven by enhancers for Fru and Dsx label sexually-dimorphic neurons in both male and female brains. The recent release of the first whole-brain connectome for Drosophila provides a unique opportunity to study the connectivity between these neurons as well as their integration into the larger brain network. Here, we identify 91 putative Fru or Dsx cell types, comprising ~1400 neurons, within the whole-brain connectome, using morphological similarity between electron microscopic (EM) reconstructions and light microscopic (LM) images of known Fru and Dsx neurons. We discover that while Fru and Dsx neurons are highly interconnected, each cell type typically receives more inputs from and sends more outputs to non-Fru/Dsx neurons. We characterize the connectivity in the Fru/Dsx networks to predict the function of cell types not previously characterized, we measure distances to the sensory periphery and uncover multisensory interactions, and we map connections to descending neurons that drive behavior. All Fru and Dsx labels reported here are shared within FlyWire Codex (codex.flywire.ai; gene==Fruitless or Doublesex); this work is a critical first step towards deciphering the neural basis of sexually-dimorphic behaviors and for making comparisons with future connectomes of the male brain.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The geometry of cortical sound processing in slow wave sleep", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.13.658070", "authors": "Muller, A.; Filipchuk, A.; Bagur, S.; Bathellier, B.", "abstract": "During wake, sound-evoked and spontaneous neural activity of the auditory cortex evolve in distinct subspaces whereas anesthesia disrupts sound responses and merges these spaces. To evaluate if similar modifications of the sound representation geometry explain sensory disconnection during sleep, we followed large neural populations of the mouse auditory cortex across slow wave sleep and wakefulness. We observed that sleep dampens sound responses but preserves the geometry of sound representations which remain separate from spontaneous activity. Moreover, response dampening was strongly coordinated across neurons and varied throughout sleep spanning from fully preserved response patterns to population response failures on a fraction of sound presentations. These failures are more common during high spindle-band activity and more rarely observed in wakefulness. Therefore, in sleep, the auditory system preserves sound feature selectivity up to the cortex for detailed acoustic surveillance, but concurrently implements an intermittent gating mechanism leading to local sensory disconnections.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

The optic tectum (OT), homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus, serves as a central hub for visuomotor processing. To elucidate how OT circuits discriminate visual inputs and generate relevant behavior outputs, we leveraged the mesoscopic connectome of zebrafish OT to build a biophysically constrained reservoir computing network that models visuomotor transformations. In silico lesion revealed that the accuracy and robustness of sensorimotor outputs are governed by different combinations of tectal interneuron (TIN) subtypes. Furthermore, specific lamina-projecting serotoninergic subsystems distinctly bias network output toward either escape or orienting behaviors via regulating TIN activities. Our findings establish a mesoscopic connectome-based reservoir for vertebrate sensorimotor processing, where TINs control accuracy and robustness, highlighting TINs as a tunable gate and serotoninergic neurons as a context-dependent modulator of behavioral flexibility.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

F.; Tyrkalska, S.; Bureau, C.; Gonzalez, C.; Gracia, J.; Lelievre, E.; Mulero, V.; Chi, M. N.; YATIME, L.", "abstract": "S100 proteins are highly versatile calcium-binding proteins from vertebrates. Following extracellular release, they become instrumental in immune and antimicrobial defenses, initiating the inflammatory response through receptor signaling and providing direct control of bacterial invaders via nutritional immunity. While mammalian S100s have been extensively studied, very little is known about the more recently discovered S100 proteins from teleost fish, including those with no strict orthologs in mammals. Comparable functioning between both clades would allow to expand their study into the highly popular zebrafish model, particularly suited for live imaging and mechanistic exploration of immune and inflammatory processes. To fill the gap of knowledge on teleost S100s, we here provide a detailed structural and biochemical characterization of S100i1 and S100i2 from Danio rerio, two teleost-specific S100s absent in mammals. We demonstrate that they nevertheless share conserved tertiary and quaternary organization with mammalian S100s. In addition, they exhibit comparable calcium binding properties and undergo a similar calcium-dependent activation mechanism. Furthermore, they display analogous expression pattern, being enriched in tissues highly exposed to the environment like gills and skin, the latter constituting an important reservoir of S100 proteins in mammals. Finally, our results show, for the very first time, that s100i2/i2 gene expression is differentially modulated in sterile disease conditions associated with sustained inflammation or high hypoxic state. Altogether, these findings underline the strong parallelism existing between mammalian and teleost-specific S100 proteins despite their divergent evolution, opening up new avenues to explore their biology in the zebrafish model.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Their regulatory activity can be functionally characterized in a high-throughput manner using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that generally test an enhancer alongside a minimal promoter. Here, we developed a novel technology called Capture-C MPRA (ccMPRA) that combines both technologies and can simultaneously obtain chromatin interactions and measure CRE activity alongside their target promoters. We utilized ccMPRA to analyze the regulatory activity of 650 promoters interacting with 42,719 sequences. As C-based techniques also capture isolated promoters, we were able to obtain promoter baseline activity, enabling the identification of both enhancers and silencers. Analysis of CREs interacting with more than one promoter showed significant activity differences depending on the promoter. In summary, ccMPRA can simultaneously characterize chromatin interactions and regulatory activity, allowing to further dissect regulatory grammar.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, systematic and quantitative measurement of protein transmembrane (TM) domains laterally interacting in mammalian cells remains challenging. Conventional fusion protein assays directed at memPPIs suffer from low dynamic range, due to the crowded membrane environment and interference from overexpression, trafficking, or self-complementation artifacts. Here, we assessed and further developed the split luciferase complementation NanoBit system to establish suitable expression constructs and working conditions for robust quantification of TM PPIs within human cells. We benchmarked the platform using a panel of natural and synthetic memPPI pairs with diverse architectures, insertion topologies, and trafficking patterns, finding assay settings that robustly distinguish true positive interactions from co-expressed non-interacting pairs. Adding a novel procedure measuring and normalizing protein expression levels in situ in parallel, we drastically improve assay dynamic range and consistency in discerning relative interaction propensities across broad expression levels - which also enhanced compatibility with protein engineering screens. To extend measurements to versatile protein contexts, we developed membrane expression constructs and validated tagging strategies to improve trafficking with defined TM orientations. By incorporating topological control and accounting for variations in expression levels, this memPPI platform becomes a viable approach for high-throughput interaction analyses and experimental screens for membrane protein design such as TM binders targeting human membrane proteins. Owing to its sensitivity, scalability, and adaptability, we expect this assay platform to have broad cross-disciplinary utility in protein science, design, and drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-14", "journal": ""}
