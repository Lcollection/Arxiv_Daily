A.", "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation were a major driver of the divergence of archaic hominins (AHs)--Neanderthals and Denisovans--and modern humans (MHs). The three-dimensional (3D) folding of the genome is critical for regulating gene expression; however, its role in recent human evolution has not been explored because the degradation of ancient samples does not permit experimental determination of AH 3D genome folding. To fill this gap, we apply novel deep learning methods for inferring 3D genome organization from DNA sequence to Neanderthal, Denisovan, and diverse MH genomes. Using the resulting 3D contact maps across the genome, we identify 167 distinct regions with diverged 3D genome organization between AHs and MHs. We show that these 3D-diverged loci are enriched for genes related to the function and morphology of the eye, supra-orbital ridges, hair, lungs, immune response, and cognition. Despite these specific diverged loci, the 3D genome of AHs and MHs is more similar than expected based on sequence divergence, suggesting that the pressure to maintain 3D genome organization constrained hominin sequence evolution. We also find that 3D genome organization constrained the landscape of AH ancestry in MHs today: regions more tolerant of 3D variation are enriched for introgression in modern Eurasians. Finally, we identify loci where modern Eurasians have inherited novel 3D genome folding patterns from AH ancestors and validate folding differences in a high-frequency locus using Hi-C, revealing a putative molecular mechanism for phenotypes associated with archaic introgression. In summary, our application of deep learning to predict archaic 3D genome organization illustrates the potential of inferring molecular phenotypes from ancient DNA to reveal previously unobservable biological differences.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

This suggests that older adults have more difficulty maintaining balance while cycling, likely due to age-related sensorimotor decline. A particularly challenging maneuver in traffic is the shoulder check (turning the upper body to look behind while maintaining balance and direction). This study investigates how age-related sensorimotor deficits impact this skill. 40 young and 41 older participants (60-65 years old) cycled in a straight lane while performing a shoulder check to identify the color of an object behind them. We recorded the task-errors (interrupted cycling, incorrect color identification, cycling outside the lane) and computed the steering angle, rotation of the frame, pelvis and torso, and task duration from inertial measurement unit data. Older adults made more task-errors than young participants; one-third failed the task due to mistakes such as misidentifying the color, losing balance, or leaving the lane. In the successful trials, older adults showed greater steering variability, increased pelvic rotation relative to the frame, and took longer to complete the task than the young participants. These findings suggest that age-related difficulties in maintaining balance while head-turning may contribute to the higher rate of single-sided bike accidents among older cyclists. Infrastructure adaptations (e.g., wider bike lanes) and individual-level interventions (e.g., mirrors) that alleviate the difficulties older adults experience when performing a shoulder check could improve safety for people from this age group.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Using a combination of anatomical tracing experiments and in vitro electrophysiological recordings in the mouse, we report that axons from MEC somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons densely distribute in layer I of LEC, where they drive strong and near selective inhibition of principal neurons in layer IIa. This inhibitory pathway is accompanied by MEC glutamatergic axons that innervate multiple layers of LEC and preferentially synapse onto principal neurons in layers IIb and III.

A.", "abstract": "Background: The role of neutrophils in mediating neurovascular vulnerability has been increasingly implicated in various acute inflammatory models of neuroimmune crosstalk between the periphery and the brain. Whether neurovascular vulnerability is similarly modulated in the context of frequent, but not acute, inflammatory activation in the periphery is the aim of our study. Such a model of frequent inflammatory irritation is pertinent to understanding the neurologic risk of constant exposure to aerosolized environmental hazards leading to progressive pulmonary disease. Methods: To model repeated pulmonary inflammation, we applied a three-dose regimen of intranasal (i.n.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57BL/6J mice and studied the impact on the inflammatory environment of the brain, with a specific focus on neutrophil dynamics at the neurovascular unit (NVU). Tissue and circulatory inflammatory profiles were screened via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein content and cellularity, transcript analysis of brain tissue, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Intravital two-photon microscopy (2PM) of the brain vasculature identified neutrophil dynamics at the NVU. Immunofluorescence validated neutrophil dynamics and identified neuroinflammatory hallmarks and peripheral immune factor interactions at the NVU. In vivo findings were corroborated and replicated in murine and human microphysiological systems (MPS) modeling the blood-brain barrier as a proxy demonstration of the translational relevance of our findings. Results: 2PM of tdTomato-Ly6G+ neutrophils demonstrated increased levels of circulating neutrophils and corresponding engagement with the brain vasculature after the three-dose repeated i.n. exposure regimen. Neutrophilia at the NVU was corroborated with increased transcript levels of Ly6G and other pro-inflammatory markers. This coordination between endothelial physiology and neutrophil phenotypes was recapitulated in murine and human MPS models. System-wide neutrophilia in the lung and circulation was found to be cotemporaneous to neutrophilia at the NVU based on the cellularity of BAL and peripheral blood samples collected at the same endpoints. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue implicates temporal coordination between vascular surface adhesion molecules with changes in neutrophil dynamics from adhesion, crawling, stalling, and transmigration. Extravasation of neutrophils was complemented by sustained paravascular deposition of fibrinogen and microgliosis up to 72 hours after the final i.n. dosing. Microglia-associated effector functions for synaptic pruning and regulation of neutrophil activity demonstrated distinct temporal profiles. Conclusions: Our results identify systemic levels of neutrophilia accompanied by ingress and extravascular accumulation in brain parenchyma that correlated with sustained microglial activation. This neutrophil-centric lung-brain interaction is complemented by the observation of paravascular fibrinogen deposition that alters synaptic metabolism. Thus, we propose a mechanistic role for neutrophilia and associated inflammatory dysregulation as essential mediators along the lung-brain neuroimmune axis in a generalizable model of repeated respiratory exposure to inflammatory agents.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

H.; Choi, J.-S.", "abstract": "Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat's current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naive Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogenous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Kahneman's attention model (1973) theorizes a key interplay between attention and arousal, yet this relationship remains poorly understood. Using a multimodal approach, we investigated this interaction in healthy young adults performing an auditory attention task designed to simultaneously assess phasic arousal, voluntary attention, and involuntary attention. Furthermore, tonic arousal was experimentally modulated with low or high arousing music, as confirmed by changes in pupil size and heart rate. Behavioral data confirmed that informative cues enhanced voluntary attention, while unexpected salient task-irrelevant sounds (so-called distractors) produced either shortened or lengthened reaction times depending on their timing relative to target onset. Physiological data indicated that the facilitation effect of distractors on reaction times was driven by increases in phasic arousal. This benefit was further modulated by a dynamic interplay between phasic arousal and voluntary attention over time. Supporting Aston-Jones and Cohen's theory, a fronto-central cortical response to distractors revealed that tonic and phasic arousal interact in line with an inverted U-shaped relationship. This study provides empirical evidence, in humans, that tonic arousal can optimize performance by tuning phasic arousal and attentional control.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Biomaterial cell carriers can be functionalized with growth factor-mimetic peptides (i.e. IGF-1 mimicking peptides) to enhance MSC function while promoting cell retention and minimizing off-target effects seen with direct administration of soluble growth factors. Here, we functionalized alginate hydrogels with three distinct IGF-1 peptide mimetics and the integrin-binding peptide, cyclic RGD. One IGF-1 peptide mimetic (IGM-3) in combination with integrin ligand was found to activate Akt and ERK1/2 signaling and support survival of serum-deprived MSCs. MSCs encapsulated in alginate hydrogels that presented both IGM-3 and cRGD showed a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion when challenged with interleukin-1 {beta}. Finally, MSCs cultured within the cRGD/IGM-3 hydrogels were able to blunt pro-inflammatory gene expression of human primary cells from degenerated intervertebral discs.

More specifically, neurons' firing rates increase during microgravity and decrease during centrifugal-induced hypergravity. Different biophysical explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon: however, they have not been backed by quantitative analyses nor simulations. More generally, classical computational models of neurons and networks do not account for the effect of altered gravity, which limits the possibility to perform in-silico experiments and simulations. Here, we propose computational implementations for different effects of altered gravity on cellular functions, and modify existing models to account for the effect of micro- and hyper-gravity. Firstly, in line with previous experiments, we suggest that microgravity could be modeled as an increase of the voltage-dependent channel transition rates, which is assumed to be the result of a higher membrane fluidity and can be readily implemented into the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Using in-silico simulations of single neurons, we show that this model of the influence of gravity on neuronal activity allows to reproduce the observed increased firing and burst rates. Secondly, we explore the role of mechano-gated (MG) ion channels on population activity. We show that recordings can be fitted by a network of connected excitatory neurons, whose activity is balanced by firing rate adaptation. Adding a small depolarizing current to account for the activation of MG channels also reproduces the observed increased firing and burst rates. Overall, our results fill an important gap in the literature, by providing a computational link between altered gravity and neuronal activity. Starting from historical observations of the effects of gravity on cellular functions, we derived gravity-sensitive models of neurons and networks, whose predictions could be refined using future experiments.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Enlarged t-tubules are formed upon disruption of Arpc5, impairing the synchronisation between plasma membrane depolarization and calcium release.

Site-specific recombinases provide a route to genetic memory via targeted DNA modifications, but their high specificity and efficiency are offset by leaky expression and limited tunability in prokaryotes. We developed a tightly regulated, titratable Cre recombinase system for Escherichia coli that achieves low recombination rates and minimal basal activity. Implemented on both plasmids and the chromosome, the latter showed superior retention of genetic memory across generations. These features make the system broadly useful for environmental biosensing and other applications. To demonstrate applicability to environmental biosensing, we developed a whole-cell recombination-based biosensor for arsenite, a toxic and ubiquitous pollutant that is primarily mobilized in anoxic environments such as flooded soils, sediments, and aquifers. However, existing arsenite whole-cell biosensors face limitations in sensitivity and workflow in anaerobic settings. Our biosensor reliably recorded anoxic arsenite exposure as a stable genetic memory for delayed fluorescence readout in aerobic conditions, with detection sensitivity comparable to conventional wet chemical methods. By decoupling exposure from measurement, this approach offers a foundation for arsenite biosensing under field-relevant conditions, including redox variability and other physicochemical gradients, without the constraints of anoxic measurement. More broadly, the ability to induce low-rate, heritable genetic changes expands the genetic toolkit for environmentally responsive systems, with applications in environmental monitoring, bioproduction, bioengineering, as well as experimental studies of microbial ecology, evolution, and host-microbe interactions.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Despite not being designed for generative tasks, SMILES remain the most commonly used string-based representation. However, while SMILES follow strict syntactic rules, grammatically correct SMILES strings do not always correspond to valid molecules. SELFIES were introduced as an alternative that addresses this limitation by ensuring that every string of SELFIES tokens represents to a valid molecule. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the limitations of both SMILES and SELFIES as representations for generative models. We define two key criteria for robust molecular generation: viability, generated strings represent novel, unique molecules with correct valence, and fidelity, the distribution of physicochemical properties from sampled molecules resembles that of the training data. We find that approximately one-fifth of molecules generated using canonical SMILES are invalid, failing the viability criterion. In contrast, all SELFIES-generated molecules are viable, but they deviate significantly from the training distribution, indicating low fidelity. To address these limitations, we develop data augmentation procedures for both representations. While simplifying the SELFIES grammar yields only modest gains in fidelity, our stochastic augmentation method for SMILES, ClearSMILES, significantly improves both viability and fidelity. ClearSMILES simplifies syntax by reducing the vocabulary size and explicitly encoding aromaticity via Kekule SMILES, making it easier string representations for models to process. Using ClearSMILES, the rate of invalid samples decreases by an order of magnitude, from 20% to 2.2%, and fidelity to the training distribution is also moderately improved.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We estimated the duration of phonetic feature encoding, speed of evolution across neural populations, and the spatial location of encoding over EEG sensors. First, we establish that phonetic features are robustly encoded in EEG responses of healthy older adults. Second, when comparing individuals with aphasia to healthy controls, we find significantly decreased phonetic encoding in the aphasic group after shared initial processing pattern (0.08-0.25s after phoneme onset). Phonetic features were less strongly encoded over left-lateralized electrodes in the aphasia group compared to controls, with no difference in speed of neural pattern evolution. Finally, we observed that healthy controls, but not individuals with aphasia, encode phonetic features longer when uncertainty about word identity is high, indicating that this mechanism - encoding phonetic information until word identity is resolved - is crucial for successful comprehension.

At 5 to 6 days old fruit fly progeny were exposed to hypoxia for two hours prior to returning to normoxic conditions. We observed escape behavior in hypoxia larvae, confirming exposure to hypoxia. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, elevated FA levels were observed in FAD compared to controls. We report increased acute hypoxia-induced mortality in FAD flies. Furthermore, FAD flies were not motivated to climb after hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions FAD flies had a higher velocity when descending during a climb.

H.; Robinson-Rechavi, M.", "abstract": "Phenotypic variation among individuals plays a key role in evolution, since variation provides the material on which natural selection can act. One important link between genetic and phenotypic variation is gene expression. As for other phenotypes, the range of accessible expression variation is limited and biased by different evolutionary and developmental constraints. Gene expression variability broadly refers to the tendency of a gene to vary in expression (i.e., between individuals or cells) due to stochastic fluctuations or differences in genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors, separately from the differences between conditions (e.g. organs), and is often estimated based on observed expression variance. The variance due to biomolecular stochasticity (transcriptional 'noise') and cell-to-cell heterogeneity has been well-studied in isogenic populations of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeasts. However, for more complex organisms with multiple cells, tissues, and organs sharing the same genetic background, the interplay between inter-individual expression variability, gene and organ function, and gene regulation remains an open question. In this study, we used highly multiplexed 3'-end Bulk RNA Barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) to generate transcriptome profiles spanning at least nine organs in outbred individuals of three ray-finned fish species: zebrafish, Northern pike, and spotted gar. For each condition, we measured the expression variance per gene independent of mean expression level as an estimate of its variability. We observed that lowly variable genes are enriched in cellular housekeeping functions whereas highly variable genes are enriched in stimulus-response functions. Furthermore, genes with highly variable expression between individuals evolve under weaker purifying selection at the coding sequence level, indicating that intra-species gene expression variability predicts inter-species protein sequence divergence. Genes that are broadly expressed across organs tend to be both highly expressed and lowly variable between individuals, whereas organ-biased genes are typically highly variable within their top organ of expression. For genes with organ-biased expression profiles, we inferred differences in selective pressure on gene regulation depending on their top organ. We found that genes with peak expression in the brain have low inter-individual expression variability across non-nervous organs, suggesting stabilizing selection on regulatory evolution of brain-biased genes.

Early life stress in childhood has been shown to increase the likelihood of migraine in adulthood in humans. Calcitonin-gene relate peptide (CGRP) has been shown to reliably and acutely induce migraine or migraine-like behavior in both humans and rodent models. Here we investigate the impact of early life stress and CGRP on migraine-related neural circuitry, as well as the impact of early life stress on CGRP-mediated migraine-like activity in order to better understand the mechanisms by which early life stress predisposes neural circuitry to migraine brain activity. Methods: We implemented an early life stress paradigm in the outbred strain of mice, CD1. We evaluated the impact of peripheral CGRP on migraine-like behavior and employed multi-site in vivo neurophysiology in freely behaving mice. A changepoint analysis was used to dissect differences in individual CGRP-induced responses. Results: We found that early life stress exacerbated migraine-related behavioral and network physiology. CGRP alone caused disruptions in neural oscillatory activity across a network of brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMY), thalamus (Po, VPM, and MDthal), and parabrachial nucleus (PBN). We found that power across the network was lowered within 10 minutes of peripheral CGRP exposure, which was sustained for ~40-50 min. Coherence was mostly disrupted in amygdalar brain region pairings, and took on a shorter timecourse, with partial rescue of these responses by migraine abortive, sumatriptan. We found that early life stress exacerbated most of these responses, especially AMY-thalamic coherence pairings, although early life stress in the absence of CGRP demonstrated no impact on the network overall. We further identified individual mice with brain-network activity hypersusceptible to migraine. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that early life stress confers vulnerability to migraine, simultaneously impacting behavior and brain network activity responses to peripheral CGRP.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

In this work, we have paved the way for the standardisation of PEV markers, providing the most profound proteomic data so far from apoplastic washing fluid-EVs, a sample enriched in genuine extracellular vesicles from plant tissue of two reference plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Arath-EVs) and Brassica oleracea (Braol-EVs). Besides, we analysed the protein content of the soluble fraction of the apoplast and calculated the enrichment of the potential markers studied in EVs. Additionally, we have conducted an exhaustive analysis of the proteomic data available so far from genuine EVs from any plant species, evaluating current potential markers, together with those found in our proteomic analyses. Our results provide evidence supporting the potential use of the following families as PEV markers: aquaporins, vacuolar-type ATPase complex subunits, some fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs), tetraspanins, syntaxins, germin-like proteins and calreticulins. Next, we analysed the presence of orthologues and their degree of conservation throughout plant taxa, as well as in 2 reference species from the animal kingdom: human and mouse. Their degree of conservation was compared with that of current animal EV: CD63, CD81 and CD9. Among the protein families with potential to be used as PEV markers, 2 were found to be plant-specific: FLAs and germin-like proteins. On the other hand, aquaporins and vacuolar-type ATPase complex subunits showed the greatest degree of conservation across plant and animal kingdoms. Our results provide key insights on several aspects of classical and novel protein identity markers for PEVs to assist in the selection of the best candidates for standardisation: 1) species-specific abundance, 2) specificity for PEVs, and 3) conservation and plant specificity.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

For example, immunity and metabolism are regulated in part by the gut microbiota, which can be shaped indirectly by host neuroendocrine function via a gut-brain axis. Yet the sensitivity of this axis in wild vertebrates remains ambiguous. Here, we investigate covariation among environmental quality, glucocorticoids, and gut microbiota in a vulnerable population of Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) inhabiting a region impacted by variable rates of human disturbance. We test competing hypotheses related to direct versus indirect environmental effects (via the gut-brain axis) on adult and juvenile gut microbial communities. Adults housed a richer gut microbiota and had higher hair glucocorticoids that covaried with microbial composition, while juveniles lacked any hormone-microbiome covariation. Environmental quality (patch size, habitat diversity, and suitability) predicted variation in glucocorticoids but not variation in microbial diversity, suggesting no direct effects on gut microbiota. Instead, structural equation models revealed indirect environmental effects on microbiota via elevations in glucocorticoids in adults. Among juveniles, habitat-induced hormonal responses had no downstream effects on microbial diversity. Together, this provides evidence for age-dependent indirect environmental effects on gut microbial composition in a wild mammal by way of the host neuroendocrine system.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we present PULSE, an in vivo promoter engineering tool based on a streamlined workflow combining FACS-based screening of a randomized DNA library to identify active promoter elements, and their subsequent assembly into synthetic hybrid promoters where each element is flanked by loxPsym sites. Multiple promoter cassettes can be genome-integrated to generate ready-to-use platform strains, allowing users to easily place their genes of interest under the control of PULSE promoters. By activating Cre-mediated recombination, loxPsym-flanked promoter elements can be recombined, effectively bringing the target genes under control of a vast set of promoters spanning a wide range of expression levels in one simple step. Applying PULSE on two heterologous pathways, a threefold increase in {beta}-carotene production and improved xylose utilization by S. cerevisiae was achieved.

Despite decades of major advances and key insights from molecular systematics, organismal anatomical features remain a key source of biological data for both inferring phylogenies and investigating patterns of trait evolution among fossil and extant species. In palaeobiology, morphologic characters are typically the only source of information available for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Systematists working with fossil data must make decisions regarding how morphological characters are modeled, whether they are coded as continuous or categorical, and how to address biological sources of rate variation. To determine the impact of how different models of morphological evolution influence phylogenetic inferences and downstream comparative analyses of fossil data, we compared a series of increasingly complex model configurations of character evolution to a dataset of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobites containing both discrete morphological characters and continuous traits. Model configurations vary in complexity, ranging from simple constant rate scenarios with only discrete categorical traits, to complex evolutionary models including both discrete and quantitative traits across multiple ecological partitions while accounting for multiple sources of rate variation. We compared topological distributions across model configurations by visualizing their distances in multidimensional treespace. Results indicate support for rate-variable models and partitioning characters. However, inclusion of continuous traits dramatically alters macroevolutionary inferences. Character model complexity also has a major impact on which regions of treespace are explored, suggesting a critical need to carefully model morphologic evolution even when systematists are only interested in patterns of phylogenetic relationships alone.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Identifying functional changes at each stage, from inception to development to maturation, functional execution, and eventual death or pathological transformation, often requires systematic comparisons of functional expression across cell populations. However, because cells of the same type often exhibit similar gene expression patterns regardless of function or fate, it is challenging to distinguish the stages of cellular fate or functional states within the same cell type, which also limits our understanding of cellular memory. Cells of the same type that share structural and gene expression similarities but originate from different regions and perform slightly distinct functions often retain unique epigenetic memory signatures. Although RNA serves as a key executor of fundamental cellular functions, its high expression similarity among cells of the same type limits its ability to distinguish functional heterogeneity. To overcome this challenge, we developed TOGGLE, utilizing higher resolution analytical methods to uncover functional diversity at the cellular level. Then we based on TOGGLE developed an innovative Graph Diffusion Functional Map, which can significantly reduce noise, thereby more clearly displaying the functional grouping of RNA and enabling the capture of more subtle functional differences in high dimensional data. Ultimately, this method effectively removes the influence of baseline functions from classification criteria and identifies key trajectories of cell fate determination.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

E.; Lidke, K.

One method of Super-Resolution Microscopy (SRM) circumvents the diffraction-limited resolution by precisely estimating the position of spatiotemporally independent emitters. However, these methods of SRM techniques are not optimal for estimating the separation of two simultaneously excited emitters. Recently, a number of detection methods based on modal imaging have been developed to achieve the quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound (QCRB) to estimate the separations between two nearby emitters. The QCRB determines the minimum achievable precision for all possible detection methods. Current modal imaging techniques assume a scalar field generated from a point source, such as a distant source from an optical fiber or a pinhole. However, for fluorescently labeled samples, point emitters are single fluorophores that are modeled as dipole emitters and, in practice, are often freely rotating. Dipole radiation must be described by vectorial theory, and the assumption of a scalar field no longer holds. Here, we present a method to numerically calculate the QCRB for measuring the separation of two dipole emitters, incorporating the vectorial theory. Furthermore, we propose a near-quantum optimal detection scheme based on one of the modal imaging techniques, super-localization by image inversion interferometry (SLIVER), for estimating the separation of two freely rotating dipoles. In the proposed method, we introduce a vortex wave plate before the SLIVER detection to separate the radial and azimuthal components of the dipole radiation. With numerical simulations, we demonstrated that our method achieves non-divergent precision at any separation between two dipole emitters. We investigated several practical effects relevant to experimental measurements in super-resolution microscopy, including numerical aperture, detection bandwidth, number of estimation parameters, background, and misalignment on separation estimation.

Despite its agricultural significance, the toxin repertoire of P. putida, particularly those secreted via the K2- and K3-T6SSs, remains poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive molecular study of Tke5, a potent toxin encoded within the K3-T6SS, which represents the first comprehensive functional analysis of the BTH_I2691 protein family.

This unique mechanism offers a powerful approach to targeting resilient phytopathogens. This study reveals a previously undescribed mode of action within a widespread yet understudied toxin family.

V.; Ragsdale, A.", "abstract": "In many taxa, levels of genetic diversity are observed to vary along their genome. The framework of background selection models this variation in terms of linkage to constrained sites, and recent applications have been able to explain a large portion of the variation in human genomes. However, these studies have also yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, existing models are inaccurate in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes~-1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest. And second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics, which allows for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to non-equilibrium demography, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire range of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under population size changes and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, biases due to the incorrect assumption of equilibrium carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Our findings show that magnetic particles in RS-1 initially form randomly within the cell before localizing to the positive cell curvature.

Prior studies also suggest that biochar may have specific developmental effects on legumes, including increased root nodulation and altered morphology. We examined the growth and morphometric responses of legume and non-legume tropical trees to biochar additions in a common garden pot trial experiment. Four legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. mangium, Delonix regia, and Pterocarpus santalinus) and four non-legumes (Eucalyptus alba, Melia azedarach, Swietenia macrophylla, and Syzygium cumini) were compared in terms of sapling responses to additions of a wood-feedstock biochar applied at 10 and 20 t/ha. Overall, strong positive effects of biochar additions on sapling performance were observed, with an average increase of 30% in total biomass and a notable increase in height relative to diameter growth. Species showed pronounced differences in responses, with strong interactive effects of species and biochar treatments on growth metrics. Legume species showed an average increase somewhat higher than non-legumes; however, responses were variable among species, with the two Acacia species showing the largest responses, resulting in a non-significant pattern. A literature-based meta-analysis of tropical and subtropical trees likewise suggests higher biochar responses in legumes, but also falls short of statistical significance. In addition, experimental results indicate large interactive effects of species and biochar on soil pH and other soil properties. High growth responses of certain taxa of legumes (and other taxa) to biochar, and pronounced species-specific effects on soil properties, may reflect evolved responses to fire disturbance that can be leveraged in the context of forest restoration and enhanced carbon sequestration in degraded tropical landscapes.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Given that both the AKAP11-Protein Kinase A (PKA) complex and Li target and inhibit Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta (GSK3{beta}), we hypothesize that Li may partially normalize the transcriptomic and/or epigenomic alterations observed in heterozygous AKAP11-knockout (Het-AKAP11-KO) iPSC-derived neurons. In this study, we employed genome-wide approaches to assess the effects of Li on the transcriptome and epigenome of human iPSC-derived Het-AKAP11-KO neuronal culture. We show that chronic Li treatment in this cellular model upregulates key pathways that were initially downregulated by Het-AKAP11-KO, several of which have also been reported as downregulated in synapses of BD and SCZ post-mortem brain tissues. Moreover, we demonstrated that Li treatment partially rescues certain transcriptomic alterations resulting from Het-AKAP11-KO, bringing them closer to the WT state. We suggest two possible mechanisms underlying these transcriptomic effects: (1) Li modulates histone H3K27ac levels at intergenic and intronic enhancers, influencing enhancer activity and transcription factor binding, and (2) Li enhances GSK3{beta} serine 9 phosphorylation, impacting WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling and downstream transcription.

However, little is known about the neural circuits of the PF that are involved in the regulation of self-grooming behavior in rodents.

Chemogenetic activation of Cbln2+ PF neurons significantly reduces both physiological and pathological self-grooming, and chemogenetic inhibition of Cbln2+ PF neurons increases physiological self-grooming. Moreover, activating synaptic excitatory inputs to Cbln2+ PF neurons inhibits self-grooming, while synaptic inhibitory inputs enhance it. Cbln2+ PF neurons independently transmit neural signals to the dorsal and ventral striatum. Activation of PF-dorsal striatum and PF-ventral striatum pathways both inhibit self-grooming behavior.

Although many tools exist to characterize protein-binding pockets in silico, this is not yet the case for RNA, which has only recently been recognized as a suitable target for small ligands. Molecular Interaction Fields (MIF) are a useful tool to characterize the interactions of a given binding pocket. However, classical MIFs heavily rely on the use of probes, which makes their calculation accurate but very specific to the binding partners in question. We develop here a simple version of MIF, that we call Statistical Molecular Interaction Fields (SMIF), based on functional forms inspired by coarse-grained models and parametrized based on PDB structures and previous statistical analysis of the main form of interactions typical of macromolecules, namely hydrogen bonding, stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. We show that these fields, despite their simplicity, are very informative and overall in agreement with pharmacophoric models. Thanks to a carefully optimized code, our calculations are fast and can be performed in bulk on a large set of binding pockets or even on a full macromolecule. As shown in a few representative examples, the latter possibility opens the way to the analysis of systems as large as 20000 to 80000 atoms in relation to the surrounding environment, i.e., a lipidic membrane, a small ligand, or another macromolecular partner, allowing for a detailed visualization of the possible interactions.

J.; Klasson, L.", "abstract": "Background: Long-term persistent symbiotic associations may result in co-speciation and can be inferred if species trees of hosts and symbionts are congruent in topology and divergence times. Co-speciation has been seen to occur relatively frequently in obligate associations, but is less common in parasitic or facultative ones, mainly due to the difference in horizontal transmission rates. The long-term vertical inheritance and close host association of obligate endosymbionts also generally result in smaller genomes than in facultative endosymbionts. Here, we investigate co-speciation and genome reduction using highly similar strains of the endosymbiont Wolbachia infecting Drosophila species from the willistoni and saltans groups, where only one strain, wPau, infecting D. paulistorum, is obligate. Results: We sequenced the Wolbachia genomes from five species of the willistoni and saltans groups and constructed phylogenies. Topological congruence was found between these Wolbachia strains and the nuclear DNA of their hosts, except for wPau and D. paulistorum, but full topological congruence was observed between Wolbachia and the host mitochondrial DNA. However, assuming temporal congruence, we estimated extremely low evolutionary rates in Wolbachia of 10-10-10-11 changes/site/year. Additionally, the obligate wPau strain was found to have a larger genome than closely related facultative strains, mainly due to an ongoing expansion of an IS4 element. Furthermore, wPau has lost a large proportion of its prophage WO genes, but the cif genes, known to be involved in the CI phenotype, are intact. Finally, nine of the eleven genes from the prophage WO-associated Undecim cluster are uniquely duplicated. Conclusions: The congruent topologies between Wolbachia and their willistoni and saltans group hosts indicate co-speciation. However, the high similarity between Wolbachia strains, which results in low mutation rate estimates, challenges this interpretation. Contrary to the expectations of the genome reduction theory, we observed an increase in genome size in the obligate wPau strain, potentially driven by a decreased population size. Finally, the duplication of the Undecim cluster despite a major loss of other prophage-associated genes suggests that the genes in the Undecim cluster are under strong selection and potentially play a role in the obligate association between wPau and their D. paulistorum hosts.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

CBP and ChiS are the SBP-HK pair that activate the chitin utilization program of Vibrio cholerae. Here, we elucidate the molecular basis for allosteric regulation of CBP-ChiS by generating structural models of this complex in the unliganded and liganded states, which we support with extensive genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analysis. Our results reveal that ligand-binding induces a large conformational interface switch that is distinct from previously described SBP-HKs. Structural modeling suggests that similar interface switches may also regulate other uncharacterized SBP-HKs. Together, these results extend our understanding of signal transduction in bacterial species and highlight a new approach for uncovering the molecular basis of allostery in protein complexes.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a prominent bacterium isolated from diabetic wound infections and in a murine model of diabetic wound infection, GBS stimulates an influx of neutrophils into the wound. Utilizing a transposon mutant screen, we identified 291 bacterial genes required for fitness during diabetic wound infection including enzymes involved in glycolipid biosynthesis and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) alanylation. GBS mutants lacking either LTA alanylation ({triangleup}dltA) or all glycolipids ({triangleup}iagB) are attenuated in a murine diabetic wound infection. GBS induces primary and secondary degranulation in primary human neutrophils and the {triangleup}iagB mutant is significantly more susceptible to neutrophil killing by cationic antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species than {triangleup}dltA.

IFN-gamma producing CD4+ T cells are necessary but insufficient for protection against infection. In humans, the development of IL-17A producing Th17 T cells correlates with protection, however not all individuals develop a Th17 response. In mice, experimental vaccines can elicit protective Th17 cells, yet Th17s are rare in primary infection. Why Mtb fails to consistently elicit Th17s is unknown. Here, we identify factors suppressing Th17 responses during primary infection. We demonstrate that the lack of Th17 induction is independent of route and duration. Next, using Tbet deficient mice, we show that Mtb drives a Th1 response that is only partially protective and limits Th17 cell production in an IFN-{gamma} independent manner. We further reveal that the ESX-1 type VII alternative secretion system and lipid PDIM suppresses Th17 responses. Infection with ESX-1 or PDIM mutants results in significantly increased Th17 T cells and IL-17A cytokine in the lungs, and infection of IL-17A deficient animals partially restores virulence of ESX-1 and PDIM mutants. Although the ESX-1 secretion system and lipid PDIM elicits type I IFN, which can suppress Th17 differentiation, we find that suppression of Th17 is independent of type I IFN. Instead, ESX-1 and PDIM suppresses production of IL-23, a cytokine that promotes Th17 differentiation, in dendritic cells found in mediastinal lymph nodes during Mtb infection. These findings define a new function of the ESX-1 secretion system and PDIM in Mtb virulence, a long-standing question in tuberculosis research.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant  mating-type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far unisexual reproduction has never been directly observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans. Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in both chaperoning and activating G proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans. Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, we found that deletion of both GPA2 and GPA3 in the MAT background leads to self-filamentation without sporulation, suggesting that differential modulation of the G proteins, likely involving Ric8, could underlie the switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus. Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and could modulate sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungi and microbial eukaryotes as well.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via receptors in post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in female California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or NAc to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and had less robust effects on vigilance when interacting with a target mouse behind a wire barrier. In this large arena, where mice could control their proximity to a target mouse, BNST OTR knockdown also increased investigation of a non-social stimulus (empty cage). Behavioral effects of BNST OTR knockdown were weaker in the small arena where focal mice physically interacted with target mice.

In this study, we systematically investigated these paralogs by employing a targeted bioinformatics pipeline, revealing notable diversity in polyhydroxyalkanoate synthases among Halobacteriales and underscoring the distinctiveness of H. mediterranei. We further analyzed the native transcriptional expression profiles of all phaC paralogs under three physiologically relevant conditions: growth-limiting and growth-permissive conditions, as well as valeric acid supplementation to alter polyhydroxyalkanoate monomer composition. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that all three paralogs are transcriptionally active and differentially expressed, refuting earlier assumptions of their cryptic nature. Expression patterns were found not to correlate to polymer composition but to be dependent on growth phase, suggesting a potential physiological role for each paralog in native polyhydroxyalkanoate metabolism.

To investigate the relative contributions of the between-house, between-village, and between-year variations, as well as other house-level covariates such as inhabitant number and bed net usage, intensive Pyrethroid Spray Catches (PSC) sampling was conducted across a 60-month period between 2012-2019 from four villages in the Sudano-Sahelian region of Burkina Faso. For mosquito density, measured by counts of female Anopheles gambiae s.l., our modelling showed that the between-house variation was the largest component, followed by the between-year then between-village variation, after accounting for seasonality and other covariates. Density increased with the number of inhabitants within a household but was uncorrelated with bed net usage. A subset of female mosquitoes was genotyped for species identification, and the composition of An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, the two dominant vectors in the region, varied hugely across villages without a clear seasonal trend. The between-village variance contributed up to 76% of the total random variation, followed by the between-year variance. The between-house variation was estimated to be statistically insignificant. Neither household size nor bed net usage had any impact on species composition. In short, the relative importance of the random components in mosquito density was in the reverse order from species composition.

Due to a lack of ROCK2 specific inhibitors, previous pharmacological studies of ROCK function have relied on pan-ROCK1/2 inhibition. Here, we use the ROCK2 specific inhibitor, GV101, in the context of breast cancer (BC) models to uncouple the effects of ROCK2 pharmacological inhibition on both epithelial and stromal fibroblast cell populations. We demonstrate that ROCK2 inhibition with GV101 reduces fibroblast-mediated remodelling of pre-existing and de novo synthesised ECM resulting in a reduction in biomechanical stiffness, while also limiting epithelial cell growth in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that ROCK2 inhibition exposes epithelial cell vulnerability to fluid flow-induced shear stress. Furthermore, using 3D co-cultures we reveal that GV101 reduces single-cell migratory capacity, while the disruption of stromal ECM architecture is sufficient to impede collective cell migration and invasion. Finally, we assessed ROCK2 expression in human BC patient tumours revealing that ROCK2 expression is up-regulated during BC progression and that high ROCK2 expression correlates with poor patient outcome in the triple-negative subtype of BC. Together, these results demonstrate that ROCK2 specific inhibition disrupts key functions in both epithelial cell and stromal fibroblast compartments warranting further assessment of ROCK2 in highly proliferative, fibrotic or metastatic diseases, such as BC.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Removing KIAA0408 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids results in an impaired cortical organization characterized by abnormal cell fate and patterning defects, including the depletion of intermediate and ventral progenitors. Molecularly, KIAA0408 codes for a 79-kilodalton centriolar distal appendage protein (DAP) that controls cilium biogenesis (hereafter CCB79). CCB79 forms a complex with other DAP components and specifically localizes in the DAP at the onset of ciliogenesis, and its absence blocks ciliogenesis. Mechanistically, progenitors in 3D brain tissues are unable to form cilia, which induces aberrant hedgehog signaling and causes premature differentiation.

The Pfam database contains a large collection of proteins that are nowadays annotated with domain families through multiple sequence alignments and profile Hidden Markov models (pHMMs). However, such computational annotation methods have some limitations such as problems for handling large datasets and the fact that multiple sequence alignments are computationally challenging to compute with high accuracy due to the increase in complexity as the number of sequences and lengths grow. Additionally, each HMM is independently obtained for each family missing the opportunity of learning patterns across families, that is from a complete view of all the dataset. As an alternative, some deep learning (DL) models have been recently proposed, nevertheless with simple representations of the inputs and moderate improvements in performance. Results: In this work we present ET-Pfam, a novel approach based on transfer learning and ensembles of multiple DL classifiers to predict functional families in the Pfam database. Several base DL models are first trained using learned representations from a protein large language model, with different hyperparameters to increase diversity. Then, the base models are integrated using classical ensemble strategies and novel voting approaches by learning weights for each model and for each Pfam family. Results demonstrate that the proposed ET-Pfam method can consistently diminish classification error rates compared to individual DL models and to pHMM models, boosting prediction performance. Among the strategies presented here, the learned weights by family voting achieved the best performance, with the lowest error rate (7.00%), significantly surpassing the best individual model error (12.91%) and the state-of-the-art pHMM error (29.28%) on the same Pfam dataset.Availability: Data and source code are available at https://github.com/sinc-lab/ET-Pfam.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Failure to do so is catastrophic for fertility and offspring health. However, Lepidopteran (moths and butterflies) males produce two morphs of sperm: nucleated (eupyrene) sperm which fertilize the egg, and anucleated (apyrene) sperm, both of which are essential for fertilization. The meiotic differences in the two types of spermatogenesis have not been well characterized, and our knowledge of the molecular differences between eupyrene and apyrene spermatogenesis are extremely limited in all systems. The only factor identified as being required for apyrene spermatogenesis is Sex-lethal (Sxl). Here, we show through cytological analysis of early meiotic events that there are several key differences in the genesis of apyrene sperm and eupyrene sperm. Specifically, apyrene spermatocytes fail to condense and pair their chromosomes during meiotic prophase I. In addition, telomeres do not attach to the nuclear envelope. Due to these differences, full-length synaptonemal complex does not form. RNA sequencing of both eupyrene- and apyrene-producing testes revealed distinct changes in transcriptional programs, including down-regulation of a myriad of meiotic genes and cell cycle checkpoint factors during apyrene meiosis. By comparing wild-type and Sxl-knockout apyrene testes, we found that Sxl is not required for the changes in the expression of the meiotic genes but instead plays a role in checkpoint inactivation to allow this error-prone meiosis to proceed.

Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from neurons from across the human brain to identify gene co-expression networks, then weight them by polygenic heritability to implicate more-specific biology in neuropsychiatric disorders. Using this framework, we highlight the dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis as an etiological driver of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further supporting these results, we find that a critical component of this molecular system, the P-type calcium ATPase ATP2B2, exhibits marked expression deficits in both nuclear transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of individuals with schizophrenia. We then developed a method that uses missense variants in case-control cohorts together with protein structures (inferred from AlphaFold3) to systematically prioritize mutational hotspots of biological significance for downstream mechanistic interrogation. This approach identified an enrichment of deleterious missense variants - implicated across multiple neuropsychiatric disorders - that changed protein residues in close spatial proximity to both the Ca2+ permeation tunnel and the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site of ATP2B2. Cellular and biochemical analyses of variants in both the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site and the canonical Ca2+ binding site revealed clear loss-of-function effects, establishing two distinct molecular mechanisms that converge on impaired calcium extrusion, likely perturbing pre- and post-synaptic Ca2+ homeostatic equilibrium.

Here, we investigated the effects of tumor-derived VEGF-C on the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy with avian paramyxoviruses APMV-1 (NDV) and AMPV-4. Treatment of B16F10 tumors not expressing VEGF-C with either virus led to tumor growth delay, and complete responses were rare. In contrast, when tumors expressed VEGF-C, viral therapy led to complete remission and long-term immunological memory in most mice. Upon re-challenge, most mice remained tumor- and metastasis-free for over 18 months, indicating durable immunity. VEGF-C induced tumor lymphangiogenesis, which correlated with high CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell densities in proximity of lymphatic vessels. Spectral flow cytometry revealed distinct changes in the composition and activation of CD8+, CD4+ T cells and NK cells associated with complete remission. In responders, tumors were highly enriched in CD8+CD25+ PD-1+ effector T cells. Composition of T cells was altered in sentinel and in contralateral lymph nodes, indicating a systemic immune response. Taken together, these data demonstrate VEGF-C-induced changes in tumor immune landscape which are critical for achieving complete response and support combining VEGF-C with APMV virotherapy as a novel highly effective strategy for cancer treatment.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Tetracycline (Tet)-inducible gene regulation has been a long-standing and effective approach for overexpression, RNAi and genome wide screens. The single inducer Tet-On system has been foundational for studying essential genes that are required for biological processes and identifying potential drug targets. To achieve greater flexibility in experimental design, we capitalized upon previously described dual inducer systems that combined vanillic acid (Van) or cumate (Cym) with Tet as inducers. Here we report the development of a triple inducer system combining Cym, Van and Tet repressor elements to selectively regulate the expression of three genetic elements within a single cell line called PHITER. As proof of principle to demonstrate independent control, we adapted the previously characterized Van/Tet dual inducer RNAi complementation cell line, IBCompVaT for additional Cym inducible expression of an eGFP reporter. We provide evidence that each of the inducer elements operate independently with no evidence of leaky expression. In this system, Cym induction is specific and tunable. Additionally, simultaneous triple induction for POLIB RNAi complementation with wildtype POLIB and eGFP expression phenocopied the near complete rescue of POLIB RNAi previously reported. This system enables the study of complex and pleiotropic phenotypes through more sophisticated experimental design.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Microbial community structure can be heavily influenced by microbe-microbe interactions, host genetics and environmental factors. Here, we characterize the host population genetic structure, and bacterial and fungal communities in natural populations of the West Nile virus mosquito vector Culex tarsalis. Mosquitoes were collected and analyzed across the species range of the mosquito in the United States, where we used PoolRADSeq to quantify population genetic structure. Microbial community composition was characterized using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region) and fungal ITS sequencing (ITS1 region). Results: PoolRADSeq identified four broad genetic clusters of mosquito populations, which corresponded to previous clusters identified by microsatellite analysis and RADSeq on individual mosquitoes. Microbiome diversity grouped mosquito populations into three broad clusters, with each cluster distinctively represented by diagnostic abundant bacteria (Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, or Zymobacter/Providencia, respectively). Clustering for fungal taxa was less pronounced. Geographic distance between populations was positively correlated with microbiome community dissimilarity, and multiple environmental factors were significantly correlated with microbial species richness and diversity. Conclusions: These results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities are geographically structured in Cx. tarsalis, interact with important environmental factors, and are partially correlated with host genetic structure. As microbiota can affect the ability for mosquitoes to transmit pathogens, understanding the factors underpinning microbiome variation across space and time has important implications for the spread of vector-borne pathogens such as WNV.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Slow brain signals at different frequencies are thought to support distinct functional processes, but their contribution to shaping large-scale cortical organization across development remains unclear. Here, we map the maturation of cortical organization by decomposing spontaneous slow brain activity into multiple frequency bands in participants aged 6-19 years. We identify a reproducible three-stage progression - child-like, transitional, and adult-like configurations - whose timing depends on frequency: faster dynamics mature earliest, intermediate frequencies develop gradually, and lower-frequency dynamics reorganize abruptly around puberty. Individual cognitive and social traits modulate these trajectories: children with higher social anxiety or higher IQ reach adult-like configurations earlier in specific frequency bands, whereas lower-IQ children show generalized delays. These results reveal that cortical organization matures along multiple, frequency-specific timescales and that intellectual and socio-emotional factors shape its pace. Our multi-frequency framework provides a new perspective on hierarchical brain development and may inform biomarkers for atypical neurodevelopment.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

As the site of action potential initiation, the AIS has been postulated to rapidly change its length in response to increased or decreased cellular and circuit activity. To date, AIS structural plasticity has only been tested in tissue cultures and rodent models. In our current study, we assess the ability of neurons to alter their AIS length over a variety of timescales in ex vivo rodent and human brain slices, human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and in mice dark-reared during early life; using a combination of electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We find no evidence for changes to AIS length following depolarisation for up to 3 hours, despite positive controls confirming modulated activity. However, we do find that neuronal physiological properties are altered by changes in activity, but these are largely independent of action potential initiation associated with the AIS.

Likelihood-based methods can identify introgression between sisters but the test exhibits several nonstandard features, including boundary problems, indeterminate parameters, and multiple routes from the alternative to the null hypotheses. In the Bayesian test, those irregularities pose challenges to the use of the Savage-Dickey (S-D) density ratio to calculate the Bayes factor. Here we develop a theory for applying the S-D approach under nonstandard conditions. We show that the Bayesian test of introgression between sister lineages has low false-positive rates and high power. We discuss issues surrounding the estimation of the rate of gene flow, especially at very low or very high rates.

J.; Lozano, A.", "abstract": "Animal models can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders. Yet, significant translational challenges persist, as laboratory behavioral assays are often reductionistic, with limited attention to ethologically relevant behavioral diversity. Recent advances in high-throughput pose-estimation tools and computational ethology methods are addressing this limitation by enhancing the resolution and validity of behavioral phenotyping. In this context, it is known that early life stress (ELS) reshapes how animals handle subsequent threats later in life, but the fine-scale dynamics and ethological details of this shift remain elusive. To overcome this, we combined a deep-learning pose-estimation pipeline (DeepLabCut) with a supervised freezing classifier (SimBA) and an unsupervised behavioral motifs identification platform (keypoint MoSeq) to study in detail the diversity and dynamics of behavior in an auditory fear-conditioning (FC) paradigm in two independent cohorts of adult male mice that were exposed to ELS through the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm. We first validated the blunted freezing response after ELS in a supervised manner using SimBA. Next, keypoint MoSeq segmented the same pose-estimation data into ethologically meaningful motifs over time. When compared to control animals, ELS offspring showed an altered FC response, reduced behavioral entropy and limited diversity in their behavioral repertoire. Such response was characterized by longer active-behavior bouts and more recurrent transitions between states, indicating a more stereotyped and predictable response. Multidimensional scaling of time-binned behavioral vectors and distance metrics identified a resilient subpopulation within the ELS group that displayed a control-like behavioral profile, characterized by a steeper increase in freezing behavior during the FC task and a more diverse behavioral repertoire with reduced recurrence of stereotyped actions, less frequent and shorter active bouts and prolonged passive responses. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS shifts the balance between passive and active coping strategies and that resilience is marked by a less stereotypical yet more diverse and flexible behavioral response to a subsequent stressful demand. Finally, we further validated the unsupervised behavioral motifs with a predictive model that identified distinctive kinematic features of these responses, which could be used to build new behavioral classifiers that can be applied in other behavioral paradigms. These results demonstrate the potential of computational ethology to dissect complex behavioral patterns and improve our understanding of individual stress responses. By combining supervised and unsupervised behavioral analysis tools, we can deepen our understanding of the latent structure of stress behavior and identify objective markers of vulnerability and resilience.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Cortical organoids provide a unique platform to investigate these mechanisms in isolation from subcortical and long-range cortical inputs. Here we illustrate how cortical organoids respond to ES, identifying the response profiles of isolated cortical circuits while detailing a roadmap of how ES parameters affect the organoid spiking activity. We employed a high-density multielectrode array to record neuronal activity from cortical organoids (n=417 units in N=7 organoids) during ES, systematically varying stimulation frequency, intensity, pulse width, and charge density. By analyzing single unit spiking activity, we found that ES elicits excitatory, inhibitory, and mixed responses in 39%, 12%, and 17% of the units, respectively. On average, this response lasted 100 ms and became stable within 26 trials. The magnitude of both excitatory and inhibitory responses was maximal near the stimulation site and decayed with distance. The response magnitude was inversely correlated with pulse intensity and duration, but not with stimulation frequency and charge density. These findings demonstrate that local cortical circuits are sufficient to initiate the early excitatory phase of the canonical ES response, whose magnitude depends on ES parameters, and can sustain the excitatory phase for over 100 ms. The reduced late inhibitory phase, together with the absence of late excitatory components observed 200 ms after ES in intact adult brains in-vivo, suggests that these phases may depend on neuronal maturation or inter-area connections. Our work thus establishes cortical organoids as a framework for studying the local contributions to ES-induced activity in a developmental model of the human cortex.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Increasing computational power has allowed human evolutionary history to be modeled at ever-larger scales, but simulations that encompass the complete human genome, including sex chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA, have been difficult due to the lack of support for whole-genome models in commonly used evolutionary simulation frameworks.

While some GBA1 variants are associated with both GD and PD, several coding mutations, including E326K, specifically confer risk for developing PD. It is established that GD-linked variants in beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme encoded by GBA1, are loss-of-function, but it remains unclear whether variants solely associated with PD similarly reduce GCase activity. The mechanisms by which some of these variants impact GCase activity and PD-associated pathways, including lysosomal and mitochondrial function, are also poorly defined. Here, we show that the PD-linked E326K variant significantly reduces lysosomal GCase activity by impairing its delivery to lysosomes via altered interactions with its receptor, LIMP2. Biophysical and structural characterization of this variant, both alone and in complex with LIMP2, reveals a dimeric organization that appears to result from the loss of a key salt bridge between E326 and R329. Restoration of this salt bridge through the introduction of a negatively charged side chain at position 329 promotes monomeric organization and interaction with LIMP2 in cells. GBA1-p.E326K cell models show greater deficits in PD-linked pathways compared to more severe loss of GCase function, including secondary lysosomal lipid storage and mitochondrial dysfunction. We confirm the E326K variant impacts GCase pathway activity in relevant CNS cell types, including iPSC-derived microglia, and in biofluids from heterozygous GBA1-p.E326K variant carriers.

Genome-wide profiling at an early recovery time point revealed ~1,100 PRC2 nucleation sites, characterized by rapid Suz12 and histone H3K27me3 re-accumulation with strong signal, with minimal impact on gene expression. These sites were significantly enriched at bivalent promoters, coinciding with unmethylated CpG islands and chromatin states associated with developmental regulation, and were largely conserved in differentiated cells.

Notably, a subset of nucleation sites overlapped with long-range chromatin interaction anchors in histone H3K27me3 HiChIP datasets.

Methods: Mice were subjected to dietary restriction (DR) and ad libitum (AL) dietary regime. FACS-sorted DR and AL Paneth cells and Lgr5+ stem cells were co-cultured, and organoid formation supportive capacity of Paneth cells was assessed. The role of Gpt2, a Paneth cell specific mitochondrial alanine transaminase, was investigated by targeting pharmacologically and genetically in the intestinal organoids. By using U-13C labelled Alanine, an intercellular metabolic exchange assay was developed, and a conversion and transport of lactate from Paneth cells to stem cells, was followed by metabolomics. The in vivo role of Gpt2 was investigated in a conditional knock out mouse model. Results: We discovered that an increase in ISC function upon dietary restriction (DR) or DR mimicking condition, is dependent on Gpt2 in Paneth cells. Metabolic tracing of alanine directly showed DR boosts Paneth cell alanine catabolism, increasing lactate production via gluconeogenesis. Alanine derived lactate is shuttled from Paneth cells to neighboring stem cells, promoting TCA cycle and enhancing the ISC function during DR. Correspondingly, pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and genetic targeting of Gpt2 in vivo abolished the DR induced capacity of Paneth cells to support ISC function.

The clock-enhancing properties of naringenin suppressed lipogenesis in mature adipocytes together with induction of browning characteristics. The inhibitory effect of naringenin on lipogenesis was dependent on clock modulation as it was abolished in ROR-deficient adipocytes. We further show that naringenin administration in vivo up-regulated ROR expression with clock gene induction together with browning of subcutaneous beige fat depot, resulting reduced fat mass and body weight. Naringenin treatment in vivo also lowered plasma glucose and free fatty acid levels, with markedly enhanced insulin signaling in adipose depots and skeletal muscle. Collectively, our findings uncover a new clock-activating mechanism of action in mediating the metabolic benefits of naringenin, suggesting its potential as a natural supplement for anti-obesity and metabolic disease interventions.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Smits, S.; van Wesel, A.; Wubbolts, R.; Vader, P.", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in intercellular communication, facilitated by the transfer of RNA and other molecular cargo between cells. However, how EV-RNA is processed in recipient cells remains poorly understood, particularly the uptake and intracellular trafficking pathways leading to functional transfer remains elusive. Visualizing EV-RNA in recipient cells may help to address these knowledge gaps. Although EV labeling methods are well-established, tracking endogenous RNA cargo within EVs and in recipient cells is challenging due to its low abundance, requiring highly sensitive labeling methods. Existing RNA labeling methods often lack sensitivity, specificity for donor cell-derived RNA, or are limited to labeling long RNA species. In this study, we propose a novel metabolic labeling approach to track RNA in donor cells, EVs and recipient cells using 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU). 5-EU is a nucleoside analog of uridine that is incorporated into nascent RNA and can be detected through click chemistry with a fluorescent azide. To enhance RNA labeling efficiency, we overexpressed Uridine-Cytidine Kinase 2 (UCK2) in MDA-MB-231 donor cells, which increased 5-EU incorporation into nascent RNA chains. This approach allowed visualization and quantification of RNA in isolated EVs. Furthermore, co-culturing MDA-MB-231 UCK2+ donor cells expressing a CD63-HaloTag fusion protein with HMEC1-eGFP+ recipient cells enabled visualization and quantification of intercellular transfer of EVs and their endogenous RNA cargo. This novel approach offers a sensitive and specific tool for studying physiological EV-RNA transfer, thereby advancing our understanding of the biological roles of EVs in intercellular communication.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We identify a stress response pathway connecting the nucleolus to the Golgi apparatus, endo-lysosomal trafficking, and cellular secretion (NuGETS). Chronic nucleolar defects activate a TP53-dependent transcriptional program that promotes organelle expansion, enhances secretory activity, and induces cell cycle exit with prolonged quiescence and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) phenotypes. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen uncovered 400 regulators of secretory and quiescent states upon nucleolar stress. These pathways are enriched in cancer progression associated with ribosomopathies.

However, few in vivo models enable studying how stem cell fates are specified as neurons in an adult body. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea provides a powerful system for investigating these mechanisms, owing to its abundant adult pluripotent stem cells, termed neoblasts, and its capacity to regenerate a molecularly complex nervous system. The SoxB1 family of transcription factors is broadly implicated in ectodermal lineage commitment. In planarians, the SoxB1 homolog soxB1-2 has been shown to promote neural and epidermal differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which soxB1-2 influences chromatin dynamics and transcriptional programs during adult neurogenesis remain unknown. To address this, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on neural-rich head tissues to assess how soxB1-2 RNAi knockdown alters chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Disrupting soxB1-2 resulted in reduced chromatin accessibility and transcriptional downregulation at neural and epidermal loci, consistent with a pioneer-like role in chromatin priming. We identified 31 candidate downstream targets with concordant accessibility and expression changes, including the transcription factors castor and mecom, which regulate mechanosensory and ion transport genes. Head tissue sampling enabled the detection of soxB1-2-responsive genes within rare neural subtypes that were missed in our previous whole-body RNA-seq experiments.

We detect lineage-specific variation in genome-wide mutation rates, showing that DNA polymerase gene losses correlate with increased genetic variation.

We provide evidence that the cell cycle of Rhizophagus irregularis is active when in symbiosis with a host, but not without. This indicates a higher level of integration between AM fungi and plants than previously appreciated, and suggests the existence of a regulatory or functional contribution provided by a host to the fungal cell cycle.

Retinoic acid signaling, acting on both HSCs and niche cells, has emerged as a central regulator of this process. Among ME components, BM adipocytes (BMAs), which can comprise up to 45% of BM volume and expand dramatically during the pancytopenic phase after myeloablation, play a previously underappreciated role in hematopoietic recovery. Here, we identify retinoid X receptor (RXR) signaling in BMAs as a key regulator of the adipokine Resistin, which promotes HSC self-renewal and functional fitness by activating NF-kB signaling. Conditional loss of RXR in adiponectin-expressing cells suppressed Resistin production, resulting in reduced NF-kB activity in HSCs, impaired self-renewal, and defective multilineage hematopoietic regeneration. Functionally, in vivo Resistin neutralization impaired hematopoietic reconstitution, whereas supplementation with either monomeric or dimeric Resistin enhanced HSC self-renewal and long-term lympho-hematopoietic reconstitution in an NF-kB dependent manner. Together, these findings establish BMA-derived Resistin as an RXR-dependent, critical extrinsic regulator of HSC self-renewal and regenerative hematopoiesis, underscoring its essential role in lympho-myeloid reconstitution after myeloablation.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

This study examined the impact of elevated post-flowering temperatures (32{degrees}C/25{degrees}C, day/night) combined with two watering regimes (40% and 10% field capacity) on chickpea genotypes. Elvar and Electra, top-yielding Portuguese genotypes well adapted to southern Portugal's dry climate were evaluated. Under controlled high-temperature conditions (Phenolab), reproductive cycle was shortened to 30-35 days, compared with 65 days under greenhouse conditions (24{degrees}C/18{degrees}C). Water use peaked soon after flowering and declined after 19 days, regardless of genotype or watering regime, suggesting a physiological limitation on water use. Elevated temperature strongly reduced seed number and weight while altering composition. Nutrient density improved, with higher protein and mineral levels (P, Mg, S, Mo, Fe, Zn) and lower starch content, highlighting a consistent protein-starch trade-off unaffected by water availability. While growth environment largely determined composition, enzymatic activity patterns revealed genotype-specific differences in carbon metabolism (e.g. sucrose synthase, cell wall invertase, aldolase and phosphoglucose isomerase).

Here we adopt an operational definition of interpretability, specifically that a model is described by an arrow diagram wherein each arrow corresponds to a positive effect or negative effect of one component upon a process, and fewer arrows is more interpretable than more arrows. We then develop a method to add flexibility - and thus accuracy in fitting data - to mathematical models by relaxing functional form assumptions, while constrained by the same arrow diagram and thus the same interpretability. We apply this method to the T cell, where quantitative models are particularly needed, in part because of ongoing efforts to engineer T cells as therapeutics. Recent experiments exposed T cells to pulsatile inputs and measured their frequency response, and found several nonlinear frequency responses: high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, and band-stop. Using our modeling approach with enhanced flexibility, we show that a simple signaling model quantitatively captures the frequency response of CD69 surface expression, one of the correlates of T cells activation, with accuracy within the experimental inter-replicate standard error of the mean. Specific qualitative behaviors map to specific parts of the arrow diagram: Band-pass behavior can be explained by refractory de-sensitizing circuit (we refer to this as \"first-aid icing a wound\"). Band-stop behavior can be explained by removal-inhibition (we refer to this as \"roommate interrupts my studying\"). Apparent low-pass emerges naturally when total stimulation time is constant. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability to achieve both quantitative prediction and interpretability in understanding cellular dynamics. Simple models may at first appear incapable of explaining complex data, but might indeed be able to by adding this modest flexibility.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we use high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological sectioning, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to characterize the fine morphology and material composition of the cuticle of ant valvilli. We report structural differentiation within the valvilli, including sharply delimited material zones that may correspond to distinct mechanical properties. CLSM imaging highlights variation in sclerotization, resilin distribution, and ultrastructure, indicating that the valvilli are not uniform flap-like elements but rather complex, partially deformable structures. Furthermore, comparative micro-CT scans of stingers fixed in different actuation states indicate the involvement of a non-antiphasic pattern of valvilli movement during stinger deployment, challenging the current understanding of valvilli-assisted pumping based on rhythmic, alternating movements, as inferred from European honeybees. These findings offer new anatomical insight into the architecture of the ant stinger and provide a refined morphological basis for future studies of venom delivery mechanisms in Hymenoptera; to also foster our understanding of the complex functionality of micro-scale injection and pumping systems in insects.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We studied how aging affects GSC fitness in the protochordate Botryllus schlosseri, an evolutionary crosspoint between invertebrates and vertebrates.

Moreover, their function was validated through a novel lineage tracing approach that combines membrane-labeled GSC transplantation with scRNA-Seq. Leveraging our method to isolate them, single-cell transcriptomics showed significant age-related changes between young and old GSCs. Spermatids and sperm, however, showed minimal changes, suggesting that reproductive aging is governed by GSCs rather than by gametes. Reduced expressions of markers like DDX4 and PIWIL1 in aged GSCs mirrored trends in mammalian datasets, pointing to a conserved GSC-driven aging mechanism across chordate evolution.

Haploid mammalian pluripotent stem cells, in all derived species to date - mouse, human and rat - undergo spontaneous diploidization. Here, we investigated the mechanisms affecting the stability of the haploid state using the mouse and human embryo, as well as a human embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that diploidization occurs early in preimplantation development and is often unproductive, with haploid embryos exhibiting decreased developmental potential. Haploid embryos show increased chromosome segregation errors at the first mitosis, failure to align chromosomes on the metaphase plate in the second mitosis. Delayed mitotic progression and failure to form a central spindle and a midbody are followed by cytokinesis failure, diploidization, increased DNA damage marked by gamma-H2AX and RPA32 foci, and low developmental potential. By increasing the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio in diploids, or reducing this ratio in haploids, these phenotypes can be induced in diploids or reduced in haploids. Changing ploidy alone from haploid to diploid without also adjusting nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio does not improve mitotic phenotypes and developmental outcomes. Thus, the most upstream driver responsible for the instability of the haploid state is a stage-specific ratio of nucleus to cell size.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Urinary exfoliated mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, muscle cells, or neuronal cells, if grown in specialized culture conditions. In this study, however, we identified the development of multiple mesodermal cell lineages from urinary exfoliated cells despite using a single culture system not designed for these cell differentiations. Methods: Urinary exfoliated cells used for culturing were obtained from pediatric patients with kidney disease. All cultures were maintained using an identical, non-specifically supplemented, rich, DMEM/F12-based growth medium, refreshed regularly throughout the experiments. Cells of different mesodermal lineages--adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes--were identified by staining with Oil Red O, Alizarin Red, and Alcian Blue solutions. Moreover, the expression of mRNA markers specific for adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes, as well as for stem cells and--more specifically--mesenchymal stem cells, was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: Although the abundances varied, in all 11 cultures of urinary exfoliated cells from six patients, dye staining revealed multiple cell clusters of mesodermal lineages. All cultures contained clusters of the adipocyte and chondrocyte lineages, and seven also contained clusters of the osteoblast lineage. Morphology differences were found even between clusters stained with the same dye. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the three lineages, while also revealing expression of genes specific to pluripotent stem cells (Nanog, Oct3/4, SOX2, and LIF) and genes more specific for mesenchymal stem cells (CD73, CD90, and CD105). Conclusions: Among urinary exfoliated cells cultured using our method, clusters of cells of mesodermal lineages were observed without needing to selectively adjust the culture medium. The cells seemed to differentiate and proliferate from mesenchymal stem cells in the urine. We envision that these initial findings may eventually contribute to a deeper understanding of urinary stem cell differentiation and to optimizing lineage-specific differentiation for research and therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Hall, I.", "abstract": "Understanding the incubation period of Legionnaires disease is vital for accurate source-term identification. Traditionally, researchers estimate the dose-dependent incubation period from human outbreak data, but this method suffers from the inability to estimate the exposure dose retrospectively for each case. This challenge limit the precision of incubation-period analysis using human case data. Existing within-host models, such as ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based and discrete-event stochastic approaches, estimate the dose-dependent incubation period of Legionnaires disease. However, discrete-event models, while useful, are so computationally costly that the within-host dynamics must be simplified to solely the Legionella and macrophage interactions. This simplification makes the computation feasible, but precludes cytokine interactions and adaptive immune response modelling. In this paper, we develop a new approach to model the within-host dynamics of Legionnaires disease that focuses on reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates and improves upon existing ODE and discrete event within-host models of Legionnaires disease. By integrating the previously developed ODE and discrete-event stochastic models with stochastic differential equation (SDE) models, we create a unified system that adapts dynamically throughout the infection process. We quantify the points at which each model becomes the optimal tool for describing the infection, resulting in a flexible simulation of disease dynamics. Our hybrid model aligns with observed human incubation-period data and is the first framework of its kind in this context.

Foraminiferal assemblages are established proxies for past sea levels, but their composition can vary seasonally and spatially, affecting the reliability of morphological reconstructions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) enables high-resolution, non-invasive monitoring of foraminiferal communities and supports high-precision RSL reconstruction. However, the spatiotemporal stability of eDNA assemblages in (sub)tropical intertidal zones and their influence on RSL reconstruction remains uncertain. We conducted a two-year eDNA monitoring study at three intertidal stations of varying tidal elevation in Hong Kong, sampling during both dry and wet seasons to assess variability in mangrove and mudflat environments. Mid-mangrove eDNA communities exhibited temporal and spatial stability. In contrast, eDNA assemblages in mudflat and upper-mangrove environments, particularly among monothalamous foraminifera taxa, showed pronounced seasonal shifts primarily driven by environmental changes. Despite this variability in the upper-mangrove, eDNA-based elevation estimates in mangrove consistently aligned with observed elevations (within 95% credible intervals), demonstrating reliability of RSL reconstructions in these environments. However, samples from mudflats, especially during the wet season, exhibited an overprediction bias, reflecting their heightened sensitivity to seasonal and exogenous eDNA inputs.

Trophic position and isotopic niche were estimated with both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, enabling the evaluation of ontogenetic isotope shifts, niche overlap, and resource use in relation to growth. ALB grew fastest had the highest trophic position, and the broadest isotopic niche. Optimally growing tuna larvae occupied the narrowest trophic niche and had lower trophic positions for all three species, supporting the hypothesis that strong trophic specialization supports better growth performance, and that feeding on more efficient shorter food chains (e.g., microbial loop via appendicularians) can enhance larval fitness. Using lower C:N ratio as a proxy of larval condition, found in optimal growing groups, supports the broader hypothesis that growth potential is closely tied to energy allocation strategies during early ontogeny. A detailed understanding of how larval trophodynamics, niche breadth, and resource partitioning interact with growth and survival during these vulnerable stages is essential for ecosystem-based management, particularly in systems where growth rate modulates predation risk and competitive fitness.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Yet modern silviculture has homogenized temperate forest structure at local and landscape scales. The consequences of this homogenization for landscape-level spider diversity, however, remain largely unknown. 2. Therefore, we sampled spiders using pitfall traps across 234 patches in a large-scale, replicated field experiment at 11 paired European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest sites in Germany. In one district per site, we experimentally diversified between-forest-patch complexity (ESBC) through canopy gap creation and deadwood enrichment and kept a second district untreated as a structurally homogeneous control. 3. We applied a novel meta-analytic framework to compare -, {beta}-, and {gamma}-diversity of spiders between treatment and control districts, standardized for sample coverage, along Hill numbers giving increasing weight to abundance and for taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. To gain a deeper insight into the effects of our intervention on the processes affecting the assembly of spider communities, we investigated the response of functional-phylogenetic diversity quantified by standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise distances (SES MFPD) to our treatments. 4. Based on 18,540 spider individuals from 206 species, treatment districts exhibited significantly lower {gamma}- and -diversity across all diversity facets and Hill numbers, particularly when focusing on rare species (q = 0). In contrast, {beta}-diversity increased in treatment districts for phylogenetic and functional diversity across all Hill numbers (q = 0, 1, 2). Although spider abundances were higher in treatment patches, functional-phylogenetic diversity decreased in gaps and ESBC districts in general, indicating a shift from limiting similarity towards habitat filtering. 5. Our findings corroborate earlier results of high abundances but lower taxonomic and functional diversity in canopy gaps due to strong habitat filtering effects, resulting in overall lower -diversity, which cannot be compensated by increasing {beta}-diversity. Hence, the greater three-dimensional complexity of homogeneous forests supports more diverse spider metacommunities at the {gamma}-scale, particularly when controlling for sample coverage, suggesting that canopy spider diversity in temperate forests may be underestimated. Nonetheless, higher abundances in treatment districts point to increased predator pressure and greater prey availability in structurally diversified forests.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by deadwood are increasingly recognised as key olfactory cues used by saproxylic beetles to locate suitable substrates. However, how beetle communities respond to these cues during the colonisation of deadwood remains poorly understood. To address this gap, it is essential to quantify both VOC emissions and beetle assemblages, and to experimentally disentangle the main ecological drivers of the deadwood volatilome (i.e., tree species, sun exposure). 2. To explore the potential role of VOCs on saproxylic beetle colonisation, we exposed 1200 freshly cut branches of oak, beech, spruce, and pine across Central Europe. To mimic natural variation in deadwood and disturbance processes, the bundles were experimentally manipulated either by sterilisation (to reduce endogenous fungi), fungal inoculation with a brown rot fungus (Fomitopsis pinicola), fungal inoculation with a white rot fungus (Fomes fomentarius), or burning. From each deadwood bundle, we sampled VOCs and reared emerging beetles. 3. From deadwood bundles, we sampled 448 substances, 89 of which were identified as VOCs, and reared 134 saproxylic beetle species. We observed distinct VOC profiles emitted by broadleaf (oak, beech) and conifer (pine, spruce) species, aligning with the beetles tree-type preferences. In conifers, bark beetles, longhorn beetles, and jewel beetles were associated with different chemical cues, whereas beetle taxonomic separation was not observed in broadleaf species. Although experimental treatments (sterilisation, fungal inoculation, burning) altered VOC composition, they could not explain beetle colonisation patterns. 4. Our study highlights that VOCs emitted during the early decay stage of deadwood are associated with distinct saproxylic beetle assemblages. VOC composition varied across tree species and treatments, suggesting that chemical variation reflects multiple ecological factors. These findings indicate that deadwood diversity, particularly in tree species, contributes to chemical heterogeneity, which is linked to broader beetle assemblages. Forest conservation efforts may therefore need to consider the role of chemical variation in deadwood, as it could influence colonisation patterns of saproxylic beetles and affect the success of biodiversity management strategies.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Understanding genetic and phenotypic divergence across these regions can give insight into speciation and diversification, as well as aid in our knowledge of how species may respond to possible climate change scenarios. Most past research has focused on temperate regions, yet it is in the tropics that organisms are thought to be the most vulnerable to rising temperatures. In addition, year-round stable temperatures in the tropics make altitudinal temperature variation more pronounced and increase the likelihood of local adaptation across relatively narrow gradients. Here we investigate how genetics and the environment influence a wide range of traits in two butterfly species, Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are widespread across the neotropics and occur along the altitudinal slope of the Andes. Using \"common garden\" rearing of over 1,000 offspring from over 70 wild females caught along an altitudinal gradient, as well as rearing of populations from either end of the altitudinal range in their reciprocal temperature environments, we find evidence of genetic, environmental, and in some cases gene-by-environment interaction effects in developmental, morphological, and thermal tolerance traits. We find parallel divergence in wing colour in both species, with wing colour darkening with increasing altitude, consistent with this playing a role in thermoregulation in these species where wing colour has mostly been linked to mimicry and mate choice. We also find evidence for gene-by-environment interactions: In H. erato we found local differences in heat acclimation response, with increased heat knock-out times at higher rearing temperatures found only in low altitude populations, which are exposed to the hottest temperatures. We find evidence for heritable genetic variation in most traits measured, with positive implications for adaptation to climate change, although our results suggest that selection may not act in a straightforward way on these traits.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Identification was assessed using a single-interval four-alternative forced-choice task. Discrimination was assessed using a three-interval oddity task, where the listener was required to pick the odd one out. While identification of time of day was generally poor, discrimination was significantly above chance, indicating that listeners could hear some differences associated with the time of day, but could not effectively use those differences to assign the correct verbal label. The contribution of level, fine spectral, temporal envelope and temporal fine structure cues to discrimination was assessed. None of these cues appeared to be critical for time of day discrimination.

TELSAM is a pH-dependent, polymer-forming protein crystallization chaperone which, when covalently fused to a protein of interest, forms a stable, well-ordered crystal lattice. However, despite its success, a challenge persists in that crystal quality and diffraction limits appear to be heavily dependent on the choice of linker between TELSAM and the protein of interest, with identification of a functional linker relying on trial-and-error methods. Likewise, previous studies revealed that the 10xHis tag at the TELSAM N-terminus can either facilitate or hinder the ordered crystallization of target proteins attached via flexible or semi-flexible linkers. To address these challenges, we designed multiple constructs with several types of linkers, rigid (helical fusion), semiflexible (Pro-Alan), and flexible (poly-Gly), of varying lengths to fuse a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) to the TELSAM C-terminus. Semi-flexible and flexible linker constructs were made with and without the 10xHis tag. Our findings indicate that short semi-flexible and rigid linkers consistently yield large crystals within 24 hours with a DARPin target protein, but that flexible linkers perform best with a TNK1 UBA domain target protein. Removing the 10xHis tag enhanced crystallization rates, improved crystal morphology, and increased the crystallization propensity of semiflexible and flexible linker constructs. While removing the His tag did not have a significant effect on crystal size, it improved the diffraction limits and crystal quality of the 1TEL-PA-DARPin construct. These results suggest that the ideal linker selection primarily depends on the properties of the target protein. Our data support the recommendation to use a short yet flexible or semi-flexible linker between TELSAM and the target protein to facilitate protein crystallization and high-resolution structure determination.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a geraniol synthase (Cymbopogon flexuosus geraniol synthase; CfGES) that catalyzes the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) (also known as geranly diphosphate) to geraniol, as well as a previously unreported geranyl pyrophosphatase (CfG(P)Pase) that acts on both GPP and geranyl monophosphate (GP), albeit with different efficiencies, to generate geraniol. Virus-induced gene silencing of CfGES or CfG(P)Pase resulted in a substantial reduction in geraniol and its immediate product citral in lemongrass leaves. Conversely, transient overexpression of CfGES or CfG(P)Pase resulted in enhanced production of geraniol and citral in lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) leaves, as well as geraniol, citronellol, and citral in rose (Rosa damascena) flower petals. Subcellular localization studies revealed that while CfGES exhibited dual cytosolic/plastidial localization, CfG(P)Pase was localized to the cytosol. This localization pattern was further supported by the significantly higher geraniol-forming activity observed in the purified cytosolic protein fraction compared to the chloroplast fraction. Our study uncovers the missing step in cytosolic geraniol formation via a TPS independent noncanonical route and demonstrates that geraniol, required for citral production in lemongrass, is synthesized by cytosolic CfG(P)Pase and cytosol-/plastid-localized CfGES.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

These phenotypes persist through the night phases, suggesting a readiness for the daylight environment that is routinely experienced despite the intervening dark periods (Dupuis & Ojeda et al. 2025). Here, we investigate how prior acclimation impacts algal fitness upon a change in daylight intensity and how quickly Chlamydomonas can reprogram its photoprotective strategy in a diurnal context. We performed a systems analysis of synchronized populations acclimated to diurnal LL when subjected to HL days and of populations acclimated to diurnal HL when subjected to LL days. In the latter case, diurnal photoacclimation decreased fitness during the first day at a new light intensity: HL-acclimated cells barely increased in size over the first LL period, and they failed to complete a cell cycle. However, although LL-acclimated cells showed severe photodamage after 6 hours of HL, they recovered chloroplast form and function later that afternoon and successfully divided at nightfall. These cells rapidly altered their thylakoid membrane ultrastructure, increased their photoprotective quenching capacity, and decreased their inventory of photosystem and antenna proteins by the end of the first HL day. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed rapid induction of thousands of genes, including those encoding proteases, chaperones, and other proteins involved in the chloroplast unfolded protein response.

Despite extensive study in other mammals, tamarin trabecular structure and fine-grained differences among leaping taxa remain poorly characterized. Materials and Methods: We examined humeral and tibial trabecular networks in four tamarin species representing short- and long-distance leapers using microCT-scans and a whole-epiphysis approach. We quantified network complexity with topological indices (node density, tortuosity, trabecular length, fractal dimension) alongside traditional metrics (degree of anisotropy [DA], bone volume fraction [BV/TV]) to capture both geometric and topological features. Results: Long leapers exhibit significantly higher node density in both humeral and tibial epiphyses and increased trabecular tortuosity in the distal humerus. Elevated node density localizes beneath the humero-scapular joint, within the proximal humerus, and in variable regions across other epiphyses. Other parameters (DA, BV/TV, trabecular length, fractal dimension) showed no leaping-related differences, instead correlating with sex and captivity. Discussion: Increased mechanical strain during longer leaps likely drives higher node density and, to a lesser extent, tortuosity in humeral and tibial epiphyses, with node density showing the strongest functional signal. While sex and captivity influence other trabecular traits, patterns in these key metrics support locomotor adaptation. Integrating whole-epiphysis analyses with novel topological indices enhances detection of subtle functional signals and complements VOI-based and traditional frameworks in comparative trabecular bone studies.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

While much is known about the major pathways regulating the UPRER, the roles of endocrine cell type-specific, context-dependent, and time-dependent transcriptional changes are not well explored. To identify unique and shared responses to the UPRER across a subset of endocrine cell types, we tested representative lines for {beta}-cells (insulin), -cells (glucagon), {delta}-cells (somatostatin), X/A-cells (ghrelin), L-cells (glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)), and thyrotropes (thyroid hormone and thyroglobulin). We exposed each cell type to the canonical ER stressor thapsigargin for 6 and 24 h, or vehicle for 24 h and performed mRNA sequencing. Analysis of the data showed all lines responded to thapsigargin. Comparisons of differentially expressed genes between each line revealed both shared and unique transcriptional signatures.

We show that apparent fluctuations in interaction strength-and even shifts in interaction signs, often interpreted as transitions between competition and facilitation-can arise intrinsically from population dynamics with fixed ecological roles. Experimental protocols further shape these estimates: the duration of observation and the type of setup in microbial growth studies (e.g., chemostats, batch cultures, or resource conditions) systematically affect measured interactions. Considering interactions across timescales enhances interpretability: short-term measurements primarily capture direct species couplings, whereas long-term observations increasingly reflect indirect community feedback.

Although habitat heterogeneity is known to enhance local species diversity, the effects of management-driven structural heterogeneity on understorey plant communities across spatial scales remain poorly understood, despite their crucial role for forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2. To analyse how forest understorey plant communities respond to an enhancement of structural heterogeneity in managed forests, we established 11 experimental sites consisting of two paired forest landscapes, an untreated homogenous control and a treatment district (ESBC). In treatment districts, structural heterogeneity was enhanced through different combinations of local patch-scale manipulations of light and deadwood features, leading to greater between-patch heterogeneity at the landscape scale. We performed a meta-analysis across these 11 sites using a Hill-Chao number and sample coverage standardisation framework. 3. Gamma diversity increased across taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets in structurally heterogeneous forests (ESBC districts) via higher alpha diversity. This effect was positively associated with heterogeneity in light availability between forest patches, but not with their mean light availability. In contrast, we found no support that species turnover among patches (i.e., beta diversity) significantly contributes on average to the observed increase in gamma diversity. However, both the direction and magnitude of beta diversity responses varied substantially among landscapes. 4. On average, structurally heterogeneous forests supported higher species richness for both open and closed forest habitat species. 5.

While species richness is commonly used to assess conservation value, it may not capture compositional differences critical for maintaining regional biodiversity. We examined how local species richness (alpha diversity) and community turnover (beta diversity) relates to forest structure and management in Swedish boreal forests. We surveyed lichens, bryophytes, and polypore fungi, representing three sessile taxo-ecological groups across 120 sites. The sites were distributed between three management types: young production forests, retention patches (trees left during harvest to support mature forest species in production forests), and unmanaged set-asides. We used generalised linear models and generalised dissimilarity modelling to assess how habitat structures (deadwood and living tree metrics) and spatial distance explained patterns of richness and turnover across taxa and management types. For all taxa, species richness increase with lying deadwood volume. Lichen species richness also increased with living tree volume, and decreased with tree density in retention patches. Lichens had higher species richness in retention patches and set-asides, whereas only set-asides had statistically higher bryophyte richness, and there were no differences for polypore richness. In contrast, beta diversity was more often associated with geographic distance, with only limited influence of deadwood volume. The relationships between lichen beta diversity and habitat structures were not consistent between retention patches and set-asides, suggesting that retention patches may have limitations in conserving mature forest species despite supporting similar lichen species richness. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that alpha and beta diversity can be driven by different ecological processes and management contexts, and that while tree retention can support higher biodiversity than young production forests in some taxa, it cannot replace the value of conserving mature forests.

We recently characterized a phenomenon, which we termed n-Phosphate collaborations (nP-collabs), where bulk cations form stable bridges between several phosphoresidues in all-atom molecular dynamic simulations. nP-collabs were found to be sensitive to the combination of forcefields and cation types. Here, we attempt to assess the physical relevance of these nP-collabs by evaluating the strength of the cation/phosphate interaction through osmotic coefficient ( {varphi}) calculations on the model 2Na+HPO42- and 2K+HPO42- salts, using different classical forcefields for phosphorylations. All forcefields were found to overestimate the strength of the interaction to various degrees. We thus designed new parameters for CHARMM36m and AmberFF99SB-ILDN using the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC) approach, which provide remarkable agreement for {varphi} values for both cation types and over a range of concentrations. We provide a preliminary test of these ECC parameters for phosphorylations by simulating the sevenfold-phosphorylated rhodopsin peptide 7PP and comparing secondary chemical shifts to experimental data. Conformational ensembles resulting from the ECC-derived phosphorylated forcefields display both qualitative and quantitative improvements with regards to full-charge forcefields. We thus conclude that long-lasting nP-collabs are artifacts for classical forcefields born from the lack of explicit polarization, and propose a possible computational strategy for the extensive parameterization of phosphorylations. The presence of long-lived nP-collabs in simulations produced using classical forcefields is therefore a serious concern for the accurate modelling of multiphosphorylated peptides and IDPs, which are at the center of research questions regarding neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

These BFAs accumulate as triglyceride components and are excreted in urine as free fatty acids with stable and individually distinctive profiles. Behavioral assays show that cats discriminate urine samples based on BFA composition, even against complex volatile backgrounds, suggesting BFAs as robust, metabolically encoded olfactory signatures for individual recognition. Comparative analyses of non-domesticated felids reveal that BFA production is broadly conserved but exhibits both species-specific and individual variation. These findings demonstrate how a core metabolic pathway has been evolutionarily co-opted into a chemical signature system.

M.-; Cataldi, J.; Siclari, F.", "abstract": "Vigilance is increasingly conceived as a continuum, ranging from full alertness to deep sleep. Despite its fundamental role in cognition, behaviour, and health, reliable physiological markers of vigilance remain limited, and clinical assessments often rely on subjective or time-consuming evaluations. Traditionally, vigilance has been estimated through visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG), identifying recognizable oscillatory patterns like rapid, wakefulness-defining alpha waves (~10 Hz) and large slow waves (~1 Hz) which typify sleep. However, these oscillatory features often appear only intermittently and follow complex, non-linear trajectories across time, space, and frequency, limiting their utility for automated, continuous tracking of vigilance. Recent research has shifted attention to the non-oscillatory, or aperiodic, component of the EEG, which may follow simpler dynamics and offer a more robust index of brain state. Yet most studies often continue to use narrowly defined, discrete vigilance states and transitions in only one direction (e.g., from wakefulness to sleep), without jointly examining oscillatory and aperiodic activity. Here, we address these key gaps by evaluating the capacity of both oscillatory and aperiodic features of EEG power spectra, derived from high-density recordings, to predict vigilance as a continuous variable. Across three independent datasets, we consistently show that although oscillatory features reliably track changes in vigilance, they are unequivocally outperformed by aperiodic activity. Aperiodic features demonstrate a stronger, more linear, and spatially consistent relationship with both objective and subjective indices of vigilance, offering a more robust and scalable physiological marker of this fundamental feature of the brain.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Although both states occur primarily at night, fish respond differently to sleep deprivation and arousing stimuli depending on which sleep sub-state they are in. Moreover, the proportions of deep and light sleep are selectively altered by genetic and pharmacological manipulations of melatonin, serotonin, and norepinephrine signaling, offering new insights into how these neuromodulators shape sleep architecture. These results support zebrafish as a tractable model for dissecting the regulation and function of sleep sub-states.

In addition, exercise can be highly pleasurable and and serves as an effective stress reliever. Extant studies have highlighted frontal, parietal, and subcortical brain changes following acute bouts of exercise. However, slower, slightly delayed brain correlates after exercise at the network level have not been studied. Therefore, this study's objective was to investigate the changes in dynamic functional connectivity after 60 minutes of exercise in healthy males. Here we measured a 6-minute resting state fMRI in 24 young males at baseline and after a 60-minute cycling exercise challenge. Apart from routine preprocessing, the data were denoised with FSL-FIX and modeled with i) leading eigenvector dynamics analysis (LEiDA) to probe whole brain network dynamics and ii) with group independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression to quantify static brain connectivity. The within subject statistical tests compared baseline to post-exercise conditions. We found that a striato-fronto-parietal network is destabilized after exercise, as indicated by a lower probability of occurrence in dynamic analysis through LEiDA. The brain areas in the network include the bilateral caudate, putamen and pallidum as well as middle orbitofrontal, frontal operculum, frontal trigonum and inferior parietal cortices. No differences between baseline and post exercise conditions were found in the dual regression of the group ICA components. We conclude that 60 minutes of cycling causes a prolonged effect in brain network dynamics, reducing synchronization between the striatum and frontoparietal networks with respect to baseline. This provides insights into the network-level neural correlates of aerobic exercise, which may be directly linked with the stress relieving effects of physical exercise.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Recent observational high-throughput-sequencing studies have shown that fungal diversity is correlated with resource availability and climate across different spatial scales. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Across Germany, we experimentally manipulated 11 typically homogeneous, broadleaf production forests to increase their between-patch-heterogeneity (ESBC) and compared them with a control forest. In specific, we enhanced light availability via canopy openness and deadwood resources in the ESBC treatments. Fungal communities were determined by metabarcoding at 234 patches and analysed using a novel meta-analytical approach for pairwise comparisons of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity along Hill numbers. We hypothesized that {gamma}-diversity is primarily driven by {beta}-diversity increasing with canopy mediated microclimate variability and secondarily by -diversity increasing with resource availability. Furthermore, we expected an increase in {gamma}-diversity by unique phylogenetic lineages supporting the insurance hypothesis. Our results showed a significant increase in {gamma}-diversity in ESBC forests, first by - and second by {beta}-diversity, both of which were influenced mainly by microclimate and not resource availability. The increase of phylogenetic diversity with ESBC was weak indicating functional similarity of species. Analysis of symbiotic, saprotrophic and parasitic fungal assemblages revealed contrasting effects of resource availability and microclimate across the scales. As in the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration many forest managers aim to increase the heterogeneity of forests and are simultaneously face rising tree mortality, our study provides first robust empirical evidence for the varying effects of forest gaps and deadwood on fungal diversity across -, {beta}-, {gamma}-scales for this major kingdom.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Consistently, GNF-7 is highly efficacious to kill cancer cells previously treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including in patient-derived organoids and mouse xenografts. Surprisingly, the senolytic effect of GNF-7 is not mediated by the inhibition of a tyrosine kinase (TK), but rather by the activation of GCN2, an effect previously reported for other TK inhibitors.

We present a strategy to define biomarkers of MeCP2 dysfunction in brain with potential to delineate mechanisms and monitor therapeutic interventions. This strategy relies on a library of proteins responsive to Mecp2 gene dosage and correlated with molecular and clinical outcomes after AAV9-mediated MECP2 gene therapy in Mecp2 KO mice. Gene rescue restored MeCP2 in brain, improved clinical phenotypes, and reverted transcriptome and proteome abnormalities. We identified 327 shared proteins among 1852 cortical and hippocampal proteins responsive to Mecp2/MECP2. Of these, 119 also displayed Mecp2/MECP2-dependent transcript changes. Both the Mecp2 responsive proteome and transcript/protein pairs were enriched in synaptic and metabolic pathways, including central carbon and NAD+ metabolism. We used this therapy-responsive protein library to guide selection of candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in RTT. CSF composition from neurotypical and RTT groups was analyzed using ultrasensitive nucleic acid-based multiplexed ELISA. Twenty eight proteins were altered in RTT, nine overlapping with Mecp2 dosage and therapy sensitive proteins.

Recent exome sequencing of a Schizophrenia patient cohort identified a set of 3' deletions present within multiple highly expressed-isoforms of the synaptic adhesion molecule neurexin1 (NRXN1), a gene that is broadly implicated across many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. To understand how isoform differences and mutations within isoforms impact neuronal function and behaviors, we expressed 8 NRXN1 isoform variants in C. elegans and tested their effects on a stereotyped food-deprivation response and social feeding behavior. Overall, expression of the NRXN1 isoforms followed a pattern similar to that of the endogenous ortholog NRX-1, with expression primarily localized to the nerve ring in the head of the animal. However, several isoform variants displayed distinct localization, with ectopic or abnormal expression in neuronal cell bodies. We observed in the food deprivation response behavior that the isoforms (both control and 3' deletion variants) fell into one of three phenotypic categories; unchanged, partial rescue, or gain of function. A similar trend was observed for social feeding behavior; most of the NRXN1 isoforms had no impact compared with npr-1;nrx-1 controls, but some had partial rescue or induced stronger phenotypes. In summary, NRXN1 isoforms are able to partially rescue behavioral defects caused by the loss of nrx-1, suggesting that they may functionally replace the endogenous protein. Further, we identified differential impacts between some control and 3' deletion isoform variants, confirming pathogenic impact of 3' deletion isoforms in behavior. Overall, C. elegans presents a genetically tractable model in which to study the impacts of protein coding deletions associated with human neuropsychiatric conditions that impact genes with many isoforms on robust and stereotyped behaviors in vivo.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We utilized a variety of methods including radioligand binding, real-time conformational monitoring of transitions using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and signaling assays using the TRUPATH resource. At the mu receptors, sodium behaved as a negative allosteric modulator of binding, conformational transitions and signaling. Intriguingly, bitopic mu agonists were unaffected by sodium concentrations.

A major feature of TDP-43 pathology is its nuclear depletion, leading to the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons during RNA splicing. STMN2 and UNC13A have emerged as prominent TDP-43 splicing targets, but the broader impact of TDP-43-dependent cryptic splicing on neuronal function remains unclear. Here, we report new TDP-43 splicing targets critical for membrane excitability and synaptic function, including KALRN, RAP1GAP, SYT7 and KCNQ2. Using human stem cell-derived neurons, we show that TDP-43 reduction induces cryptic splicing and downregulation of these genes, resulting in impaired excitability and synaptic transmission. In postmortem brains from patients with FTD, these cryptic splicing events occur selectively in neurons with TDP-43 pathology. Importantly, suppressing individual cryptic splicing events using antisense oligonucleotides partially restores neuronal function, and combined targeting almost fully rescues the synaptic deficit caused by TDP-43 loss. Together, our findings provide evidence that cryptic splicing in these synaptic and membrane excitability genes is not only a downstream marker but instead a direct driver of neuronal dysfunction, establishing a mechanistic link between TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration in ALS and FTD.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Mutations at the regulatory c-terminus of CCND2, and in proteins that regulate mTOR such as PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT3 and TSC1/2, result in CCND2-stabilisation and overgrowth. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the neurodevelopmental defects observed in Megalencephaly-Polymicrogyria-Polydactyly-Hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived models of CCND2-associated disease. Using CRISPR-Cas9 we generated lines containing either a pathogenic CCND2 variant (c.814G>T, p.Glu272Ter) or frameshift variants in the final exon of CCND2, all of which truncate CCND2 before the critical Thr-280 residue, required for its phosphorylation and degradation.

While linear models have shown promise in predicting readthrough efficiency, they may not fully capture the complex, non-linear interactions between sequence context and drug activity. Methods: We developed TransStop, a novel, transformer-based pan-drug model, trained on a dataset of ~5,400 PTCs and eight readthrough compounds. The model learns sequence representations and incorporates learnable embeddings to capture drug-specific effects, allowing a single model to predict efficacy for multiple drugs. Results: Our model achieved a global R2=0.94 on a held-out test set. Visualizations of the learned embeddings revealed a deep understanding of biological principles, including the distinct clustering of stop codon types and grouping of drugs by mechanism of action. In silico saturation mutagenesis and epistasis analyses uncovered complex, non-additive sequence determinants of readthrough. We generated 32.7 million predictions across the human genome, covering all possible PTCs. Analysis of these genome-wide predictions revealed strong drug specializations for specific stop codon contexts and identified key areas of disagreement with previous models, particularly for UGA codons, where our model predicts a more effective drug in thousands of cases. The TransStop model represents a significant advancement in the prediction of translational readthrough efficiency.

These mechanical alterations were significantly attenuated at higher calcium concentrations, consistent with the calcium-rich milieu of the vestibular and retinal tissues.

In HEK293T cells transfected with Cav1.4 and the auxiliary {beta}2x13 and 2{delta}-4 subunits, Z944 and ML218 inhibited Ca2+ currents with IC50 values of ~30 M and 2 M, respectively.

Compared to mutation of a conserved threonine (T1007) that is required for DHP sensitivity of Cav1 channels, mutation of M1004 had a 10-fold greater impact in diminishing the potency of ML218. Cav1.2 was significantly less sensitive to ML218 inhibition (IC50~ 37 M) than Cav1.4, which could not be attributed to a valine in place of M1004 in Cav1.2.

The latter hexamerize on the microtubule lattice, pull out single tubulin dimers in an ATP-dependent manner and eventually generate internal breaks in the microtubule. While both, katanin and spastin, were shown to be regulated by posttranslational tubulin modifications, only katanin was reported to have microtubule lattice-defect- or crossover-sensing activity. Here, we employ in vitro assays to investigate the impact of microtubule lattice defects on the severing characteristics of spastin. Toward this end, we prepared GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules with varying defect densities. Thereby, microtubule defects were introduced either through specific polymerization conditions or by end-to-end annealing of microtubules. We found that (i) the presence of defects accelerated the onset of the severing process and (ii) severing was twice as frequent in microtubule segments with defect sites as compared to random lattice segments. However, there was no evidence of preferential binding of spastin to defect sites. We therefore propose a severing mechanism in which defects do not actively promote microtubule severing but rather passively contribute to microtubule lattice instability, facilitating the process as fewer tubulin subunits are required to be removed for microtubule severing.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

This feature underlies essential processes such as development, immune responses, and cancer invasion. Classical mathematical models have offered key insights into directed migration, yet they often neglect temporal correlations arising from cellular mechanisms that stabilize polarity and protrusion dynamics, processes not well captured by simple white noise. Here, we introduce an agent-based model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that integrates fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to explicitly incorporate translational autocorrelation in cell trajectories. We simulate migration as a function of angular reorientation (Dr) and the strength of correlated noise (H). In this framework, temporal correlation stabilizes trajectory features inherited from initial conditions, whereas angular reorientation introduces variability that enables transitions between erratic and directed motion. Our simulations show that, unlike models driven by white noise, positive correlation markedly enhances persistence even under strong angular reorientation. Moreover, the combination of Dr and H gives rise to emergent behaviors, particularly in the presence of taxis, where persistence and responsiveness are jointly tuned. These results identify correlated noise as a proxy for intrinsic cellular memory and provide a versatile computational framework to interpret the diversity and complexity of migratory behaviors.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated the formulation dependent self-assembly behavior of a therapeutic mAb (termed mAb1) and provide a link to physical stability after applied stress. Using a combinatorial microdroplet platform to delineate the phase space of mAb1, we highlight its unusual solution properties. Specifically, mAb1 undergoes LLPS in a narrow window of low NaCl concentrations, in a formulation relevant design space, at room temperature (RT), without crowding agents and more than one pH unit lower than its isoelectric point. Using time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering, we measured the attractive interactions underpinning LLPS to be on the sub second timescale and leading to the formation of small clusters, which altogether could be rapidly inhibited by L-arginine HCl. The elevated opalescence of mAb1 solutions extended beyond the LLPS regime, where a highly similar interaction fingerprint to the LLPS condition was observed but no microscopic association was detected. This suggests that LLPS and opalescence differ in the distribution of interactions within their networks, dictating their ability to form long-range assemblies (phase-separated droplets) or not. Finally, our physical stability assessment highlights that mAb1 LLPS and molecular assemblies giving rise to high opalescence both resist stirring stress and that the observed aggregation is uncorrelated with ionic strength at our selected timescale. This observation challenges an unequivocal relationship between LLPS/opalescence and reduced physical stability of mAb solutions.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We show that GSDME acts as a switch, linking MAM-mediated calcium release to astrocyte-driven neurotoxicity. Specifically, Abeta-activated microglial signals activate astrocytic GSDME, releasing its N-terminal fragment, which targets MAMs and triggers ER calcium efflux. This induces biphasic CaMKIIalpha; phosphorylation, initially boosting NRF2 defenses, then activating NF-kappaB-driven inflammation, shifting astrocytes from protective to toxic states. GSDME activation also drives astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) to carry neurotoxic tau, proinflammatory miRNAs, and toxic lipids, propagating toxicity. GSDME deletion in AD mice reduces Abeta; burden, restores NF-kappaB/NRF2 balance, reprograms astrocytes and ADEs to protective states, and rescues cognition.

Murine and human neutrophils express the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3; however, their specific roles in neutrophil immunobiology have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we show that neutrophilic immune responses to Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus critically depend on GLUT1/3-dependent glucose uptake and glycolysis. Combined deletion of GLUT1 and GLUT3 almost completely abolished glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in murine neutrophils, yet did not impair granulopoiesis, indicating that homeostatic neutrophil development is largely independent of extracellular glucose. By contrast, during microbial challenge, loss of GLUT1/3 severely compromised NADPH-dependent ROS production, oxidative burst and cyclooxygenase-derived lipid mediator (LM) biosynthesis, demonstrating that glucose uptake via GLUT1/3 controls inflammatory effector functions of neutrophils. Moreover, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1/3-mediated glucose utilization reprograms neutrophil metabolism and LM biosynthesis toward an immunomodulatory phenotype.

Due to the lack of an internal protein synthesis machinery, they entirely depend on the import of target proteins to carry out their functions within peroxisomes. While the process of cargo/receptor recognition is well understood, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the subsequent translocation steps, including cargo release and receptor recycling, is lacking behind. Here, we provide structural and functional evidence on the role of Pex8 in these processes. First, we show that Pex8 in yeast is essential for peroxisomal cargo translocation, irrespective of the mechanism of receptor/cargo recognition. Next, we reveal that Pex8 binds through an irregular twelvefold HEAT repeat array to a short three-helical bundle within the otherwise unfolded N-terminal domain of the Pex5 receptor. Impairing this interaction abolishes peroxisomal protein translocation. It is complemented by a secondary autonomous Pex8 cargo-like interaction site with the C-terminal domain of Pex5, thus generating a bipartite interaction between the two proteins. Our data support a model in which Pex5/Pex8 complex formation allows assembly with the peroxisomal Pex2/Pex10/Pex12 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to initiate recycling of the receptor. In summary, our findings provide in-depth insight into the transition from cargo release into peroxisomes to receptor recycling, which is essential to uncover the overall process of the peroxisomal cargo translocation.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

The transcriptional and tumorigenic activities of MYC mainly depend on its association with MAX. In its unbound state, MAX exhibits partially disordered regions, complicating structural characterization and limiting conventional drug discovery approaches that rely on the existence of well-defined binding pockets and ignore dynamical aspects of protein structures. To address these challenges, we employed the enhanced-sampling well-tempered metadynamics method to systematically explore the conformational space of the unbound MAX protein. Our results revealed, for the first time, a well-defined and thermodynamically favorable conformation of monomeric MAX. This is a remarkable finding, as it demonstrates that regions of MAX previously considered persistently disordered are capable of adopting stable, folded structures under specific conditions. Moreover, our findings also suggest that the meta-stable structural motifs observed in this work may harbor druggable sites, particularly relevant for strategies aiming to target MAX directly or to disrupt its interaction with MYC, thereby modulating oncogenic signaling pathways. The present study establishes a new structural framework for understanding the dynamics of MAX and provides a foundation for future structure-based drug design targeting the MYC/MAX axis.

This study presents a robust methodology based on continuous-wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy to characterize protein-membrane interactions. We focused on the protein Tau, an intrinsically disordered protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We show that the interaction of labelled Tau with lipids gives rise to a very distinct lineshape, which can be used to quantify the fraction of bound protein. This allows to obtain the apparent binding mode and affinity through titration experiments. In addition, we show that a single measurement provides the absolute concentration of free and bound protein. We argue that this information, which is rarely obtained by other methods providing relative signals, is very useful for mechanistic studies. Furthermore, using mathematical modeling, we developed a minimal-data approach and demonstrated that a single EPR measurement can be used to derive binding constants. The approach is applied to the Tau-membrane interaction occurring in different conditions affecting the binding behavior.

The GT70 family contains a single well-characterized enzyme, GumK, a glucuronosyltransferase from Xanthomonas campestris required for xanthan gum biosynthesis. Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, while donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for glucuronate-UDP is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation. Comparative analysis highlights GumK-specific motifs distinguishing it from homologous GTs.

Unexpectedly, in unstimulated female lymphocytes that are largely quiescent, these epigenetic features are largely absent but are restored by NF-kB signaling following their activation. To determine whether these epigenetic phenotypes correlate with quiescence or NF-kB activation in other tissues, we evaluated female progenitor and stem cells from intestine, blood, and muscle. Despite known NF-kB activation, intestinal progenitors have variable Xist RNA patterns, whereas blood progenitors and neutrophils show a strong correlation between NF-kB activation status and Xist RNA localization. In contrast, muscle satellite cells (SCs) and myoblasts exhibit Xist RNA accumulation at the Xi without NF-kB activation. Xist RNA localization patterns in SCs change with age, yet adult SCs have an Xi that is mostly transcriptionally silent while allowing expression of muscle-specific X-linked genes including Dmd. These findings reveal that female somatic cells employ diverse, tissue-specific epigenetic mechanisms to maintain X chromosome inactivation, enabling cell type specific Xi gene expression while preserving chromosome-wide silencing.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

The current project aims to translate the vaccine protocol to exploit a carrier protein used in routine human vaccination schedules. The well-characterised, non-toxic fragment C of tetanus toxin (TTc) was selected as the carrier protein. Here we show that priming with the carrier TTc followed by boost with Robo4-TTc (R4-TTc) efficiently induces strong antibody responses to Robo4 and inhibits tumour growth in LLC1 and 4T1 tumour models. The growth inhibition was correlated with anti-Robo4 IgG1 titres. Furthermore, we observed decreased vessel formation and increased immune cell infiltration in tumours from R4-TTc vaccinated mice in the absence of detectable adverse effects on health.

To generate its characteristic shape, ER-resident proteins directly affect membrane topology, while interactions with the microtubule (MT) network determine ER positioning. The ER undergoes continuous remodeling with the most drastic rearrangements taking place during mitosis. A critical aspect is the reconfiguration of MT-ER interactions that accompanies spindle formation. One abundant ER-MT tether is constituted by the ER sheet-associated membrane protein Climp63, which binds MTs in a phosphorylation-sensitive manner. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a phosphodeficient Climp63 mutant in HeLa cells prevents dissolving of ER-MT contacts in mitosis, resulting in severe mitotic delays. Moreover, during mitotic exit, cells fail to properly enclose all chromosomes into a single nucleus, leading to excessive nuclear fragmentation. The emerging micronuclei assemble NE components with nuclear pore complexes, in contrast to what is known for micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes. We further show that the N-terminal 28 amino acids are sufficient for the interaction between Climp63 and MTs with phosphorylation of serine S17 by CDK1 being critical for the mitotic release of the ER from MTs. Overall, our results demonstrate that aberrant Climp63 activity severely affects mitosis.

Information from intra- and extra-cellular signaling cues is transmitted to mTOR through an intricate signaling network that impinges on the Rag and Rheb GTPases to regulate its localization and activity. Interestingly, although mTOR is a heavily ubiquitinated protein, the role of this post-translational modification (PTM) in regulating its activation status remains poorly understood. Here, through an unbiased RNAi screen, we identified the tumor suppressor CYLD deubiquitinase (DUB) as a direct negative regulator of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. Mechanistically, CYLD interacts with mTOR and removes non-degradative, K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains from multiple of its residues. Consequently, CYLD loss-of-function cells are characterized by mTORC1/2 hyperactivation, elevated rates of protein synthesis, increased cell size, and resistance to serum-starvation-induced activation of cell death pathways. Moreover, silencing of cyld-1, the C. elegans CYLD ortholog, fully reverses the extended lifespan of low-TORC1-activity mutant worms. Finally, we find that inactivation of CYLD is associated with hyperactivation of mTORC1 also in skin biopsies from CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS) patients. In sum, our findings highlight CYLD as a sentinel of mTOR hyperactivation via direct control of its ubiquitination, and suggest that dysregulated mTOR activity may contribute to the development and progression of CCS tumors.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that heparin-polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels loaded with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) instructed stable chondral MSC development in vivo. We here assessed this approach in vitro, utilizing heparin-PEG hydrogels or soluble heparin supplementation of chondrogenic medium. Methods Human MSCs were cultured in heparin-PEG hydrogels (22.4 mg/mL crosslinked heparin, 120ng TGF-{beta}1) or as hydrogel-free pellet cultures treated with soluble heparin (0, 10, 100, 700 g/mL) in TGF-{beta}1-containing (10 ng/mL) chondrogenic medium. Chondral and endochondral signaling (1-3 h, 4 weeks) and cartilage matrix formation (4 weeks) were analyzed using Western blot, histology, qPCR, ELISA, and enzyme activity. Results Unlike in vivo, human MSCs differentiated in heparin-PEG hydrogels into type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase-positive hypertrophic chondrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, treatment with soluble heparin (10-700 g/mL) revealed reduced TGF-{beta}-small mother against decapentaplegic (SMAD)3 but not SMAD2 activation at unaffected type II collagen and proteoglycan/DNA levels. We propose that the stimulation of the insulin-AKT pathway by heparin aided in maintaining SMAD2 activation which apparently plays a more prominent role than SMAD3 for MSC chondrogenesis. Heparin treatment inhibited the pro-hypertrophic WNT/{beta}-catenin pathway in vitro but insufficiently silenced TGF-{beta}-SMAD1/5/9 activation and unfortunately reduced anti-hypertrophic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Ultimately, treatment with 10 g/mL heparin reduced the upregulation of several hypertrophy markers (MEF2C, IHH, IBSP mRNAs, alkaline phosphatase activity) below control levels, but type X collagen remained unresponsive. Thus, soluble heparin treatment was similarly selective and effective as previous anti-hypertrophic interventions (parathyroid-hormone related protein (PTHrP)-pulses, wingless-int (WNT)-inhibition), while offering technical simplicity, reduced cost, and solvent-free formulation. Conclusions Taken together, heparin-TGF-{beta} showed a novel dichotomous SMAD2/3 inhibition at maintained chondrogenic power and context-dependent lineage-instructive properties: permitting endochondral differentiation in vitro but chondral development in vivo. Thus, environmental contributions are mandatory to allow heparin-PEG-guided chondral versus endochondral lineage commitment of MSCs in vivo, potentially involving SMAD1/5/9 suppressors and PGE2 sources.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

D.; Subramanian, R.", "abstract": "The Aurora B kinase-containing Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) is an essential regulator of cytokinesis, the final and irreversible step of cell division. During anaphase, the CPC concentrates at the spindle midzone - a bundle of overlapping antiparallel microtubules organized at the cell center. How CPC is selectively enriched at the midzone within the dense, heterogeneous, and dynamic spindle microtubule network is unknown. Here, we define a minimal CPC midzone enrichment module. We show that the maximal enrichment of CPC at antiparallel microtubule overlaps requires PRC1-crosslinked microtubules and the interaction of CPC with two mitotic kinesins, KIF4A and KIF20A. We find that the two motors exhibit a division of labor: KIF20A delivers CPC from non-overlapping microtubules, and KIF4A retains CPC at PRC1-crosslinked overlaps. Conditional depletion of KIF4A in mitotic cells reveals that it is required for CPC localization at the spindle midzone in anaphase. Taken together, our findings reveal how the collective activity of two kinesins enables navigation through the complex microtubule network of the spindle to organize kinase signaling at the cell center for cytokinesis.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Timely and accurate transition into mitosis is essential to preserve genome integrity and avoid chromosome segregation errors. This transition depends on spatial and temporal activity patterns of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, that eventually lead to nuclear envelope permeabilization (NEP) and irreversible mitotic commitment. How these patterns are orchestrated to ensure an error-free mitosis remains unclear. Here, using a combination of high-resolution imaging with cellular micromanipulation, we show that mitotic entry is controlled by the condensation of mitotic chromosomes, which generate a mechanical signal on the nuclear envelope during prophase. We further demonstrate how the nuclear envelope spatiotemporally integrates this mechanical signal to ensure the coordination between the cytoplasmic and nuclear events required for the transition into mitosis. Through the LINC complex, this chromosome-generated mechanical signal is relayed to the cytoplasm, ensuring timely nuclear translocation of cyclin B1. Simultaneously, SUN proteins transmit this signal directly to nuclear pore complexes independently of their role in the LINC complex, to regulate NEP and mitotic spindle assembly. We propose that irreversible mitotic commitment is controlled by a chromosome-dependent nuclear mechanism, that provides robust spatiotemporal coupling between chromosome condensation and mitotic entry, contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

The physical principles guiding this centromere positioning remain unknown. Here, we reveal that human core centromeres are directed to the chromatin surface by repulsion of centromere-associated proteins - independent of condensin-mediated loop extrusion and microtubule engagement. Using cellular perturbations, biochemical reconstitution, and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that chromatin surface localisation emerges from repulsion between condensed chromatin and both the kinetochore and the highly negatively charged centromere protein, CENP-B. Together, these elements form a centromeric region composed of two domains with opposing affinities, one favouring integration within the mitotic chromosome and the other favouring exposure to the surrounding cytoplasm, thereby driving surface positioning. Tethering synthetic negatively charged proteins to chromatin was sufficient to recapitulate this surface localisation in cells and in vitro, indicating that electrostatic repulsion is a key determinant of surface localisation. These findings demonstrate that centromere layering is not hardwired by chromatin folding patterns but instead emerges from phase separation in chromatin.

Emerin is an integral membrane protein that is part of the LEM (LAP2/emerin/MAN1) domain family, and mutations in either emerin or lamin A/C can result in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and other striated muscle diseases. Emerin is retained at the INM through direct interaction with lamin A/C, and emerin's proper subcellular localization is critical for its ability to influence the mechanical properties of the nucleus and participate in various signaling processes. Nonetheless, the requirements for interaction between emerin and lamin A/C at the INM remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that two distinct regions of lamin A/C are each sufficient to properly localize emerin to the INM and prevent emerin's lateral diffusion within the INM. In addition to a previously described region of the lamin A/C tail domain able to bind emerin, we identify a novel emerin-interacting domain comprising the linker between the rod and Ig-like fold domains of lamin A/C. We further demonstrate that stably anchoring emerin to the INM requires assembly of A-type lamins into a filamentous network. Collectively, our findings suggest a revised model for emerin retention at the INM, which predicts that two independent lamin A/C domains are required to retain emerin at the nuclear envelope, thereby illuminating how diverse mutations in lamin A/C result in EDMD.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

In-vivo imaging of endogenous Pyramus:mCherryendo and Thisbe:sfGFPendo knock-ins revealed that the ligands segregate into distinct, receptor-bound territories among isogenic AMPs. This segregation arises as AMPs acquire ligands via polarized, Htl-containing cytonemes that directly contact each ligand source. Cytoneme polarity and target-specificity are position-dependent, enabling ligand distribution to scale with tissue size and AMP organization. A positive feedback loop through the Htl-Pointed axis reinforces cytoneme polarity, amplifying ligand-specific segregation and signaling.

This is the case for the gene regulatory network (GRN) that underlies the development of compound eyes in insects, where the very detailed level description of the network in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster contrasts with the knowledge of the network in other well studied insects, such as the flour beetle Tribolium or the desert locust Schistocerca. It is not even known to what extent the Drosophila eye GRN is typical of flies (diptera). Here we have introduced the marmalade fly Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae), separated from Drosophila approximately 90 MYrs, as a fly species to compare the mechanisms of compound eye development. The Episyrphus eye develops from an imaginal disc which is, in the overall, similar to that of Drosophila. By generating parallel data sets in Episyrphus and Drosophila to maximize comparability, our results show how the genes known to participate in the early specification of the Drosophila eye and the onset of its differentiation are likely participating in the eye GRN of Episyrphus, further expanding the set of conserved genes/nodes in this network. This gene set might be the basis for further explorations of the developmental mechanisms involved in compound eye development beyond flies. By combining RNAseq and ATACseq profiling with TF motifs we derive the first eye GRN in Episyrphus. When built using Episyrphus/Drosophila conserved nodes, the resulting GRN model exhibited abundant internal connectivity, suggesting that, as proposed in Drosophila, the GRN is knitted with many regulatory feedbacks. Using link conservation as a criterion for discovering new regulatory interactions, we find that the AML1/Runx transcription factor lozenge (lz) is a negative regulator of the retinal determination gene dachshund (dac) in Drosophila. However, although many of the predicted regulatory links are conserved, a large number of regulatory connections seem species-specific, even among conserved nodes. This suggests quite a significant regulatory rewiring during the 90Myr period separating Episyrphus and Drosophila.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

In most animals, epithelial tissues exhibit a predominantly hexagonal space-packing geometry. However, in many species of the largest group of crustaceans, the Malacostraca, the embryonic epithelium takes on the striking form of a grid made up of predominantly square cells, sequential rows of which establish the adult segmented body plan. After square cells emerge, their organization appears to be maintained by specific cell division patterns. However, the mechanisms that initially generate square cells from hexagonal precursors are unknown. Here we address this problem by combining long-term multiview lightsheet microscopy, immunohistochemistry, laser ablation, and pharmacological perturbation. We show that in the emerging model crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis this highly unusual grid geometry is first initiated from two perpendicular axes that are established sequentially according to different cellular mechanisms. The first axis arises dorso-ventrally at a tensile lineage compartment boundary, while the second emerges at the ventral midline through lineage-independent cell intercalation driven by tensile actin-myosin cables. We show that these midline cables are necessary for organizing square-cell packing as well as for proper expression of the segmentation gene engrailed.

Here, by employing a Polylox1 DNA barcoding technology and mathematical modelling, we unveiled the clonal dynamics of the mouse male germline from development through adulthood and to the next generation. We found that, within cells initially specified to become germ cells in early embryogenesis, >30% of clones are lost during migration before settling at the testis, with the surviving PGC clones expanded quite unevenly. In contrast, within developing testes, in which PGCs are compartmentalised into quasi-one-dimensional seminiferous tubules, their clonal repertoire (i.e., diversity and size distribution) is preserved until adulthood. Further, the clonal repertoire in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is proportionally mirrored in sperm production and in the offspring.

Defective ETC activity led to increased NADH/NAD+ ratio whereas ATP levels remained constant due to a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Using targeted perturbations, we found that the metabolic state of the cells ahead of and/or at the moving front of differentiation determined its speed.

We previously identified an aptamer, SAPT8, that selectively targets nucleolin, a shuttling protein overexpressed on the surface of pathogenic FLSs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and induced its lysosomal degradation. In this study, we repurposed SAPT8 as a tumor-targeting and lysosome-directed ligand, leveraging the elevated expression of NCL on tumor cell surfaces. By conjugating SAPT8 with either the c-Met-binding aptamer SL1 or the small molecule inhibitor Tepotinib, we engineered novel LYTACs that demonstrated potent tumor-targeting capability and induced concurrent degradation of both c-Met and NCL, leading to significant antitumor effects. Furthermore, fusion of SAPT8 with VEGFR-2-targeting aptamer Apt02 generated LYTACs that simultaneously degraded VEGFR-2 and NCL, effectively suppressing RA-FLS activity.

Death of Mtb-infected macrophages promotes tissue pathology and releases Mtb to infect other cells, suggesting that inhibiting the death of Mtb-infected macrophages could be an adjunctive treatment of TB. Prospects for such an intervention depend on identifying the molecular pathways leading to cell death. We previously reported that the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages in vitro depends on type I interferon (IFN) and that the ensuing upregulation of cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1; IRG1) contributes to cell death by exacerbating Mtb-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Here we report that death of Mtb-infected primary mouse macrophages in vitro became necroptotic and die faster in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD) acting on a target other than caspase-8. Macrophages infected with Mycobacterium kansasii and Rhodococcus equi likewise underwent z-VAD-dependent necroptosis. In C57BL/6 mice, which are relatively TB-resistant, we saw no impact of MLKL deficiency on bacterial burden or pulmonary pathology. In contrast, in Sp140-/- mice on the C57BL/6 background, which express high levels of type I IFN after Mtb infection and develop necrotic pulmonary lesions, MLKL-deficiency reduced bacterial burden and pathology after high-dose infection. This report illustrates that off-target action(s) of a caspase-8 inhibitor can switch the cell death pathway to necroptosis in macrophages infected with various Gram-positive pathogens. In turn, this opens the possibility that pathophysiologic circumstances may lead to inhibition of the same target(s) that z-VAD inhibited in our studies.

Tsetses indigenous microbiota can include a member of the genus Spiroplasma, and infection with this bacterium causes fecundity-reducing phenotypes in the fly that include a prolonged gonotrophic cycle and a reduction in the motility of stored spermatozoa post-copulation. Herein we demonstrate that Spiroplasma and tsetse spermatozoa compete for fly-derived acylcarnitines, which in other bacteria and animals are used to maintain cell membranes and produce energy. The fat body of mated female flies increases acylcarnitine production in response to infection with Spiroplasma. Additionally, their spermathecae (sperm storage organs), and likely the sperm within, up-regulate expression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase-1, which is indicative of increased acylcarnitine metabolism and thus increased energy demand and energy production in this organ. These compensatory measures are insufficient to rescue the motility defect of spermatozoa stored in the spermathecae of Spiroplasma-infected females and thus results in reduced fly fecundity. Tsetses taxonomically simple and highly tractable indigenous microbiota make the fly an efficient model system for studying the biological processes that facilitate the maintenance of bacterial endosymbioses, and how these relationships impact conserved mechanisms (mammalian spermatozoa also use acylcarnitines as an energy source) that regulated animal host fecundity.

Here, we investigated the role of ubiquitination in the stability of PRRSV-encoded nsps and found that nsp12 was specifically degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mechanistically, nsp12 underwent K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination at lysine residues 89, 91, 127, and 130. RNF114 served as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for nsp12, with its enzymatic activity essential for both nsp12 degradation and viral replication.

T.", "abstract": "In the N-degron pathway, ATE1 transfers the amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg) from Arg-tRNAArg to N-terminal (Nt) residues of cellular proteins. The resulting Arg/N-degrons bind the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTSM-1/Sequestosome-1 to induce lysosomal degradation of various biomaterials. Here, we demonstrate that the chemical mimetics of Arg/N-degrons, termed autophagy-targeting ligands (ATLs), can induce lysosomal degradation of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) via p62-mediated macroautophagy. In Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, ATLs promoted p62 self-polymerization and enhanced LC3 synthesis and lipidation, leading to viral sequestration within autophagosomes for lysosomal degradation. In transgenic mice overexpressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), oral administration of ATL1014 inhibited viral replication and increased viability. In a Syrian hamster model, ATL1014 attenuated viral replication in the lungs and demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory lesions and pulmonary congestions. These results identify the N-degron pathway as a potential target for a host-targeting strategy (HTS) against a broad spectrum of viruses.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

With aging, MuSCs experience a decline in their regenerative function and reduction in their number. However, recent evidence points to substantial heterogeneity within the aged MuSC population, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms of age-associated dysfunction. Here, we used Pax7CreERT2;RosaYFP mice (MuSCYFP) to label Pax7-expressing MuSCs and chronologically traced MusCs until geriatric age. Genetic labeling and chronological tracing revealed that the number of YFP+ MuSC remained comparable between young, middle and geriatric ages. At geriatric age, YFP+ MuSCs exhibited reduced expression of traditional MuSC markers such as VCAM1 and PAX7. A previously unrecognized subpopulation emerged, characterized by loss of VCAM1 and low or absent PAX7. Despite their altered marker profile, these cells retained transcriptional signatures of quiescence and myogenic potential, but displayed significantly reduced proliferative and regenerative capacities. They displayed gene expression patterns indicative of senescence-like state and were selectively ablated by senolytic treatment. DHT restored regenerative function in aged mice and re-induced VCAM1 expression in YFP+/Pax7-/low/VCAM1- cells, indicating responsiveness to rejuvenation. Based on their emergence with aging, functional impairment and responsiveness to rejuvenation, we termed this population GERI-MuSCs (Geriatric Emerging Rejuvenation-responsive and Impaired MuSCs). CD63 and CD200 were identified as novel surface markers that together with VCAM1, reliably detect GERI-MuSCs as well as classical Pax7+/VCAM1High MuSCs, providing a tool for comprehensive isolation of MuSCs from aged wild-type mice.

Targets included systems with experimental structures determined in two or three states, evaluated by direct comparison to experimental coordinates, as well as domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) targets assessed against statistical models from NMR and SAXS data. This paper focuses on the former class of multi-state targets. Ten ensembles were released as community challenges, including ligand-induced conformational changes, protein-DNA complexes, a trimeric protein, a stem-loop RNA, and multiple oligomeric states of a single RNA. For five targets, some groups produced reasonably accurate models of both reference states (best TM-score >0.75). However, with the exception of one protein-ligand complex (T1214), where an apo structure was available as a template, predictors generally failed to capture key structural details distinguishing the states. Overall, accuracy was significantly lower than for single-state targets in other CASP experiments. The most successful approaches generated multiple AlphaFold2 models using enhanced multiple sequence alignments and sampling protocols, followed by model quality based selection. While the AlphaFold3 server performed well on several targets, individual groups outperformed it in specific cases. By contrast, predictions for one protein-DNA complex, three RNA targets, and multiple oligomeric RNA states consistently fell short (TM-score <0.75). These results highlight both progress and persistent challenges in multi-state prediction. Despite recent advances, accurate modeling of conformational ensembles, particularly RNA and large multimeric assemblies, remains a critical frontier for structural biology.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Conventional MVN systems incorporate supporting fibroblasts and may include biochemical cues such as VEGF, FGF, or S1P, as well as mechanical stimuli like luminal flow, yet the impact of these variables on MVN morphology and function remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of fibroblast concentration, fibroblast-conditioned media, angiogenic factors, and luminal flow on the morphology, perfusability, and vessel wall integrity of MVNs cultured in a microfluidic vasculature-on-a-chip. In addition to standard branch-based metrics such as vessel coverage area and diameter, we developed and applied novel void-based morphological parameters that quantify the size, shape, and distribution of vessel-free spaces to capture subtle differences across MVN culture conditions. Our results demonstrate that high fibroblast-to-endothelial cell ratios accelerate MVN formation but promote excessive vessel fusion, while MVNs cultured without fibroblasts, using only conditioned media or soluble factors, exhibited patch-like, non-physiological morphology with reduced branch formation. Direct inclusion of fibroblasts proved essential for promoting the thin, interconnected vascular structures characteristic of in vivo microvasculature and could not be substituted by soluble cues alone. Furthermore, the presence or absence of fibroblasts modulated MVN responsiveness to luminal flow. Overall, our void-based analysis method enabled more sensitive discrimination of MVN morphological features than traditional branch-based metrics and offers a reduced-data, high-content approach suitable for integration with machine learning and AI-assisted image analysis pipelines.

Results confirm that this period coincides with an increased reliance on millet, particularly in regions associated with the Po Valley. This shift is primarily attributed to the need for food security in a politically fragmented and unstable environment, with millet offering reliable yields due to its phenotypic traits for tolerance. While political agenda and environmental factors appear to impact millet cultivation to varying degrees, specific links with social or ethnic affiliations remain largely unclear and require additional research.

Conditional Cre-mediated cell ablation, using diphtheria toxin (DTA), removed Ascl3+ ionocytes from the salivary glands and resulted in an altered pH of total saliva, supporting a function for ionocytes in transepithelial ion flow. Finally, Cre-mediated expression of the calcium indicator GCaMP6f revealed that Ascl3+ ionocytes exhibit unique properties not observed in acinar or surrounding duct cells, including elevated basal [Ca2+]I, spontaneous blinking in the absence of stimulation, and a rapid loss of [Ca2+]I following nerve stimulation.

LCK-deficient T cells exhibited reduced antigen-induced proliferation but, paradoxically, displayed enhanced effector differentiation in vivo. This phenotype likely reflects dysregulation of specific TCR signaling pathways, as LCK was more critical for ERK and NFAT activation than for NF{kappa}B, AP-1, or AKT/mTOR signaling. T cells deficient in a related kinase FYN also showed a slight increase in effector cell formation, suggesting that effector differentiation is regulated by their combined activity rather than distinct non-redundant roles.

Key virulence factors including polysaccharide capsule and melanin, facilitate immune evasion and tissue invasion in the host. Recently, Titan cell formation, has been defined as another important virulence factor of C. neoformans and plays a pivotal role in disease progression. Titan cells are defined as enlarged cells with a diameter of [&ge;]10 {micro}m and are highly polyploid with a significantly thicker capsule compared to the yeast morphotype. Despite the established role of Titan cells in C. neoformans pathogenesis, the mechanistic details governing their formation remain largely unresolved. The cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway has been shown to be an important regulator of virulence-associated processes, including capsule formation, melanin biosynthesis and Titan cell formation. However, the upstream signals, critical for the activation of cAMP-PKA pathway in the context of Titan cell formation remain poorly understood. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that the central carbon metabolic pathway, glycolysis, is critical for cAMP-dependent Titan cell formation in C. neoformans. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of glycolysis significantly attenuated Titan cell formation. Remarkably, exogenous addition of cAMP completely reversed the Titan cell defects observed during glycolysis perturbation.

However, phage-resistance may develop, compromising therapy. Phage-resistance has primarily been linked to changes in major phage receptors that for the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus are the cell-wall linked wall teichoic acids (WTA). To identify additional factors contributing to phage-resistance, S. aureus was evolved under selective pressure from lytic phages, including candidates from therapeutic phage cocktails, to obtain resistant clones. A third of the phage-resistant clones acquired mutations associated with cell-wall changes previously linked with phage resistance, namely in femA, involved in peptidoglycan crossbridge formation, and tagO, encoding the initiator of the WTA biosynthesis. The remaining clones had mutations in pathways not previously associated with phage-resistance, including nucleoside catabolism (deoC1), polyamine import (potAB) and DNA/RNA replication (cshA, ligA), suggesting that phage-resistance may be associated with phage-driven host takeover. Antibiotic susceptibility and virulence were diversely affected by the mutations; mutations in tagO increased {beta}-lactams sensitivity and attenuated virulence, whereas mutations in femA/ligA or cshA increased staphylococcal virulence in Galleria mellonella.

Our analyses revealed that Tls1 and Cay1 act at distinct steps in splicing, specifically affecting rap1 and poz1 transcripts: Tls1 strongly interacts with Brr2 (a splicing factor), whereas Cay1 preferentially associates with introns. Accordingly, deletion of tls1 and cay1 synergistically impaired splicing of rap1 and poz1 transcripts and reduced their protein levels, leading to abnormal telomere elongation. Removal of introns from the rap1 and poz1 genes restored normal protein levels and telomere length, confirming that defective splicing underlies these defects. Analyses of the phenotypes of single and double tls1{triangleup} and cay1{triangleup} mutants revealed that different telomere functions vary in their dependence on Rap1 levels: telomere length regulation and, to a lesser extent, meiosis require higher protein abundance, whereas chromosome end protection can be sustained with minimal amounts.

Here, we present a non-trivial extension of the birth-death phylodynamic model that captures this characteristic feature of development. By applying our method to a public dataset of stem cell colonies, we show how previous estimates of the underlying population-dynamic parameters were biased by the choice of a birth-death tree prior. Beyond developmental biology, our framework provides an approach for analyzing systems where classical birth-death assumptions may be violated or where empirical tree shapes are poorly captured by those expected under standard phylodynamic models. Our method is available as a BEAST2 package.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a previously established library of 153 single-amino acid variants of the mating pheromone M-factor was applied to large-scale competition assays under varied mating conditions. Mutations deleterious under standard conditions became advantageous at specific environmental pH levels, demonstrating context-dependent pheromone function activation. Synthetic peptide assays confirmed that certain substitutions act as environmental molecular switches. Comparative analysis with the closely related Schizosaccharomyces octosporus species identified a permissive mutation that mitigates the effects of otherwise inactivating changes, enabling an evolutionary route without intermediate fitness loss. Our findings reveal how short peptide signals evolve via environmentally contingent activation and compensatory interactions, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of mating communication.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

For plant and animal breeding applications, researchers increasingly recognize the potential benefits of identifying superior haplotypes (markers in linkage disequilibrium; LD) rather than relying on single markers, as traditional approaches inefficiently account for cumulative signals from incomplete LD with QTL or split effects when multiple markers are in high LD with QTL. Using the genomic prediction framework, the local GEBV (localGEBV) method was developed in animal breeding and has been adopted in crop haplotype mapping studies; however, no study has thoroughly quantified the utility of this method or systematically compared outcomes to traditional GWAS approaches. Here, we characterized a strategy to group markers in chromosomal segments based on LD (haplotype blocks or haploblocks), computed localGEBV as a linear contrast of marker effects within each haploblock, and utilised the variance of localGEBV to enhance QTL discovery compared to traditional GWAS. Marker effects for localGEBV were estimated with ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP) and BayesR, with results compared to two common GWAS approaches. Using the barley row-type trait, we demonstrated that localGEBV improved QTL discovery and phenotypic prediction compared to single markers. Furthermore, localGEBV results were robust to the choice of prior marker assumptions and blocking parameters, enabling flexibility in fine or broad-scale QTL mapping. Overall, our findings establish localGEBV as a haplotype-based strategy capable of leveraging localized genomic effects to improve QTL discovery and, potentially, genomic selection.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

This is the first demonstration of a 3D MPL-printed biodegradable scaffold that mimics bone-like stiffness and allows spatially controlled, biodegradation-driven remodeling. The nanoscale feature size and mechanical properties are validated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), while the nanoscale bioactivity of the scaffold is confirmed through Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). We track vinculin, a focal adhesion protein, with single-molecule resolution during mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) expansion and osteogenic differentiation. A new finding is time-dependent axial migration of vinculin clusters, independent of scaffold composition. Despite similar mechanosensing profiles, hybrid scaffolds significantly enhance osteogenic marker expression (collagen I, osteocalcin), revealing that scaffold bioactivity and geometry, not stiffness alone, direct stem cell fate. Cell expansion is highly dependent on scaffold composition, showing a biodegradation-driven remodeling over time.

Leaf bating in vitro assays were conducted using naturally colonized, non-sterilized substrates to closely simulate nursery conditions. Several locally isolated Trichoderma strains (T3, T5, T6, and T7), as well as two commercial products (PC1 and PC2), consistently reduced the incidence of Calonectria infection, indicating their capacity to decrease pathogen inoculum levels in the substrate. The reproducibility of these effects across independent trials underscores the robustness of Trichoderma as reliable BCAs.

It secretes putrescine, a polyamine that promotes biofilm formation by oral co-colonizers and enhances the proliferation of cancer cells. However, the physiological importance of putrescine for F. nucleatum itself remains unexplored. Here, we show that putrescine biosynthesis, mediated by the ornithine decarboxylase gene oda, is essential for F. nucleatum viability. Deletion of oda was only possible when a functional copy was provided in trans, and CRISPR interference of oda expression resulted in complete growth arrest. The essentiality of oda was conserved across multiple subspecies. Supplementation with exogenous putrescine enabled the isolation of a conditional oda mutant whose growth was strictly putrescine-dependent. Putrescine depletion caused filamentation, membrane disruption, detergent hypersensitivity, and lysis in hypoosmotic conditions, indicating a critical role in maintaining cell envelope integrity. RNA sequencing revealed broad transcriptional remodeling under putrescine-limited conditions, including upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, osmoprotection, and cell wall remodeling. Notably, oda transcript levels increased when putrescine was depleted, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism. These findings demonstrate that putrescine is not only an extracellular communal metabolite but is also vital for the cellular integrity and survival of F. nucleatum under anaerobic conditions.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

The transition to this state is regulated by various environmental or intracellular signals that converge on the comCDE operon, which groups together the competence initiation genes. A fraction of activated cells is sufficient to propagate competence to the whole population via the product of the comC gene, the competence stimulating peptide (CSP). Remarkably, depletion of the essential ClpX/ ClpP AAA+ protease has been shown to induce the comCDE operon. Here we demonstrate that the ClpX-dependent induction of competence relies on the Spr1630 toxin (RipA), part of a Rosmer toxin-antitoxin system. We show that this toxin generates replicative stress by acting on the sliding clamp of replication, inducing transcription of the comCDE operon.

However, the mitogenomes of many microbial eukaryotes remain underexplored due to challenges in their isolation and cultivation. Particularly understudied are Foraminifera (Rhizaria, SAR), unicellular calcifyers that are widely distributed across global oceans and important paleoenvironmental proxies. Through single-cell genomic sequencing, here we report a 22-kb complete mitogenome of a planktonic foraminiferan from tropical seawater, which is the smallest known to date among all sequenced mitogenomes of Rhizaria, a major lineage of eukaryotes. It contains only six protein-coding genes and fragmented ribosomal RNA genes, and has lost most genes in oxidative phosphorylation and all genes in mitochondrial translation. Such genome reduction is associated with accelerated evolutionary rates and a lower GC content than that of benthic foraminiferan and other rhizarian mitogenomes.

Human population findings increasingly support its complex genetic architecture, with most genetic association signals for atrial fibrillation found in the non-coding genome. In this study, we integrated genome-wide histone modification, gene expression and DNA methylation levels in a paired left and right atrial cohort comprising permanent atrial fibrillation patients and sinus rhythm controls. First, we first identified epigenomic regions enriched in histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) across left and right atria from patients and controls, and associated them with differentially expressed genes to derive a set of dysregulated candidate loci, including NPPB and SCX. Second, by incorporating an independent replication cohort, we were able to validate gene expression and epigenomic differences for a subset of these candidate loci. Third, we profiled base-resolution DNA methylation levels and identified differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm samples. Integration of these data with histone modification levels and gene expression allowed us to propose epigenetic mechanisms underlying transcriptomic and epigenomic changes across dysregulated loci, such as disruption of transcription factor binding by DNA methylation at the LRRC4B locus. The data and analyses we report constitute a systematic investigation of gene regulatory alterations across the left and right atria in permanent atrial fibrillation.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Exploitation of marine resources has recently attracted increased interest. It is therefore essential to improve our understanding of the meso- and deep pelagic ecosystems with respect to conservation and management strategies. Genomic resources are paramount to enable in-depth studies of population structuring and understanding the inherent genetic diversity, but also to enable studies of processes such as local adaptation and selection. Here we present a genome assembly of the Glacier lanternfish (Benthosema glaciale) generated with long-read PacBio and Hi-C contact map data. By comparing additional available genomes from the Myctophiformes order we explore their adaptive immune strategies. Our findings reveal that multiple lineages within this order have lost a significant proportion of genes related to adaptive immunity (Electrona, Protomyctophum and Benthosema). We find simultaneous loss of both classical MHC class I and class II function coinciding with reduction in genetic diversity with respect to immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors. In contrast, the sister branch represented by Gymnoscopelus and Nannobrachium appear to have maintained the standard configuration of the jawed vertebrate adaptive immune system apart from large gene expansions in MHC class II. Our results demonstrate that the Benthosema-belonging lineage (Myctophinae) has completely lost the core functions of the adaptive immune system.

SHIP1 plays an important role in processes such as directed cell migration, endocytosis, and cortical membrane oscillations. Alterations in SHIP1 expression have been shown to perturb myeloid cell chemotaxis and differentiation. In the brain, SHIP1 regulate microglial cell behaviors, which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the structural and functional relationships of SHIP1 is critical for developing ways to modulate SHIP1 membrane localization and lipid phosphatase activity during immune cell signaling. Recently, we discovered that the N-terminal SH2 domain of SHIP1 suppresses lipid phosphatase activity. SHIP1 autoinhibition can be relieved through interactions with receptor-derived phosphotyrosine (pY) peptides presented on membranes or in solution. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) we identified intramolecular contacts between the N-terminal SH2 domain and CBL1 motif of the C2 domain that limit SHIP1 membrane localization and activity. Single molecule measurements of purified SHIP1 on supported lipid bilayers and in neutrophil-like cells support a model in which the SH2 domain blocks membrane binding of the central catalytic module. Mutations that disrupt autoinhibition enhance the membrane binding frequency and increase the catalytic efficiency of SHIP1. Although dimerization of SHIP1 enhances membrane localization and the apparent phosphatase activity, it is not required for SHIP1 autoinhibition. Overall, our results provide new insight concerning SHIP1's structural organization, membrane binding dynamics, and the mechanism of autoinhibition.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": ""}

Beyond these canonical roles, lipids have emerged as critical regulators of host immunity. Here, we define a lipid-driven mechanism that governs host-pathogen interactions by impacting pathogen clearance and thus infection outcomes. Exploiting Drosophila, we show that enteric infection triggers robust accumulation of neutral lipids, and specifically 1,2-diacylglycerols (DAGs), in the midgut. Disruption of DAG biosynthesis or lipid transport in midgut enterocytes (ECs) impairs lipid accumulation and reduces host survival. Conversely, dietary lipid supplementation enhances lipid storage and improves survival. Mechanistically, these lipid-dependent responses regulate defecation, thereby controlling bacterial clearance from the midgut. DAGs can act as signaling lipids that activate protein kinase C (PKC), and DAG accumulation in ECs correlates with elevated PKC activity and calcium signaling in midgut visceral muscle (VM), promoting VM contraction, midgut motility, and expulsion of pathogens via defecation.

However, even with automation, the time that they take to execute limits the extent to which evolution experiments can be used as part of a high throughput approach to understand the links between genotype and phenotype. Mutations that lead to genetic loss of function are frequently selected for in evolution experiments. Thus in principle these experiments could be done more rapidly by starting not with clonal isolates but with dense transposon libraries that will contain loss of function mutations in all non-essential genes. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing the results of long term (5 month) evolution experiment, in which E. coli was grown with daily transfers in unbuffered LB starting at pH 4.5, with short term (5 and 10 day) experiments on a high density transposon library in the same strain and under the same conditions.
