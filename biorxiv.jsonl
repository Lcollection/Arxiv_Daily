Specifically, these devices can deliver charged biomolecules such as fluoxetine cations (Flx+) and electric field (EF) in freely moving pigs. Treatments can be controlled and monitored in real time via WiFi, with options for both user-specified delivery rates and durations, as well as automated closed-loop (CL) control. The devices are engineered to handle various failure scenarios that may arise in dynamic, real-world experiments--such as communication or power interruptions--ensuring that valuable experimental data is collected with minimal disruption. The ion pump features eight drug reservoirs and channels arranged around a 20 mm diameter-wound, with a central ground electrode (0 V). When voltages above 0 V are applied to the outer channels, currents flow from the reservoirs and channels into the wound, delivering Flx+ and/or EF depending on the reservoir solution. The device records applied voltages and currents locally to a microSD card at a high sampling rate, while simultaneously transmitting real-time measurements via a local WiFi network to a wound healing algorithm running on a nearby laptop. CL control of current/delivery rate is performed by an onboard microcontroller unit (MCU) and current-source microchips, based on instructions received from the wound healing algorithm. A graphical user interface (GUI) provides intuitive user control and real-time data visualization, with support for multiple devices. In vivo studies over seven days showed that Flx+-treated wounds had a 20% lower M1/M2 macrophage ratio and 41.67% greater re-epithelialization compared to controls (standard-of-care), demonstrating the actuator's potential to enhance wound healing.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Building on the success of COVID-19 vaccine development, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as leading vehicles for mRNA delivery in a range of therapeutic applications. Naturally-occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs), which share similar physical properties with LNPs, present a promising alternative platform because of their relative stability and lower immunogenicity. A key challenge common to both EVs and LNPs is enabling efficient vesicle - cell interactions and establishing a polarized permeability pathway required for effective cargo transfer. Membrane recognition and intercalation are essential for the function and delivery capacity of both systems, regardless of their complexity. In this study, we leveraged recent advances to create hybrid extracellular vesicles (HEVs) by using LNPs to load mRNA into EVs. We characterized HEV formation using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), and super-resolution microscopy, and demonstrated their ability to deliver mRNA to recipient cells. In both, in vitro and in vivo models, HEVs exhibited superior transfection efficiency compared to conventional LNPs composed of synthetic lipids, while significantly reducing LNPs cytotoxicity - a not-well-recognized limitation of synthetic lipid-based systems. These results highlight HEVs as a safer and more effective alternative for mRNA and small molecule delivery. Future therapeutic strategies could involve isolating EVs from patients, hybridizing them with synthetic lipid carriers loaded with therapeutic cargo, and reintroducing them for personalized treatment.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

This phase repels 'normal' macromolecules but allows NTR passage. When HIV infects non-dividing cells, its capsid is transported into nuclei not like cargo but crosses NPCs like NTRs. We now uncovered the molecular determinants of the capsid's NTR behavior: The FG-binding pocket is insufficient. Hexameric and pentameric capsomers contribute. The highly exposed outer capsid surface is key. It lacks 'FG-repulsive' charged residues (K,D,E) that are very abundant on 'normal' protein surfaces. 'FG-attractive' residues dominate the capsid surface. Introducing FG-repulsive ones impedes FG phase-partitioning, NPC-targeting and NPC-passage of assembled capsids. Capsids are thus made FG phase-soluble by myriads of transient FG-attractive interactions originating from individual surface sidechains. We discuss that CPSF6 releases the capsid from NPCs by switching its surface from FG-attractive to FG-repulsive.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

A.; Sharma, A.; Tsunoda, T.", "abstract": "Immune cell classification from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) presents significant challenges due to complex hierarchical relationships among cell types. We introduce scHDeepInsight, a deep learning framework that extends our previous scDeepInsight model by integrating a biologically-informed classification architecture with an adaptive hierarchical focal loss. The framework leverages our established method of transforming gene expression data into two-dimensional structured images for use with convolutional neural networks by effectively capturing both global and fine-grained transcriptomic features, overcoming the limitations of flat classification approaches that ignore hierarchical relationships between cell types. scHDeepInsight dynamically adjusts loss contributions to balance performance across the hierarchy levels. It also employs STACAS batch correction, robust random masking, and SHAP-based interpretability to enhance prediction accuracy and biological insight. Comprehensive benchmarking across seven diverse tissue datasets shows scHDeepInsight achieves an average accuracy of 93.2%, representing a 5.1 percentage point improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. The model successfully distinguishes 50 distinct immune cell subtypes with high accuracy, demonstrating proficiency for identifying rare and closely related cell subtypes.

M.; Sigrist, S. J.; Piao, C.", "abstract": "One of the major characteristics of sleep is homeostatic sleep rebound following sleep loss. While the molecular mechanisms of baseline sleep regulation have been intensively studied, a specific molecular understanding of sleep rebound remains elusive. Here, we show that a constitutively active form of the Munc13-family presynaptic release factor Unc13A, which lacks the inhibitory Ca2+/calmodulin interaction domain (Unc13AWRWR), dominantly suppressed sleep rebound upon acute sleep deprivation, leading to a nearly complete elimination of recovery sleep (''reboundless''). In contrast, baseline sleep remained largely normal. Through a genetic modifier screen, we found that this dominant ''reboundless'' phenotype of Unc13AWRWR was rescued by a partial loss of Snap, a cofactor of NSF required for disassembly and recycling of post-fusion cis-SNARE complex. Given that Unc13A promotes fusion-competent trans-SNARE complex formation, these findings suggest that sleep rebound may depend on a delicate balance between SNARE complex assembly and recycling. Additionally, we found that expression of a human disease-associated active Unc13A (Unc13APL) variant attenuated baseline and rebound sleep. Since both Unc13AWRWR and Unc13APL were shown to promote presynaptic release probability (Pr), we speculate that Unc13A suppresses recovery sleep likely by increasing Pr and subsequently enhancing synaptic transmission, probably through elevated trans-SNARE formation and efficient cis-SNARE recycling. Taken together, our data demonstrate a fundamental role of Unc13A and SNARE dynamics in sleep homeostasis.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

However, only a minority of sleep SWRs are associated with memory reactivation in the hippocampus and its downstream areas. Whether that subset of SWRs have specific physiological characteristics and directly contribute to memory performance is not known. We identified a specific subset of large SWRs linked to memory reactivation in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice, and found that their occurrence selectively increased during sleep following new learning. Closed-loop optogenetic SWR boosting during sleep was sufficient to enhance ensemble memory reactivation in hippocampus and PFC. This manipulation also improved subsequent memory retrieval and hippocampal-PFC coordination, causally linking both phenomena to SWR-associated ensemble reactivation during sleep.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

However, the cellular mechanisms by which Mtb extract and SL-1 modulate nociceptive sensory neurons remain incompletely understood.

After identification of individualized stimulation targets, participants completed a TMS/fMRI session, performing a WM task while receiving rTMS at randomized frequencies. Decoder outputs and behavioral data during this session guided selection of optimal and suboptimal stimulation frequencies. Participants then underwent six stimulation sessions (three optimal, three suboptimal) in a randomized crossover design, performing WM and control tasks. The optimal stimulation improved WM performance by the final session, with no improvement observed in the control task. Additionally, the decoder output predicted behavioral performance on the WM task, both during the TMS/fMRI and neuromodulation sessions.

Temperament is known to influence the regulation and expression of emotions. However, how animal temperament affects their vocalisations and particularly their vocal expressions of emotions remains largely unexplored. Sociability is often measured as the behavioural reactivity to social separation and is a temperament trait intrinsically linked to emotional reactivity. Most social species respond to this challenging situation using contact calls. Here, we investigated whether the acoustic structure of these calls reflect sociability, emotions or both. We used 42 female lambs from two diverging sheep lines selected for high or low sociability. High bleats were recorded both in isolation (social challenge) and before receiving a food treat (non social context) to investigate the link between vocalisations, emotions and heritable sociability. The acoustic features of isolation bleats differed between the lines, but it was not the case for pre-feeding bleats. Surprisingly, the genetic selection index and social behaviour were better predictors of the structure of isolation bleats than the arousal. Last, encoding of individuality in isolation bleats was impaired by the genetic selection. Our findings suggest a socio-acoustic co-selection: selecting for sociable animals affects vocal signatures in calls produced during a social separation.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Mice modeling 16p11.2 duplication may provide important insights into cognitive risk factors, in particular in reward-guided decision making. NMDAR function has also been implicated in psychosis phenotypes, but whether these phenotypes differ by genetic risk factor is unknown. Objectives: We aimed to: 1) identify sex and genotype differences in early operant training and two-arm spatial restless bandit task performance; 2) examine the effects of an NMDAR antagonist on task performance and strategy across genotypes. Methods: 16p11.2 duplication and wildtype mice completed a series of training schedules of escalating difficulty followed by bandit tasks. MK-801 and saline were administered in alternating sessions prior to later bandit task performance. Results: Large sex differences in early operant training revealed some male-biased impacts of 16p11.2 duplication, contingent on training schedule difficulty. Once on the two-arm spatial restless bandit task, 16p11.2 duplication was no longer a strong contributor to decision making. However, MK-801 decreased the tendency to stay with a rewarded choice, lowered the probability of selecting the highest rewarded option, and decreased the influence of prior outcomes on choice. Conclusions: The male-biased vulnerability in early operant training suggests that strategies for learning early schemas or in novel environments may be impacted by 16p11.2 duplication in males. In contrast, NMDAR are influential in the ability to flexibly switch between choices, and disrupting this function significantly impairs decision making in all animals.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Therefore, we used a recently developed Myt1l haploinsufficient mouse model to examine this gene's effects on ethanol-induced apoptosis across different developmental stages. We discovered that haploinsufficiency can moderately influence vulnerability to ethanol in a complex, age- and cell type-specific manner: apoptosis was reduced on P7, increased P21, but unaffected on P60. Remarkably, we also discovered the previously unrecognized ability of a single binge of ethanol to rapidly increase apoptosis within six hours in early adolescent and adult wild-type mice occurring in microglia and the newborn granule neurons in the hippocampus.

K.", "abstract": "Many newly encoded memories are labile when acquired but then consolidate to more stable states. Reconsolidation theory posits that reactivating a consolidated memory again destabilizes it, increasing its vulnerability to interference from competing memories. In a series of 3-day experiments, we investigated the fate of a motor memory when it is reactivated and challenged with a competing one. We pursued a modular design in which humans adapted to a visuomotor rotation A (day 1), then an opposite rotation B (day 2), followed by a retest on A (day 3). We first found that reactivating A before learning B (A-AB-A) caused no greater impairment in A retention than non-reactivation (A-B-A). That is, while interference occurred, it appeared to be uninfluenced by reactivation, contradicting reconsolidation predictions. We then tested an alternate idea, that reactivation might serve to protect the original memory from interference. In subsequent experiments, we introduced no rotation (N) trials either prior to A relearning (A-AB-NA and A-B-NA groups), or immediately after B learning (A-ABN-A and A-BN-A groups). Here, we observed that reactivation served a protective function, but only when B was washed out immediately, preventing its consolidation (A-ABN-A group). Collectively, our results show that reactivation does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of a motor memory to interference but may rather shield it from degradation by competing learning. Our findings align with theories positing memory transitions between active and inactive states, and hold implications for strategies focused on improving memory retention in rehabilitation, sports and skills training.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we found that response polarity in ON and OFF neurons is not fixed but rather switches dynamically to the opposite sign. The switch was not observed in rod-knockout mice, indicating that rods generate the polarity switch. We determined that neither horizontal cells nor rod-signaling pathways were responsible for the switch.

Hypoxic damage to the ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) sensory thalamic nuclei, in particular, precipitates CPSP. One barrier to developing treatments for CPSP is the lack of preclinical models of thalamic ischemic stroke. In this study, we present a novel mouse model of CPSP induced through targeted photothrombotic ischemia. After eliciting hypoxia in the sensory thalamus of male mice, we assessed pain behaviors over a four-week period. Stroke-affected mice exhibited a persistent spontaneous facial grimace from day four to week four post-stroke, indicative of pain. Hind-paw mechanical hypersensitivity indicative of altered nociception, characteristic of VPL and VPM hemorrhagic CPSP models, was not detected in our model. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased activated microglia (Iba1) and reactive astrocytes (GFAP). Iba1 fluorescence intensity in the VPL thalamus, but not the VPM thalamus, correlated with the severity of facial grimace at four weeks post-stroke. Clustering based on behavioral phenotypes identified a subpopulation of mice in which grimace pain spontaneously resolved, by four weeks post-stroke, relative to sham controls, suggesting that this model can be used to understand how stroke recovery may influence pain chronification.

However, accurate interpretation of GCaMP signals in the antenna requires understanding both response uniformity within an ORN population and how calcium signals relate to spike activity. To address this, we optimized a dual-modality recording method combining single-sensillum electrophysiology and widefield imaging for Drosophila ORNs. Calcium imaging showed that homotypic ab2A neurons exhibit similar odor sensitivity, consistent with spike recordings, indicating that a single ORN's response can reliably represent its homotypic counterparts. Furthermore, concurrent dual recordings revealed that peak calcium responses are linearly correlated with spike activity, regardless of imaging site (soma or dendrites), GCaMP variant, odorant, or fly age.

Here, we have studied its reinforcing effects in adolescent mice and characterized the neurochemical and behavioral effects induced in the same animals in adulthood. Methods: We utilized an intravenous self-administration (IVSA) protocol in adolescent (PND 40-56) CD-1 male mice. In adulthood (PND 66-78), we conducted several behavioral and neurobiological assessments including: Sucrose Preference Test (SPT); Resident Intruder Test (RIT); Olfactory Reactivity Test (ORT); brain microdialysis to quantify DA levels in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC); and fiber photometry analysis using the GCaMP calcium sensor to monitor excitatory neural dynamics in the mPFC after exposure to an aversive odorant. Results: We found that 5F-MDMB-PICA, administered through IVSA in adolescent mice, produced an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. The dose of 2.5 g/kg/25ul elicited behavior consistent with drug seeking. Adult mice exposed to 5F-MDMB-PICA during adolescence exhibited significant behavioral and neurochemical changes in adulthood compared to control mice. These behaviors included increased aggression, reduced social interaction, an anhedonic state, and an abolishment of mPFC DA response to an aversive odorant, as measured by in vivo brain microdialysis. Moreover, fiber photometry analysis of excitatory neuronal activity in the mPFC showed diminished calcium activity in response to the same aversive odorant in 5F-MDMB-PICA-exposed mice compared to controls.

Incoming sensory stimuli, which arrive from an egocentric perspective, must be integrated into an allocentric reference frame to allow neural computations that direct an animal toward a learned goal. This egocentric-allocentric spatial transformation has been proposed to involve projections from the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), which receives strong visual input, to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which contains allocentric spatial cell types such as grid and border cells. A major step toward understanding this transformation is to identify how POR and MEC spatial representations differ during place navigation, which is currently unknown. To answer this question, we recorded single neurons from POR and MEC as rats engaged in a navigation task that required them to repeatedly visit a learned uncued allocentric location in an open field arena to receive a randomly scattered food reward. While neurons in both regions displayed strong tuning to the spatial structure of the environment, neither showed bias toward the goal location despite strongly biased behavior. Critically, when local visual landmarks were manipulated to place the visual scene in conflict with the learned location, POR neurons adjusted their tuning preferences to follow the visual landmarks, while MEC neurons remained in register with the true global reference frame. These findings reveal a strong dissociation between POR and MEC spatial reference frames during place navigation and raise questions regarding the mechanisms underlying integration of POR egocentric signals into the MEC allocentric spatial map.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear whether gait speed influences responses to such perturbations. This study aims to examine the effects of gait speed on gait parameters following immediate and prolonged exposure to mediolateral optic flow perturbations. Methods: Twenty-one young adults (23.43 +/- 4.19 years) walked on an instrumented treadmill, including 3 phases: baseline (3 min), perturbation with mediolateral optic flow (8 min), and post-perturbation (3 min). Trials were conducted at 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 m/s. Ground reaction forces and 3D motion data were collected to calculate mediolateral margin of stability (MoS), mean step length (SL), step width (SW) and their variabilities. Three repeated-measures ANOVAs (Speed by Phase) were used to compare: baseline vs. early perturbation, early vs. late perturbation, and baseline vs. post-perturbation. Results: The responses to immediate and prolonged exposure to optic flow perturbation were speed dependent. Walking at slow speeds induced greater immediate responses in mediolateral gait parameters (SW and mediolateral MoS, both p < 0.001) compared to walking at faster speeds. During the perturbation phase, the adaptations were larger at faster vs. slower speeds for gait parameters in the direction of movement (SL, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Immediate responses and adaptations to mediolateral optic flow perturbations are speed-dependent and larger at slower gait speeds. The responses to prolonged perturbation are interpreted as step-to-step adaptations that may inform future interventions and studies on gait speed selection.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

K.; Ashrafi, K.", "abstract": "The steroid hormone 5-androstene-3{beta},17{beta}-diol (ADIOL) was discovered in humans nearly a century ago, yet its physiological roles remain poorly defined. Here, we show that fasting and caloric restriction, two forms of dietary restriction, induce transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family enzymes, promoting ADIOL biosynthesis. ADIOL, in turn, acts on the nervous system to reduce levels of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive metabolite linked to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This effect requires NHR-91, the C. elegans homolog of estrogen receptor {beta}, specifically in the RIM neuron, a key site of kynurenic acid production. Consistent with the known benefits of fasting and caloric restriction on healthspan, enhancing ADIOL signaling improves multiple healthspan indicators during aging. Conversely, animals deficient in ADIOL signaling exhibit reduced healthspan under normal conditions and in genetic models of caloric restriction, underscoring the functional significance of this pathway. Furthermore, ADIOL suppresses cellular stresses induced by the Alzheimer's-associated APOE4 variant, highlighting its potential as a neuroprotective agent. Notably, ADIOL does not significantly impact lifespan, indicating that its healthspan benefits are not simply a byproduct of lifespan extension. Together, these findings establish a physiological role for ADIOL in mediating the neuroprotective and pro-healthspan effects of fasting and caloric restriction and suggest that boosting ADIOL signaling may help narrow the gap between lifespan and healthspan. This positions ADIOL as a promising mimetic of dietary restriction effects on healthspan that could be used as a therapeutic strategy for age-related neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

These cryptic exons frequently introduce premature termination codons resulting in the degradation of affected transcripts through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Conventional RNA sequencing approaches thus may fail to detect cryptic exons that are efficiently degraded by NMD, precluding identification of potential therapeutic targets. We generated a comprehensive set of neuronal targets of TDP-43 in human iPSC-derived i3Neurons (i3N) by combining TDP-43 knockdown with inhibition of multiple factors essential for NMD, revealing novel cryptic targets.

We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of CA3 pyramidal neurons and whole-cell patch clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, to characterize the contributions of different forms of heterogeneity to information flow. We found pronounced heterogeneity in synaptic responses and short-term plasticity (STP), influenced by the neurotransmitter identity, input pattern, and size of the activated presynaptic ensemble. Inhibitory synapses exhibited greater diversity in both response variability and depression profiles than excitatory synapses. We incorporated these readings in a molecule-to-network multiscale model of the CA3->CA1 circuit. The reference model shows strong decorrelation of autocorrelated input, but removal of STP makes the decorrelation frequency dependent.

Although prior knowledge, such as schemas, is known to influence learning and memory, its impact on the neural mechanisms underlying inference remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how schema congruency affects the encoding and retrieval of overlapping events and how these processes contribute to memory-based inference. Thirty-nine participants encoded AB associations, consisting of picture-word pairs presented on either schema-congruent or schema-incongruent backgrounds. These were followed by BC associations involving the same word paired with a new picture on a neutral background. At test, participants were asked to infer the indirect AC association. While overall inference accuracy did not differ as a function of schema congruency, behavioral and neural data revealed distinct mechanisms. Inference for schema-incongruent events depended on accurate retrieval of both AB and BC associations, whereas schema-congruent inferences did not. To investigate the neural processes involved, we trained hierarchical multivariate pattern classifiers on EEG data to detect schema and context reinstatement during task performance. For schema-congruent events, successful inference was predicted by schema reinstatement during BC encoding, consistent with integrating overlapping information into a unified memory trace. In contrast, successful inference for schema-incongruent events was predicted by context reinstatement during AC retrieval, reflecting a reliance on flexible recombination of separate memory representations. These findings demonstrate that schema congruency modulates the neural basis of memory-based inference. Congruent events are integrated during encoding, whereas incongruent events rely on retrieval-based inference.

When the reliability of one source of sensory information used to detect self-motion for posture control is reduced, there may be a reweighting of inputs within and/or across the remaining sensory systems determining self-motion for postural control. Muscle vibration, which creates an illusion of muscle stretch and a compensatory movement to shorten the vibrated muscle, may be used to determine the weighting of muscle spindle Ia proprioception for posture control. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vision occlusion on triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control during quiet stance, utilizing 80 Hz muscle vibration and a quantitative measure of the bodys anterior to posterior ground center of pressure response to triceps surae muscle vibration in freely standing subjects. Subjects (N = 41; mean(standard deviation), 19.6(2.0) years) were examined as they stood with eyes open or eyes closed. Ground center of pressure was measured during quiet standing with, and without, bilateral vibration of the triceps surae muscles. The mean backward center of pressure shift induced by triceps surae vibration was significantly greater during the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open (eyes closed: -4.93(1.62) centimeters; eyes open: -3.21(1.33) centimeters; p = 6.85E-10; Cohens d = 1.29). Thirty-seven subjects increased, and two subjects decreased, their vibration induced center of pressure backward shift in the eyes closed condition compared to eyes open, although the magnitude of the change varied. Results support the idea that for most subjects, during an eyes closed stance there is an increased triceps surae muscle Ia proprioceptive weighting for postural control, due to the need for posture control to depend more on non-visual feedback.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Knowing the CTP driving OOV artifacts enables optimization of crusher gradients to improve their suppression without additional data acquisition. Theory and Methods A phase cycle systematically changes the phase of RF pulses across the transients of an experiment, encoding phase shifts into the data that can be used to suppress unwanted CTPs. We present a new approach, phase cycle inversion (PCI), which removes the receiver phase originally applied to the stored transients, replacing it with new receiver phases, matching the phase evolutions associated with each unwanted CTP, to identify the OOV signals. We demonstrated the efficacy of PCI using the MEGA-edited PRESS sequence in simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. Based on these findings, the crusher gradient scheme was optimized. Results The simulation results demonstrated that PCI can fully separate signals originating from different CTPs using a complete phase cycling scheme. PCI effectively identified the CTP responsible for OOV signals in phantom experiments and in vivo, though with reduced specificity in vivo due to phase instabilities. Re-optimization of the gradient scheme based on the identified OOV-associated CTP to suppress these signals, resulted in cleaner spectra in six volunteers. Conclusion PCI can be broadly applied across pulse sequences and voxel locations, making it a flexible and generalizable approach for diagnosing the CTP origin of OOV signals.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

This study provides the first detailed characterization of the VNS in the Iberian mole (Talpa occidentalis), a fossorial species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We performed a morphofunctional and neurochemical analysis of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) using histology, immunohistochemistry, and lectin histochemistry. The VNO in T. occidentalis exhibited an unusual circular lumen lined by a uniform sensory epithelium, lacking the dual epithelial organization seen in most species. The vomeronasal cartilage was limited in extent and did not form the typical J-shaped structure. Importantly, no evidence of a vomeronasal pump was found, suggesting alternative mechanisms for semiochemical entry, likely facilitated by the anatomical position of the organ and continuous receptor distribution. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong expression of Gai2 and Gg8 in sensory neurons, with weaker Ga0 expression, suggesting predominance of V1R-type signal transduction. The AOB, though small, exhibited clear lamination and specific marker localization (Gai2, OMP, CR, MAP2), indicating robust functional organization.

By utilizing the fly optic lobe, whose neurogenic program parallels that of mammals, and the genetic tools available in this organism, we uncover the progenitor cell types and critical neurogenesis window necessary for proper brain size and architecture. Asp has an essential function in symmetrically dividing neuroepithelial precursors, yet its expression in asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts alone is not sufficient for optic lobe development. Asp is highly expressed during both embryonic and larval neurogenesis stages, but embryonic expression is dispensable for making a properly sized adult brain. We also show that Asp/ASPM interphase nuclear localization is not required for its ability to promote brain development. Expression of the human ASPM N-terminus can also significantly rescue fly brain defects, suggesting conserved mechanisms of function in brain growth control.

However, the mechanism of TRPML3 mediated autophagy induction and the underlying gene expression changes are not clearly understood. Here, by using Ca2+- and electrical-current measurements, RNA sequencing and RT PCR studies, we explored the cellular function of TRPML3 and the global transcriptomic profile in a cell-based serum starvation model of autophagy. We report that serum starvation leads to downregulation of neuronal developmental genes during autophagy induction. TRPML3 overexpression further amplifies the effect of starvation in downregulating neuronal gene expression. But, when nutrition is not a limiting condition, TRPML3 overexpression upregulated neuronal genes including those responsible for axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and dendritic arborization. TRPML3 mediated neuronal gene expression changes were, presumably, due to transcription factors (TF) TFEB, FOXO1 and neuron-specific TFs such as SOX2, and ETV5. To further validate the role of TRPML3 in neuronal gene regulation, we performed meta-analysis of publicly available RNAseq datasets on neurodegenerative disorders which provided insight into the heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and corroborated the TFEB-mediated autophagy induction and neuronal gene expression in TRPML3 overexpression condition.

Although the ability to choose correctly decreased over time, we could not measure any differences in memory between flies that initially chose correctly and those that chose incorrectly upon retest. This suggests that forgetting is unlikely to consist of a spontaneous loss of a memory but instead consists of a decrease in the probability of flies that remember choosing the correct behavioral response. Thus, although flies maintain memory over time, there is an increase in uncertainty associated with this memory.

Impairments in cerebral energy metabolism are increasingly recognized as central in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Elderly patients and patients with AD are also at elevated risk for perioperative neurological complications, including post-operative delirium and further cognitive deterioration. However, the interaction between metabolic vulnerability and anesthetic exposure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated cortical metabolic responses and potassium homeostasis in acute brain slices from wild-type (WT) and AD-like APPPS1 transgenic mice, which were either exposed to isoflurane or left untreated. Glia cells were assessed by staining microglia and astrocytes. Measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), extracellular potassium dynamics, and proteomic profiling were integrated with computational modeling to assess oxidative metabolism and anesthetic effects under different conditions. Results: APPPS1 mice exhibited reduced CMRO2 and attenuated neuronal activity compared to age-matched WT controls, showing sex-specific differences. Proteomic analysis revealed the downregulation of key mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes, indicating an impaired ATP-generating capacity. Exposure to isoflurane further suppressed CMRO2, with a more pronounced effect in the APPPS1 brain tissue, while glia cells exhibited no acute changes. Additionally, isoflurane exacerbated deficits in extracellular potassium ([K]) clearance, highlighting impaired ion homeostasis under anesthetic challenge. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice is associated with a significant decline in oxidative metabolism and ATP availability. These deficits are exacerbated by anesthetic exposure, contributing to impaired potassium regulation. This suggests that diminished metabolic flexibility may underlie increased anesthetic vulnerability and postoperative complications in AD.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Memory replay during sleep has been proposed as a powerful mechanism contributing to interference-free new learning. In contrast, artificial neural networks suffer from a problem called catastrophic forgetting, where new training damages existing memories. This issue can be mitigated by interleaving training on new tasks with past data; however, whether the brain employs this strategy remains unknown. In this work, we show that slow-wave sleep (SWS) employs an interleaved replay of familiar cortical and novel hippocampal memory traces within individual Up states of the slow oscillation (SO), allowing new memories to be embedded into the existing pool of cortical memories without interference. Using a combination of biophysical modeling and analyses of single-unit activity from the mouse retrosplenial cortex - for a mouse trained first in a highly familiar environment and then in a novel one - we found that hippocampal ripples arriving near the Down-to-Up or Up-to-Down transitions of the sleep SO can entrain novel memory replay, while the middle phase of the Up state tends to replay familiar cortical memories. This strategy ensures the consolidation of novel cortical memory traces into long-term storage while minimizing damage to familiar ones. This study presents a novel framework for how replay of familiar and novel memory traces is organized during SWS to enable continual learning.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Most Ca2+ enters the cell via ligand- or voltage-gated channels on the neuronal membrane, where it stimulates the release of additional Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the influence of cytosolic Ca2+ on neuronal metabolism has been widely investigated, relatively few studies have explored the contribution of ER Ca2+ release in this context. Therefore, we investigated how activity-driven Ca2+ crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria influences the regulation of mitochondrial ATP production. We show that in primary hippocampal neurons derived from rat pups of either sex, depletion of ER Ca2+ led to a reduction in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels during both resting and stimulated states, while exerting only a minimal impact on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Additionally, impaired ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer led to a reduction in mitochondrial ATP production. Similar effects were observed when inositol-3-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs), but not ryanodine receptors (RyRs), were pharmacologically inhibited. Together, our findings show that, in hippocampal neurons, Ca2+ is transferred from the ER to mitochondria through IP3 receptors, and this Ca2+ crosstalk in turn enhances mitochondrial ATP production in response to neuronal activity.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we ask whether VWM inherits the spatial constraints observed in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) during perception, or instead reorganizes these representations to meet mnemonic demands. Using matched bilateral presentation paradigms and fMRI-based decoding, we systematically compared spatial representations during perception and VWM. This approach revealed a striking dissociation: during perception, object information is largely confined to the contralateral LOC, whereas during VWM, robust ipsilateral representations emerge--even when both hemifields must be remembered. Vertex-ablation analyses revealed that VWM engages 70-90% of ipsilateral LOC territories, far exceeding those recruited during unilateral perception. Neither increased attentional span nor top-down feedback from association areas fully explained this expansion; rather, ipsilateral LOC patterns closely mirrored contralateral sensory representations, implicating interhemispheric coordination in VWM.

Here, we report that whereas mouse type I interferon (IFN-I) or interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) dramatically restrict R. parkeri in macrophages, human interferons do not. Differential RNA-seq revealed a significant induction of nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2, encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS) in infected mouse but not human macrophages upon interferon treatment. Chemical iNOS inhibition or Nos2 deletion restored IFN-{gamma}-mediated restriction in mouse cells. Human cells treated with cytokine cocktails or with iNOS cofactors and substrates were unable to restrict R. parkeri. In vivo, whereas wild type mice restricted R. parkeri, infected Nos2-/- mice developed mild skin eschars, recapitulating a key human disease manifestation. Together, our findings suggest that there is a threshold of NO production required to restrict R. parkeri, which mouse cells reach but human cells do not, and this is a key explanation for why humans develop tick-borne rickettsial diseases while rodents can be tolerant, asymptomatic reservoirs.

The formation of these biofilms is controlled by a complex transcriptional network and involves over a thousand genes, many of which are uncharacterized. We have investigated three genes (ORF19.4654, ORF19.7608, and PBR1), found only in C. albicans and closely related species, that are highly induced under biofilm conditions and encode small proteins with N-terminal signal sequences. Through the construction of fluorescent protein fusions, we have examined the location of the encoded proteins in both planktonic and biofilm cells. Orf19.4654-Scarlet and Pbr1-Scarlet were localized to the vacuole under both conditions. In contrast, the Orf19.7608-GFP fusion generated a punctate pattern only under biofilm conditions and was designated Ppp1 (Punctate Pattern Protein 1). The Ppp1-GFP puncta were similar in location, stability, and size to those formed by the eisosome subunit Sur7, but co-localization studies suggest that Ppp1 and Sur7 define separate elements. The PPP1 mutation does not cause a distinct phenotype under various stress conditions or in the presence of antifungals and does not impact biofilm formation and biomass. These data suggest that while the expression and cellular localization of Ppp1 appear controlled by conditions generating biofilms, and define a unique subcellular localization pattern, Ppp1 protein function is not essential for biofilm formation.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

M.; Enninga, J.; Arbibe, L.", "abstract": "Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes bacillary dysentery by invading and replicating within intestinal epithelial cells. Successful intracellular survival requires the bacterium to balance metabolic adaptation with the sustained expression of virulence programs by the type III secretion system (T3SS). Toxin antitoxin (TA) systems, including the highly conserved type II VapBC module, are classically associated with plasmid maintenance via post-segregational killing, but their broader roles during infection remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the function of the VapBC system during S. flexneri infection. We show that the vapBC operon is activated in response to intracellular stress and that VapC-dependent cleavage of initiator tRNAfMet occurs specifically during infection. The stringent response, primarily mediated by SpoT, appears to influence operon responsiveness by maintaining vapB expression levels, while iron limitation emerges as a strong activator of vapC transcription and activity. Deletion of vapBC impairs T3SS activation and bacterial dissemination, despite normal invasion, and induces a strong host interferon response, including the upregulation of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), known to restrict bacterial spread. Transcriptomic profiling of the vapBC mutant reveals downregulation of core metabolic genes and upregulation of envelope stress and other TA modules, indicating a loss of intracellular homeostasis. These findings uncover a novel role for VapBC in promoting Shigella fitness by coordinating stress adaptation, virulence expression, and immune evasion, thereby sustaining the bacterium intracellular lifestyle.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Their resistance to acidic pH and the pasteurisation processes commonly used in the food industry demands the investigation of new preservation strategies. Bacteriophage-related treatments have emerged as a promising alternative, being considered safe, green, and sustainable. In this study, the type strain Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris DSM 3922T and a food isolate, A. acidoterrestris MMB007, were used as hosts to isolate new ACB-targeting phages. A phage was isolated from a soil sample in contact with the type strain, purified, and characterised for its genetic and phenotypic features. The isolated phage, named Alicyclobacillus phage MMB025, belongs to the Caudoviricetes class and exhibits a narrow host range. Also, phage MMB025 was revealed to be stable under different environmental conditions, maintaining its lytic activity across a wide range of pH values (3 to 12) and high temperatures (up to 1 h at 60 {degrees}C). The hybrid assembly of short and long reads revealed a phage genome of 105,243 bp with a GC content of 43.25 %. Sequence mapping to the A. acidoterrestris DSM 3922T genome indicated phage DNA integration within the bacterial chromosome, disrupting the sigK open reading frame. This suggests that MMB025 may have originated from a prophage induction event potentially linked to sporulation regulation. Despite the limitations derived from its likely temperate nature, phage MMB025 remains a valuable source of lysins capable of specifically and effectively eliminating ACB bacteria. More importantly, this study highlights the potential of phages as an alternative preservation strategy against ACB bacteria.

Despite the removal of penicillin from treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in the 1980s, ponAL421P is present in nearly 50% of current N. gonorrhoeae isolates in the PubMLST database. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that ponAL421P is exclusive to N. gonorrhoeae isolates, whereas Leu-421 is 100% conserved in other Neisseria species. To understand the involvement of ponAL421P in antibiotic resistance, we introduced ponA variants encoding 16 different amino acids at position-421 into FA6140, a penicillin-resistant gonococcal isolate that naturally harbors ponAL421P. Proline-421 was the only mutation that increased the MICPEN to the same level as FA6140. We also assessed the fitness of strains with the 16 mutant ponA alleles over multiple serial passages, both with and without sub-MIC levels of penicillin. There was no fitness defect attributed to ponAL421P under these experimental conditions; instead, our analyses suggest that the widespread occurrence of ponAL421P is driven by its capacity to increase the MICPEN above the clinical breakpoint. In FA6140 transformed with the mosaic penA allele from strain H041, a ceftriaxone-resistant isolate, ponAL421P increased the MIC of ceftriaxone, suggesting that ceftriaxone targets PBP1 in this strain. We conclude that the ponAL421P allele emerged in gonococcal isolates, increasing the MICPEN above the clinical breakpoint, and has remained in the population even after the removal of penicillin from treatment guidelines.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features.

We identified four groups of mixotrophic phytoplankton using both methods: Pedinellales (Dictyochophyceae), Cryptomonas (Cryptophyceae), Dinobryon (Chrysophyceae), and a single-chloroplast bearing group within Chlorophyta. These groups accounted for 58-96% and 54-95% of total mixotrophs identified by the two methods, respectively. Seasonal variations demonstrated that Pedinellales and Chlorophyta were more abundant in spring and summer/autumn, while Dinobryon was only present in winter when temperatures were lowest and light intensity was moderate.

This behavior, widespread across diverse biological systems, is paradoxical because it suggests a seemingly wasteful use of resources that could instead be employed to maximize energy production. In this work, we investigate the ecological implications of metabolic overflow, using bacterial acetate metabolism as a model. We formulate a second-order generalization of the logistic growth equation, incorporating resource availability and acceleration dynamics to provide an explicit mechanistic link between metabolic overflow and ecological collapse. We demonstrate that acetate-mediated growth deceleration reduces the risk of overshoot and collapse, especially under conditions of resource oversupply. By inhibiting excessive proliferation, acetate overflow enhances the survival and stability of bacterial communities in fluctuating environments. In this context, acetate acts as a quorum-sensing signal, coordinating population-wide responses and enabling the active regulation of growth rates before resource exhaustion occurs. Our findings suggest that overflow metabolism is an adaptive strategy evolved to mitigate the risk of ecological collapse and stabilize microbial populations.

Methods In a low-effort group (n=9), Bombus terrestris learned to press a lever to access sugar water solution (instrumental task) and responded with a constant effort for a period of four hours, whereas in a high-effort group (n=10), subjects were trained with the same task, but effort requirement was doubled in the last two hours of the experiment. The gene expression profiles of these two groups were compared with a control group (n=10) where subjects had access to the sucrose solution ad libitum, and no learning or effort manipulation took place. After running the experiment, total RNA from each bumblebees mushroom bodies was shipped to Novogene for high-throughput RNA sequencing (mRNAseq). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of the two training protocols on biochemical pathways. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between the top five mRNAs and bumblebee performance on high- and low-effort tasks. Results In total, 150 and 112 genes were deregulated by the low- and high-effort procedures, respectively. Complete hierarchic clustering regarding low- and high-effort groups versus the control was observed. GO analyses of the low- and high effort groups versus control revealed that the deregulated genes were associated with pathways related to lipid metabolism. Analyses of the top five deregulated genes suggested a link between mRNA of LOC100646091 to performance following low effort protocol. Conclusion The data from the present study showed that exposure to the low- and high -effort reinforcement procedures may be associated with the deregulation of many genes related to lipid metabolism in the bumblebees mushroom bodies.

Cleavage of the viral polyprotein depends on the catalytic activity of nsP2, which is essential for viral replication. Due to this critical role, the nsP2 protease is a promising target for antiviral drug development. Animal venom-derived peptides have shown great potential against a variety of diseases, including infections, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects and properties of pantinin-1, a peptide derived from the scorpion Pandinus imperator with broad antimicrobial activity, against CHIKV nsP2 protease. Pantinin-1 effectively inhibited CHIKV nsP2 protease, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC) of 6.4 {+/-} 2.04 M and complete inhibition at 175 M. Further analysis revealed that pantinin-1 acts as a competitive inhibitor with low micromolar affinity and showed no toxicity up to 20 M in cell culture.

Existing bioimage analysis tools, including machine learning-based ones, often struggle with the unique staining patterns, complex midgut backgrounds, and variable morphology of oocysts, making the determination of oocyst size and numbers cumbersome. To overcome these challenges, we curated a high-quality dataset comprised of 11,178 Plasmodium falciparum oocysts in Anopheles gambiae midguts annotated by expert parasitologists. Using this dataset, we fine-tuned a Mask R-CNN object detection model to achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to human parasitologists (Spearman's correlation of 0.998 for oocyst counts and 0.978 for size measurements). Applying this tool in conjunction with spatial analysis, we uncovered a non-random, clustered spatial distribution of oocysts independent of the midgut's anatomical regions or geometric axes, particularly in infections with fewer than 75 oocysts/midgut. Our workflow significantly accelerates malaria oocyst intensity and size analysis, reduces human bias, and provides spatial coordinates for advanced parasitology studies. OocystMeter is freely available at https://github.com/duopeng/OocystMeter, and as a web tool at http://Oocystmeter.org/, offering a valuable resource for researchers investigating the oocyst stage of malaria development.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Well-established, cost-effective, genomic-sequence-based methods are replacing or complementing laborious, slow and costly culture-based diagnostics. These methods include: end-point PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), as well as digital PCR (dPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). All these methods require oligonucleotide primers whose nucleotide sequences confer high specificity and sensitivity for the intended target. The most challenging steps in designing these assays include finding genomic sequences that are unique to the target pathogen and absent from off-target organisms, as well as designing primers for those sequences. Here, we present user-friendly, reliable and comprehensive tool DiPPER2 (Diagnostic Primer Picking and Evaluation pipeline for Reproducibility and Reliability), which finds unique diagnostic targets, designs end-point or qPCR primers for them, evaluates the primers in silico for specificity and sensitivity, characterizes the diagnostic target and produces a comprehensive and intuitive report. The pipeline has been developed according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) principles and allows for flexible adjustment of primer parameters. It designs primers compatible with qPCR-, dPCR- and ddPCR. DiPPER2 can also evaluate previously designed primer sequences in silico for specificity and sensitivity.

Employing extensive constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed atomistic characterization of {beta}2AR inactivation across physiologically relevant pH values (4-9). Our simulations reveal that {beta}2AR inactivation is closely linked to protonation events at critical residues, notably E2686x30 involved in the ionic lock formation.

Instead, sodium ions predominantly interact with D1133x32, effectively blocking deeper entry toward the traditional binding site.

C.; DELFINI, M.-C.", "abstract": "One-third of skin melanomas arise from melanocytic nevi, benign skin lesions composed of clustered melanocytes. Benign nevi are associated with overactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase RAS/ERK pathway, resulting from driver mutations, most commonly in the BRAF or NRAS gene. However, this overactivation in melanocytes is insufficient to induce melanoma formation, as only a minority of benign nevi give rise to melanoma. Overactivation of the RAS/ERK pathway promotes genetic and epigenetic alterations by inducing aneuploidy, but the processes by which nevi evolve into melanoma via RAS/ERK pathway-dependent aneuploidy are only partially understood. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing after overactivation of the RAS/ERK pathway in the chicken embryo, we discovered that RIPOR2 is a positive transcriptional target of this pathway, including in melanocyte precursors. Similar transcriptional control of RIPOR2 by RAS/ERK is conserved in human melanoma cells. RIPOR2 emerged as an attractive target because it encodes an atypical RHOA inhibitory protein involved in the development of physiologically multinucleated cell types. Multinucleation in cancer has been shown to promote aneuploidy, which correlates with tumor aggressiveness. We found that RIPOR2 is ectopically expressed in human nevi and skin melanomas and functionally promotes multinucleation in both an animal model and human tumor-derived cells, including melanoma cell lines. Our results suggest that RIPOR2 expression, downstream of RAS/ERK overactivation in skin melanocytes, promotes the emergence of multinucleated cells, a previously overlooked step in melanoma formation.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the effects of theta-burst TUS (tb-TUS), a neuromodulatory pattern characterized by bursts of pulses repeated at a theta frequency, on cerebral blood flow, functional connectivity, and metabolite concentrations in the primary motor cortex (M1). This study aims to take a first step towards the mechanistic and methodological feasibility of tb-TUS at the M1 using multimodal neuroimaging. Methods: Seventeen healthy participants underwent a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover design, receiving both active and sham tb-TUS to the left M1 over three days. Multimodal MRI, including pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), was conducted at baseline, pre-, and post-stimulation. Acoustic simulations and finger-tapping BOLD-peak signal guided individualized TUS targeting. Results: Active tb-TUS significantly reduced cerebral blood flow (p < .001) and within-region functional connectivity (p < .001) in the M1 compared to sham stimulation. A non-significant trend towards decreased GABA was observed, with no significant session x condition interaction found for GABA, Glutamate, or Glx concentrations. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that tb-TUS of the M1 induces reductions in cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity in healthy participants. These findings indicate that tb-TUS may be used to mitigate neural hyperactivity patterns in future clinical studies, but highlight the need for further research to replicate our findings, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and optimize stimulation protocols.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Among these, Hemerythrin RING Zinc finger (HRZ) proteins have emerged as key regulators of Fe homeostasis. In this study, six wheat HRZ homoeologs TaHRZ1 and TaHRZ2 were identified from rice HRZ sequences and mapped to chromosomes 1 and 3. These encode proteins with conserved N-terminal Hemerythrin (HHE) domains and C-terminal CHY-RING and Zn-ribbon motifs. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes into distinct clades, while expression profiling revealed strong root-specific and Fe-responsive expression patterns, indicating roles in nutrient sensing. Functional conservation was demonstrated by complementation of the Arabidopsis bts-1 mutant, where both wheat genes restored normal Fe regulation. Full-length TaHRZ1 and TaHRZ2 interacted with members of wheat bHLH IVc transcription factors, while truncated versions lacking the RING domain did not, emphasising their conserved role in protein interactions. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the conserved HHE3 domain in all the TaHRZ1 homoeologs, coupled with GRF4-GIF1 chimeric protein, achieved ~9% regeneration efficiency in wheat cultivar C306. Grain ICP-MS analysis indicated enhanced iron loading in the edited lines, particularly in the scutellum, suggesting improved iron partitioning compared to the wild type. Additionally, qRT-PCR revealed upregulation of FIT and IRO3, and downregulation of IDEF1 in edited lines, supporting a central role for TaHRZ1 in Fe homeostasis signalling.

B.", "abstract": "Precise motor control relies on continuous sensory feedback from muscles, a process in which gamma motoneurons play a key role. These specialized spinal neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibres, modulating their sensitivity to stretch and maintaining proprioceptive signalling during movement. Gamma motoneurons are characterized by a distinct biophysical profile, including low recruitment thresholds and high firing rates that enable rapid activation of intrafusal fibres at contraction onset. Despite their importance, the intrinsic mechanisms that underlie these properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we analysed published and unpublished data to identify a population of low-threshold, high-gain motoneurons with features consistent with gamma motoneurons, emerging during the third postnatal week in mice. Their low recruitment threshold was linked to lower membrane capacitance, higher input resistance, a more hyperpolarized activation of persistent inward currents (PICs), and a narrower axon initial segment. In contrast, higher firing rates were associated not with PIC amplitude but with shorter action potential durations and smaller medium afterhyperpolarizations. Notably, 92% of putative gamma motoneurons exhibited a sodium pump-mediated ultra-slow afterhyperpolarization (usAHP), which was absent in slow alpha motoneurons. This difference could not be attributed to h-current activity or expression of the alpha 3 subunit of the sodium-potassium ATPase. These findings reveal key intrinsic properties that support the unique excitability of gamma motoneurons, offering new insight into their contribution to motor control.

We uncovered a complex, polygenic architecture underlying all three traits, involving novel loci linked to stress responses, cell cycle, and genome integrity. Notably, canonical resistance genes were absent from our top associations, reflecting either their low frequency or lineage specificity. Functional validation of several candidate genes confirmed distinct genetic determinants for each drug response. Heritability estimates and conditional analyses revealed that susceptibility and heteroresistance are governed by partially overlapping but largely independent loci, with some genetic variants displaying opposing effects on different traits. This limited overlap suggests that each phenotype represents a distinct evolutionary strategy for drug evasion, which may not be simultaneously addressed by a single therapeutic approach.

Our mesophilic composts exhibited clear PLA biodegradability, and this is due to specific biological activity enriched in our material. To investigate the nature of this mesophilic activity, we conducted metagenomics analysis to reveal the microbial composition and enzyme-coding potential associated with PLA biodegradation. These efforts revealed multiple enzyme subtypes with strong enrichment on PLA surfaces in our trained composts, and the top candidate was a type of hydro-lyase, an enzyme that can cleave carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bonds, both present in the chemical structure of PLA, in the absence of water. Hydro-lyases represent a novel class of enzymes that could facilitate PLA degradation, and our results point to the model that the combinatorial action of multiple types of enzymes is what drives PLA biodegradation and how the temperature barrier for PLA composting is overcome.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

To mitigate the impact of resistance, multiplexed gRNA strategies have been demonstrated. However, unless both outmost sites are cleaved simultaneously, poor homology during DNA repair may compromise efficiency, leading to decline in drive conversion efficiency when the number of gRNAs is higher than two. Here, to better estimate the rate of drive efficiency decline, we designed and assessed the efficiency of single gRNA drives with imperfect homologous arms, refining a detailed gRNA multiplexing model. To mitigate the greater than expected efficiency loss, we further evaluated two new strategies: (1) extended homology arms to span all target sites with mutations in the PAMs and (2) a population-level multiplexing gRNAs system involving two or more drives, each carrying two gRNAs. Specifically, the population-level multiplexing system has four adjacent gRNA target sites, and the drives have small mutations in their homologous arms to prevent cleavage by the other drive. Mutations in both strategies did not impair efficiency, but they were not consistently inherited, and undesired cutting in the homologous arms decreased drive efficiency. We simulated homing suppression drive using a dual 2-gRNA population-level gRNA multiplexing strategy based on our experimental evaluation. Despite being somewhat more vulnerable to functional resistance than a standard 4-gRNA drive, the higher individual drive efficiency of the population-level multiplexing system increased successful population elimination outcomes. Thus, population-level multiplexing can be a useful for improving suppression drive power.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

The ribosomes of F. tularensis can incorporate one of three different paralogs for the small ribosomal subunit protein bS21.

Although ribosomal bS21 content influences F. tularensis virulence, the factors that control bS21 paralog production are not well understood. Here, we reveal that all three bS21 proteins influence the transcript abundance of the paralog important for virulence, bS21-2. In contrast, the other bS21 paralogs (bS21-1 and bS21-3) do not affect their own production. We further determined that the leader sequence of the bS21-2 mRNA is sufficient for bS21-mediated repression of mRNA abundance, suggesting that bS21-2 is autogenously regulated. Yet we determined that the increase in bS21-2-encoding mRNA is not reflected by increased protein production, suggesting that translation of this transcript is controlled by other factors. Finally, we found that bS21-2 exerts at least some of its effects on the bS21-2 transcript by decreasing its stability. Together, our findings suggest that F. tularensis integrates multiple signals into a regulatory network to control the appropriate production of each bS21 paralog, and particularly the paralog important for virulence, bS21-2.

Here, we report an integrative structural and functional analysis of the SteAB system, a regulatory complex that has been shown to modulate cell separation in the model organism Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cglu) and is conserved across Mycobacteriales. Although Mtb SteB was previously proposed to act as a mycobacterial outer membrane copper transporter, the crystal structures of the homodimeric protein, alone and in complex with the RipA coiled-coil (CC) domain, rule out this hypothesis. Instead, the high-affinity SteB-RipA interaction, together with computational and biophysical data, strongly supports the role of SteB as a direct RipA activator that releases enzyme autoinhibition upon complex formation. In addition, crystallographic characterization of the cytoplasmic core of SteA revealed a homodimeric organization harboring a conserved functional pocket similar to the phosphonucleotide-binding site of thiamine pyrophosphokinase. These data, coupled with the in vivo phenotypic analysis of a steAB knockout mutant of Cglu, support a model in which the transmembrane SteAB heterotetramer, driven by cytoplasmic ligand binding, orchestrates the productive periplasmic positioning of RipA, leading to PG hydrolysis activation.

In Bacillus subtilis, this can be achieved through the coordinated action of the alarmones (p)ppGpp and the transcription factor Spx. In this study, we performed a genetic screen to identify new factors involved in the heat shock response of B. subtilis. We discovered that the RNase Y specificity factor Y-complex plays an important role in the heat shock response and the transition to the stationary growth phase. The Y-complex is required for the processing of various RNAs, including the maturation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in translation and metabolism. We further demonstrate that the Y-complex and RNase Y initiate the degradation of rRNAs in mature ribosomes, lowering their abundance. We propose the Y-complex as a system by which B. subtilis regulates protein synthesis and resource allocation after exponential growth.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

Here we report a solution based on morphology, Raman spectrometry and the Laser-Induced Forward Transfer technology, which works at microbial single cells, many generations before they appear as colonies. We develop a machine learning-based framework that enables species-level targeted sorting of single microbial cells from complex microbiome. We illustrate the utility of this approach in selecting for or against specific bacteria in fecal microbiome samples and the potential for quantifying the molecules expressed based on Raman spectra. Analysis of single-cell cultured genomes reveals that brief antibiotic use drives both pre-existing resistance and de novo mutations in the transpeptidase or efflux pumps of gut commensals, along with convergent evolution between different species. Our precision culturomics method should enable detailed morphological, metabolic, and genomic insights into variations in microbial phenotypes at the single-cell level for microbiome studies.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "How signals coordinate cellular differentiation with proliferation to regulate cell fate transitions is poorly understood. Hair follicle dermal condensates (DCs) emerge in developing skin from an acute cell fate transition in which molecular differentiation and cell cycle exit occur simultaneously. Here, we show that the coincident levels of Wnt and Hedgehog signals synchronize these two processes and when uncoupled, trigger them independently, resulting in asynchronous arrest and fuzzy cell fate borders. We use an innovative computational approach to dissect out independent processes from scRNA-sequencing data to show that high Wnt activity alone elicits cell cycle exit through a Hedgehog mediator, Gli3. Furthermore, Hedgehog induces DC genes in a Wnt-dependent manner while cell-autonomously accelerating Wnt activity, effectively synchronizing cell cycle exit with DC gene expression. These results show that the interaction of signal gradients can balance proliferation with differentiation to regulate cell fate transitions, revealing a tunable logic to tissue patterning.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Ecosystems as adaptive living circuits", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.27.661910", "authors": "Dhanuka, A.; Flamholz, A. I.; Murugan, A.; Goyal, A.", "abstract": "Unlike many physical nonequilibrium systems, in biological systems, the coupling to external energy sources is not a fixed parameter but adaptively controlled by the system itself. We do not have theoretical frameworks that allow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent behavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive coevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a framework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the energy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional nonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from equilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical driving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that saves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the adaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking any global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal dissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work establishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose structure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Barriers Broken: Genetic Swamping in Restored Brook Trout Populations", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.25.661651", "authors": "Smith, R.; Fitzpatrick, B.; Kulp, M.", "abstract": "Scientists use reintroductions to restore native species to their historical ranges but sometimes can overlook the effects of dispersal on the genetic structure of restored populations. In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), an ambitious reintroduction strategy aims to restore native Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations, which have lost over 75% of their historical habitat within the park. Each restoration requires removing non-native trout and selecting restoration streams with natural barriers to prevent recolonization. Multiple Brook Trout populations are mixed in restoration sites to maximize genetic diversity and to avoid depletion of any single source population. However, a miscommunication during a reintroduction in Anthony Creek, which used three source populations for restoration, inadvertently created an in-situ population genetics study. One segment of the restoration site received fish from all three source populations. However, technicians also unintentionally placed fish from just one source upstream of a natural barrier. Unbeknownst to management, fish from this separate translocation dispersed downstream, potentially altering the desired genetic diversity of the restored population. This study characterizes the genetic changes caused by this unidirectional dispersal. Population genetics theory predicts that such movement leads to genetic swamping. Here, we use genetic and population density data to confirm the directionality of dispersal, estimate the rate of genetic swamping, and assess alternative mitigation strategies. Our results indicate that it is already too late for assisted migration within the restored stream to achieve the intended genetic diversity. Instead introducing additional fish above the second natural barrier would be necessary to equalize the contribution of all three source populations. Understanding the interplay between dispersal behavior and genetic structure is crucial for planning reintroductions and refining conservation strategies for this iconic species.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

K.; Doughty, B. R.; Schaepe, J. M.; Wang, T.; Smith, M.

Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) methods that rely on the labeling of individual accessible DNA bases have emerged in recent years as a powerful chromatin accessibility mapping approach, as they provide not just an average readout of accessibility over a given genomic position but also the distribution of accessibility states within a population at the level of individual original DNA molecules. However, SMF approaches have been limited either in their resolution or in labeling readout accuracy. To address these limitations, we have developed a high-resolution strand-specific single molecule footprinting approach (C[-&gt;]U/T-ssSMF) based on the application of highly active sequence context-independent endogenous methylation-insensitive double-strand DNA (dsDNA) deaminases (CseDa01 and LbDa02), which convert accessible cytosines into uracils (and in turn into thymine after amplification). We demonstrate the application of the method to mapping fine-grained single-molecule accessibility states in human cell lines in both a short and a long-read format, and quantifying the occupancy states of individual transcription factors (TFs) as well as TF co-accessibility and strand-specific accessibility patterns.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}

However, these diagnostics require nucleic acid pre-amplification, an additional step that complicates deployment to low resource settings. Here, we developed CATNAP (Cas trans-nuclease detection of amplified products), a method that integrates isothermal linear DNA amplification with Cas12a detection in a single reaction. CATNAP uses a nicking enzyme and DNA polymerase to continuously generate single-stranded DNA, activating Cas12a's trans-cleavage activity without damaging the template. We optimized enzyme combinations, buffer conditions, and target selection to achieve high catalytic efficiency. CATNAP successfully distinguished between high- and low-risk HPV strains and detects HPV-16 in a cervical cancer crude cell lysate at room temperature with minimal equipment, offering advantages over PCR-based approaches. We conclude that CATNAP bridges the sensitivity gap in CRISPR diagnostics while maintaining simplicity, making accurate disease detection more accessible in resource-limited settings.", "date": "2025-06-29", "journal": ""}
