This process is guided by combinatorial processes thought to be unique to our species. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level and higher-order information. These networks exhibited a hybrid spatial organization: broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal concentrations of sensitivity to semantic and structural contrasts in canonical language regions. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, we find that these networks are largely non-overlapping, each processing information associated with one of three linguistic contrasts. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. These results show that activity magnitude and information content are dissociable, with important implications for studying the neurobiology of language.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

An emerging factor in this regenerative process is the bi-directional interplay between microtubule dynamics and the delicate morphology of the axonal endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, we hypothesize that locally synthesized ER structural proteins regulate microtubule dynamics and the regenerative response of cortical axons. This hypothesis is supported by RNA data-mining, which identified Reticulon-1 as the sole mRNA coding for an ER-shaping protein across eight axonal transcriptomes and found it to be downregulated following injury. Using compartmentalized microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that local knockdown of Reticulon-1 mRNA increases the outgrowth while reducing the distal tubulin levels of injured axons. Furthermore, we show by live-cell imaging that axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown restores the loss of microtubule growth rate and length caused by injury. Interestingly, axonal inhibition of the microtubule-severing protein Spastin fully prevents the effects of axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown on outgrowth as well as distal tubulin levels, while not affecting most of the analyzed microtubule dynamic parameters. Further, we demonstrate that the Reticulon-1C isoform is locally synthesized within axons and provide evidence supporting its role in attenuating Spastin-mediated microtubule severing. These findings uncover a mechanism by which axonal protein synthesis provides fine control over the microtubule cytoskeleton in response to injury.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Earlier approaches, which primarily relied on free-energy minimization, proved inadequate, as RNA often adopts complex folds, especially with increasing length. We present rpcFold, a residual parallel convolutional neural network-based model for RNA secondary structure prediction. From the nucleotide sequences, we compute a base-pairing possibility score using a locally weighted Gaussian function. It captures the intricate canonical and noncanonical pairing patterns, which enhances the modelling of short- and long-range dependencies. The features are mapped into an image that is the input to rpcFold. Our sliding window mechanism accommodates sequences of arbitrary length, and hence explicitly addresses the prediction of pseudoknots, which are often overlooked in prior works. The performance of rpcFold is demonstrated on nested and on non-nested (pseudoknot) base-pairs. While tested on within-family and cross-family benchmark datasets, rpcFold shows improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, for long nucleotide sequences with complex pseudoknots, rpcFold achieves 71.1% F1-score in jointly predicting nested and non-nested pairs. Performance on unseen RNA families further confirms the robustness and adaptability of our approach. The prediction accuracy of rpcFold, particularly in long-range RNAs and pseudoknots, improves our understanding of RNA functions.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We reconstructed full single-point mutational landscapes of 171 MPXV proteins using an advanced mutational effect predictor, ESCOTT, selected for its superior performance on viral proteins. ESCOTT performance was assessed by benchmarking against the experimental data in the ProteinGym (v1.0.0) dataset that contains 48917 multiple and 173502 single point mutations. A recent MPXV strain sequenced in July 2024 was used as the reference genome. Multiple sequence alignments and protein structures were generated using Colabfold v1.5.5, and the predicted structures were evaluated with pLDDT metric, secondary structure predictions, and comparisons with available experimental data, ensuring high confidence in the structural models. We determined mutational sensitivity of all positions in a protein utilizing ESCOTT scores and demonstrated their functional implications on cysteine proteinase and helicase of MPXV. Moreover, we created an interactive visualization tool to visualize mutational landscapes and sensitivities in a publicly available Google Colab. Furthermore, we introduced a novel, interpretable metric (Average Gene Mutation Sensitivity) to prioritize the most mutation-sensitive proteins within the large MPXV proteome as prime candidates for drug or vaccine development. Among the top 20 proteins identified with this metric, several were membrane-associated proteins, proven to be important for viral interactions with the hosts in other viruses. This analysis provides a valuable resource for assessing the impact of new MPXV variants.

In the Drosophila lamina, a single progenitor type generates five lamina neuron subtypes, second-order neurons downstream of photoreceptors. Here, we identify a pan-class homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF), induced by Hedgehog signaling in progenitors and maintained across all five subtypes, that drives diversification within the progenitor-defined lamina class. This pan-class HDTF orchestrates a four-step program across the progenitor-to-newborn neuron transition: establishing progenitor identity, promoting cell-cycle exit, inducing subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) HDTFs, and acting as their obligate cofactor to specify distinct subtypes. Loss of DE-HDTFs in newborn, but not older, neurons causes subtype-specific fate conversions at molecular, morphological, and functional levels, thereby reducing diversity. Notably, we find that mouse retinal neurons express analogous pan-class and DE-HDTFs, indicating evolutionary conservation. Our findings define a generalizable progenitor-to-newborn neuron HDTF cascade by which progenitor identity directs subtype diversification within a neuronal class.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort.

This is analogous to proteins, where investigating function, folding, or evolution often requires dividing the three-dimensional (3D) structure into subparts that can be studied individually. These independent substructures, known as protein \"3D domains\", are geometrically defined as compact and spatially separate regions of the polypeptide chain. In RNA macromolecules, however, and to the best of our knowledge, no equivalent 3D-based concept has yet been formulated. We present RNA3DClust, an application of the Mean Shift clustering algorithm to the RNA 3D structure partitioning problem. For this work, a dedicated post-clustering procedure was developed to address the peculiarities of delimiting 3D domains in RNA conformations. Tuning and benchmarking RNA3DClust required us to create reference datasets of RNA 3D domain annotations and to devise a new scoring function--the Chain Segment Distance (CSD)--for assessing segmentation quality. Importantly, we show that the domain decompositions produced by RNA3DClust are consistent with those based on RNA biological function and evolution. Finally, the emerging interest in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their likeliness of containing folded regions has motivated us to generate an additional reference dataset of lncRNA predicted conformations. The resulting delineations of 3D domains by RNA3DClust illustrate the potential of our method for analyzing lncRNA 3D structures.

Yet, despite the urgent need for theory that can predict evolutionary and ecological responses in times of accelerated climate change, the assumptions of eco-evolutionary theory currently remain restrictive, relying on theory that neglects important interactions between ecological and evolutionary forces. In this study, I provide testable predictions on limits to adaptation in changing environments, which arise from the feedback between selection, genetic drift and population dynamics. This eco-evolutionary feedback creates a tipping point where genetic drift overwhelms selection, and species' range contracts from the margins or fragments abruptly - even under gradual environmental change. This tipping point is determined by three parameters: two quantifying the effects of spatial and temporal variability on fitness, and one capturing the impact of genetic drift (the reduction of local genetic diversity across generations in finite populations). Importantly, I show that by increasing the \"neighbourhood size\", dispersal can counteract the loss of genetic variation, which would otherwise limit evolvability and increase extinction risk. This suggests that increasing local dispersal, possibly via assisted migration, can facilitate evolutionary rescue when local population size is small. While standard ecological niche models assume that species ranges simply shift with environmental change, this study shows that eco-evolutionary feedback can lead to a sudden range fragmentation into disjunct subpopulations with depleted genetic variance, increasing the probability of extinction.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Using magnetoencephalography and behavioural psychophysics, combined with time-resolved representational similarity and multivariate transfer entropy analyses, we show how phonemes and prosody propagate along the dual streams and how their categorical representations are gradually formed. Contrary to theoretical predictions, acoustic and categorical representations occur in parallel, rather than serially, across time and space for both elements. Moreover, prosody categories extend further along both streams than phoneme categories, with differently weighted contributions of posterior temporal areas.

We tested these lines across 15 field trials spanning diverse Australian environments with varying temperatures, rainfall, and irrigation regimes, measuring physiological responses, yield, biomass, and water productivity. Lines with TaSAL2 gene deletions showed 4-8% yield improvements with enhanced water productivity, while TaSAL1 deletions reduced yields. The TaSAL2 mutants maintained superior photosynthetic function under drought stress, showed improved relative water content, and demonstrated enhanced yield stability across environments. Canopy temperature measurements revealed dynamic stomatal regulation, with increased closure during midday stress periods but normal aperture under benign conditions. Significantly, specific SAL modifications enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and stress resilience without traditional yield penalties. Targeted modification of specific SAL homeologous groups can simultaneously improve both yield and stress tolerance in wheat.

Many motoneurons exhibit bistable behavior, alternating between a quiescent resting state and a self-sustained firing mode, classically attributed to plateau potentials driven by persistent inward currents. This intrinsic property is important for normal movement control, but can become dysregulated, causing motor function deficits, like spasticity. Here we use a conductance-based single-compartment model, together with mouse spinal slice recordings, to investigate the ionic interactions underlying motoneuron bistability. We show that synergistic interactions among high-voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL), calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and the Ca2+-activated non-specific cation current (ICAN) constitute a minimal mechanistic core that produces plateau potentials and bistable firing. Within this framework, the persistent sodium current (INaP) promotes plateau generation, in contrast to the Ca2+-dependent K+ current (IKCa) which opposes it.

We discovered that supplementation with NMN mitigated diet induced weight gain by enhancing energy expenditure, corrected dyslipidemia, and reversed perturbations in fasting blood glucose, all in a SIRT1-dependent manner. On the other hand, NMN-induced reductions in fat mass, fluid mass, eWAT and mesenteric WAT were SIRT1 independent. Proteomic approaches in plasma samples using O-Link and mass-spectrometry provided novel insights into key obesity- and NMN-dependent changes in circulating molecules with potential relevance to inflammation, liver function, and dyslipidemia.

Detecting subtle annual, seasonal, and spatial variations in tropical forests is particularly challenging, due to their complex structure and dynamic environmental conditions. Traditional processing of hemispherical photographs involves time consuming pixel classification that is prone to subjective systematic errors, impeding comparison across months, years, and study sites. While automated methods that ensure consistency are available, they typically require coding expertise, which limits their wider adoption among non-specialists. We present a streamlined protocol that enables automatic, coding-free calculation of LAI by integrating two free software packages: ilastik, for AI-based pixel classification, and CAN-EYE, for LAI estimation. To evaluate its performance, we compared the seasonal and spatial variations in LAI derived from our protocol with those obtained using traditional pixel classification. Four sub-types of tropical forests were used to test the protocols in different scenarios, including moist evergreen forest, semi-deciduous forest, dry forests, and woody savanna. We found that traditional pixel classification (which requires manual threshold adjustments by operators) was highly influenced by subjective bias, with results varying depending on the time invested in pixel classification. In contrast, the fully automated workflow (our protocol: ilastik pixel classification + CAN-EYE calculation) eliminates subjective bias, enabling consistent cross years and cross-operator comparisons. Careful validation using field photos and local forest phenology showed that the automated approach captured seasonal LAI variations more accurately than traditional processing, aligning more closely with observed phenological patterns. However, analyses of spatial variation found no significant difference between protocols, as both captured site-to-site differences with comparable accuracy. Additionally, ilastik can classify pixels into non-binary categories (sky, leaves, and twigs), providing an added layer of detail that is useful for delineating savanna tree phenology.

Physiologically, Bruce suppresses wing tissue growth.

A cluster of frameshift-causing C-terminal deletions (CTDs) lead to loss of [~]100 amino acids at the C-terminus of the MeCP2 protein, and account for approximately 10% of RTT-causing mutations. The pathogenicity of C-terminal deletions (CTDs) is unexpected, as this C-terminal domain is non-essential in mice. Utilising databases of pathogenic and benign human MECP2 mutations, we find that some individuals with apparently typical CTDs do not exhibit Rett syndrome, confirming that C-terminal truncations are not intrinsically pathogenic. Using human DNA sequence data and mouse models, we demonstrate that pathogenicity results from a drastic reduction in MeCP2 levels and is determined by the presence of the short amino acid motif proline-proline-stop (-PPX) at the C-terminus, which results from a shift to the +2 reading frame. Individuals with CTDs that shift to the +1 frame avoid this motif and do not develop Rett syndrome. Mutating the stop codon of the PPX motif to tryptophan rescues MeCP2 expression and RTT-like phenotypes in a CTD mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an adenine base editor can efficiently introduce this tryptophan substitution in cultured cells. Overall, our findings uncover a simple and reliable prognostic distinction between benign and pathogenic CTDs and provide proof-of-concept for an editing strategy that potentially corrects all disease-causing CTD mutations.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We introduce BioML-bench, the first benchmarking suite for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end biomedical ML tasks.

We evaluate four open-source agents: two biomedical specialists (STELLA, Biomni) and two generalists (AIDE, MLAgentBench). On average, agents underperform relative to human baselines, and biomedical specialization does not confer a consistent advantage. We also found that agents which attempted more diverse ML strategies more often tended to score highest, suggesting that architecture and scaffolding may be stronger determinants of performance.

While the role of social tolerance in social learning has long been acknowledged, its impact on innovativeness remains poorly understood. Here, we test six groups of captive white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) and brown capuchins (Sapajus apella) to explore and compare the relationship between social tolerance and problem-solving propensities. White-faced capuchins are renowned for their rich repertoire of social behaviours, whereas brown capuchins are known for their diverse foraging repertoire, resulting in a broad range of culturally transmitted behaviours in both species. We performed a co-feeding experiment to assess species differences in social tolerance and a set of open diffusion novel food puzzles to test innovativeness. We measured associations for each possible dyad within each group during both experiments and compared the resulting social networks between conditions. We also measured neophobia in an independent experiment presenting groups with three novel objects. Overall, during both experiments, brown capuchins were more tolerant, and proportionally more individuals spent their time within the testing areas at any given moment. We also found that networks across experimental contexts were more similar in brown capuchins compared to white-faced capuchins. Moreover, although differences in approaching and exploring food puzzles were marginal, the success rate was higher in brown capuchins than in white-faced capuchins. Finally, neither eigenvector centrality within the networks nor neophobia could explain individual problem-solving success. Age was the strongest predictor for successfully extracting a food item. The results indicate that species-level differences in social tolerance may contribute to divergent innovation patterns, whereas individual-level variation within species may have only a minor influence. We conclude that the higher social tolerance observed in brown capuchins during feeding and foraging contexts can contribute to their broader repertoire of foraging behaviours and foraging traditions.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Human participants performed an RL task with no low-level sensorimotor contingencies. We observed robust RL signals related to reward processing and reward prediction errors in cognitive regions of the cerebellum (Crus I and II). These signals were not explained by oculomotor or physiological confounds. By manipulating the delay between choices and reward outcomes, we discovered that cerebellar RL signals are temporally sensitive, becoming undetectable at supra-second feedback delays. Similar delay effects were not found in other areas implicated in reward processing, including the ventral striatum and hippocampus. Connectivity analyses revealed that during RL feedback, cognitive areas of the cerebellum coactivate with a network that includes the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus.

We systematically characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of neural encoding for visual, semantic, and memorability attributes and showed that memorability was encoded in a distributed manner, which can be dissociated from visual and semantic coding. While the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) was engaged in encoding all three attributes, the representations were dissociable. Interestingly, memorability representations in the prefrontal cortex appeared to arise from integrated visual and semantic signals from the VTC; and memorability influenced early stages of visual and semantic processing. Our results were corroborated by high-resolution 7T fMRI, which revealed continuous encoding across the brain, and further validated using a separate dataset featuring within-category object variability. Lastly, single-neuron recordings confirmed semantic and memorability coding in the medial temporal lobe.

We examined a large cohort of healthy adults (n = 285) to investigate SC-FC coupling and identify markers distinguishing different language laterality groups. Functional connectivity was measured using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) time-series data, while structural connectivity was determined via probabilistic fibre tractography. SC-FC coupling was investigated using the SENSAAS language atlas and defined as the Pearson correlation between non-zero elements of regional structural and functional connectivity profiles. Group differences were assessed using the PALM toolbox in FSL. Our findings revealed that increased SC-FC coupling in the left precentral sulcus was associated with typical language lateralisation, while increased coupling in the right middle temporal gyrus and left anterior insula was observed in individuals with atypical language lateralisation (pFDR < 0.05). Non-lateralised individuals exhibited increased coupling in the left anterior insula compared to lateralised (pFDR<0.05). SC-FC coupling offers a promising framework to uncover functional and anatomical differences among individuals with varying language lateralisation.

Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging in Thy1-eGFP-M mice, we examined age-related changes in dendritic spine density and dynamics in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the secondary motor area (MOs), a frontal cortical region essential for strategy switching and cognitive flexibility, and that was assessed using an operant conditioning paradigm. We found that aged mice (18 to 22 months) exhibited significant impairments in cognitive flexibility relative to young mice (3 to 5 months) in the four-odor choice discrimination and reversal task. Analysis of dendritic spine plasticity revealed that baseline spine density, turnover, and morphology were largely preserved in aged mice. Sex differences were evident, with females displaying higher spine density and a greater fraction of stable spines, a feature maintained across aging. Importantly, despite preserved baseline architecture, aged mice showed impaired ketamine-induced spinogenesis and reduced stabilization of newly formed spines, in contrast to the robust structural plasticity observed in young mice. These results indicate that healthy aging selectively impairs activity-dependent synaptic remodeling without affecting steady-state spine architecture in frontal cortical circuits.

Cell surface proteins represent attractive therapeutic targets yet remain underexplored in high- grade serous ovarian cancer. Here, we employed cell surface N-glycoproteomics to elucidate the cell surface proteomes of HGSC cells alongside normal epithelial and cancer-associated stromal cells, uncovering new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Integration of cell surface N-glycoproteomics and functional screening revealed multiple minimally characterized, HGSC-enriched surface proteins that are critical for HGSC proliferation - most notably, SLC7A1. Multi-omic and functional characterization indicated that SLC7A1 is necessary for HGSC migration, protein synthesis and mitochondrial functions likely linked to its role as an arginine transporter. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated surface expression of SLC7A1 in HGSC reflects dysregulated arginine metabolism, pointing to a putative therapeutic vulnerability. Our work identifies SLC7A1 and arginine metabolism as a previously unrecognized molecular vulnerability in HGSC and provides a framework to guide future therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Proliferative TAM subsets likely represent critical mediators in establishing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, given the susceptibility of TAMs to be hijacked by malignant cells for pro-tumorigenic functions. However, the regulatory networks governing their self-renewal circuitry and lineage bifurcation remained undefined. Combining single cell RNA sequencing of human and murine colon tumors, we identified CD168+ TAMs, a hyperproliferative subpopulation with FOXM1-dependent maintenance of replicative competence. Spatial multi-omics and functional validation revealed that this subset exhibited peritumoral localization and underwent immunosuppressive polarization through cholesterol-coordinated CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling. Colon cancer-specific lipid metabolic rewiring elevates glycerophospholipid and cholesterol flux, with PLA2G7-mediated glycerophospholipid catabolism promoting CX3CR1 expression in TAMs. Thus, the CX3CR1 signaling-driven immunosuppressive effect of CD168+ TAM is an integrated response to tumor-specific metabolic features.

This results in their extensive use in diverse studies, especially large-scale genetic and drug perturbation screens. Although it is commonly accepted that ex vivo models do not fully recapitulate in vivo conditions, the molecular effects of model systems on cells in homeostasis and on cells undergoing drug or genetic perturbations are poorly understood. Using a CRISPR knockout (KO) screen with transcriptome read-out (Perturb-seq) of hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured ex vivo and grown in vivo, we analyzed the effects of ex vivo culture on unperturbed and perturbed cells. Unperturbed cells cultured ex vivo generally showed reduced basal interferon signatures and increased growth and metabolism signatures. These differences in unperturbed cells translated to differences between KO effects observed in vivo and ex vivo. We validated this impact of the model system on KO effects in an additional dataset of genetic KOs in bulk-sorted splenic immune cells, which confirmed our results. Interestingly, genes and molecular pathways with different KO effects were partly predicted by differences between unperturbed cells cultured in vivo and ex vivo. We therefore evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art models in predicting in vivo KO effects from ex vivo KO effects. This proved challenging, demonstrating the need for further developments. In summary, our study reveals differences in culture models, suggests approaches to improve culture models, and provides a test case for computational predictions of perturbation effects.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Local translation of axonal mRNAs is a key regulator of nociceptor plasticity, yet how axonal transcriptome dynamics contribute to inflammatory sensitisation remains unclear. Using compartmentalised culture systems and RNA-sequencing, we defined axonal and somatic transcriptomes in embryonic (E16.5) and adult (W8) DRG neurons and assessed their remodelling after PGE2 exposure. We identify a conserved core axonal transcriptome spanning embryonic to adult stages, prominently enriched for ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, consistent with sustained translational and metabolic demands. PGE2 elicited compartment-specific reprogramming: pathways related to sensory processing and pain were upregulated in axons but downregulated in somata. Functionally, prolonged axonal PGE2 exposure enhanced capsaicin-evoked calcium responses and drove retrograde sensitisation of neuronal somata. Integrating transcriptomics with functional assays, we pinpointed Tnfrsf12a (Fn14), a cytokine receptor linked to regeneration and neuropathic pain, as a PGE2-induced axonal mRNA. Crucially, local axonal knockdown of Tnfrsf12a significantly reduced neuronal excitability, providing proof-of-concept that axonally enriched transcripts can be targeted to modulate sensitisation. These findings position conserved axonal transcriptome programmes as drivers of peripheral sensitisation and establish Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a therapeutic candidate for inflammatory pain.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

However, these advanced acquisitions are both time-consuming and costly to acquire. The ability to reconstruct WM bundles in the massive amounts of existing single-shelled, lower angular resolution data from legacy research studies and healthcare systems would offer much broader clinical applications and population-level generalizability. While legacy scans may offer a valuable, large-scale complement to contemporary research datasets, the reliability of white matter bundles derived from these scans remains unclear. Here, we leverage a large research dataset where each 64-direction dMRI scan was acquired as two independent 32-direction runs per subject. To investigate how recently developed bundle segmentation methods generalize to this data, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of the two 32-direction scans, of WM bundle extraction across three orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstruction methods: generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and single-shell three-tissue CSD (SS3T). We found that the majority of WM bundles could be reliably extracted from dMRI scans that were acquired using the 32-direction, single-shell acquisition scheme. The mean dice coefficient of reconstructed WM bundles was consistently higher within-subject than between-subject for all WM bundles and ODF reconstruction methods, illustrating preservation of person-specific anatomy. Further, when using features of the bundles to predict complex reasoning assessed using a computerized cognitive battery, we observed stable prediction accuracies (r: 0.15-0.36) across the test-retest data. Among the three ODF reconstruction methods, SS3T had a good balance between sensitivity and specificity in external validation, a high intra-class correlation of extracted features, more plausible bundles, and strong predictive performance. More broadly, these results demonstrate that bundle segmentation can achieve robust performance even on lower angular resolution, single-shell dMRI, with particular advantages for ODF methods optimized for single-shell data. This highlights the considerable potential for dMRI collected in healthcare settings and legacy research datasets to accelerate and expand the scope of WM research.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

In mice, exposure to an obesogenic high-fat and sugar diet (HFD) resulted in social recognition memory deficits, a process that is dependent upon hippocampal area CA2 and oxytocin signaling. HFD-fed mice had stronger inputs onto CA2 pyramidal neurons that led to increased action potential firing, without altering intrinsic properties or inhibitory transmission. Chemogenetic CA2 inhibition rescued HFD-induced social memory deficits, confirming the role of CA2 hyperexcitability in these effects. In CA2, oxytocin receptor activation resulted in membrane depolarization, spontaneous action-potential firing and permitted endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity in control diet-fed mice, but not HFD-fed littermates. In a concentration-dependent manner, oxytocin restored potentiation of excitatory responses and allowed for endocannabinoid plasticity at CA2 inhibitory synapses as well as social memory deficits in HFD-fed mice.

Previous modeling approaches have been limited to either simplified point-neuron networks or isolated single-cell models that lack synaptic connectivity. Objective: To develop and validate a multiscale cortical circuit model that integrates morphologically-realistic neurons with accurate TMS-induced electric field distributions and to investigate mechanisms underlying cortical responses to stimulation. Methods: We constructed a network model of a cortical column comprising 10,000 biophysically realistic neurons (excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons) across layers 2/3, 5, and 6 with over 10 million synaptic connections. The model incorporated thalamic and non-specific corticocortical inputs to generate physiological firing rates. TMS-induced electric fields were calculated using finite element modeling and coupled to individual neurons through the extracellular mechanism. We validated model predictions against experimental recordings of TMS-evoked local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity. Results: The model reproduced key experimental observations including the dose-dependent N50 LFP component and multiphasic multi-unit responses, consisting of an (excitatory) increase followed by a (inhibitory) decrease in firing rates. The early excitatory response exhibited dual-peak dynamics reflecting distinct contributions from directly and indirectly activated neuronal populations, and the subsequent inhibitory phase reflected activation of feedback GABAergic circuits through both GABAA and GABAB conductances. Spatial analysis across 30 cortical columns distributed across the precentral gyrus revealed orientation-dependent evoked responses. Conclusion: This validated multiscale model provides mechanistic insights into TMS-evoked cortical dynamics, demonstrating how direct neuronal activation cascades through synaptic networks to generate characteristic population responses.

Tn5's preference toward accessible chromatin alters CUT&Tag sequence read distributions in the genome and introduces open chromatin bias that can confound downstream analysis, an issue more substantial in sparse single-cell data.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mainly caused by gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA genes and are the most common neoplasms of the digestive tract. Imatinib (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting these oncogenic drivers, has considerably improved patient outcomes, although resistance remains a major challenge. The transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and TAZ, downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, have emerged as potential oncogenic drivers in various cancers, including GIST. However, their specific roles in KIT-dependent tumor development remain unclear. Methods. We used WRAP5-based nanoparticles loaded with specifically designed siRNA to selectively silence YAP1 and/or TAZ proteins in KIT-dependent IM-sensitive GIST cell lines. This nucleic acid delivery system enabled efficient and specific knockdown without cytotoxicity. We assessed the impact on cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression, focusing on YAP1/TAZ targets CYR61 and CTGF. Results. TAZ silencing resulted in a substantial reduction in GIST-T1 cell proliferation and migration, whereas YAP1 knockdown was comparatively limited. This finding was consistent with an increased TAZ expression in GIST patients, which was associated with shorter progression-free survival and an increased tendency for metastasis development. A slight additive effect was observed upon a combined YAP1/TAZ silencing in the migration assay, suggesting a more complex regulation between these two proteins. CYR61 and CTGF expressions were predominantly regulated by TAZ, though a stronger downregulation was observed upon dual knockdown in a subset of GIST cell lines with differential YAP1 and TAZ basal expression. Finally, CYR61 seemed to be more implicated in cell proliferation inhibition, which is further supported by the correlation between high CYR61 expression and poor prognosis in GIST patients. Conclusion. Our results highlight the central regulatory function of TAZ-CYR61 axis in oncogenic processes in KIT-dependent GIST, with a modest contribution from YAP1. Targeting TAZ, alone or in combination with YAP1, may represent a promising therapeutic approach, particularly in the context of tumor heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Optical microscopy remains a key technique for observing live-cell behaviors in vitro. This paper introduces an enhanced cell-tracking algorithm designed to address dynamic changes in cell populations, including mitosis, migration, and cell-cell interactions, even within complex co-culture models. The proposed method involves three main steps: 1) modeling the movements and interactions of different cell types in co-culture experiments via tailored open multi-agent systems; 2) identifying parameters via real data for a multi-agent, multi-culture framework; 3) embedding the model within an Extended Kalman Filter, to predict the dynamics of heterogeneous cell populations across video frames. To validate the approach, we used a novel dataset which examines the interplay between tumor and normal cells, using osteosarcoma and mesenchymal stromal cells, respectively, as a model. This dataset offers a challenging and clinically relevant framework to track cell proliferation and study how cancer cells evolve and interact with stromal cells within their surroundings. Performance metrics demonstrated the algorithm effectiveness over state-of-the-art methodologies, highlighting its ability to track heterogeneous cell types, capture their interactions, and generate the estimated cell lineage tree.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia.

R.; McCall, C.; Preston, C. E. J.", "abstract": "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a pleasant tingling sensation felt across the scalp and neck, widely reported to reduce anxiety and improve sleep. The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMR's underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon's therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPH's core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

This study analyzes neutrophil pyroptotic responses under different conditions and dissects distinct pyroptosis-associated events, including IL-1{beta} release and cell death. We decipher the signalling pathways underlying these responses and distinguish them from other cell death mechanisms. Interestingly, we observe IL-1{beta} release and enhanced survival in neutrophils in response to LPS-primed ATP-treatment, in contrast to a combination of IL-1{beta} release with cell death in macrophages. While LPS-primed nigericin-treated neutrophils exhibit IL-1{beta} release and cell death, characterized by nuclear rounding, cell swelling/ ballooning, plasma membrane pore formation, and subsequent cell rupture, confirming the occurrence of pyroptotic cell death. While nigericin alone triggers cytokine uncoupled pyroptosis. Intriguingly, these phenomena do not induce under other death programs, including apoptosis, NETosis. This provides opportunity to unravel the regulation of these pyroptotic responses in neutrophils. Data observed reveal the role of NLRP3 and context-dependent caspase -1 & 11 in IL-1{beta} secretion. While, DNA damage and caspase-7 & 9 regulate pyroptotic death. Intriguingly, forced DNA damage by ATM kinase inhibitor mitigated inflammasome activation and IL-1{beta} release, while spur death. Furthermore, this study identifies perinuclear actomyosin forces driving nuclear rounding and pyroptotic death. Both murine neutrophils exposed to bacteria and human neutrophils treated with nigericin exhibit these pyroptotic processes, highlighting their broad relevance. This study depicts decision whether to secrete cytokines or undergo pyroptotic cell death emphasizing the regulatory role of DNA damage-cytoskeletal axis beyond inflammasome activation. Moreover, LPS and bacteria induced acute lung injury in mice displays nuclear rounding presenting pyroptotic neutrophils and enhanced NLRP3, Caspase-11 activation, and IL-1{beta} release.

Here, we address this gap using three high-quality diploid genome assemblies of the obligately parthenogenetic booklouse Liposcelis bostrychophila, a species characterized by apomictic meiosis and striking intraspecific variation. Combining Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C sequencing, we generated three diploid genomes of three populations (Lb_1, Lb_2, Lb_3), revealing exceptionally high heterozygosity rates (1.67 - 3.92%) and minimal recombination - hallmarks of prolonged asexuality. Critically, in population Lb_2, intra-individual SNP divergence surpassed inter-population levels, directly demonstrating the Meselson Effect. Phylogenetic analyses of 7,029 genes revealed that while haplotypes within populations clustered as expected under sexual reproduction, nearly 15% of gene trees exhibited topologies consistent with asexual divergence - a signature of incipient Meselson-driven evolution. Comparative genomic analyses further revealed a twofold expansion of repetitive elements in asexual lineages compared to their sexual relatives (L. brunnea) and a widespread relaxation of purifying selection, particularly affecting transcription factor activities. We propose that relaxed selection on transcriptional regulators may act as a compensatory mechanism, buffering the functional consequences of escalating heterozygosity in non-recombining genomes. By integrating population genomics, phylogenomics, and selection analyses, this work not only provides the clearest evidence to date of the Meselson Effect but also establishes L. bostrychophila as a pivotal model for unraveling the genomic paradox of parthenogenesis", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

However, research on gene function, adaptive evolution, and molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits in Bactrian camels remains limited, constraining the full utilization of their breeding potential and conservation efforts. To address this gap, we performed whole-genome resequencing (WGS) on 35 domesticated Bactrian camels from the Chinese Sunite local population and integrated this data with publicly available WGS data from 112 Asian Bactrian camels. Our comprehensive analysis revealed significant genetic differences and genomic features between wild and domesticated Bactrian camels. We further integrated 27 epigenomic (ATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) datasets from eight biologically important tissues of four Bactrian camels, along with skeletal muscle scRNA-seq and scATAC data. This allowed us to identify tissue-specific genes, regulatory elements, and genes under positive selection.Our integrated analysis identified target genes and their upstream regulatory elements, including potential regulatory transcription factors, with a focus on positively selected regions in Bactrian camel muscle tissue. We constructed regulatory pathways from key SNPs to regulatory elements to genes, and for the first time, identified regulatory elements in major tissues of the Bactrian camel genome. Our results also summarized the single-cell transcriptional landscape of Bactrian camel skeletal muscle, revealing cellular heterogeneity and genetic expression patterns across two developmental stages. This comprehensive regulatory element map provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies in Bactrian camels.

Although high synchrony in female sexual receptivity has been hypothesized to constrain dominant male monopolization of reproductive success, recent genetic studies indicate pronounced male reproductive skew in this species. We investigated how prolonged sexual receptivity in female bonobos affects male behavioral patterns. Materials and Methods: Behavioral observations were conducted on a free-ranging bonobo group at Wamba in the Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Periovulatory periods (POPs) were estimated from the timing of detumescence marking the end of the maximal swelling phase, following Ryu et al. (2022). For each male, we calculated the proportion of copulations with POP females. Using all-day focal follows targeting mature males, we tested for rank-related bias in their copulation rates and evaluated the effects of the party-level operational sex ratio (OSR; the ratio of mature males to sexually receptive females) on the focal male probability of copulation and intermale aggression. Results: Higher-ranking males were more likely to copulate with POP females, yet males of all ranks engaged in copulation on most of focal observation days (twice per day, on average). Lower party-level OSR values increased the focal male probability of copulations while reducing intermale aggression. Discussion: Prolonged sexual receptivity in female bonobos-yielding a pool of sexually receptive but non-POP females-may broaden male copulation opportunities beyond dominance rank and reduce intermale mating competition, even when POPs are detectable.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The scavenger receptor SCARA5 is implicated as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, yet its role in breast cancer remains unclear. Methods: We conducted integrative transcriptomic analyses of bulk RNA-seq data from TCGA-BRCA, validated with GTEx, to examine SCARA5 expression and its clinical relevance. Differential expression, PAM50 subtype classification, PCA/t-SNE clustering, and ROC analyses were applied to assess diagnostic potential. Functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, Reactome), PPI networks, and co-expression analyses explored SCARA5-associated pathways. Single-cell transcriptomic datasets (TISCH2, Broad Portal) and spatial profiling (Human Protein Atlas) were used to dissect the cellular and spatial localization. The prognostic significance was evaluated using GEPIA2 survival analysis. Results: SCARA5 was markedly downregulated in breast tumors, particularly in Her2-enriched and Luminal B subtypes, with ROC curves confirming its diagnostic value. Enrichment and PPI analyses linked SCARA5 to lipid metabolism, immune regulation, and scavenger receptor pathways. Co-expression studies highlighted associations with lipid metabolism (FABP4, ADIPOQ, CD36) and immune genes (CLEC3B, LYVE1). Single-cell data revealed selective SCARA5 expression in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune subsets, rarely in malignant epithelial cells. Spatial analyses confirmed stromal enrichment, particularly in regions rich in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Survival analysis revealed poorer outcomes in patients with HER2+ and Luminal B breast cancers who had low SCARA5 expression.

In New Zealand, EC rates have increased significantly, particularly among M[a]ori and Pacific women, who face higher risks of advanced disease and poorer outcomes. Microbial dysbiosis has been implicated in EC pathogenesis, but characterising the uterine microbiome is challenging due to low microbial biomass and high contamination risk. Aims: This study aimed to pilot a protocol that could inform the preparation of a larger cohort trial. Short-read Illumina MiSeq and long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) 16S rRNA gene sequencing were investigated to profile the uterine microbiome in people with EC. Methods and Results: Uterine and vaginal swabs were analysed to assess platform performance in terms of DNA recovery, sequencing success, diversity metrics, and taxonomic resolution. The impact of sample freezing or immediate lysis prior to DNA extraction was also evaluated. ONT sequencing provided enhanced species-level resolution and improved detection of low-abundance taxa but showed variable performance in low-yield samples. Freezing prior to cell DNA extraction modestly increased bacterial 16S copy numbers and improved community consistency. Contamination was a problem across both platforms, particularly in low-biomass samples, but can be minimised during data analysis.

Thus, we performed a detailed characterization of a mouse model of AIPN and candidate mechanistic associations including the role of neuroinflammation and acetaldehyde. Our studies showed chronic alcohol induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity and deficits in spontaneous behaviors in EtOH concentration-, time- and sex-dependent manners. Female mice drank more alcohol and developed more rapid and severe hypersensitivity but less robust deficits of spontaneous behaviors. The grimace test demonstrated chronic alcohol promoted spontaneous pain independent of sex. Duration of intake impacted alcohol-induced deficits in peripheral nerve electrophysiology amplitude and intra-epidermal nerve fiber density. We characterized an extensive time-course of chronic alcohol-induced neuroinflammation in the DRG and spinal cord and found significant time, sex and tissue effects. Polymorphisms of ALDH2 have been associated with alcohol-induced neuroinflammation, alcohol-related pain, and alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy. We investigated the role of acetaldehyde, via inhibition of ALDH2, in the development of AIPN and showed that ALDH2 inhibition accelerated and exacerbated development of chronic alcohol-induced hypersensitivity in male and female mice.

This study presents the first meta-analysis assessing individual repeatability of oxidative stress markers, comprising 123 repeatability estimates obtained from 22 studies.

This flags serious limitations regarding the utility of oxidative stress measurements to meaningfully capture aspects of health and to predict other health-related traits such as telomere length. In line with this assertion, we found that different markers of oxidative stress were often poorly correlated. Next, we simulated causal effects of oxidative stress on telomere length to reveal statistical power limitations on the detection of a relationship between oxidative stress and telomere length when the individual repeatability of oxidative stress is consistent with our meta-analysis findings. Our simulations reveal that substantially larger samples sizes are required than those typically used in this field. On a more positive note, we also show that increasing the number of repeated samples can improve statistical power. This would create valuable opportunities for untangling the causes of intraindividual variation in oxidative stress, improving the utility of oxidative stress as biomarkers of environmental effects on fitness, as well as elucidating the functional consequences of oxidative stress for health and ageing.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

This study investigated how different features of a tool influence the formation of distinct motor memories during dual adaptation to opposing visuomotor perturbations. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) setup, participants performed an aiming task in which they launched a ball toward a target using virtual tools, each consistently associated with a different visuomotor rotation. We manipulated tool features across three groups: one in which tools differed only in colour (Colour Control), one in which they differed in shape but involved similar operational dynamics (Motor Congruent), and one in which they differed in both shape and mode of operation (Motor Incongruent). A control group that adapted to a single perturbation with a single tool at a time was also included. Only the Motor Incongruent group demonstrated robust dual adaptation and clear aftereffects, comparable to those observed during single-tool learning. These results suggest that distinct modes of tool operation play a critical role in supporting the formation and retention of separate internal models during sensorimotor adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Acuity progressively declined under scotopic conditions followed by photopic conditions. Acuity deficits only broadly correlated with the retinal response measured by the electroretinogram.

PBDEs have been implicated as risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning and is commonly accompanied by co-morbidities such as cognitive and attentional deficits. Here, we used a mouse model with translationally relevant exposure to establish direct causal evidence that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in male offspring. Methods: C57Bl6/N mouse dams were exposed to a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, via oral administration of 0 (vehicle control, VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71), or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d for 10 weeks, spanning three weeks prior to gestation through the end of lactation at postnatal day (PND) 21. Results: Mass spectrometric analysis indicated dose-dependent transfer of PBDEs (in ppb) to brains of F1 male offspring at PND 30, with reduction in levels by PND 110. Adult F1 male offspring displayed ASD-relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes, including impaired short- and long-term social recognition memory (SRM), despite intact general sociability, and exaggerated repetitive behavior. Exposed mice also displayed altered olfactory discrimination of social odors, impaired novel object recognition memory, and reduced open field habituation. However, no changes were observed in anxiety-like, sensorimotor, or depressive-like behaviors relative to VEH/CON. At the molecular level, DE-71 exposed males displayed deregulated gene markers of prosocial neuropeptides. Oxt was upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN); Avp was upregulated in the PVN and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) but downregulated in the lateral septum (LS); Avp1ar and Adcyap1 were upregulated in the BNST; and Adcyap1r1 was upregulated in the PVN, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and BNST. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that developmental PBDE exposure produces enduring behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes that resemble core domains of ASD, which may result from early neurodevelopmental reprogramming within central social and memory networks.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

J.; Schaner Tooley, C.", "abstract": "It is widely thought that age-related damage is the single biggest contributing factor to neurodegenerative diseases. However, recent studies are beginning to indicate that many of these diseases may have developmental origins that become unmasked overtime. It has been difficult to prove these developmental origins, as there are still few known links between defective embryonic neurogenesis and progressive neurodegeneration. We have created a constitutive knockout mouse for the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 (Nrmt1-/- mice). Nrmt1-/- mice display phenotypes associated with premature aging. Specifically in the brain, they exhibit age-related striatal and hippocampal degeneration, which is accompanied by impaired short and long-term memory. These phenotypes are preceded by depletion of the postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) pools, which appears to be driven by their premature differentiation and migration. However, this differentiation is often incomplete, as many resulting neurons cannot permanently exit the cell cycle and ultimately undergo apoptosis. Here, we show that the onset of apoptosis corresponds to increased cleavage of p35 into the CDK5 activator p25, which can promote neuroinflammation. Accordingly, Nrmt1-/- brains exhibit an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, astrogliosis, complement activation, microgliosis, and markers of a compromised blood brain barrier, all of which indicate an activated neuroimmune response. We also find Nrmt1-/- mice do not activate a corresponding anti-inflammatory response. These data indicate that abnormal neurogenesis can trigger neuroinflammation, which in the absence of compensatory anti-inflammatory signaling, could lead to neuronal apoptosis and progressive neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Its prevalence is projected to increase in parallel with the aging global population. Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Folates, B-vitamins and choline play a central role in one-carbon metabolism (1C), which is a key metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, epigenetics, regulation of cell proliferation, and stress resistance. Our research group has previously shown that deficiencies in 1C lead to worsened stroke outcomes using preclinical models. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on 1C enzymes in affected brain tissue remains unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate whether ischemic stroke contributes to a change in the levels of 1C enzymes after ischemic stroke in male and female patients. Cortical brain tissue sections from ischemic stroke patients and controls were stained for enzymes involved in 1C. All tissue was co-stained with neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The colocalization of all three markers was evaluated by two individuals who were blinded to the experimental groups. Ischemic stroke increased neuronal levels of the folate receptor and 1C enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS) and serine hydroxy methyltransferase (SHMT). In male stroke brain tissue was observed to have increased levels of MTHFR, TS, and SHMT. Female brain tissue had increases in the folate receptor and TS. The results suggest that ischemic stroke leads to increased demand of 1C and that there are some differences between males and females.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Breakdown in the unit is central to many neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS of which the retina is a component. A growing literature indicated that primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs) can regulate this crosstalk between vasculature and neuronal tissues. In this study we describe a central role for erucamide, a 22:1 mono-unsaturated omega-9 fatty acid amide, in degenerating retinal tissues. Using high-resolution global mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we cataloged metabolites in murine models of retinal degeneration and show that while PFAMs, in general, are highly dysregulated, erucamide is the one most significantly diminished during photoreceptor atrophy. Using rodent models of retinal degeneration and novel organosilane-modified porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) for the in vivo delivery of erucamide, we demonstrate that erucamide activates CD11b+ myeloid cells, leading to the upregulation of angiogenic and neurotrophic cytokines that stabilize retinal degeneration. We identified TMEM19 as a novel binding protein for erucamide that is crucial for human iPSC-derived macrophage precursor cells activation and subsequent neurotrophic and angiogenic factor production. These findings reveal a previously unknown PFAM pathway that is modulated during retinal degenerative diseases, demonstrating that erucamide or functional analogues and their action through TMEM19 may be useful as a therapeutic alternative to neuroprotective and stem cell-based approaches for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Despite its burden, no licensed antivirals or host-directed therapies are currently available. Our group has previously identified Annexin A1 (AnxA1) as an endogenous regulator of inflammation in dengue. Treatment with the AnxA1 peptidomimetic, Ac2-26, improved clinical outcomes in murine models of severe dengue by promoting resolution of inflammation without affecting viral control. To explore new delivery strategies, we developed a novel formulation of Ac2-26 complexed with hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (CDX-Ac2-26). In DENV-2-infected A129 mice, both intraperitoneal and oral CDX-Ac2-26 improved clinical scores and reversed thrombocytopenia. Notably, CDX-Ac2-26 reduced mast cell degranulation, MCPT-1 plasma levels, and CCL2 expression in spleen, with no effect on viral titers, indicating a host-targeted mechanism and overcoming the anti-inflammatory effects of the free peptide. Intraperitoneal administration achieved the same efficacy as oral dosing with only one-third of the dose. Importantly, the combination of CDX-Ac2-26 with the antiviral nucleotide analog sofosbuvir fully prevented disease and mortality in infected mice, highlighting a combinatorial effect between host-directed and antiviral therapies. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving strategies in severe dengue and support the development of CDX-Ac2-26 as a novel adjunctive treatment. Combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral approaches may enhance efficacy and reduce treatment-associated toxicity, offering a promising path for clinical translation.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Here we present a drone-based workflow to automatically acquire large volumes of close-up, ultra-high resolution photos of selected tree crowns (or specific locations over the canopy) to support tropical botanical and ecological studies (https://youtu.be/80goMEifpc4). Our workflow is built around the small, easy-to-use DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise (M3E) drone, which is equipped with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera. On day one, the pilot maps a forest area of up to ~200 ha with the wide-angle camera to generate a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM) and orthomosaic using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. On subsequent days, the pilot acquires close-up photos with the telephoto camera from up to 300 selected canopy trees per day. These close-up photos are acquired from 6 m above the canopy and contain a high level of visual detail that allows botanists to reliably identify many tree and liana species. The photos are geolocated with survey-grade accuracy using RTK GNSS, thus facilitating spatial co-registration with other data sources, including the photogrammetry products. The primary operational challenge of our workflow is the need to maintain RTK corrections with the drone to ensure that close-up photos are acquired exactly at the predefined locations. The maximum operational range we achieved was 3 km, which would allow the pilot to reach any tree within a ~2800 ha area from the take-off point. Although our workflow was developed to support taxonomic identification of tropical trees and lianas, it could be extended to any other forest or vegetation type to support botanical, phenological, and ecological studies.

The core innovation lies in three synergistic components: (1) Hyperbolic embeddings that preserve evolutionary-conserved topological relationships through negatively curved space projections, capturing scale-free properties of protein networks; (2) Multi-scale wavelet decomposition operating at biologically grounded resolutions to jointly analyze local residue contacts and global pathway dynamics; (3) Contrastive learning with stochastic feature dropout that mimics natural binding interface plasticity.

Here, we analyzed transcriptomic data from the TCGA-KIRC cohort and found that advanced-stage ccRCC exhibits widespread dysregulation of cell cycle pathways, with 1,484 genes upregulated and 479 genes downregulated in stage IV compared to stage I tumors. To define survivins functional contribution, we performed loss-of-function and pharmacologic inhibition studies in RENCA cells. Survivin knockdown or treatment with the small molecule inhibitor YM155 significantly reduced proliferation, S-phase entry, and Cyclin D1 expression, while also impairing both collective and single-cell migration. Beyond cell cycle control, survivin depletion induced notable changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics, including increased mitochondrial content coupled with reduced oxygen consumption, suggesting accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria due to impaired clearance.

Here we report a single-institution series of 37 gliosarcomas including next-generation sequencing data on 25 cases and digital spatial whole-transcriptome analysis on 4 cases to characterize differential gene expression between glial and mesenchymal components. Gliosarcoma demographic and genetic features were compared to a cohort of 75 primary adult hemispheric IDH-wildtype non-sarcomatous glioblastomas. Patient age, tumor location, sex, and overall survival in gliosarcoma were similar to glioblastoma. Gliosarcomas showed a significantly lower rate of EGFR amplification and a higher rate of NF1 mutation compared to glioblastomas in next-generation sequencing analysis. Digital spatial whole-transcriptome analysis showed a distinct transcriptomic profile in sarcomatous regions with over-expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix development and remodeling. Selected differentially expressed transcripts were examined further by immunohistochemistry. The glial elements of gliosarcomas showed higher immunoreactivity for Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) than glioblastomas, but low to absent expression within the sarcomatous elements. Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1) immunoreactivity was identified within sarcomatous regions of gliosarcoma without detectable nuclear beta-catenin, suggesting a role for beta-catenin independent wingless (WNT) effector signaling in sarcomatous transformation. This study adds to the growing literature demonstrating differences in the genetic underpinning of gliosarcoma and glioblastoma, establishes feasibility of spatial transcriptomic approaches in gliosarcoma, and validates digital spatial profiling-based results as a discovery platform to identify pathways and immunohistochemical markers for further study.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We transplanted these cells into the spinal cord of ALS large animal models (SOD1G93A pigs and TIA1P362L rabbits), which faithfully recapitulate pathologies and symptoms observed in ALS patients. The transplanted cells could efficiently differentiate into functional MNs upon Dox treatment in vivo, distribute throughout the spinal cord and motor cortex via extensive migration, survive long-term without the need for immunosuppression. Notably, these MNs integrated into host neural circuits, as evidenced by their long projection of peripheral axons to target muscle and reformation of neuromuscular junctions.

Applying lux-FRET, we examined receptor-receptor interactions and downstream signaling events, including agonist specificity for 5-HT receptors. Ratiometric FRET measurements with a genetically encoded cAMP biosensor allowed us to assess biosensor sensitivity to cyclic nucleotides and receptor efficacy.

One question with important implications for adaptive decision-making is whether we learn about the absolute values of cues we encounter (how good or bad?), or about their relative values (how much better or worse than the alternative?). Humans have been shown to use relative value learning, even when it leads to suboptimal decisions. In this study, we ask whether insects use absolute or relative value learning. Using the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we designed associative odour-taste learning experiments to distinguish both kinds of learning and find that larvae learn about the relative rather than the absolute values of both rewards and punishments, irrespective of the number and sequence of training trials. This suggests that relative value learning is a facility shared across the animal kingdom from maggots to humans, and can be realized even by simple insect brains. Given the great potential of D. melanogaster as a model organism for in-depth neurobiological analyses, our study opens up the opportunity to reveal the mechanism underlying relative value learning in unprecedented detail.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

By profiling a non-industrialized rural cohort, this study deciphers the assembly rules governing the human skin microbiome and reveals an evolutionarily conserved core microbiota structured by niche selection. Microbial alpha-diversity peaks when C. acnes and M. osloensis reach equilibrium, supporting the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. Host lipids, rather than aqueous compounds, emerged as the primary drivers of microbial niche partitioning. We further demonstrate that C. acnes and Malassezia restricta function as core metabolic engineers, expressing diverse lipases that hydrolyze triglycerides (TGs) into free fatty acids (FFAs), thereby maintaining skin surface lipid homeostasis (approximately 85% TG + FFA). Notably, virtually all skin surface FFAs are microbially derived and function as public goods, enabling cross-feeding that supports auxotrophic members and fosters mutualistic interactions. Importantly, in vitro coculture experiments confirm that C. acnes establish a survival niche for M. restricta.

R.; Warmington, R.; Beale, C.", "abstract": "Climate change is causing the loss or movement of suitable habitats, forcing species to undergo range shifts. However, many may be unable to move to suitable locations, resulting in increased extinctions. Climate refugia, areas maintaining suitable conditions for species now and in the future, offer protection from climate change. These refugia are categorised as in situ, where species are currently present, and ex situ, where they are not. Identifying these areas is vital and they could serve as relocation sites for species unable to migrate naturally. We aimed to identify climate refugia for rare vascular plant species in Britain and examined whether refugia with the highest number of suitable species share any common features. Using predicted 2080 distributions, we identified protected areas in Britain that act as in situ or ex situ refugia for 12 of Plantlifes focal plant species. This study revealed that many current habitats will become unsuitable by 2080, highlighting the urgent need to protect refugia. The limited availability of in situ refugia underscores the importance of ex situ refugia as potential habitats. Given Britain's fragmented protected areas and species' low dispersal rates, translocations may be necessary to move threatened species to ex situ refugia. Our findings indicated that protected areas with higher elevations, larger elevational ranges, higher latitude and longitude and larger area will provide climate refugia for a greater number of species. This information can be used to guide the selection and management of protected areas and identify receptor sites for species introductions.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Our study aims to i) investigate the spatial distribution of TEs, including TCEs, across different environmental matrices; ii) compare measured concentrations in water and sediment against environmental quality guidelines; and iii) assess potential risks to human health from fish consumption. In this study, we sampled water, sediment, and fish tissues (muscle and liver) across six boreal lakes near the historically mining region of Rouyn-Noranda, home to North America's largest copper smelting and recycling facility (Horne Smelter). Concentrations of TEs (e.g., Cu, Se) were higher in lakes closest to the smelter. Similarly, some TCEs (i.e., Ti, Co, Tl) followed this same spatial distribution pattern, suggesting that their release may be linked to historical and current mining activities. Conversely, REEs displayed distinct spatial patterns, likely influenced by geological sources rather than pollution. Several TEs (e.g., Zn, Cd, Pb) exceeded Canadian water and sediment quality guidelines in lakes closer to the mining area. Muscle tissue from walleye or yellow perch showed Zn, Cd, or Pb concentrations above safety limits in at least one lake. This study highlights the importance of including emerging TCEs (e.g., Sr, Tl, Co) in biomonitoring programs. Our findings provide critical insights into the environmental distribution of TEs across multiple matrices of boreal lake ecosystems, contributing to global efforts in risk assessment and sustainable freshwater management in the context of growing electronic waste recycling.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

However, standard approaches for measuring forest microclimates do not capture within-plot heterogeneity, which, according to the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, is a key driver of local biodiversity. We quantified horizontal and vertical microclimatic heterogeneity within 30 broad-leaved forest plots in Central Europe using a three-dimensional design with high spatial resolution. Moreover, we examined whether microclimatic heterogeneity differs among silvicultural treatments and whether it can be predicted using forest structure indices derived from laser scanning. Additionally, we explored the relationship between microclimatic heterogeneity and biodiversity. In the understory of canopy gaps, warm and cold habitats co-existed in close proximity, leading to a high horizontal microclimatic heterogeneity. In closed stands with high structural complexity, we found steep gradients of increasing temperature and vapor pressure deficit from the ground to the canopy during mid-day. Canopy cover and forest structural complexity were strong indicators of microclimatic heterogeneity. We found positive relationships between herb layer temperature heterogeneity and the diversity of plants, Hymenoptera, and Diptera. Our results demonstrate that single-point measurements fail to capture the substantial microclimatic heterogeneity within plots, potentially misrepresenting the conditions experienced by forest species. However, laser scanning provides reliable indicators for within-plot microclimatic heterogeneity. With canopy gaps featuring high horizontal microclimatic heterogeneity and promoting the biodiversity of several taxonomic groups, we argue that managing forests for maximized temperature buffering should not be the only strategy to conserve forest biodiversity.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Cardiac tissue engineering is a substitutionary approach combining cells, scaffolds, and growth factors to develop functional heart tissues in vitro. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a significant advancement in cardiac regenerative medicine, offering a continuous supply of CMs, however, the limited understanding of their microenvironment hinders translational research. Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) derived from myocardium is a highly promising natural scaffold for CTE, given its tissue- specific composition, mechanical properties, and biochemical cues that promote cellular regeneration. This study investigates myocardial dECM-based fibrous scaffolds for iPSC-derived CM use. Coaxially electrospun nanofibers comprising a polyurethane core and a blend of polycaprolactone and myocardial dECM as the sheath were optimized. Morphological analysis confirms the resemblance of the nanofibers to fibrillar collagen in the native dECM. ATR-FTIR and immunostaining results confirm the presence of dECM which enhanced their hydrophilicity and enzymatic degradation.

This study seeks to understand this relationship in bacteriophage {varphi}X174 using an experimental technique of deep mutational scanning and computationally predicted protein stability. Results: Analyzing the viability data using a newly developed multistage binomial model confirms that highly destabilizing mutations predict inviability. For single-site variants, the model predicts that {Delta}{Delta}G of folding greater than ~3 kcal/mol and {Delta}{Delta}G of binding greater than ~6 kcal/mol cuts the probability of survival by half of the maximum. The maximum probability, even for minimal {Delta}{Delta}G values, plateaus at around 87%, reflecting the influence of unobserved factors. Fitting of double-site variants data shows similar results. In contrast, a linear regression analysis of viable mutants reveals that the effect of protein stability is too weak to be a reliable predictor of fitness. Conclusion: In this study, we introduce a novel modeling technique to explore the relationship between protein stability and survival outcomes. While large destabilization often indicates inviability, most destabilizing mutations exert only small to moderate effects and do not reliably predict survival. Although protein stability is a crucial biophysical property influencing biological systems, it represents just one of multiple factors that contribute to fitness and survival.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Methods: We applied spatial whole-transcriptome profiling (GeoMx) and gene set enrichment analysis within CM lesions at single vasculature level. Differentially expressed genes were validated by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphoproteomics was profiled to uncover lesion-wide phosphorylation sites on proteins. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CM-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to determine differentiation trajectories of lesional vascular lineages. In silico gene perturbation was used to predict candidate genes for modulating vascular pathological progression, followed by functional validation in CM iPSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) using a Tet-on system. Results: A spatial transcriptomic atlas was constructed, and pathological landscape of individual CM vasculature was delineated. CM vessels exhibited hallmarks of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), including disruption of adherens junctions (AJs), vascular identity transitions, and metabolic remodeling. Phosphoproteomics confirmed that differentially phosphorylated proteins were enriched in EndMT- and AJ-related pathways. Aberrant expression of venous transcriptional factor NR2F2 was observed in lesional ECs and correlated with progressive enlargement from capillaries to larger-caliber vessels containing multiple layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In CM iPSCs, differentiation course yielded reduced ECs but increased SMCs. In silico knockout simulation predicted NR2F2 as a crucial regulator of facilitating SMC phenotype in CM. Consistently, enforced NR2F2 expression during iPSC differentiation suppressed endothelial markers while inducing SMC-associated genes.

This mutation has been reported in other cases as a prevalent pathogenic mutation in patients with motor dysfunction and a broad range of neurological outcomes. To investigate the molecular and functional consequences of the Go E246K mutation, we employed structural modeling and analysis, biochemical assays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and cellular functional assays.

This impairment overrides the presence of wild-type Go, explaining the dominant effect of the severe neurogenetic phenotype in the heterozygous background.

Our findings revealed that TRAP-/- mice of both sexes maintained shorter tibiae than WT mice independent of sex. Notably, male, but not female, TRAP-/- mice have increased trabecular bone volume fraction and cortical bone area compared to WT, indicative of disrupted bone remodelling processes in male mice. Interestingly, TRAP-deficiency substantially impaired the anabolic bone response to mechanical loading, affecting both trabecular and cortical compartments in both sexes, indicating that when challenged, TRAP is important for bone formation also in female mice. Mechanical stimulation in vitro of hematopoietic progenitor cells from WT and TRAP-/- mice revealed that the increased ATP-release in response to mechanical stimulation was only disrupted in male mice, while mechanically induced increase in osteoclast formation was inhibited in TRAP-/- mice of both sexes.

We implemented an optical 3D imaging pipeline to generate a first account of the 3D-spatial and volumetric distribution of the remaining {beta}-cells throughout the volume of an entire human late onset T1D pancreas at a microscopic resolution. As expected, {beta}-cell mass was dramatically lower than in the non-diabetic pancreas. However, the pancreatic head displayed a morphology and size resembling the non-diabetic pancreas and had a 3 times higher {beta}-cell density compared to the rest of the organ. Surprisingly, only a fraction of the residual {beta}-cells were located within islet structures. Instead, the absolute majority were present as extra-islet {beta}-cells, either as scattered individual cells or as clusters of {beta}-cells, spatially separated from all other endocrine cell-types. Jointly, these extra-islet {beta}-cells appeared roughly 60x less prone to succumb than islet associated {beta}-cells. In sharp contrast to {beta}-cell mass, -cell density appeared unaffected. This 3D whole organ depiction of an entire long standing, late onset, T1D pancreas shows that individual {beta}-cells may be preserved in a highly regionalized manner, potentially reflecting key aspects of disease dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

To address these questions, we performed molecular phylogenetic analysis of Lhcx/Lhcsr subfamilies and produced the Lhcx1 knockout mutants of the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis, which has low Lhcx redundancy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that diatom Lhcxs and the green algal Lhcsrs evolved from a common ancestor, with green plants acquiring them through horizontal gene transfer. The Lhcx1 mutants of C. gracilis mostly abolished non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and the time-resolved fluorescence measurements clarified that Lhcx1-mediated quenching occurs in the energetically detached antenna complexes. Consistently, clear-native PAGE using Amphipol suggested that CgLhcx1 would interact with FCP L-dimer, functioning as a peripheral antenna for C2S2M2 PSII-FCPII. Notably, the lhcx1 mutant exhibited a higher PSII effective quantum yield than wild-type (WT) under high-light acclimation, attributed to reduced antenna size and enhanced carbon fixation capacity. The lack of NPQ accelerated high-light acclimation, with increased xanthophylls in lhcx1, indicating that compensatory mechanisms can lead to enhanced photosynthetic efficiency. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and molecular mechanisms of photoprotection in diatoms.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

It is composed of endemic and diverse genera, with most species having restricted geographic distributions. To infer its evolutionary history, the structure of a fog-dependent plant community in the Marginal Desert (27-30S) was characterized, with a special focus on congeners of Nolana and Heliotropium sect. Cochranea. Similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF) identified six plant assemblages differentially distributed along the altitudinal gradient. The congeners showed a pattern of niche segregation, with basal species N. rostrata and H. filifolium occupying the fog-influenced altitudinal range, while recently diverged species occurred outside its direct influence. To corroborate phylogenetic convergence, climatic zones were defined based on the presence of Nolana and Cochranea, and these were used to reconstruct ancestral areas and formulate a biogeographic hypothesis. The history of the Atacama Desert flora is marked by two periods: the formation of the hyperarid core (18-27S) during the late Miocene led to an initial divergence, leaving species isolated in different climatic zones. Then, beginning around 4 Mya, various wet phases promoted the northward geographic expansion of the flora inhabiting the Marginal Desert, with some genera reaching as far as Peru. Following geographic expansion, dry phases led to landscape-scale heterogeneity in water availability, promoting adaptive radiation. The ecological and phylogenetic affinities of N. rostrata and H. filifolium suggest that terete leaf morphology represents a case of evolutionary convergence associated with fog water capture.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

By modulating the photosystems absorption cross section, they affect their photosynthetic activity and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity. These processes have been widely studied by spectrally integrated chlorophyll fluorescence methods, which mask their associated spectral information. We explored in aspen and Arabidopsis npq mutants how the absence of these components affects the development of NPQ spectra under two contrasting conditions: in the absence and presence of photoinhibition. We proposed a new parameter to estimate the development of new emitting species (NESD) during time-spectrally resolved NPQ inductions and a pipeline to disentangle PSII energy partitioning heterogeneity. We demonstrate that LHCB, PsbS and zeaxanthin is required for NESD. By combining gas exchange with spectrally resolved kinetics, we show that under photoinhibitory conditions, however, NES develops in the absence of PsbS and zeaxanthin, and the resulting sustained quenching occurring independently of photoinhibition. Furthermore, we found that in the absence of LHCB and Curvature Thylakoid 1 a significant increase in photoinhibition was observed. This suggest that in the long term effective photoprotection requires the presence of LHCB and thylakoid plasticity, while PsbS and zeaxanthin play a major role in catalyzing LHCII-dependent quenching.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Numerous examples of cis-elements targeted by DNA methylation, particularly at CG sites (mCG), have been reported to be under selective pressure in animals and plants. By contrast, there is limited knowledge of trans-regulators of mCG leading to adaptation. Here, using genome-wide association studies, we identify CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7 ALPHA (CDCA7) as a trans-regulator of mCG in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. CDCA7 and its paralog, CDCA7{beta}, directly bind to the chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1), which facilitates access of methyltransferases to DNA. CDCA7/{beta} selectively regulates mCG and minimally impacts other DDM1-dependent processes such as non-CG methylation and histone variant deposition. We identify the cis-regulatory sequence modulating CDCA7 expression in natural populations and determining the degree of mCG and TE silencing. The geographic distribution of CDCA7 alleles suggests that new alleles have repeatedly expanded to novel ecological niches, indicating a potential role in local adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide new insight into how changes in global DNA methylation levels through transcriptional regulation of the epigenetic machinery have the capacity to facilitate local adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

A forward genetic approach based on random gene overexpression, also known as activation tagging, was previously used to study gene function in angiosperms. However, such an approach has never been applied to algae. Here, we present enhancer-driven random gene overexpression (ERGO), a forward genetic screen that we utilized to study genes involved in carotenoid metabolism in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We generated a library of over 33,000 insertional mutants in a yellow-in-the-dark background strain, which is incapable of producing chlorophyll in the dark. Each mutant contained a randomly inserted enhancer, Ehist cons, capable of activating gene expression in the C. reinhardtii nuclear genome. After visually screening the mutant colonies for a color change from yellow to orange, we isolated a mutant with increased carotenoid content and remarkable resistance to high-light stress. RNA-seq data analysis revealed substantial upregulation of a gene, that we name CMRP1, encoding a putative F-box protein. CRISPR-mediated knockout of this gene resulted in decreased carotenoid concentrations, confirming that CMRP1 is involved in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism. Our study shows that a gene overexpression screen can be successfully adapted to C. reinhardtii and potentially other plants and algae, thereby expanding the palette of genetic tools to study gene function.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We present the first integrated study of how allelic variation at three key flowering time genes, PPD-H1, ELF3 and PHYC, modulates three parameters of the photoperiod response model: threshold photoperiod, photoperiod sensitivity, and intrinsic earliness. We recorded flowering under lengths of 16-24h in Near Isogenic Lines carrying PhyC-e or PhyC-I allele within ppd-H1 background, and in lines from HEB-25 combining wild and domesticated alleles of ELF3 and PPD-H1. The ELF3 allele in ppd-H1 background reduced intrinsic earliness, whereas PhyC-e reduced photoperiod sensitivity, opening opportunities for climate change adaptation. Remarkably, ppd-H1 lines flowered at a 20-h threshold, whereas Ppd-H1 lines showed no response, consequently we propose new SB photoperiods at 20 and 16h depending on PPD-H1 background.

Using the as near as possible to nature DRD-BIBLOX (Dark-Root device Brick Black Box), barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.), although relatively salt-tolerant, exhibits impaired germination, seedling growth, and an altered root system architecture (RSA) under high salinity. Shotgun proteomic analysis revealed spatiotemporal regulation of ESCRT proteins in shoots and roots during seedling development. We identified HvSNF7.1 and HvVPS4 as critical, but differently acting modulators of salt stress responses in barley tissues. In this study we further reveal novel functions of ESCRT-0-like TOM-1-like proteins (TOLs): Previously described as gatekeepers of degradative protein sorting and as regulators of abscisic acid signaling, growth, and heat stress responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), HvTOLs had not been characterized for their role in salinity adaptation during plant development. Functional analyses demonstrated lethality in Hvtoldouble and Hvtolquadruple mutants under standard growth conditions. In Arabidopsis, loss of AtTOL3 alone impaired germination and root growth under salt stress, underscoring the essential role of individual TOL proteins in the spatio-temporal regulation of abiotic stress adaptation.

Half the monoliths received a spring drought, then all were watered and the wheat 14CO2 pulse-labelled at stem elongation.

Past electron microscopy evidence suggests that GLRaV3 forms VRCs from the outer mitochondrial membrane of host grapevine plants. Here, we report the subcellular localization of the replicase polyprotein encoded by GLRaV3 ORF1a (PP1a) towards understanding its putative role in VRC formation. Through confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of distinct EGFP-tagged PP1a domains, interdomain regions and truncations expressed in model plants, we report the molecular signals responsible for the targeting and association of PP1a to the mitochondria. This signal, located in the \"Iceberg\" region downstream from the methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase (M/GTase) domain, comprises an amphipathic a-helix and a downstream transmembrane domain (TMD). Mutagenesis studies suggest that the polar face of the amphipathic a-helix functions as the targeting signal, whereas the non-polar face, together with the TMD, act in membrane-anchoring. Microscopy observations are confirmed through mitochondrial isolation via gradient centrifugation and Western blotting.

To address this gap, we developed a modular platform of cell lines that stably express synthetic chromatin reader constructs, termed Acyl-eCRs, containing various bromodomains fused to eGFP. We demonstrate that these Acyl-eCRs recapitulate the same response to bromodomain inhibitors and PROTACs as endogenous proteins, allowing for the quantitative assessment of drug effects. We introduce two complementary flow cytometry-based assays to evaluate inhibitor-target engagement: a competitive binding assay leveraging PROTAC-induced degradation, and a nuclear retention assay that directly measures the displacement of bromodomains from chromatin. Our approach circumvents the need for laborious protein purification and in vitro characterization, providing a scalable and physiologically relevant method for assessing inhibitor potency and specificity. This platform represents a versatile tool for chemical biology, enabling the functional evaluation of chromatin-targeting drugs in a native cellular context.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Core clock genes and other highly rhythmic targets of CLOCK:BMAL1 typically possess a tandem arrangement of E-boxes that is required for robust oscillations. Here, we show that the presence of tandem E-boxes enables CLOCK:BMAL1 to bind more internal sites on the nucleosome, leading to release of DNA from the histone core and the presentation of multiple coactivator binding motifs in close proximity to facilitate multivalent interactions with the coactivator CBP/p300. We show that the transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1, essential for CLOCK:BMAL1 activity, interacts with several modular domains of CBP. Deletion of these CBP domains or chemical inhibition of protein-protein interactions with CBP significantly reduces or eliminates CLOCK:BMAL1-driven activity. Altogether, this suggests that multivalent interactions with CBP may play a role in the ability of tandem CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers to recruit this limiting cofactor in cells.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The objective of this study was to systematically analyse the genomic characteristics, bacteriocin production, and probiotic potential of LAB strains isolated from fermented Ethiopian kocho. The research involved isolating LAB from kocho, assessing their tolerance to acid and bile salts, evaluating antimicrobial activity, determining antibiotic susceptibility, and conducting whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate genetic relatedness. Out of 150 LAB isolates, 7 (4.67%) exhibited remarkable acid tolerance, surviving at rates between 50.52-74.05% and 33.33-62.40% after 3 and 6 hours of exposure to pH 2, respectively. These seven acid-tolerant isolates also demonstrated exceptional resistance to 0.3% bile salt, maintaining survival rates ranging from 88.96% to 98.10% over 24 hours. In addition, the isolates displayed inhibitory effects against several important foodborne pathogenic bacteria, underscoring their potential as natural antimicrobial agents. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, whereas the most potent isolates exhibited significant resistance to kanamycin. Notably, four of the seven isolates showed resistance to streptomycin, while the remaining three were sensitive. The WGS analysis revealed that the isolates belonged to the Lactobacillus genus, including six Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one Lactobacillus brevis strain. Genomic analysis using the Bayesian Analysis of Gene Essentiality (BAGEL) tool predicted the presence of two class II bacteriocins across all seven strains, further supporting their potential as functional probiotic candidates. Overall, our findings highlight the probiotic potential of the seven Lactobacillus strains, demonstrating their acid and bile salt tolerance, antimicrobial properties, and genetic predisposition for bacteriocin production.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The mechanisms underlying IR damage in SGs are not fully understood, and current therapies often fail to meet patient needs adequately. Therefore, identifying targeted pathways and alternative treatments is essential. To address this, we developed an ex vivo model of SG damage using human salivary glands obtained from patients. Healthy submandibular glands were harvested, cultured, and exposed to IR. RNA sequencing revealed elevated markers for DNA damage, inflammation, and ferroptosis, with four specific genes, FDXR, MDM2, H2AX, and p21, showing increases in expression that correlated with the IR dose. Using them, we developed a high-throughput genetic screening method to evaluate stem cell therapies aimed at mitigating IR injury. Conditioned media from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC-CM) were found to reduce the expression of all four markers, maintain tissue viability, promote cell proliferation, and decrease oxidative stress. Further analysis involved separating MSC-CM into two fractions: Extracellular Vesicles (EV)-rich and EV-depleted. The EV-depleted fractions retained elevated levels of DNA damage response markers, indicating that EVs play a crucial role in mediating tissue repair. In contrast, the EV-rich fractions reduced the markers of DNA damage response and were readily absorbed by the tissue slices. In conclusion, we have developed a genetic screening method to evaluate treatments for acute IR injury, emphasizing the significant role that EVs play in the repair process.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

A common cause is the C203R missense mutation, which occurs in both OPN1LW and OPN1MW, or in hybrid OPN1LW/OPN1MW opsin genes. Because BCM primarily affects foveal cones, we generated Opn1mwC198R/Opn1sw-/-/Nrl-/- (C198RAC) mice carrying the murine equivalent of the human C203R mutation on an all-cone retinal background. C198RAC mice exhibited absent photopic ERG responses and reduced expression of cone phototransduction proteins, recapitulating foveal cone deficits in BCM. Metabolomic profiling further revealed altered retinal metabolism, including reduced cGMP and elevated oxidative stress-related metabolites. To evaluate therapy, we delivered AAV8-Y733F expressing human L-opsin (OPN1LW) cDNA under the cone-specific PR2.1 promoter at 1 and 5 months of age. Treatment restored cone function, regenerated outer segment structures, and provided rescue for at least 5 months post-injection in both early- and late-treatment groups. These results demonstrate that densely packed cones expressing only the C198R mutant opsin remain viable targets for gene therapy.

Although QKI is dispensable for cardiac specification, its loss disrupts sarcomere assembly despite intact expression of sarcomere mRNAs through exon skipping and nuclear retention of mis-spliced RNAs. QKI-dependent exons in essential cardiac genes have weak 5'SS and frequently show poor complementarity with U6 snRNA. We show that QKI directly interacts with U6 snRNA using an overlapping interface to its traditional intronic binding activity, securing U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP to ensure splicing fidelity.

Deletion of p16 promoted the transition of AT2 into alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, resulting in tissue regeneration in both mice and alveolar organoids. Pharmacological targeting of the p16 pathway using senolytic agents recapitulate this regenerative effect, further supporting the role of p16 as a key brake on epithelial plasticity.

Using activity-based protein profiling, we identified UCHL3 as a key cellular factor activated during Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infections. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments demonstrated that UCHL3 deficiency impairs flavivirus replication and viral protein expression across multiple cellular models. The underlying molecular mechanism involves UCHL3-mediated stabilisation of subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA)-containing biomolecular condensates. Through biotinylated sfRNA-interactome capture assays, we show that UCHL3 physically interacts with sfRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes alongside G3BP1. Importantly, UCHL3 depletion triggers inappropriate RNase L activation, leading to sfRNA relocalisation from protective P-bodies to degradative compartments, such as RNase L-induced bodies (RLBs) as reported previously, resulting in viral RNA decay. Our rescue experiments confirmed that RNase L knockdown restores viral replication in UCHL3-deficient cells. This pro-viral effect of UCHL3 operates through interferon-independent mechanisms, as demonstrated by persistent replication defects even upon exogenous interferon treatment. This work therefore identifies UCHL3 as a molecular switch controlling the balance between pro-viral and antiviral RNA condensates, representing a promising host dependency factor for broad-spectrum flavivirus intervention strategies.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

To dissect the genetic basis underlying stripe rust resistance in Bakers Ann, 125 doubled haploid lines, derived from the cross between OK12D22004-016 and Bakers Ann, were evaluated at the adult plant stage in the greenhouse and in field environments in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Washington.

Phantom morphology can be user-tuned according to the: number of generations (branches); total number of segments; segment diameter and length; angle between connecting segments, and; maximum extent in space. The geometric fidelity of resulting VASAL phantoms was validated against an exemplar rat hippocampal network. Comparable distributions of segment lengths, diameters and orientations, and branching characteristics were obtained, demonstrating VASAL replicated realistic microvascular structures. Implementation of spin flow dynamics was validated by simulating dMRI signals in the ballistic regime, which has a well-defined analytical solution; agreement was excellent between simulated signals and analytical solutions (average root mean square error of 0.005). Following this validation of network geometry and spin flow dynamics, VASAL phantoms with different morphologies were generated to evaluate key IVIM model assumptions. Phantom geometry substantially affected dMRI signals and caused deviations from the IVIM model: for example, complex branching phantoms displayed non-Gaussian signal attenuation and diffusion time dependence.

CETP is the primary protein that regulates plasma circulating levels of lipids (within high, low, and very low-density lipoproteins. The protein, in addition to its terminal openings, has two additional openings, plugged by two phospholipids (PLs). Small molecule inhibitors targeting CETP tunnel displace PL during CETP inhibition. Here, using steered molecular dynamics simulations followed by in-vitro mutagenesis we show that CETP-bound PLs are indispensable in establishing the optimal architecture of CETP tunnel. Our structural and functional analyses revealed that lipid traversal through CETP's central tunnel is facilitated through hydrophobic interaction-mediated diffusion. PLs are critical in synchronizing domain movements of CETP while accelerating triglyceride traversal through the tunnel and their activity regulated through salt-bridge interactions. Most notably, we show for the first time that phospholipids (PLs) bound within CETP's tunnel accelerate lipid movement through a novel \"gliding\" mechanism, representing the first known example of a lipid regulating the movement of another. We identified conserved phenylalanine (Phe) flaps that act as a regulatory valve, opening and closing concertedly to prevent lipid backflow in the absence of an active motor. This study provides in-depth understanding of the mechanism of lipid exchange by CETP guided, and accentuated by its interaction with PLs.

Exciton dynamics within LH2 complexes are controlled by the structural arrangement and energy levels of the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and carotenoid (Car) pigments. However, there is still debate over the competing light-harvesting versus energy-dissipation pathways. In this work, we compared five variants of the LH2 complex from genetically modified strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, all containing the same BChls but different Cars with increasing conjugation: zeta-carotene (N=7; LH2Zeta), neurosporene (N=9; LH2Neu), spheroidene (N=10; LH2Spher), lycopene (N=11; LH2Lyco), and spirilloxanthin (N=13; LH2Spir).

Similarly, fluorescence spectra showed that the B850 BChl emission peak had an increasing red shift from LH2Zeta[-&gt;](LH2Neu/LH2Spher)[-&gt;]LH2Lyco[-&gt;]LH2Spir. In contrast, time-resolved fluorescence and ultrafast transient absorption (fs-TA) revealed similar excited state lifetimes (~1 ns) for all complexes except LH2Spir (~0.7 ns). From fs-TA analysis, an additional ~7 ps non-radiative dissipation step from B850 BChl was observed for LH2Zeta. Further, singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation studies showed a ~50% average fluorescence lifetime reduction in LH2Zeta at high laser power and high repetition rate, compared to ~10-15% reductions in LH2Neu/LH2Spher/LH2Lyco and minimal lifetime change in LH2Spir. In LH2Zeta, the fastest decay component (<50 ps) became prominent at high repetition rates, consistent with strong singlet-triplet annihilation. Nanosecond TA measurements revealed long-lived (>40 s) BChl triplet states in LH2Zeta and signs of damage caused by singlet oxygen, whereas other LH2s showed faster triplet quenching (~18 ns) by Cars. These findings highlight a key design principle of LH2 complexes: the Car triplet energy must be significantly lower than the BChl triplet energy to efficiently quench BChl triplets that otherwise act as potent \"trap states\" causing exciton annihilation in laser-based experiments or photo-damage in native membranes.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

While the stoichiometries and dynamics of ivonescimab's interactions with VEGF and PD-1 are not fully understood, VEGF binding is thought to promote higher-order structure formation. Methods: We used mass photometry (MP) and kinetic modelling to analyze these interactions, quantifying the complexes formed and their affinities. Dissociation constants (KD) for ivonescimab's binding to VEGF and PD-1 were calculated from equilibrium counts and real-time measurements, respectively. Results: VEGF drove oligomerization of ivonescimab, which bound VEGF predominantly in a 2:2 stoichiometry, with KD=0.08 nM. Higher-order oligomeric complexes, present only at low abundance, displayed markedly weaker affinities (1.29 nM; 3.17 nM). Ternary complexes of ivonescimab with its two targets consistently presented two PD-1 antigens for each ivonescimab molecule, with near-identical KDs for the binding of the first (2.37 nM) and second (2.36 nM) PD-1 molecules. Conclusions: MP confirmed VEGF-induced ivonescimab oligomerization and revealed that dimers, not higher-order structures, were the most stable stoichiometry. MP enables detailed analysis of antibody-antigen interactions, even for bispecific antibodies that interact with antigens with complex stoichiometries.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The platform is compatible with magnetic mounting onto the standard goniometer of macromolecular crystallography beamlines. Our design utilizes a 96-well frame that facilitates hanging-drop experiments directly on the membrane using conventional crystallization plates, thereby eliminating multiple pipetting and crystal handling steps.

The versatility of the platform is demonstrated by five structures solved using different crystallization and data-collection strategies. Single crystal rotational-crystallography at both room- and cryogenic- temperatures using large crystals of lysozyme is shown.

Through a meta-analysis, we showed that net N2O and N2 production from denitrification respond differently to temperature, exhibiting distinct temperature sensitivities. In addition, nitrate availability plays a critical role in regulating this balance, yet only few studies have examined the combined effects of temperature and nitrate availability in natural sediments. Using 15N-isotope labelling and anoxic sediment incubations, we found that temperature effects on N2O and N2 production from denitrification were evident only under high nitrate levels (100 M), while no significant temperature response occurred under low nitrate concentration (10 M). At high nitrate availability, N2 production increased at higher temperatures, whereas net N2O production declined, leading to a lower production ratio of N2O to N2 at warmer temperatures. These findings suggest that in nitrogen-limited ecosystems, substrate availability plays a stronger role than temperature in regulating denitrification. More broadly, they provide insights into how nutrient loading and climate warming interact to shape nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in aquatic ecosystems.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we advance individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) for intact mass and fragmentation analysis of - and {beta}-catenins (85-110 kDa), key components of adherens junctions. Using denatured I2MS, we resolved discrete phosphorylation states of catenins isolated from HEK cells subjected to differential actomyosin tension. Up to 10 phosphorylations were detected on -catenin and 7 on {beta}-catenin, with site-specific changes corresponding to actomyosin contractility. Notably, phosphorylation at -catenin S641 was constitutive, while other sites in the P-linker and actin-binding domains as well as {beta}-catenin S675 and S552 were sensitive to actomyosin perturbation. Application of I2MS for fragment ion detection (I2MS2) also enabled 25-30% sequence coverage for these exceptionally large proteoforms, compared to <1% using conventional methods for top-down mass spectrometry. Our results support a catenin phospho-code model, wherein combinatorial phosphorylation patterns encode mechano-transductive signals regulating cell-cell adhesion.

Alignment improvements can come from structural alignment of AlphaFold-predicted structures or scoring based on similarity of protein embedding vectors, resp. Thorough comparison on many domains from BAliBASE and CDD demonstrates that the Ankh-score method produces much better sequence alignments than structural alignments using US-align of AlphaFold3-predicted structures.

Here we show several ways that criticality can be hidden from traditional data analytic approaches, leading to false negative conclusions. We use a parsimonious high-dimensional model to demonstrate how neural systems may separate different dynamical modes into different subspaces, simultaneously generating non-critical dynamics, critical oscillations, and scale-invariant avalanches.

These adaptations can include biofilm formation, where the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances can protect the cells from a hostile environment, or, under nutrient-limited conditions, pseudohyphal or hyphal growth, where the colony can send out long `tendrils' to explore the environment and seek nutrients. Recently, we observed a spiral colony morphology emerge in an isolate of the hyphae-forming yeast Magnusiomyces magnusii grown under laboratory conditions. We use an off-lattice agent-based model (ABM) that simulates colony development to investigate the hypothesis that the spiral morphology is the result of bias in the hyphal branching angle. The model involves biologically-motivated rules of hyphal growth and branching, with key model parameters including the colony size at the onset of hyphal filaments, and the branching angle. Using one example of an experimentally-grown colony, we use a sequential neural likelihood method to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference to infer the model parameters. Our results indicate a mean hyphal branching angle of 2.3 degrees [1.1, 3.6] (95% credible interval).

Six vim-1+ clinical isolates, from the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, were obtained from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Whole genome sequencing revealed that vim-1 was plasmid-borne in all strains and situated as the first gene in In916 or In110 integrons. Analysis of related plasmids suggested that these vim-1-containing plasmids are globally disseminated and have spread via horizontal gene transfer and autochthonous vertical spread within Ontario. Interestingly, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ertapenem and meropenem, two clinically relevant carbapenem antibiotics, against these six isolates varied more than tenfold, suggesting the effects of VIM-1 are dependent on the genomic content of the host microbe. To further study the genomic content dependency of VIM-1, we introduced vim-1 into three common Enterobacterales laboratory strains. Although introduction of vim-1 into Escherichia coli DH5 resulted in little resistance to ertapenem or meropenem, multiple rounds of adaptive laboratory evolution allowed us to identify variants with extremely high levels of resistance to both carbapenems. DNA sequencing revealed that the increase in carbapenem resistance was due to a combination of increased vim-1 gene dosage and epistatic interactions with mutations of ompC that likely would have decreased outer membrane permeability to these antibiotics. Together, these results provide additional support for the role of gene epistasis is modulating the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of acquired resistance genes, as well as previous results suggesting that the presence of a {beta}-lactamase gene is insufficient to confer strong resistance to carbapenems without being paired with reduced outer membrane permeability.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The final resolution of EM reconstruction was estimated to be in the range from 2.09 to 2.30 angstroms, which is higher than that of the previously published structure. This improvement in the resolution enabled us to refine side-chain conformations to reliably determine the distances be-tween the side-chain residues participating in the intersubunit interactions, and determine a network of water molecules surrounding the pilus rod. The analysis revealed that water contributes to inter-subunit stabilization both through discrete bridging interactions and through extended hydrogen-bonded clusters, thereby supporting both the rigidity and flexibility of the filament. Comparison with a homologous high-resolution pilus model from enterotoxigenic E. coli showed that nearly all conserved water molecules i.e., those that are present at equivalent positions in different subunits of our model occupy also equivalent positions across the two structures, underscoring their func-tional relevance. At the same time, sequence-specific differences in hydration patterns were ob-served.

Unlike temperate and boreal forests, tropical forests exhibit a bimodal photosynthetic pattern, characterized by distinct peaks in the first and second halves of the year. However, the intra-annual differences in photosynthetic responses to hydrothermal variations between these two periods in the Amazon rainforest remain largely unexplored. Here, utilizing satellite-derived photosynthetic proxies alongside ground-based flux tower observations from 2001 to 2020, we investigated the differences in photosynthetic responses to hydrothermal variations between the first and second halves of the year in the Amazon rainforest. Our observations revealed weaker temperature limitations but stronger precipitation limitations on photosynthesis in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Temperature constraints on photosynthesis have progressively weakened in both periods, while precipitation limitations have intensified, particularly in the latter half. Although the optimal temperature for photosynthesis is higher in the second half of the year, it is reached earlier, resulting in a sharper decline in photosynthetic productivity over the past two decades.

We quantified how enhanced structural beta complexity (ESBC) treatments affect VOC {beta}-diversity patterns and investigated potential drivers and ecological effects in temperate production forests. Using the experimental BETA-FOR framework, we sampled ambient forest air at the forest floor and 1 m heights across 234 forest patches in six German regions using Tenax/Carboxen adsorbent traps analyzed via TD-GCMS. Results from generalized linear beta regression models showed that {beta}-diversity of VOCs increased significantly at 1 m height in ESBC forests compared to control forests, but this increase was not significant at the forest floor. In contrast to studies on plants, fungi and animals, the main driver for increasing beta-diversity in VOCs was not the heterogeneity of canopy openness, but the amount of deadwood. Using saproxylic beetles as a test group, we found that saproxylic beetle community dissimilarity increased with VOC dissimilarity, but only for forest floor VOCs. Our finding adds a new component to the framework of habitat heterogeneity, the invisible gradient of volatile diversity utilized by many forest organisms.

In 16 streams, we measured species richness, abundance, unique species richness, evenness, beta and gamma diversity in a beaver-engineered site with beaver dams and a control site without beaver activity. 3 Especially aquatic and semi-aquatic species profited from beaver-engineering. In response to beaver-engineering, amphibians, dragonflies, macrophytes, and plankton increased in species richness, abundance and unique species richness, while fish and terrestrial plants increased in species richness and unique species richness. Bats only increased in unique species richness, while for the other terrestrial taxa, we found no difference between beaver-engineered and control sites. Community evenness remained largely unaffected across all groups. 4 Overall, beaver-engineering increased biodiversity across a land-use gradient. For macrophytes and amphibians (species richness, unique species richness and abundance), as well for dragonflies (species richness and unique species richness), increases were smaller under higher land-use intensity. For the remaining taxa and metrics, we found no relationship between land-use intensity and responses to beaver engineering. 5 However, for beta-diversity, we found that sites with a high land-use intensity had a lower component of nestedness and stronger community turnover in comparison to more natural sites, with a significant effect for macrophytes. Gamma species richness was generally unaffected by land-use intensity, except for amphibians, which were often only found in beaver-engineered sites in high-land-use intensity areas. 6 Synthesis and applications.

We recently discovered that unusual nitrogen- and sulfur-containing (N,S-) cardenolides in some milkweed species are highly toxic, and broken down to less toxic forms which are sequestered by monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). Here we isolated and purified five dominant cardenolide toxins from the tropical milkweed, Asclepias curassavica, a globally abundant host plant of monarchs, and fed them to caterpillars individually or in mixture. We hypothesized that the two N,S-cardenolides in A. curassavica (uscharin and voruscharin) would reduce caterpillar growth and sequestration more than other abundant related cardenolides (15-Hydroxy calotropin, frugoside, calactin). Overall, cardenolide treatments caused monarchs to feed more and grow more compared to controls; nonetheless, one N,S-cardenolide (voruscharin) was not stimulatory and caused substantial reductions in growth efficiency. Consuming N,S-cardenolides caused caterpillars to sequester the lowest total amounts of cardenolides, and also reduced their efficiency of sequestration. We next tested the phytochemical diversity hypothesis, that toxin mixtures pose a substantial burden for caterpillars compared to individual compounds provided in equimolar concentrations. We prepared two types of mixtures, one containing equal concentrations of the five compounds and another \"realistic mixture\" where toxin concentrations reflect their natural proportions in leaves. Mixtures had a negative impact on caterpillar feeding, growth, sequestration, and sequestration efficiency compared to the average of single compounds. The equal and realistic mixtures had similar impacts on feeding and growth, but feeding on the realistic mixture resulted in the lowest sequestration. We conclude that as a result of coevolutionary interactions, even sequestering herbivores may be thwarted by highly specialized plant metabolites such as N,S-cardenolides, and that phytochemical mixtures strengthen plant defense. Toxin mixtures likely challenge detoxification and transport of plant defenses, reducing the herbivores growth and sequestration.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

N.; Haegeman, B.; Etienne, R.", "abstract": "Understanding island biodiversity requires studying the processes driving its assembly and examining how these processes vary over time, across lineages, and across different islands. The DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Island biota through Speciation, Immigration, and Extinction) framework has been developed for this purpose, and has advanced our understanding of island community assembly by estimating, from phylogenetic data, the contribution of the processes of colonization, speciation and extinction to island community assembly. However, the model assumes uniform colonization and diversification rates across lineages, ignoring potential variation in these rates caused by, for example, lineage-specific traits. This assumption thus restricts the model's capacity to capture complex colonization and diversification dynamics, and may consequently bias inference of colonization and diversification dynamics on islands. An extension of the framework behind these more complex dynamics is therefore desired. However, for this state-dependent colonization and diversification extension, the current computation of the likelihood of the model given phylogenetic data is computationally prohibitive. In this study, we therefore propose an alternative approach to computing the DAISIE likelihood, under the assumption of diversity-independent colonization and diversification. Our novel approach is based on the pruning algorithm (which calculates the likelihoods of comparative data given a tree and a model) that has been used for computing the likelihood of SSE (State-dependent Speciation and Extinction) models, which traces lineage history backward in time from the present day to the root of the tree. We demonstrate that our alternative approach reproduces DAISIE's predictions under diversity-independent colonization and diversification. This is important because no independent evaluation of the likelihood computation in DAISIE has been available. Our alternative approach not only confirms DAISIE results for diversity-independent colonization and diversification, it also gives more confidence in the results under diversity-dependence. Furthermore, our alternative approach offers greater computational efficiency. Finally, it provides a flexible framework for incorporating state-dependent dynamics in colonization, speciation, and extinction processes.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

While individual transposons may emerge and vanish over time, the long-term evolutionary stability of the pathways that suppress them remains poorly understood. In the ovarian somatic cells of Drosophila, envelope-carrying gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are silenced by the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which depends exclusively on Piwi - an evolutionary derivative of an Aubergine/Piwi gene duplication unique to flies. Recent studies, however, have revealed that envelope-carrying gypsy elements are widespread across metazoans and particularly abundant in insect genomes, raising questions about the origin of ovarian somatic piRNA defence. Here we demonstrate that Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, as well as stingless bees and crickets, all produce piRNAs targeting gypsy elements in ovarian somatic cells, indicating a continuous arms race in this cellular niche for more than 400 million years of insect evolution. Notably, in Aedes aegypti, ovarian somatic cells express the same piRNA clusters as other somatic tissues, where they are known to target RNA viruses - suggesting a shared origin of anti-viral and anti-retrotransposon defences. Furthermore, we reveal striking lineage-specific differences in ovarian somatic piRNA biogenesis: slicing-independent phasing dominates in dipterans, ping-pong amplification in bees, and slicing-dependent phasing in crickets. Together, these findings indicate that distinct piRNA pathways have independently evolved at different timepoints to silence the same class of retrotransposons in insect evolution.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

While laboratory studies have provided important insights into the spontaneous mutation spectrum, laboratory environments for optimal growth may engender biases that are not representative of natural populations. We analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 1,524 Caenorhabditis elegans natural isolates comprising 550 unique haplotypes to investigate mtDNA polymorphism in the wild. Ancestral reconstruction was used to polarize 2,464 variants (88 indels, 2,376 SNPs) and the results were compared to mutations identified in experimental lines under relaxed selection. MtDNA variant distribution in natural isolates is strongly dependent on site-degeneracy in a manner consistent with purifying selection. There is significant variation in the synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphism between genes. Specifically, ETC complex I genes are enriched for nonsynonymous polymorphism. The probability of synonymous mutation is higher at sites with flanking G/C nucleotides and the per gene synonymous polymorphism is negatively correlated with A+T-content at the 1st and 2nd codon positions. Furthermore, the 5' and 3' ends of genes have both higher A+T-content and less synonymous polymorphism than central regions. There is evidence of natural selection for preferred codons. We identify the first cases of large heteroplasmic mtDNA structural variants in C. elegans natural isolates, comprising deletions and duplications. Although some patterns of mtDNA mutational bias are similar between laboratory and natural populations, there exist significant differences. In particular, transversions typically associated with oxidative damage are less common at four-fold degenerate sites in natural populations relative to the laboratory.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

J.; Faundez, V.; Kwong, J. Q.", "abstract": "Primary mitochondrial cardiomyopathies are an unmet clinical challenge, as there are no therapies that directly address the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. We previously reported that the cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3), which imports phosphate required for ATP synthesis, produces a model of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in which total cardiac ATP levels are preserved despite defective mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glycolytic activity and reduced mitochondrial flux, leading us to hypothesize that pharmacologically enhancing glycolysis might be protective when the mitochondrial energy machinery is intrinsically impaired. To test this, we turned to meclizine, an FDA-approved antihistamine previously shown to shift metabolism toward glycolysis. Chronic meclizine treatment in SLC25A3-deficient mice attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, improved systolic function, and restored mitochondrial ultrastructure. Unexpectedly, meclizine suppressed glycolytic enzyme expression and reduced lactate accumulation, suggesting that meclizine does not induce a glycolytic shift in SLC25A3-deleted hearts. Instead, proteomic and functional analyses revealed preservation of mitochondrial cristae architecture via MICOS upregulation and improved NAD+/NADH homeostasis through uncoupled electron flux and NAD+ regeneration. Together, these findings identify meclizine as a clinically approved compound that promotes cardioprotection in mitochondrial disease not by driving glycolysis, but by preserving mitochondrial membrane organization and redox balance, highlighting mitochondrial quality and NAD+ redox homeostasis as therapeutic targets for primary mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we reassess the systematics of the genus through an integrative approach, combining morphological examinations with molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial COI and nuclear H3 genes from specimens collected from sea turtles, sea snakes, and a dugong. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that P. ophiophilus is a valid species, phylogenetically and morphologically distinct from the widespread turtle barnacle, P. hexastylos. Furthermore, we report the first record of P. ophiophilus from a sirenian host (Dugong dugon), a discovery that necessitates the re-examination of historical records of barnacles on sirenians worldwide. Our phylogeny places P. decorata, a turtle epibiont, as the earliest diverging lineage within the genus. This strongly suggests that the ancestor of Platylepas was associated with sea turtles, a conclusion supported by the ichnofossil record. The subsequent divergence of the P. ophiophilus clade represents a major macroevolutionary event: an ancient host shift from sea turtles to the taxonomically disparate but ecologically linked inhabitants, sea snakes and sirenians, of seagrass ecosystems. This study not only resolves a long-standing taxonomic problem but also provides a compelling narrative of host-switching that reconciles deep molecular divergence estimates with the sparse body fossil record for this fascinating group of marine symbionts.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, spatially explicit, small-scale data on Aedes populations in urban and peri-urban areas are needed to accurately assess transmission risk and develop targeted, evidence-based vector control strategies.

Yolk fatty acids are a key energy source for the developing embryo, with omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) obtained exclusively from the diet. Therefore, food availability during the breeding season is expected to influence yolk fatty acid composition and, consequently, embryo development and growth. However, the effects of dietary variation on yolk fatty acids remain unexplored in wild birds. We investigated inter-annual variation in yolk fatty acid composition of free-living great tits (Parus major) in relation to fluctuations in beech (Fagus sylvatica) fructification-their preferred food-across two years differing strongly in seed abundance. We hypothesized that differences in beech seed availability would alter yolk fatty acid composition between years of high and low fructification, with corresponding correlations to the fatty acid profiles of available seeds. Hence, we analyzed fatty acids from seeds of beech and two conifers (Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris), which account for most of the tree cover in the study area, and from 112 eggs collected from 107 nests over two years. Beech seeds contained higher proportions of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and n-3 PUFAs, and lower proportions of n-6 PUFAs than conifer seeds. Correspondingly, egg yolks had more SFA, MUFA, and n-3 PUFAs in the year of high beech abundance, and more n-6 PUFAs in the year of low abundance. Notably, the proportion of the conifer-associated n-6 PUFA pinolenic acid was 64.25 times higher in years of low compared to high beech fructification, suggesting marked inter-annual variation in yolk fatty acid composition, likely reflecting shifts in maternal diet. Future experiments need to establish causal links between diet and yolk composition and assess the fitness consequences of different seed resources for breeding females and their offspring.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We show that infection with Plasmodium berghei parasites increases JNK signalling in the reproductive tract causing a JNK-dependent reduction in both egg development and mosquito survival. Moreover, JNK signaling supresses expression of Cyp315a1 (AGAP000284), a rate-limiting enzyme in ecdysteroid synthesis, a transcriptional change reflected in reduced ecdysteroid production following an infected blood meal. A similar mechanism limits egg production under other stressors (heat stress, or ectopic activation of JNK signaling).

M.; Nasiri, S.; Redmond, M.; Goltash, S.; Khodr, R.; Lalonde, N.; Bui, T.", "abstract": "Recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury is limited in mammals. Reactivation of locomotor circuits does occur, but primarily through the activation of sensorimotor pathways in the context of locomotor training. Previous investigations have shown that dI3 neurons, a developmentally-defined population of pre-motor, glutamatergic interneurons, are indispensable for this process. However, it remains unclear how dI3 neurons are recruited during locomotor recovery, and whether they could be leveraged to improve locomotor function following spinal cord injury. Herein, we investigated how the excitability of dI3 neurons influences locomotor behaviour and recovery after spinal cord injury. In T9-T10 transected mice, we found that acute chemogenetic silencing of dI3 neurons leads to immediate loss of hindlimb motor tone, and significant reduction in stepping during treadmill locomotion. Conversely, regular chemogenetic stimulation of dI3 neurons led to transient increases in hindlimb motor tone early after injury, but ultimately reduced hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery over the long term. These chronic changes resulting from dI3 neuron stimulation were associated with the absence of expression of the constitutive 5-HT2C-R isoform, potentially representing a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of dI3 excitability following spinal cord injury. Given these findings, we hypothesized that dI3 stimulation effects on motor tone, while insufficient to drive locomotor function alone, may promote stepping improvements when locomotor rhythm-generating circuits are active. The addition of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist known to facilitate locomotor rhythmogenesis, in combination with dI3 stimulation, significantly improved locomotor function, while also mitigating the long-term reduction in treadmill stepping associated with dI3 stimulation alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that hyper-excitable dI3 neurons are involved in the maintenance of motor tone after spinal cord injury, possibly through a 5-HT2C-R-dependent mechanism, and further show that the selective stimulation of dI3 neurons could enhance the recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

The commensal pathobiont Candida albicans was designated a WHO priority pathogen due to its capacity to cause severe morbidity and mortality. In immunocompromised individuals, C. albicans can also cause severe oropharyngeal and mucocutaneous candidiasis. In oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), oral epithelial cells (OECs) are the first point of interaction with fungus. Upon encounter with C. albicans, OECs upregulate a large array of anti-fungal defense genes. There are extensive studies characterizing transcriptional mechanisms that lead to expression of cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, etc. within OECs. Inflammatory transcripts are subject to extensive regulation at the mRNA level, yet surprisingly little is known about mechanisms that control C. albicans-induced genes posttranscriptionally. Recently, the importance of mRNA modifications (the epitranscriptome) in immunity has become appreciated, but almost nothing is known about this in the setting of fungal infection. Here, we demonstrate a role for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in oral epithelial defense responses to C. albicans. Blockade of core m6A machinery including methylases (writers) and m6A binding proteins (readers) results in reprogramming of essential C. albicans host defense transcripts. In particular, the YTHDF family of m6A readers represses a subset of OEC immune genes but upregulates others. Pharmacological inhibition of METTL3, a core m6A writer, murine OPC leads to increased cytokine gene expression, resulting in reduced fungal burden and alleviating disease. These studies provide insights into mechanisms through which m6A modifications contribute to host epithelial responses to C. albicans, establishing a role for the m6A pathway as a bidirectional modulator of immunity to mucosal candidiasis.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

Average nighttime temperature was the most important temperature variable for overall arthropod community similarity metrics. Restricted to flight interception traps, flying insect communities responded to daily temperature maximum and nighttime average temperature. Restricted to pitfall traps, on the other hand, arthropod communities were shaped by the overall temperature metric only when focusing on rare species.

To achieve this, we systematically explored three complementary scaffold-generation strategies: scaffold grafting (SG), diffusion-based de novo design, and scaffold-search and grafting (SSG), identifying distinct advantages - SG rapidly optimized receptor-derived motifs to subnanomolar affinity; de novo diffusion produced topologically novel binders; and SSG enabled access to concave site B of GDF15 by repurposing evolutionary structural analogs from natural complexes.

Conventional preclinical models intentionally reduce variability to isolate biological effects but consequently fail to capture the heterogeneity present in human populations. This limitation contributes to translational gaps, incomplete mechanistic understanding, and adverse drug reactions. Digital twins offer a novel solution by integrating individualized data with simulation-based inference to predict physiology and therapeutic outcomes in a cell-specific, and ultimately, patient specific manner. Methods: We developed an integrated computational, experimental, and machine learning framework to generate digital twins of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). A synthetic population of over one million computational iPSC-CMs was created by introducing physiologically plausible variation in 52 biophysical parameters governing six major ionic currents. Two synthetic datasets were used to train and test a fully connected deep neural network to infer complete parameter sets directly from optimized whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. Results: Application of the model to experimental iPSC-CMs enabled rapid extraction of ionic conductance and kinetic parameters, generating digital twins that reproduced action potential waveforms and pacing frequencies. The models captured fine-scale electrophysiological features of depolarization, plateau, and repolarization with high fidelity across diverse morphologies and recording conditions. The framework was robust to both temperature perturbations and broad morphological variability, as we show that the synthetic training data can be readily re-tuned to any recording temperature and to include broad AP phenotypes. Conclusions: This work introduces a scalable technology for generating fully parameterized, cell-specific digital twins of human iPSC-CMs from a single recording.

The bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), has been extensively studied for its haemosporidian parasite diversity across Europe showing a high diversity and prevalence rate. Given possible evolutionary pressure exerted by these pathogens, the present study used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to explore the genetic diversity and selection mechanisms of three immunity genes (MHC I exon 3, TLR3 and TLR4) in three European bluethroat populations. Specifically, we seek to (1) characterize the genetic diversity of these immunity genes, (2) detect selection signatures shaping their diversity, and (3) investigate the relationship between these immunity genes and haemosporidian parasites (Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon). Selection analysis was conducted using FUBAR and SLAC methods, whereas GLM regression was employed to explore the correlation between MHC genes and haemosporidian parasites. Despite geographical and ecological differences, nucleotide and haplotype diversities were similar across all populations. Most frequent haplotypes were found to be shared by both red-spotted (L. s. svecica) and white-spotted (L. s. cyanecula) bluethroat subspecies. The \"insular\" Krkono[s]e population, despite being biogeographically peripheral and experiencing minor inbreeding, did not show significantly reduced immunogenetic diversity. Selection analysis revealed a higher presence of purifying selection in TLR genes and a combination of purifying and diversifying selection in the MHC gene, reflecting their evolutionary constraints and functional importance, while haemosporidian parasite pressure was not a major driver of genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

We compiled a harmonized dataset across countries for 2020 and a longitudinal series of meat production from 1961 to 2023 to quantify patterns, evaluate socioeconomic and regulatory correlates, and forecast to 2050 using a production linked proxy model. Total ABU correlated strongly with national meat output (Spearman r = 0.906, p < 0.001). ABU intensity in milligrams per kilogram meat was highly heterogeneous and showed no global association with production. Gross domestic product per capita was unrelated to total use or intensity, learning adjusted years of schooling related only weakly to intensity, and legal controls on use or sales alone did not improve efficiency. Projections indicate a near linear rise of about 1,663 tonnes per year, reaching 131,828 tonnes in 2030 and 165,094 tonnes in 2050, with cumulative use in 2020 to 2050 surpassing 1950 to 2020. Reducing intensity by ten to fifty percent by 2050 would avert 16,509 to 82,548 tonnes. Findings motivate an integrated roadmap of source control, farm and market stewardship, and scalable surveillance using production as a proxy within a One Health framework.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}

R.; LAIZ-CARRION, R.", "abstract": "Maternal effects play a fundamental role in shaping early larval growth and survival in marine fishes. This study explores the relationship between maternal trophic ecology and larval growth in bluefin tunas, with a focus on Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) and an expanded dataset from multiple Atlantic Bluefin Tuna populations incorporated into the General Bluefin Model (GBM). Daily growth and stable isotopes ({delta}15N and {delta}13C) were obtained from 80 pre-flexion SBT larvae and 355 pre-flexion larvae from the GBM dataset. Results revealed a significant negative linear trend between larval age and {delta}15N values, consistent with the gradual attenuation of maternally inherited isotopic signatures during development. Faster growing larvae had higher growth rates showed significantly lower {delta}15N and {delta}13C values, indicating that maternal trophic behaviour and their prey sources critically influence larval growth potential. Maternal isotopic niche breadth, inferred from larval isotope data, was markedly narrower in groups with optimal larval growth, suggesting that specialized (stenophagous) maternal feeding strategies promote enhanced offspring performance. These patterns were observed consistently in two bluefin species across seven different populations, despite geographic and temporal variability, highlighting a robust ecological link between maternal foraging behaviour and larval development. From these findings, we introduce the hypothesis of an Optimal Maternal Feeding Isotopic Niche, representing a constrained isotopic range associated with increased larval growth and survival. This framework advances our understanding of the influence of maternal trophic ecology on offspring fitness and offers valuable insights for the conservation and management of highly migratory pelagic species with complex reproductive strategies.", "date": "2025-09-07", "journal": ""}
