Here we show that the ErbB3 receptor sorts internalised Integrin {beta}1, and the transferrin receptor (TfR), for endocytic recycling, in a manner that does not require ligand-induced ErbB3 signaling in breast epithelial cells. Loss of ErbB3 abrogates recycling of Integrin {beta}1, likely from a Rab4-positive compartment, and redirects it toward lysosomal degradation and secretion as extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo. ErbB3 depletion impairs the collective migration of breast epithelial cell sheets, coinciding with reduced cell surface levels of Integrin {beta}1 and increased release of Integrin {beta}1-containing EVs. In contrast, EVs secreted from ErbB3-depleted cells enhance the motility of wild-type cells. Mechanistically, ErbB3 promotes assembly of the Arf6-GGA3-Rabaptin5 endosomal sorting complex to facilitate early recycling and suppress EV release. These findings provoke the notion that pseudo-RTKs play an active role in vesicular trafficking.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Activity recordings and functional interrogation of two Piezo2+ subtypes revealed distinct sensory properties and separate roles in breathing control: one regulates inspiratory time; the other regulates inspiratory flow.

M.", "abstract": "Lungs exhibit strikingly diverse epithelial architectures - from the branched airways of mammals to the sac-like lungs of lizards and the looped airways of birds. Across lineages, the pulmonary mesenchyme gives rise to smooth muscle that interacts with and shapes the underlying pulmonary epithelium. In mammals and lizards, pulmonary smooth muscle forms early and drives epithelial branching, whereas in birds it appears only after morphogenesis is largely complete. The developmental basis for this delay has remained unclear. Using comparative single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and imaging of mouse, anole, and chicken embryos, we found that smooth muscle in the chicken lung is transcriptionally similar to vascular, rather than visceral, smooth muscle. Strikingly, imaging revealed smooth muscle cells extending between the pulmonary vasculature and the epithelium, and surgical removal of these vessels prevented the formation of smooth muscle around the airways. The vascular transcription factor PITX2 was highly expressed in these cells and its knockdown markedly reduced smooth muscle differentiation. Taken together, these findings identify vascular smooth muscle as the developmental source of pulmonary smooth muscle in birds and establish PITX2 as a key regulator of this lineage transition, revealing an unexpected developmental and evolutionary link between the circulatory and respiratory systems.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

By leveraging natural variation in the Arabidopsis population, we identified heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant alleles of TARDY ASYNCHRONOUS MEIOSIS/CYCLINA1;2 (TAM). We show that TAM associates with specialised biomolecular condensates in meiotic cells under high temperatures. Through a mechanism that involves THREE DIVISION MUTANT1 (TDM1), TAM is required to maintain the translation of key meiotic cell cycle genes, including its own, thus preventing premature meiotic exit under heat stress conditions. Boosting TAM translation in heat-sensitive accessions using complementary peptides is sufficient to rescue the heat-induced defects. We propose that this mechanism can play a role in polyploidisation events and plant evolution in the context of the ongoing global climate change.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Yet, modelling ecological connectivity in cities remains challenging because landscape resistance is often based on expert judgment rather than empirical evidence, leading to varying modelling results and limited use for planning. We developed and tested a data-driven framework for empirically parametrizing resistance and movement-distance parameters in functional connectivity models from movement-proxy data - information on the presence/absence of animal movement from direct observation or camera traps. At each step, we ensured that the connectivity model reflected the behavioural and spatial properties of the observations. We applied the framework for the common blackbird (Turdus merula) in Munich, Germany. We used observations of flying blackbirds as movement-proxy data in a logistic regression framework, testing alternative combinations of resistance and movement distances. Model selection identified the parameter sets best supported by the data. The resulting parameters were validated using repeated out-of-sample validation and compared against an expert-based connectivity model. Connectivity derived from empirically estimated parameters increased the probability of observing flying blackbirds. Across repeated validations, the empirical model achieved a mean AUC of 0.76 and R2 of 0.17. It performed moderately better than the expert-based model. Depending on their height, buildings exhibited varying resistance to flying blackbirds. Results indicate that expert assessments may oversimplify urban barriers. The approach provides a transparent, reproducible framework for using movement-proxy data to derive maps of landscape resistance. It offers a step toward more data-driven urban connectivity modelling.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Still, many aspects determining its (sub-)cellular distribution, as well as its metabolic turnover, are obscure. PIN5 is a transporter that resides on the endoplasmic reticulum and is presumed to influence internal auxin homeostasis by direct sequestration and subsequent degradation. Due to its distinct expression pattern and incomplete metabolomics analyses, the exact role of PIN5 protein and the identity of downstream auxin degradation products show significant gaps. To this end, we utilized morphologically homogeneous tobacco BY-2 cell cultures. We show that the expression of Arabidopsis thaliana AtPIN5 in the BY-2 system phenocopies so-called auxin starvation defects. Moreover, we reveal that the activity of AtPIN5 leads, in extreme cases, to the broad range of processes accompanying programmed cell death (PCD). Notably, based on the recently updated knowledge on auxin metabolism, we also show that a significant part of auxin metabolites downstream of the AtPIN5 activity are part of the re-emerged auxin decarboxylation pathway.

Here we determined, using fluid dynamic modelling, the aerodynamic capabilities of a section of the primary flight feather forming the leading edge of the split wing tip of a Jackdaw (Corvus monedula). Our findings demonstrate that the feather section exhibits a relatively high performance, with lift comparable to manmade aerofoils, however, there is a drag penalty associated with the feather shaft. The models vortex shedding behaviour shows low amplitude temporal fluctuations in lift, compared to manmade aerofoils. Notably, the aerodynamic pitch torque around the shaft varies with angle of attack. This, when combined with the built-in pitch-up twist of the feather implies a passive pitch control mechanism for the feather.

These regions carrying geometry-related signals form three parallel pathways, which we collectively refer to as \"geometry visual pathways\", starting from the primary visual cortex: the dorsal and medial pathways end in the intraparietal areas, while the ventral pathway arrives at the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus. The synchronized neural activity in the identified geometry visual pathways allows for reliable decoding of the 3D scene geometric structures. Furthermore, road types, a more abstract representation of the route geometry, are encoded in overlapping pathways, distinctly absent from early visual cortex (V1, V2, V3).

The duck sector was the most concerned by this crisis but other sectors such as broiler, layer and turkey were also affected by outbreaks. The objective of this work was to assess the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus transmission from one farm to another within the French broiler and layer production network.\n\nThis study used the WOAH risk assessment framework. After drawing up a scenario tree of virus transmission from one farm to another, data were collected through a literature review or through experts elicitation. Three questionnaires were developed according to the experts field of expertise: avian influenza, broiler and layer sectors. The experts estimates were combined using a beta distribution weighted by their confidence level. A Monte Carlo iteration process was used to combine the different probabilities of the scenario tree and to assess the transmission risk.\n\nIn the broiler sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the exposed farm was an indoor broiler farm and the source a broiler farm (indoor or free-range). The high transmission probability between broiler farms integrated within the same association suggests that integration is an important risk factor. Person movement, transport of feed and manure management were the pathways with the highest transmission probabilities between two integrated indoor broiler farms with good biosecurity levels. In the layer sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the source farm was a free-range farm and the exposed farm a production farm (indoor or free-range). The pathways with the highest transmission probabilities were egg transport and person movement. The sensitivity analysis showed that the exposed farms biosecurity had a significant impact on the transmission probability.\n\nOur results provide an insight on the role of each type of farms in the virus spread within the French broiler and layer production sectors and will be useful for the implementation of control measures such as movement restriction or vaccination.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the question of how, and indeed whether, G3BPs and SGs shape the stress translation response. We find that SGs are enriched for mRNAs that are resistant to the stress-induced translation shutdown. Although the accurate recruitment of these stress-resistant mRNAs does require the context of stress, a combination of optogenetic tools and spike-normalized ribosome profiling demonstrates that G3BPs and SGs are necessary and sufficient to both help prioritize the translation of their enriched mRNAs and help suppress cytosolic translation.

Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation.

We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, a relatively simple tissue composed mostly of epithelial cells. Transcriptomic clustering of cells collected from the wing disc generates clusters that are mainly grouped based on proximodistal cell location. To quantify heterogeneity of gene expression among clusters, we adapted a metric used to study market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Genes involved in DNA damage repair, defense against reactive oxygen species, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis are expressed relatively uniformly. In contrast, genes encoding a subset of ligands, notably cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway, some transcription factors including Ets21C, previously implicated in regeneration, and several signaling proteins are expressed more regionally. Though the radiation-responsive transcription factor p53 is expressed relatively uniformly in the wing disc, several regionally-induced genes still require p53 function, indicating that regional and radiation-induced factors combine to regulate their expression. We also examined heterogeneity within regions using a clustering approach based on cell cycle gene expression. A subpopulation of cells, characterized by high levels of tribbles expression, is amplified in irradiated discs. Remarkably, this subpopulation accounts for a considerable fraction of radiation-induced gene expression, indicating that cellular responses are non-uniform even within regions.

K.; Kistemaker, D. A.", "abstract": "Stabilizing bipedal gait is mechanically challenging. To analyze how gait is stabilized, previous studies have focused on the control of the body center of mass (CoM). These studies often linked deviations in linear momentum of the CoM to subsequent shifts in position of the center of pressure (CoP), or of the foot, relative to the COM, and interpreted these as stabilizing responses to correct linear CoM momentum. Mechanically, however, CoP shifts do not cause changes of linear CoM momentum, whereas they do cause changes in whole-body angular momentum. We hypothesize that the experimentally observed shifts are a related to the need to control both linear and whole-body angular momentum. We show that, in human walking, linear and angular momentum follow quasi-periodic functions with similar periodicity and phase. Combining the equations of linear and rotational motion for a system of linked rigid segments shows that, in this case, the horizontal distance between CoP and CoM is a good predictor of horizontal forces in the corresponding direction. This suggests that linear and angular momentum are simultaneously controlled and may explain the success of preceding studies that correlated CoM states to CoP or foot locations. Regression models fitted to experimental data of participants walking at normal and slow speeds, showed that deviations in horizontal ground reaction forces and in moments of the ground reaction force about the sagittal and transverse axes could be predicted from deviations in the preceding linear and angular momentum respectively. Our analyses support that linear and angular momentum are indeed controlled simultaneously in human walking.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Current biomarkers inadequately stratify patients for therapy selection, monitoring, and early detection of progression. The FOXO transcription factors and Tribbles pseudokinases, key regulators of the PI3K/AKT pathway, have been implicated in cancer progression but their prognostic value in gliomas is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether transcriptional profiles of FOXO and Tribbles family members predict survival in glioma patients better than established biomarkers. Methods: Using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 705) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA, n = 1018), along with microarray datasets (REMBRANDT, n = 552; Gravendeel, n = 268), we analyzed mRNA levels of FOXO1/3/4/6 and TRIB1/2/3. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and concordance indices. Gene expression differences across tumor grades and molecular subgroups were assessed using Student's t-test. Results: High FOXO1 and low FOXO3/4 mRNA levels, combined with elevated TRIB1/2/3 expression, formed a signature significantly associated with worse survival across all cohorts. This signature stratifies grade 4 gliomas, with a median survival difference of 4.5 months.

To help address this, the study has developed an open-source tool called BARMIE (Binding Affinity Ranking at the Molecular Initiating Event) to rapidly predict the chemical binding affinity of steroid receptor proteins to synthetic steroids, and, when combined with an in vitro transactivation assay, to identify novel endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). BARMIE was used to screen 163 teleost fish glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) for binding to the natural ligand cortisol and to 10 synthetic glucocorticoid drugs (GCs) designed to interact within the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of GRs. GC halcinonide was predicted to have the most significant binding affinity, and species from the superorder Protacanthopterygii were identified as having high-affinity GRs. BARMIE was then used to screen the binding profiles to compounds of the Medicine for Malaria Venture Global Health Priority Box to rainbow trout GRs (rtGR1 and rtGR2). Of the 178 compounds, 24 and 36 bound within the LBP with an affinity [&ge;] -7.5 kcal/mol to the rtGR1 and rtGR2, respectively. For 30 of these compounds, transactivation activity was assessed at 1micromole in the presence or absence of 1micromole cortisol. Compound #18, a 1,2,4-oxadiazole, a compound known to have biological activities, significantly stimulated both rtGR1 and rtGR2, as well as enhanced the activity in the presence of cortisol, and compound #14, a predicted IL-1R-associated kinase four inhibitor (IRAK4) inhibitor, had antagonist properties in both receptors.

A.; Parr, C. L.; Redeker, K. R.; Robinson, E. J. H.", "abstract": "Landscape structure modulates species dispersal by presenting barriers or opportunities. Slow-dispersing edge specialists, e.g. the northern hairy wood ant (Formica lugubris), are likely to be most affected by topography and land management practices, because they require adjacent contrasting habitats, e.g. to access both food and sunlight. In managed forests, canopy gaps are often linear and anthropogenic, such as paths, firebreaks, and roads (collectively  rides), and their orientation determines shade distribution. Using data spanning 10 years, we ask how ride orientation and width affect the distribution and dispersal of three F. lugubris populations in the North York Moors, UK. Ride orientation clearly affected nest abundance, with a higher nest density on rides oriented north-south (N-S) or east-west (E-W) (cardinal directions) than on those oriented NE-SW or NW-SE (intercardinal directions). Conforming to predictions based on sunlight availability, N-S oriented rides were occupied more symmetrically than E-W ones, where the north side was used predominantly. Nests were generally larger on narrower rides. Ride orientation also clearly affected dispersal: wood ants dispersed c15 m/year along rides oriented in cardinal directions, compared with only c5 m/year on rides oriented intercardinally. Our results show that ride characteristics (width, orientation), resulting directly from forestry practices, influence the distribution and dispersal of an ecosystem engineer woodland species; this may also apply to other forest-edge specialists. As wood ants can suppress defoliating pests, these findings could benefit forest management; forest planners could encourage wood ant colonisation of plantation forest by ensuring linear features contribute to north-south and east-west connectivity.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

How this diversity emerges during development remains an open question. The rarity of individual inhibitory neuron types often leads to their underrepresentation in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets, limiting insights into their developmental trajectories. To address this problem, we developed a computational pipeline to enrich and integrate rare cell types across multiple datasets. Applying this approach to somatostatin-expressing (SST+) inhibitory neurons - the most diverse inhibitory cell class in the cortex - we constructed the Dev-SST RNAmaps, a comprehensive resource containing mouse transcriptomic data of over 51,000 SST+ neurons. We identify three principal groups : Martinotti cells (MCs), non-Martinotti cells (nMCs), and long-range projecting neurons (LRPs), each following distinct diversification trajectories. MCs commit early, with distinct embryonic and neonatal clusters that map directly to adult counterparts. In contrast, nMCs diversify gradually, with each developmental cluster giving rise to multiple adult cell types. LRPs follow a unique 'contracting' mode. Initially, two clusters are present until postnatal day 5 (P5), but by P7, one type is eliminated through programmed cell death, leaving a single surviving population. This transient LRP type is also found in the fetal human cortex, revealing an evolutionarily conserved feature of cortical development. Together, these findings highlight three distinct modes of SST+ neuronal diversification - invariant, expanding, and contracting - offering a new framework to understand how the large repertoire of inhibitory neurons emerges during development.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

We previously showed through whole-genome sequencing of tumors from CAR-T-treated patients that deletions of RHOA (3p21.31) are enriched in cases progressing after treatment. The role of RHOA in resistance and pathogenesis are poorly defined, despite loss-of-function alterations that occur in ~20% of newly diagnosed large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) cases. We created RHOA-deficient LBCL systems and confirmed cell-intrinsic loss of response to CAR-19 in vitro and in vivo driven by CD19 downregulation. Impact on CD19, however, was variable and would not explain selection for RHOA deletion in newly diagnosed cases. We therefore created RHOA-deficient tumors in immunocompetent mice and found remarkable correlation with dysfunctional lymphoma microenvironment (LME) signatures in CAR-19 resistant patients. These LMEs are marked by a type 1-like immune infiltrate with terminally exhausted CD8 T cells, Th1-like CD4 cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and increased production of interferon gamma (IFNg). RHOA-deficient tumor cells themselves have significantly impaired IFNg; responses, providing resistance to CD8 T cell clearance by way of diminished induction of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I). These findings support a model that depletion of healthy effector populations by RHOA-deficient lymphoma is a key driver of immune dysfunction thwarting CAR-19 clinical responses. Overall, we describe for the first time how a single-gene alteration found recurrently in CAR-19-resistant LBCL contributes to treatment failures.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

This pattern held across oral and systemic infection routes and was conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans where the non-pathogenic Orsay virus produced negligible aging acceleration. Pathway analysis indicated a systemic impact across aging hallmarks with virus- and tissue-specific signatures.

To be useful, a qAOP should be chemical-agnostic. However, existing qAOP studies often pool multi-chemical data without adequately addressing inter-chemical heterogeneity. Consequently, fundamental pathway relationships become obscured by heterogeneity-induced noise, thereby compromising the reliability of chemical-agnostic predictions. We developed a chemical-agnostic calibration approach to addresses this challenge by leveraging hierarchical structures to systematically separate chemical-specific heterogeneity from underlying pathway effects. Through this methodological framework, chemical-specific deviations are explicitly modeled as random effects, enabling the extraction of pathway-level parameters that represent core mechanistic relationships independent of individual chemical properties. Through simulation studies across varying heterogeneity levels, we demonstrate that performance differences between models with and without hierarchical calibration reveal the magnitude of heterogeneity in the data. Moreover, when heterogeneity is substantial, an uncalibrated qAOP should not be considered truly chemical-agnostic in practice, as it confounds pathway-level effects with chemical-specific variation. We demonstrated the application of this calibration approach through a case study of non-mutagenic liver tumor. The framework proposed in this study enhances qAOP generalizability while preserving the chemical-agnostic principle, supporting robust NAMs-based next-generation risk assessments.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

It is well established that different CMT2A alleles expressed in mitofusin deficient cells can exhibit varying levels of fusion activity. However, most CMT2A mutations are dominant. Therefore, to picture the complexity of CMT2A pathogenesis, it is crucial to define whether and how different fusion activity levels translate into different dominant properties. To explore the range of dominant properties among CMT2A alleles, we modelled in drosophila fourteen missense mutations reported in patients. We studied alleles from different mutation hotspots identified in MFN2 protein structure, alleles causing severe or mild forms of CMT2A, or alleles with different level of dominance in patients. Mitochondrial architecture analysis revealed a wide spectrum of composite dominant effects of variable expressivity. Fusion-inhibition and aggregation properties were found in mutants affecting catalytic motifs and hydrophobic cores, and exacerbation of mitochondrial fusion in mutants targeting domain interface. In these mutant categories, mitochondrial cytoplasmic distribution was disturbed to varying degrees that strongly correlate with neurotoxicity levels. Inhomogeneity of mitochondrial repartition was indeed associated with decreased endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrion overlap, reduced mitochondrial content at neuromuscular junctions, higher locomotor deficits in flies and higher disease severity in patients. At the molecular scale, most CMT2A mutant proteins showed reduced ubiquitination and increased protein level, likely amplifying their dominant properties. Thus, CMT2A mutations induce a broad spectrum of fusion alterations converging towards altered mitochondrial distribution and mutant Mfn accumulation.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

The premise of these models is that they leverage this biological and chemical information to predict synergy measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that replacing drug and cell line representations with simple one-hot encodings results in comparable or even slightly improved performance across diverse published drug combination models. This unexpected finding suggests that current models use these representations primarily as identifiers and exploit covariation in the synergy labels.

Clonality is particularly common in harsh environments and at the margins of species ranges, where it supports persistence, enables rapid growth, and promotes the maintenance of locally adapted genotypes. In the rapidly changing Arctic, increasing ecological connectivity is eroding historical barriers for sessile species. Evaluating genetic diversity in this context, before global change further alters Arctic ocean, is essential for understanding evolutionary dynamics during range expansion and for informing conservation strategies.\n\nAulactinia stella is a circumpolar sea anemone with physiological characteristics in laboratory conditions suggesting a potential for clonal reproduction. In this study, we investigated its reproductive modes in natural populations across the Arctic ocean, from the northern Pacific to the Atlantic, and examined how genetic diversity is structured between adults and juveniles at five sampled sites.\n\nAcross all study sites, we observed only females or individuals lacking gonads, with the exception of Kamchatka, where males were also present. Genetic indices and changes in genotype frequencies between adults and juveniles confirmed that this species reproduces partially by parthenogenesis. Populations on the Atlantic side were highly clonal with clonal rates (c) estimated at 80-99%, whereas populations on the Pacific side reproduced more sexually (c around 50%). Allelic diversity was twice as high in Kamchatka and Kuril populations, suggesting North Pacific coasts being the main last glacial refugia of A. stella. We found a stepping-stone pattern of genetic structure from Kamchatka to Atlantic populations, consistent with contemporary ocean currents and melted summer sea ice. Only a subset of the juvenile genetic diversity, mostly of local origin, was found in the established adults, while juveniles exhibited lower levels of genetic differentiation across the Arctic Ocean. Our findings underscore the need for further ecological and behavioral investigations to elucidate the mechanisms allowing the current possibilities of dispersal of this species across the Arctic Ocean.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/650399v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b4ef2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c24dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147f4e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11da803_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract (photo: Ekaterina Bocharova)\n\nC_FIG", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

IFN-gamma producing CD4+ T cells are necessary but insufficient for protection against infection. In humans, the development of IL-17A producing Th17 T cells correlates with protection, however not all individuals develop a Th17 response. In mice, experimental vaccines can elicit protective Th17 cells, yet Th17s are rare in primary infection. Why Mtb fails to consistently elicit Th17s is unknown. Here, we identify factors suppressing Th17 responses during primary infection. We demonstrate that the lack of Th17 induction is independent of route and duration. Next, using Tbet deficient mice, we show that Mtb drives a Th1 response that is only partially protective and limits Th17 cell production in an IFN-{gamma} independent manner. We further reveal that the ESX-1 type VII alternative secretion system and lipid PDIM suppresses Th17 responses. Infection with ESX-1 or PDIM mutants results in significantly increased Th17 T cells and IL-17A cytokine in the lungs, and infection of IL-17A deficient animals partially restores virulence of ESX-1 and PDIM mutants. Although the ESX-1 secretion system and lipid PDIM elicits type I IFN, which can suppress Th17 differentiation, we find that suppression of Th17 is independent of type I IFN. Instead, ESX-1 and PDIM suppresses production of IL-23, a cytokine that promotes Th17 differentiation, in dendritic cells found in mediastinal lymph nodes during Mtb infection.

Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations. NBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian versions of NBDA have been proposed before, although these implementations have seen limited usage and have not kept pace with the evolving ecosystem of Bayesian methods. There is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA. Here, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package \"STbayes\" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for covariates that may influence transmission, and varying (random) effects. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals can improve model fit. Our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules, and we describe a numerically stable parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission.

We evaluate this approach retrospectively on a new dataset of 60,000 chemically diverse compounds from ZINC-22 targeting the MCL1 protein using both AutoDock Vina and MMGBSA. Our results show that incorporating MMGBSA scores into the active learning loop significantly enhances performance, recovering 79.9% of the top 1% binders in the whole dataset, compared to only 6.7% when using docking scores alone. Notably, MMGBSA exhibits a stronger correlation with experimental binding affinities than AutoDock Vina on our dataset and enables more accurate ranking of candidate compounds in a runtime efficient way. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a one-at-a-time acquisition active learning strategy consistently outperforms traditional batched acquisition, the latter achieving just 78.4% recovery with MolFormer and Bayesian Ridge. These findings underscore the potential of integrating deep learning-based molecular representations with MD-level accuracy in an active learning framework, offering a scalable and efficient path to accelerate virtual screening and improve hit identification in drug discovery.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by mutations in the SPG11 gene is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lysosome dysfunction, which also presents neurodevelopmental alterations. Using knockout mouse and cortical organoid models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that lysosome dysfunction caused by SPG11 mutations decreases the proliferation of neural progenitor cells at early stages of cortical development. At the cellular level, SPG11 mutations cause accumulation of calcium in lysosomes, which reduces proliferation of neural progenitor cells and diminishes apical tight junctions. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that these phenotypes in SPG11 organoids are caused by hypoactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. The latter is a consequence of lysosomal recruitment of the enzyme PI4K2A (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 alpha) resulting in higher levels of its product PI(4)P (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate), a described regulator of the mTOR pathway. Modulating the function of the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1 successfully corrected all developmental phenotypes in cortical organoids, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal calcium in signaling during the early phase of cortical development.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

We combined expression mapping, behavioral assays, and phylogenetic comparisons to investigate its function. RH7 detects light-on and light-off transitions, modulates contrast, motion, and brightness perception, and contributes to circadian clock synchronization. Flies lacking RH7 are less active during the dark phase, while strains with constitutively active protein show increased activity. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that RH7 is an ancient rhodopsin present across panarthropods, representing an intermediate between G protein-coupled receptors and specialized rhodopsins, highlighting a key step in the evolution of non-visual light perception.

Identifying biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience to stress would facilitate a prevention-based approach to mental illness that benefits individuals and reduces healthcare costs. The present study adopted a multivariate machine-learning approach to track neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model. 96 male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent two sessions of MRI and behavioral tests, before and after CRS. Resilience and vulnerability to CRS were assessed with elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Hierarchical clustering was applied to construct brain networks. Partial correlation was used to compute network connectivity. Repeated nested cross validation with a support vector machine was employed to identify rs-fMRI biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following CRS. No strong group effect size of behavioral changes following CRS was observed within the same animals, suggesting the presence of resilient and vulnerable subgroups. Although the average model performance was modest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.3 ~ 0.67), baseline functional connectivity across cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, prefrontal and salience-orbitofrontal regions, as well as functional alteration across hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal regions, auditory thalamus, cerebellum, inferior colliculi and brainstem were identified as stable features.

Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of mutant exon 1 protein (HTT1a) may be critical to HD pathogenesis, but the relation of this to differential regional and cellular vulnerability in HD is unknown. Objective. We assessed the contribution of the accumulation of the mutant huntingtin HTT1a to the regional and cellular variation in HD brain pathology by determining if more vulnerable regions and neuron types were relatively enriched. Methods. We performed immunolabeling using the novel monoclonal antibodies 11G2 and 1B12 against the C-terminal proline 90 (P90) neoepitope of huntingtin HTT1a, which detect accumulation of monomeric, oligomeric and aggregated mutant HTT1a, on forebrain of Q175 and R6/2 mice and human HD cases. Results. Diffuse nuclear and aggregate immunolabeling increased in abundance in Q175 with age, with striatal projection neurons showing immunolabeling earlier than cortical neurons, and only neuropil immunolabeling prominent in pallidal regions. Nonetheless, some regions less affected in HD, such as hippocampus, were rich in mutant HTT1a as well. In humans, striatal immunolabeling was sparser than in mouse, and mainly in the neuropil, but sparser in striatal target areas. In human HD cortex, the P90 antibodies detected predominantly neuropil aggregates, which appeared to, in part, localize to dendrites. Immunostaining in mouse and human could be blocked with HTT1a target peptide, demonstrating antibody specificity. Conclusions. Our results indicate that mutant HTT1a burden appears to partly account for overall differential forebrain regional vulnerability in HD, but additional factors may contribute to vulnerability differences among forebrain regions and between specific neuron types.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

We previously reported that significant behavioral regression in a small cohort with SHANK3 haploinsufficiency patients, triggered by subclinical infections, responded to immunomodulator treatments. We hypothesize that behavioral regression results from the interplay between SHANK3 deficiency and neuroinflammation. Using Shank3 exon 4-22 deletion heterozygous mutant (Sh3+/-) mouse, which shows no significant behavior impairments, we established a preclinical model - Shank3 haploinsufficiency mouse undergoing systemic inflammation challenge via intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We found that, two weeks after LPS challenge, wild-type mice (WT) recovered but Sh3+/- mice exhibited motor impairment, anxiety-like behaviors, and excessive grooming, similar to Shank3 exon 4-22 deletion homozygous mutants. Anti-inflammatory treatment partially reversed LPS-induced behavioral changes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of neuroinflammation-related genes and downregulation of synaptic function-related genes in Sh3+/- mice in response to LPS. Especially, pro-inflammatory genes and microglia markers were overly activated that may result from the increased toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in Sh3+/- mice. Microglia overactivation elevated synapse engulfment and disrupted synaptic protein may underlie LPS-triggered worsen behavior phenotypes in Sh3+/- mice.

CTG activation in malignant cells was closely linked to epigenetic regulation, with chromatin remodelers ARID4B and YEATS2 playing pivotal roles. Malignant cells consistently expressed a greater number of CTGs across cancer types, which led us to develop a computational pipeline for rapid malignancy annotation.

I build upon a spatially-explicit phenotypic model that I have previously presented. The model incorporates both phenotypic sorting and gene swamping, and is used to study constant advective dispersal and trait-based habitat choice. Through analytical arguments on characteristic lengths and speeds, as well as by direct numerical solutions, I find that, in eco-evo scenarios, advective dispersal has two opposing effects on invasion fronts. In shallow environmental gradients, the demographic effect of simply adding to the steady-state invasion speed dominates. As gradients get steeper, asymmetric gene flow, due to advective dispersal, becomes increasingly stronger, pulling the invasion front in an opposite direction. Steep gradients cause front reversals, where species ranges, counter-intuitively, slide upstream. Symmetry between velocity of advective dispersal and velocity of climate change leads to adaptation lags, abundance profiles, and invasion speeds that depend only on the velocity difference. Through characteristic lengths and speeds, I also identify similarity between demographic and evolutionary averaging or tracking of environmental heterogeneity. I connect climate change research to demographic models of persistence in advective environments -- the so-called drift paradox. I additionally derive dimensionless ratios that have potential in facilitating comparisons among different species, populations, traits and locales, and in guiding micro- and mesocosm experiments and space-for-time substitutions. As an aside, I demonstrate how numerical solution and simulation of complex eco-evo models can be accelerated with GPU programming.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Specifically, local variables including zone-specific dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrite concentrations and global variables including effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations contributed positively towards N2O emissions from both aerobic and anoxic zones of the process bioreactors. The optimal operational conditions identified for minimizing N2O emissions included operation of aerobic and anoxic zones at DO < 4 mg O2 L-1 and < 1 mg O2 L-1, respectively, coupled with appropriate solids retention times (SRTs) that maximize process performance.

This study investigates the temporal dynamics of cholesterol esters using the Plp1-iCKO-Myrf mouse model, which features distinct phases of demyelination and remyelination. Our findings reveal that cholesterol ester levels increased with demyelination in both the brain and the spinal cord. In the brain, cholesterol esters declined to normal levels during remyelination, whereas cholesterol esters remained elevated in the spinal cord, which had limited remyelination. Expression of both acetyl-CoA-acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were elevated during demyelination, suggesting the potential involvement of both proteins in the formation of cholesterol esters. Co-localization studies revealed that ACAT1 is predominantly expressed by microglia and LCAT is predominantly expressed by astrocytes during demyelination highlighting the active roles of glia cells in cholesterol ester metabolism.

We found that birds became hormonally aroused in the dark long before initiating dawn singing, and that suppression of spontaneous singing by darkness enhanced their intrinsic motivation to sing. This elevated motivation subsequently triggered a rebound of intensive singing at dawn. Moreover, dawn singing accelerated refinement of song structure, supporting its role as intensive vocal exercise to optimize song performance after overnight silence.

Here, we identified SPD-2, the conserved homolog of human CEP192, as a substrate of APC/CFZR-1. We show that loss of APC/CFZR-1 increases both cellular and centrosomal SPD-2 levels, and that SPD-2 physically associates with FZR-1 in vivo. Functional analyses of canonical D-box motifs reveal that D-box1, D-box2, and D-box3 each contribute to SPD-2 degradation, each with different functional consequences. Mutation of D-box3 alone partially rescued zyg-1 mutant phenotypes by restoring centrosome duplication and embryonic viability through increased centrosomal SPD-2 and ZYG-1.

These substrates vary in their structural and chemical properties, potentially altering the composition and function of associated microbial communities. Here, we combine semi-natural microcosm experiments with compound-specific isotope analysis of essential amino acids to assess how variation in fruit substrate and symbiont origin affect larval nutrition, development, and adult phenotypes. We find that microbial community composition and environmental context jointly shape amino acid flow, with larvae deriving variable proportions of their nutrition from plant, bacterial, and fungal sources. These differences translate into distinct developmental outcomes, including shifts in larval development time - either delayed or accelerated, depending on the symbiont-substrate combination - and significant variation in adult body weight. Our findings introduce symbiont-environment interactions as a framework for understanding how ecological context shapes nutritional mutualisms, showing that environmental heterogeneity can alter microbial composition, nutrient sources, and larval performance.

In early 2022, the FDA approved Ganaxolone (Commercial name: Ztalmy) for treatment of seizures in CDD patients 2 years and older. Ganaxolone has been reported to act as a GABAA receptor agonist that helps reduce neuronal excitability; however, based on its chemical structure we hypothesized that ganaxolone may also act as a PTP1B inhibitor. We observed that ganaxalone was able to inhibit PTP1B activity both in an in vitro assay of enzyme activity and in different cell models, in a comparable way to known inhibitors of PTP1B, including MSI-1436, which has a similar chemical structure. Additionally, inhibition of PTP1B in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells increased TRKB/BDNF signaling. This effect was prominent in CDKL5-KO cells, where inhibition of PTP1B brought TRKB levels and BDNF signaling to levels similar to those of wild-type cells and the observed signaling changes also coincided with restoration of cellular morphology. Finally, loss of CDKL5 function resulted in increased levels of PTP1B.

Prior work has emphasized peripheral blood or murine models, leaving a gap in how plastic Th programs coexist and evolve in the human intestinal niche in IBD. We profiled CD4+ T cells from ileocolonoscopic biopsies and paired blood of IBD patients and non-IBD controls, combining spectral flow cytometry with functional assays and histology to map subset composition, activation, and spatial relationships across disease activity states. Here we show that IBD exhibits a dynamic, tissue-embedded CD4+ landscape, characterized by inflammatory expansion, regulatory-Th17 plasticity, branched trajectories toward regulatory and resident fates, coordinated CD4-CD8 networks, and context-dependent cytokine suppression, collectively shaping aberrant mucosal immunity. Specifically, inflamed mucosa harbored a marked expansion of CD4+ T cells that contracted in remission. Unbiased t-SNE-based analysis revealed several Th populations and linked a ROR{gamma}t+ compartment with enhanced T-bet expression to the progression of inflammation. Foxp3 cells co-expressing ROR{gamma}t also emerged within the inflamed niche, indicating regulatory-Th17 plasticity. Trajectory visualization revealed a potential branched differentiation path towards either a regulatory phenotype or a tissue-resident phenotype, with both termini expressing activation/proliferation markers. Correlation network analysis connected pro-inflammatory CD4+ states to T-bet+ and Granzyme-B+ CD8+ subsets, indicative of crosstalk between helper and cytotoxic lineages. Histology corroborated this organization, showing frequent interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ tissue-resident cells in the lamina propria and epithelial border. In functional assays, TCR stimulation during active disease revealed broad suppression of CD4+ pro-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with expansion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Conversely, a memory Th subset co-expressing HLA-DR and CD38 retained multifunctionality, producing elevated levels of IFN{gamma}, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-10. Together, these results provide insight into how regulatory-effector plasticity, tissue residency, and CD4-CD8 coordination structure the human intestinal immune landscape in IBD, providing a rational for therapies to rebalance resident and regulatory programs while preserving beneficial memory responses.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Understanding how key physiological traits respond to drought and heat is essential for ensuring grassland function under future conditions. Here, we investigated intraspecific variation in leaf cuticular traits--specifically minimum cuticular conductance after stomatal closure (gmin) and its response to temperature--in six Australian accessions of Themeda triandra spanning a wide climatic gradient. We asked whether gmin and its response to drought reflect climate-of-origin and whether the cuticle shows a thermal threshold (Tp) beyond which conductance rises sharply.\nC_LIO_LIMethods: Plants from six accessions were grown under well-watered (control) glasshouse conditions and then exposed to drought. We measured gmin in both control and drought treatments and assessed the response of gmin to increasing temperature (30-55 {degrees}C) using fresh fully hydrated leaves (control). Climatic data for each site of origin were used to explore trait-environment relationships.\nC_LIO_LIKey results: Under well-watered conditions, gmin showed no link to climate-of-origin. Under drought, however, gmin displayed clearer climate-linked patterns: accessions from cooler, wetter regions had lower values, contrary to expectations. Drought responses varied strongly among accessions, ranging from marked reductions to significant increases in gmin. With increasing temperature, gmin declined gradually and no accession exhibited a distinct phase transition, indicating a thermally stable cuticle.\nC_LIO_LIConclusions: Themeda triandra shows considerable intraspecific diversity in gmin and its response to drought. The clearer alignment between climate of origin and gmin measured under drought conditions suggests drought stress is an important filter for gmin expression. These findings provide a physiological basis for identifying genotypes with enhanced resilience for use in grassland conservation and restoration under a warming, drying climate.\nC_LI", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Inspired by recent advances in benchmarking for computer vision and large language models, where systematic evaluation has catalysed rapid progress, we introduce MolGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to close the gap between molecular generation algorithms and tangible drug discovery outcomes. MolGenBench integrates a structurally diverse, large-scale dataset spanning 120 protein targets, 5,433 chemical series comprising 220,005 experimentally confirmed active molecules. Beyond conventional de novo generation, it incorporates a dedicated hit-to-lead (H2L) optimization scenario, which represents a critical phase in hit optimization that is seldom evaluated in existing benchmarks. We further introduce novel, pharmaceutically grounded metrics that assess a model's ability to both rediscover target-specific actives or progressively optimize compounds for potency.

The gut is a major Klebsiella reservoir and gut colonization is a risk factor for developing an extraintestinal Klebsiella infection. Patients can be colonized by multiple Klebsiella strains or even species in the gut simultaneously, and there is high concordance between the gut colonizing- and infection causing- strains. The detection and characterization of colonizing strains is critical for a better understanding of the progression to infection and for developing interventions for colonized patients. However, the association between mixed or mono-colonization and subsequent infection is unknown. In this study, we developed an amplicon-based sequencing method called wzi-Seq that enables the detection and quantification of Klebsiella strains from complex samples and mixtures using the conserved capsule gene wzi as a molecular barcode. This method is highly accurate and precise with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 99.8% in mixtures containing as many as 58 unique wzi types. The assay was validated analytically and applied to an established case and control cohort. We determined that 63.2% (108/171) patients were mono-colonized with a single Klebsiella strain while 36.8% (63/171) had mixed colonization with multiple Klebsiella strains.

Patterns of cfDNA fragmentation can provide useful information about gene regulation and expression in human disease from a blood draw. Here, we demonstrate that enhancer RNA expression - a marker of enhancer activity - can be inferred from local patterns of cfDNA fragmentation. We define a transcriptional activation score (TAS) that predicts expression of enhancers and genes based on cfDNA fragment sizes and positions near transcriptional start sites (TSSs). The TAS identifies activity of cancer-associated enhancers in patients with cancer, distinguishes clinically relevant cancer subtypes, and identifies activation of enhancers associated with treatment resistance and therapy response. We propose a simple model to account for our findings based on chromatin fiber structure and the depletion of H1 histone proteins near active TSSs.

Despite their importance, our understanding of how kinase domains and their variants impact protein stability, catalytic activity, and substrate recognition is incomplete. In this work, we develop the phosphorylation protein complementation assay (phospho-PCA), which enables quantitative measurements of kinase-substrate interactions by coupling them to the growth of bud- ding yeast, thereby enabling deep mutational scanning of kinase domains. When combined with deep mutational scans targeting folding stability and Bayesian modeling, phospho-PCA can disentangle the relative impact of mutations on kinase domain stability, catalytic activity, and substrate specificity. We demonstrate the accuracy and breadth of phospho-PCA, showing its applicability to both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase domains. We then apply our method to three closely related protein kinases with distinct substrate preferences, evaluating over 15,000 kinase variants against a panel of three sub- strates for both catalytic activity and substrate specificity. The resulting dataset constitutes the largest and most detailed variant-to-function map assembled for this enzyme family to date, revealing numerous mutations that alter kinase activity and substrate specificity. Physics-based modeling reveals how these mutations operate through diverse mechanisms, including long-range allosteric communication, to alter both activity and substrate specificity.

Here we show that a Rac1-GAP-based variant of Synaptic Chemogenetics (SYNCit-C, SynC), selectively and reversibly abolishes spine enlargement after administration of an A/C heterodimeriser, while preserving cellular excitability and NMDA-receptor function. Visual cortical responses were preserved, whereas motor learning in the motor cortex was impaired. With broad frontoparietal expression of SynC, A/C administration induced reversible deficits in goal-directed behaviours, including laser-dot chasing and feeding initiation. It also induced intermittent State-C, a state outside canonical wake and sleep, marked by behavioural arrest with reduced {gamma}-power and a muted rise in slow {delta}-waves during these episodes.

While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve survival, many individuals, especially older patients, are ineligible. Prior immunotherapies have not reliably induced effective anti-leukemic immunity and have been associated with severe and unpredictable toxicities. Thus, there is a need for safe and effective therapies that reduce relapse and increase overall survival (OS). We have developed a universally applicable, patient-specific, lentivirally engineered autologous AML cell vaccine, TriLeukeVax (TLV), designed to stimulate leukemia-specific cytolytic immune responses in AML patients in remission. To generate TLV, AML cells are engineered to express the highly synergistic combination of the co-stimulatory protein CD80 and the IL-15/IL-15-receptor alpha (IL-15R) heterodimer. Prior proof-of-concept (POC) studies demonstrated eradication of disease in >80% of leukemic mice with serial administration of TLV. In the current studies, TLV was generated from 59/60 cryopreserved, diagnostic bone marrow-derived patient AML samples. Ex vivo priming of post-remission patient T-cells by ex vivo co-culture with autologous TLV stimulated robust proliferative and cytotoxic responses. In secondary co-cultures, T-cells previously primed by initial co-culture with TLV, showed greater clonal expansion and leukemia-specific cytolytic activity towards de novo autologous AML blasts than did control, unprimed T-cells.

C.; Morielli, A. D.", "abstract": "The voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.2 plays a key role in the central nervous system and mutations in Kv1.2 leads to neurological disorders such as epilepsies and ataxias. In the cerebellum regulation of Kv1.2 is coupled to learning and memory. We have previously shown that blocking Kv1.2 by infusing its specific inhibitor Tityustoxin-k (TsTX) into the lobulus simplex of the cerebellum facilitates eyeblink conditioning (EBC) and that EBC modulates Kv1.2 surface expression in cerebellar interneurons. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 is required for EBC although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We have previously shown that infusion of the mGluR1 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) into the lobulus simplex of the cerebellum mimics the faciliatory effect of TsTX on EBC. We therefore hypothesize that mGluR1 could act, in part, through suppression of Kv1.2. Earlier studies have shown that Kv1.2 suppression involves channel tyrosine phosphorylation and its endocytocytic removal from the cell surface. In this study we report that an excitatory chemical stimulus (50mM K+-100{micro}M glutamate) applied to cerebellar slices enhanced Kv1.2 tyrosine phosphorylation and that this increase was lessened in the presence of the mGluR1 inhibitor YM298198. More direct evidence for mGluR1 modulation of Kv1.2 comes from our finding that selective activation of mGluR1 with DHPG reduced the amount of Kv1.2 detected by cell surface biotinylation in cerebellar slices. To determine the molecular pathways involved we used an unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify Kv1.2-protein interactions that are modulated by mGluR1. Among the interactions enhanced by DHPG were those with PKC-{gamma}, CaMKII and Gq/G11, each of which had been shown in other studies to co-immunoprecipitate with mGluR1 and contribute to its signaling. Of particular note was the interaction between Kv1.2 and PKC-{gamma} since in HEK cells and hippocampal neurons Kv1.2 endocytosis is elicited by PKC activation. Here we show that activation of PKCs with PMA reduced surface Kv1.2, while the PKC inhibitor Go6983 attenuated the reduction in surface Kv1.2 levels elicited by DHPG, suggesting that the mechanism by which mGluR1 modulates cerebellar Kv1.2 likely involves PKC.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we established an in planta proximity labeling approach using miniTurbo-based biotinylation in Arabidopsis thaliana to capture proteins associated with phyB photobodies during early de-etiolation. Mass spectrometry identified 42 high-confidence proximal proteins, including 11 known core components and 31 previously unrecognized photobody-associated proteins. Among these, the co-chaperone HOP1 forms light-dependent nuclear condensates that partially co-localize with phyB photobodies. HOP1 condensates are smaller in the wild-type background than in phyB-overexpressing seedlings, and HOP1 overexpression enhanced cotyledon expansion under red light. These findings suggest that HOP1 contributes to photomorphogenesis by stabilizing phyB photobodies and sustaining active phyB signaling. Together, our results reveal that nascent large phyB photobodies function as dynamic hubs integrating chaperone-mediated protein quality control with transcriptional regulation, providing the first in planta proteomic framework for understanding photobody assembly and signaling in plants.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

From these simulations we derived dispersal kernels using five probability density functions and analysed their response to landscape context. Across species, log-normal (fat-tailed) kernels consistently best described dispersal, but both median and long-distance dispersal varied strongly with habitat configuration. Habitat loss consistently reduced abundances, whereas fragmentation per se more strongly shaped dispersal kernels, providing mechanistic insight into a central debate in landscape ecology. Our results highlight that dispersal kernels do not transfer reliably across environments and should be treated as emergent, context-dependent properties.

Our work contributes to the problem of decoupling the stimulus-driven and internally generated components of neural activity in the primary visual cortex. Internally generated (or intrinsic) activity refers to neural dynamics that are not directly driven by sensory stimuli, reflecting the brains ongoing, endogenous processes. Neuronal activity encodes both external stimuli and internal cortical states. The internally modulated activity, though not directly observable, can be inferred from the shared structure in population responses, and thus, serves as a proxy for the internal cortical state.\n\nWe developed a two-phase Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) framework that decomposes neural activity into two orthogonal low-dimensional subspaces: (1) a \"population\" subspace capturing global variability shared across neurons, and (2) a \"stimulus\" subspace containing dimensions that discriminate between stimulus conditions while being linearly uncorrelated with the population subspace. We focus on the granular (L4) and supragranular (L2/3) layers of awake mice exposed to visual stimuli consisting of optical flow directions, using mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging. In both L4 and L2/3 layers, many components individually yield above-chance decoding accuracy, yet a small low-dimensional subspace preserves nearly the full decoding performance of the high-dimensional population. Stimulus-driven components exhibit strong cross-mouse correlations, indicating a conserved coding scheme present in both L4 and L2/3. These components are stable across the entire recording session, reflecting robustness of the underlying representation over time. Removing the global modulation did not abolish stimulus discriminability in either layer, suggesting that information about stimulus direction is not dependent on this global signal. Both L4 and L2/3 stimulus components exhibit comparable decoding performance as well as similar tuning representations, suggesting common encoding of stimulus direction across layers.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that ERManI and ManIA localize to specialized quality control vesicles (QCVs); we now find that ManIB also partially localizes to these vesicles, whereas ManIC is predominantly Golgi-localized. ERManI, ManIA, and ManIB share a conserved luminal juxtamembrane distribution of charged residues, which diverges in ManIC. Structural predictions suggest that this region maintains an alpha-helical conformation, with the charge pattern oriented on one face. Site-directed mutagenesis that disrupted this charge pattern or altered its helical register (via alanine insertions) shifted localization between QCVs and the Golgi. Moreover, grafting this peptide onto an unrelated transmembrane protein, beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase, redirected it from the Golgi to QCVs.

We hypothesized that CREG1 regulates cardiac autophagy, thereby maintaining cardiac structure and function under both physiological and stress conditions.\n\nMethodsWe generated true Creg1 knockout (KO) mice by deleting the entire open reading frame and established a gain-of-function model by inserting human CREG1 into the Rosa26 locus. Cardiac structure and function were assessed in global and cardiomyocyte-specific Creg1 knockout (cmCreg1KO) and knock-in (cmCREG1KI) mice. Autophagy was evaluated using biochemical assays, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and the CAG-EGFP-RFP-LC3 reporter analysis.\n\nResultsGlobal Creg1 knockout mice developed progressive cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction at [~]80 weeks of age. At younger ages, CREG1 deficiency increased susceptibility to nutritional stress, resulting in mitochondrial damage and myofiber disruption in cardiomyocytes. cmCreg1KO mice exhibited dilated cardiomyopathy, left atrial thrombosis, and lethality around 50 weeks of age; however, interpretation of disease severity is confounded by Myh6-Cre-associated cardiotoxicity, which may mask additional pathogenic effects attributable to CREG1 loss. In contrast, cmCREG1KI mice demonstrated enhanced exercise capacity under nutritional stress. Mechanistically, CREG1 was localized to endolysosomal and autophagosomal compartments.

L.; Zhan, T.; Li, W.; De Belly, H.; Zhang, Q.; Xu, K.; Weiner, O.; Drubin, D. G.", "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is an essential cellular process that needs to operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions. Internalization of the endocytic site involves forces generated by membrane-bound proteins and Arp2/3-mediated branched actin filament assembly to bend the plasma membrane (PM) from flat to omega-shaped. In mammalian CME, the requirement for a branched actin filament network varies depending on cell type and differences in membrane tension. However, how the actin network adapts to changes in load in order to ensure robustness of this process over a range of membrane tensions is not understood. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy of genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to investigate the role of the mammalian class-I myosin, Myosin1E (Myo1E), in load adaptation. Under normal conditions, sites that recruit Myo1E are rare and exhibit slow CME dynamics. However, as membrane tension increases and CME dynamics are slowed globally, Myo1E is recruited to more sites, likely to assemble more branched actin, resulting in increased force generation to rescue stalled sites and promote internalization. Loss of Myo1E results in increased Arp2/3 complex lifetime at CME sites under normal conditions, and at high membrane tension, these sites fail to recruit as many Arp2/3 molecules. We propose that Myo1E is recruited to CME sites that have stalled due to increased membrane tension, where it helps build a more effective branched actin network by generating force through motor activity and recruiting additional Arp2/3 complexes to rescue stalled sites.\n\nSignificanceFor mammalian cells to internalize extracellular cargo via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), specific regions of the plasma membrane (PM) must bend from flat to inwardly curved, a process that requires force-generating proteins. One key component in generating this force during CME is the branched actin network, in which actin filaments polymerize against the plasma membrane. When PM tension increases, more force is required to generate curvature, prompting the assembly of actin and actin associated proteins to aid the process. We demonstrate that the class-I myosin motor, Myosin1E (Myo1E), becomes increasingly crucial as membrane tension rises, presumably to build a more effective branched actin network to facilitate internalization of slowed sites.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Gonadotropin stimulation also differentiates the GCs into two distinct lineages: mural GCs (mGCs), which surround the antral cavity, and cumulus GCs (cGCs), which stay in contact with the oocyte. We examined the transcriptomes of mouse mural and cumulus cells to understand the mechanism of differentiation. In addition to analyzing a single transcript expression per gene, we also considered multiple isoform expressions to explore differential transcriptomics. GC-specific core transcription factors Foxl2, Nr5a1, Nr5a2, Runx1, and Runx2 were expressed at high levels in mGCs but downregulated in cGCs, indicating that cGCs acquire a more differentiated state. Both single-transcript and multiple-isoform analyses revealed differential expression of about 70% of transcripts between mGCs and cGCs. Although the counts were similar, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the single transcript level did not correlate well with the respective differentially expressed transcript isoforms (DETI). We identified DETIs originating from key epigenetic and transcriptional regulator genes, such as Chd1, Ezh2, Kdm5a, Kdm5b, Gata4, Esr2, Fos, Myc, and Ybx1, that were not differentially expressed at the single-transcript level. Further analysis detected a transcript switch in 33% of the DETIs. Most of the transcript isoforms were protein-coding, followed by non-coding regulatory RNAs. A total of 1,302 transcript isoforms were silenced in cGCs, including those of Adar, Cebpa, Dnmt3a, Foxo4, Pgr, Rest, Runx1, Satb2, Sirt1, Sirt2, and Tead1.

Although primary cilia are known to regulate cellular signaling and energy metabolism, the relationship between these roles in the context of ciliopathies and brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction remains poorly understood. To elucidate the role of primary cilia in BAT, we generated Ucp1-Cre;Ift88flox/flox mice with BAT-specific ciliary loss. There were no significant differences in body size, weight, or BAT weight relative to body weight between P0 Ucp1-Cre;Ift88flox/flox and P0 Ucp1-Cre;Ift88+/+ pups. Embryos examined at E14.5 and E18.5 also showed no discernible differences in size, morphology, or histology. However, P0 Ucp1-Cre;Ift88flox/flox pups exhibited neonatal lethality caused by defective thermogenesis, despite preserved Ucp1 expression. These mice displayed markedly reduced ketone body levels in both BAT and serum, accompanied by downregulation of Hmgcs2, a key enzyme in ketogenesis. Loss of primary cilia in BAT suppressed ketogenesis and increased ROS production through HMGCS2 downregulation, ultimately impairing non-shivering thermogenesis. Remarkably, neonatal lethality of Ucp1-Cre;Ift88flox/flox pups was completely rescued by thermoneutral housing or {beta}-hydroxybutyrate supplementation. Our findings identified a previously unrecognized mechanism by which primary cilia regulate non-shivering, UCP1-independent thermogenesis via ketogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

In this process, an excess of double-strand breaks is introduced, but only a limited subset is ultimately processed into crossovers. Imbalances in the distribution of crossovers can lead to errors in chromosome segregation, with devastating consequences on the health of the progeny. However, the selection of which breaks are designated to become crossovers is still poorly understood, as both its timing and the ultimate molecular mechanisms are under debate. Here, we used 3D dual-color single-molecule localization microscopy and real-time confocal imaging, combined with advanced image analysis, to investigate the timing and mechanism of crossover designation in C. elegans. We show that meiotic crossover patterning is not established by a single decision point but depends on a dynamic, multi-layered regulation process. An initial, early selection process restricts potential crossovers to a small subset of double-strand break sites that already exhibit basic patterning features, including assurance and interference. A second, later step fine-tunes this pattern to ultimately ensure genome integrity and promote accurate chromosome segregation. Real-time imaging reveals that although the full process takes more than seven hours, key molecular events occur within minutes, high-lighting how rapid local dynamic changes can give rise to an overall slow but extremely robust crossover regulation program.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

In response to vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent pro-angiogenic factor, endothelial cells cultured on the surfaces of soft collagen hydrogels form elongated cell streams that coexist with more polygonal cell regions. Angiogenic sprouting initiates preferentially at cell stream tips, where nematic order gradients are most pronounced. We demonstrate that cell streams are associated with large traction forces that lead to 3D deformations of the underlying hydrogel and that stream formation results from a delicate balance between microtubule polymerization and actomyosin contractility. Finally, we show that active control of nematic order allows modulation of sprout formation, highlighting the key role of EC orientation gradients in angiogenic sprouting and paving the way for new therapeutic avenues.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

This study elucidates a crucial role for decorin in promoting the retention and stability of nascent aggrecan within this matrix. By applying bio-orthogonal click-labeling, we demonstrate that loss of decorin accelerates the release of nascent aggrecan under both physiological and inflammatory conditions, without affecting its preferred localization to the pericellular matrix. Conversely, supplementation with exogenous decorin mitigates inflammation-induced loss of nascent aggrecan, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target. At the molecular level, decorin exhibits strong binding affinity for aggrecan, and enhances aggrecan-aggrecan and aggrecan-collagen II interactions, reinforcing its direct role in integrating cartilage matrix constituents. Also, by binding to collagen II, decorin stiffens the collagen II fibril network, thereby strengthening the confinement effect that limits the diffusive loss of entrapped aggrecan. Notably, decorin does not alter chondrocyte transcriptomic profiles in vivo, emphasizing its primary role in maintaining matrix integrity through biophysical mechanisms rather than cell signaling. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic foundation for developing decorin-based biomaterials or gene therapies aimed at preserving or regenerating the cartilage matrix for improved outcomes in osteoarthritis.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Fractional killing, in which only a subset of cells undergo apoptosis after drug exposure, is a key contributor to this resistance and is influenced by genetic and nongenetic heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment. Solid tumors display substantial variation in extracellular matrix stiffness, providing evidence that the mechanical context of cancer and stromal cells may play an important role in therapeutic response. Here, we investigated how substrate stiffness affects the dynamics of apoptosis and the mechanisms behind differences in the cell death response to doxorubicin (DOX). HeLa cells cultured on stiffer substrates exhibited enhanced caspase-3/7 activation and increased apoptotic cell death, whereas cells on soft substrates showed markedly reduced apoptotic signaling and improved survival. Although substrate stiffness altered cytoskeletal organization, pharmacological disruption of actin polymerization or actomyosin contractility did not influence nuclear DOX accumulation, indicating that cytoskeletal mechanics were not the primary factor in the stiffness-dependent sensitivity. Instead, flow cytometry revealed that substrate stiffness modulates cell-cycle distribution, with soft substrates enriched in the G1 population and a reduced fraction of cells in the DOX-sensitive S phase. Synchronizing cells at the G1/S phase boundary eliminated stiffness-dependent differences in apoptotic activation, demonstrating that cell-cycle state is a dominant driver of stiffness-mediated fractional killing.

In high-grade human MPNSTs, inactivating mutations in PRC2 core components SUZ12 or EED are prevalent and contributes to oncogenic transformation and progression of MPNST. How PRC2 inactivation contributes to MPNST pathogenesis, however, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that genetic inactivation of Eed in addition to Nf1 and Cdkn2a in the Schwann-progenitor lineage leads to widespread tumorigenesis within the sciatic nerve compartment of mice. In contrast, loss of Nf1 and Cdkn2a is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis in the sciatic nerve but leads to MPNST development in other anatomic locations with a longer latency. Single-nucleus multiome sequencing of the sciatic nerves revealed that PRC2-loss reprograms Nf1/Cdkn2a-deficient Schwann-lineage cells toward a dedifferentiated, neural crest stem cell-like state that resembles the transcriptomic signatures of human PRC2-loss MPNST.

Despite their initial efficacy, development of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in metastatic ER+ BC patients is nearly universal, commonly through compensatory overexpression of CDK6. Here, we show that primary ER+ tumors show high CDK4 but very low to undetectable expression of CDK6, which suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ BC patients is largely driven by inhibition of CDK4, rather than CDK6. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of CDK6 confers acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, largely, through a kinase-independent function. Our findings challenge the dogma that CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is necessary to ER+ BC cells to progress from G1 to S phase of cell cycle. Consequently, by taking advantage of the non-kinase function of CDK6, ER+ BC cells acquire independence from the kinase function of CDK4 and 6 for cell cycle progression. These findings highlight the limitations of the current standard-of-care treatments, which focus on merely inhibiting the kinase function of CDK4 and 6, and uncover the non-kinase function of CDK6 as a new targetable vulnerability to overcome acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ BC.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

During cancer progression, alterations in membrane trafficking are frequently observed. However, the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of membrane trafficking in cancer progression remain largely unresolved. Recent evidence has demonstrated that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) employs a membrane trafficking program to coordinate cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). To further dissect the pro-tumorigenic membrane trafficking program, here we conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in vivo screen for membrane trafficking regulators in a syngeneic mouse model with a complete immune system. This screen identified REEP2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shaping protein, as a novel regulator of the EMT-dependent membrane trafficking program, which is associated with a poor prognosis in LUAD patients and is required for LUAD metastasis in a syngeneic orthotopic LUAD mouse model. Mechanistically, the EMT activator ZEB1 upregulates REEP2 expression through miR-183- and miR-193a-mediated regulation that promotes the transportation of secretory cargoes from the ER exit site (ERES) to the Golgi, thereby augmenting the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors. The REEP2-driven secretion promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME.

Mitochondria redistribution reprograms recipient neutrophils, macrophages, and CD4 T cells into highly suppressive states but drives CD8 T cell exhaustion. Within cancer cells, fusion of incoming mitochondria induces filamentous P5CS assembly, enhances biosynthetic output, and enables the refurbishment of damaged organelles into fully functional units.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from stage I NPC patients (T1N0M0) treated with RT alone. Blood samples were collected before and after 18 Gy RT (in 2 Gy fractions). A randomized six-arm syngeneic mouse tumor model and in vitro cell studies were used to investigate interactions among STING-ATM signaling, immune modulation, and tumor response.\n\nResultsIn NPC patients, RT suppressed cGAS-STING signaling in monocytes and dendritic cells but promoted immunosuppressive programs, including PD-1 signaling, checkpoint expression, regulatory T cell expansion, and upregulation of TGF{beta}1, IL-10, VEGF, PDGF, and MDSC-associated pathways. In a syngeneic mouse model, co-treatment with the STING agonist diABZI reversed these effects and improved tumor control. Bulk RNA sequencing confirmed that RT suppressed cGAS-STING and ATM signaling in both spleens and tumors. Combination treatment restored this signaling, enhanced neutrophil degranulation, and inhibited PD-1 signaling and immune checkpoints. Immunohistochemistry showed that diABZI increased ATM activation, MPO expression, and reduced Treg infiltration in spleens and tumors. ATM activation correlated positively with MPO and inversely with FOXP3 immunoreactivity, suggesting that STING-ATM-MPO activation counteracts Treg-mediated immune suppression. In vitro, diABZI activated STING-ATM signaling in PBMCs, THP-1 cells, and Jurkat T cells, while inhibiting NPC cell growth partly via CYLD upregulation.\n\nConclusionsThese findings link RT-induced suppression to inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling.

Many patients, however, relapse within 10 years from the time of the initial diagnosis, suggesting underlying heterogeneity of the disease. Using topological data analysis, we previously identified a copy number change in the region 5p14.3-p12 associated to Luminal A patients. In this paper, we further investigate this region and identify the gene p53 Upregulated Regulator of p53 Levels (PURPL), a lncRNA not previously associated with breast cancer. We show that PURPL amplification and overexpression are associated with poor survival in Luminal A patients. To study possible mechanisms of action of PURPL, we test whether the low survival of patients with overexpression of PURPL is observed when the data are stratified according to the mutation status of relevant genes or pathways. We find that while the survival differences remain in the subset of patients with no mutations in either TP53 or PIK3CA, they disappear when mutations in both TP53 and PIK3CA are present. These results suggest that the PURPL transcript interacts with the products of both TP53 and PIK3CA and that these interactions determine the different survival outcomes of Luminal A patients with high expression of PURPL.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

P.; Palmer, C.; Thiyagalingam, J.; Burnley, T.; Chaban, Y.", "abstract": "Continued exponential growth in the number of structures resolved by single particle cryoEM, as seen in the last decade, requires ever more effective data analysis workflows. Datasets are rarely homogeneous, demanding a multistep procedure for discarding outliers. Since individual particles are very noisy, either 2D or 3D averages are normally used for discrimination. This becomes challenging when the 2D classes themselves are heterogeneous, leading to selection of contaminants or discarding useful rare views/poses. The 3D model-based discrimination requires trustworthy 3D maps and a correct assignment of Euler angles, which in turn depends on the quality of the initial data and might not be available at the very early stages of the analysis. We propose a novel deep-learning approach for improving quality of single particle datasets. The two-stage procedure consists of denoising single particle images using Variational AutoEncoder framework followed by particle quality filtering based on the score inferred for every particle by Domain Adaptation Neural Network trained on a large data set of categorised 2D averages. This approach allows an automated scoring of noisy raw images using data patterns learned from the high signal-to-noise ratio, externally derived 2D classes. Consequently, a higher quality data set enters computationally expensive steps of the data analysis, reducing the need for protracted and expensive calculations. Importantly, our method does not require any prior knowledge about the data or existence of a 3D model, making it universally applicable. Tests on publicly available datasets demonstrated that our approach largely outperformed 2D class-based particle discrimination. Smaller subsets of the top-scoring particles selected with our method were required to obtain the author-reported 3D model resolution. When applied to the user data in the automated on-the-fly data processing pipeline, the method rescued 30% of cases, which otherwise would not reach confidence threshold required for making decision to proceed to the 3D model refinement. It also led to general improvements in the quality of the 3D models for many datasets which were selected for the high-resolution processing.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Many CNS WHO grade 2 to 3 and some grade 4 gliomas harbor mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1), which causes a gain of function mutation (IDH1 R132H) leading to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Mutant IDH1-induced 2HG, through epigenetic reprogramming elicits an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment (TME). An immunosuppressive mechanism in the glioma TME involves adenosine production via the ectoenzyme CD73. This study investigates mIDH1s influence on CD73 expression and adenosine levels. We demonstrate that mIDH1 glioma cells exhibit reduced CD73 expression, driven by DNA hypermethylation, leading to reduced adenosine levels. Since wtIDH1 gliomas have high CD73 expression, we evaluated CD73 blockade as an immunotherapy target. We show that CD73 inhibition used as monotherapy, did not improve survival in wtIDH1 glioma-bearing mice. However, when combined with immune-stimulatory Ad-TK (adenoviral vectors encoding herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase) and Ad-Flt3L (adenoviral vectors encoding FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) gene therapy, CD73 blockade significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy and increased anti-glioma effector T cell activity. These findings reveal that CD73 inhibition used in combination with immune stimulatory Ad-TK/Ad-Flt3L gene therapy may be an effective treatment for wtIDH1 gliomas, which could be readily translated to the clinical arena.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Although many patients respond well to R-CHOP immunochemotherapy, those with the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype are often refractory or relapse. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib have improved outcomes, but acquired resistance limits their long-term efficacy. Here, we modeled the development of ibrutinib resistance in ABC-DLBCL and investigated whether the BCR-signaling regulator microRNA-28 (miR-28) can block this process. Using flow cytometry-based competition assays, multicolor clonal barcoding, transcriptomic profiling, and xenograft models, we found that miR-28 expression impairs the emergence of ibrutinib-resistant ABC-DLBCL cells. Mechanistically, miR-28 interferes with the clonal selection process triggered by ibrutinib treatment and rewires transcriptional programs by downregulating mitochondrial and mTOR signaling pathways critical for resistance development. Furthermore, lower expression of genes that we identified as repressed by miR-28 correlates with improved survival in ibrutinib-treated patients aged over 60 years from the PHOENIX trial cohort with the MCD genetic subtype, which is associated with ABC-DLBCL. Finally, we show that the targeted therapeutic delivery of miR-28 via aptamer-guided nanoparticles suppresses ibrutinib-resistant tumor growth in vivo. These findings identify miR-28 as an effective inhibitor of ibrutinib resistance, underscoring its translational potential as an adjunct strategy in ABC-DLBCL therapy.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/687947v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (69K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0812eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f104ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@722785org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@809011_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms that modulate the sensitivity to NS remain poorly understood, which has limited the design of clinical trials on patients most likely responding to these therapies. To get a panoramic view of the genetic determinants that shape the response to NS in cancer cells, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells treated with 2 independent RNA Polymerase I inhibitors: Actinomycin D (ActD) and BMH-21. As expected, mutations known to regulate the response to NS such as P53 or RB1 increased the resistance to both drugs. On the other hand, the toxicity of RNA Pol I inhibitors was increased in the context of mutations that enhance PI3K/mTOR signaling. Surprisingly, we found mutations that sensitized to ActD but increased the resistance to BMH-21, revealing that, while both drugs are used as RNA Pol I inhibitors, the must have additional unknown targets.

We demonstrate how the different fixatives can influence lipid and protein content, and overall cell morphology, with significant implications for the accuracy of quantitative SRS microscopy.

Strain heterogeneity, the non-uniform deformation of cells under uniform external mechanical stimuli, may underlie tissue-level robustness and guide morphogenetic outcomes. In this study, we applied a defined uniaxial strain to Xenopus laevis epithelial explants and investigated how strain was distributed at the cellular level. Live imaging and quantitative analysis revealed that despite a uniform tissue-level strain, cellular strain was heterogeneous, suggesting variable responses to a uniform mechanical stimulus. To understand the source of this variability, we used an image analysis pipeline to explore multiple aspects of cell morphology. We found that cell intrinsic material properties, represented by Poisson index, had the strongest correlation with strain heterogeneity, suggesting a dominant role in variable mechanical response. We further analyzed how force was distributed at the cellular level using a vinculin force sensor and laser ablation. These experiments demonstrated that forces are primarily transmitted through the medio-apical actomyosin cortex whereas junctional actomyosin facilitates dissipation and remodeling. These findings provide new insights into the physical principles that underlie epithelial resilience and adaptive remodeling, highlighting the importance of distinct functions of junctional and medio-apical actomyosin networks in mechanical adaptation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/687918v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@942982org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131412forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae9b3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@151045d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we report a photoclickable labeling platform based on the 2,3-diaryl-indanone epoxide (DIO) photoswitch scaffold and the self-labeling protein HaloTag. Upon illumination, the protein-bound DIO undergoes reversible photoisomerization to form a metastable oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) that reacts with ring-strained dipolarophiles via [5+2] cycloaddition, enabling covalent spatiotemporal labeling. We synthesize and characterize a library of DIO-HaloTag and DIO-SNAP-tag ligands, systematically examining the effects of linker architecture and scaffold substitution on the photoswitching and photoclick reactivity in vitro and on living cells. We identify a naphthyl-substituted DIO ligand exhibiting superior photoswitching and photoclick efficiency, allowing robust and selective labeling of HaloTag on the surface of living cells using visible light activation. Using this system, we achieve two- and three-color labeling of defined cell surface regions with excellent spatial and temporal precision, additionally allowing combinatorial labeling.

However, extracting these preserved dynamics remains challenging: high-dimensional neural population activity and the recorded neuron populations vary across recording sessions. While existing modeling tools can improve alignment between neural and behavioral data, they often operate on a per-subject basis or discretize behavior into categories, disrupting its natural continuity and failing to capture the underlying dynamics. We introduce Contrastive Aligned Neural DYnamics (CANDY), an end-to-end framework that aligns neural and behavioral data using rank-based contrastive learning, adapted for continuous behavioral variables, to project neural activity from different sessions onto a shared low-dimensional embedding space. CANDY fits a shared linear dynamical system to the aligned embeddings, enabling an interpretable model of the conserved temporal structure in the latent space. We validate CANDY on synthetic and real-world datasets spanning multiple species, behaviors, and recording modalities. Our results show that CANDY is able to learn aligned latent embeddings and preserved dynamics across neural recording sessions and subjects, and it achieves improved cross-session behavior decoding performance. We further show that the latent linear dynamical system generalizes to new sessions and subjects, achieving comparable or even superior behavior decoding performance to models trained from scratch. These advances enable robust cross-session behavioral decoding and offer a path towards identifying shared neural dynamics that underlie behavior across individuals and recording conditions.

As an active functional part of motor control, characterising spinal cord activity is essential for understanding sensorimotor function. High-density electrospinography presents a novel technique to assess spinal neural dynamics by non-invasively recording task-relevant electrical activity.\n\nObjectiveTo non-invasively investigate spatio-spectral patterns of task-related spinal activity and its functional connectivity with cortical regions during isometric pincer-grip contraction.\n\nMethodologyHere, we simultaneously recorded 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG), 64-channel electrospinography (ESG), and two bipolar electromyography (EMG) signals during an isometric pincer-grip task. Frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity and cortico-spinal connectivity were evaluated by calculating task-related ESG power and cortico-spinal coherence between ESG and EEG signals during the isometric hold.\n\nResultsDistinct frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity were observed at lower cervical levels during sustained hold, with significant activation over the ipsilateral anterolateral region.

In that context, spontaneous arousals during sleep have been associated with the burden of Amyloid beta in the brain of healthy late middle-aged individuals. Whether the heterogeneity of arousals during sleep may be related to the genetic risk of developing AD in young adults is not established. Likewise, whether arousals may be associated with cognitive decline is not known. Here, we evaluated the association between arousals, the genetic risk for developing AD and cognitive performance and cognitive decline in healthy young and late-middle-aged individuals. Methods: We classified spontaneous arousals using in-lab EEG recordings of sleep in 453 younger individuals (22+/-2.7y; 49 women) and 87 late middle-aged individuals (59.3+/-5.3y; 59 women) based on their association with sleep stage transitions and changes in muscle tone. We examined the associations between arousal types and the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD, cognitive performance at baseline and, in late middle-aged individuals, cognitive decline over 2 and 7 years. Results: The prevalence of arousals associated with sleep stage transition was higher in late middle-aged vs. younger individuals. Among these arousals, those with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, associated with lower and higher PRS for AD in late middle-aged but not in younger individuals. In the late middle-aged individuals, transition arousals associated with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, correlated with better and worse attentional performance at baseline, and lower and larger memory decline over 2 or 7 years.

We used this targeted metabarcoding approach to track the temporal variation in the relative abundance of waterfowl species during the fall migration at Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, New York, a major resting area for waterfowl on their journey to and from North American nesting areas. We compared eDNA results with visual surveys conducted by us and from those reported on eBird. Our results showed that eDNA detected all waterfowl species (n= 25) during fall migration. Positive correlations existed between standardized eDNA read counts and the relative abundance of waterfowl species as reported in eBird on the day of sampling and up to five days prior. However, this approach did not provide a good metric for absolute abundance of waterfowl species: only 8 out of 25 waterfowl species showed significant correlations between the number of eDNA reads and the total abundance of birds. Overall, while eDNA-targeted metabarcoding has not yet been applied to study bird communities extensively, our results demonstrate that this technique can be used as an effective complementary tool for assessing species composition of waterfowl communities and estimating relative abundance of species within those communities.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Disruption of this process contributes to a broad range of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune dysfunction. The genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster offers powerful tools to study ubiquitination in vivo, where versatile systems such as GAL4/UAS, Split-GAL4, GeneSwitch, and MARCM can be combined with imaging and biochemical approaches to achieve precise spatial and temporal analyses. To fully exploit these advantages, experimental designs often require epitope-tagged UAS-Ubiquitin transgenes, both modified and unmodified, that accurately recapitulate the behavior of endogenous Ubiquitin. Here, we report the generation and validation of a panel of epitope-tagged UAS-Ubiquitin transgenes. We first characterize the endogenous ubiquitination pattern at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), then compare that with transgenically expressed Ubiquitin in muscle. Our analysis showed that transgenic His-Myc-, HA-, and His-Biotin-tagged Ubiquitin proteins accurately reproduce endogenous postsynaptic ubiquitination patterns. These validated transgenes provide versatile resources for investigating ubiquitination dynamics across diverse cellular and developmental contexts.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

STING agonists, among them non-hydrolysable cyclic dinucleotide analogues, are in active development to enhance immune activation in cancer treatment and vaccine adjuvants. Detailed knowledge of STING's nucleotide preferences is critical for the development of effective therapeutics, yet the full spectrum of cyclic dinucleotides capable of activating STING has not been comprehensively defined. Especially considering the recent diversity of cyclic nucleotides identified across bacteria and invertebrates, the pool of potential STING agonists to be tested has expanded considerably. Here, we systematically dissect STING nucleotide preferences and distinguish STING-dependent from STING-independent nucleotide signaling pathways by treating THP-1 monocytes and pancreatic cancer cells with a nucleotide library. We identify a set of 27 cyclic dinucleotides that induce STING activation to different extents. Our data indicate that STING's bias toward 2'3'-linked cyclic dinucleotides underlies its ability to also be activated by nucleotides containing purine-pyrimidine hybrids. In addition, we show that STING can be activated by diverse non-hydrolysable c-di-AMP and cGAMP isomers, thereby expanding the opportunities for designing STING agonists for therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe a computational approach to overcome this problem, based on the use of a protein-folding algorithm and its confidence metrics within a Monte Carlo optimization pipeline to generate peptide-based binders. For different protein targets, we show by accurate free energy calculations that our approach is able to design peptides with binding free energies on the order of tens of $k_BT$, i.e., with strengths comparable to covalent interactions. Direct observation of the bound complex through molecular simulations shows that the targeted epitope folds into structured domains with lowered thermal fluctuations upon binding, while remaining unstructured and dynamic in the unbound state, suggesting that the protein-folding algorithm must have learned the principles of induced (co-)folding. Given the ubiquitous presence of unstructured regions in proteins, our results suggest a potential pathway to design drugs targeting a large variety of previously untargetable epitopes, and open new possibilities for therapeutic intervention in diseases where disordered proteins play a key role.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Patients often report abnormal heat perception, yet the underlying sensory mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated thermoceptive behavior and corresponding structural changes in mouse models of inherited dysmyelinating neuropathy and natural aging to identify shared and divergent mechanisms. Methods: Thermal preference was assessed using a user-independent gradient apparatus spanning physiological to noxious temperatures, with automated quantification of time in zone, distance traveled, and velocity. Nocifensive responses were evaluated by hot plate latency. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was measured in paw pads, and TRPV1-positive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Results: Thermal gradient testing revealed preserved temperature preference in CMT1A and HNPP mice but significantly altered behavior in aged animals, which spent less time in warmer zones. Hot plate testing showed prolonged times to nocifensive behavior in aged and CMT1A mice, whereas HNPP mice exhibited variable responses. IENFD was markedly reduced in aged mice but preserved in CMT1A and HNPP. DRG analysis revealed smaller soma diameters and reduced proportions of TRPV1-positive A{delta} neurons in aged mice, while CMT1A animals maintained normal morphology. Interpretation: Aging produces thermoceptive deficits through axonal degeneration and selective A{delta}-fiber vulnerability, whereas CMT1A mice display conduction-related impairment due to dysmyelination.

Both approaches revealed the expected pattern of lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AxD) in AD, consistent with white matter degeneration. Despite broadly similar global trends, substantial bundle-level differences emerged between the two tractography methods. Probabilistic tracking produced stronger and more spatially extended effects in the fornix, a small and highly curved limbic pathway vulnerable to AD-related degeneration, whereas deterministic tracking showed greater sensitivity in the posterior segments of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF\\_R).

The causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is a unicellular eukaryotic parasite whose life cycle alternates between insect vectors and a wide range of mammalian hosts. In mammalian cells, parasite proliferation depends on iterative cycles of host cell invasion, intracellular multiplication, differentiation, and host cell rupture, releasing hundreds of infective parasites. The mechanisms governing the critical transition from replicative amastigotes to infective trypomastigotes (trypomastigogenesis) and subsequent egress remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of robust analytical tools. Here, we combined real-time cellular impedance monitoring, stage-specific fluorescent parasites, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and automated high-content imaging to dissect the late steps of the lytic cycle. We demonstrate that trypomastigogenesis is temporally coordinated with egress, ensuring the release of fully mature, infective trypomastigotes. Futhermore, we re-evaluate the effect of the cysteine protease inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala fluoromethyl ketone (Z-FA-FMK), previously reported as an egress inhibitor. Our results reveal that Z-FA-FMK primarily impairs trypomastigogenesis, causing an accumulation of amastigotes and blocking progression to mature trypomastigotes. This arrest delays egress and leads to the release of immature forms, highlighting the essential role of cysteine proteases in parasite differentiation. By decoupling trypomastigogenesis from egress, we provide experimental evidence that the late lytic cycle is a multi-step, tightly regulated process linking parasite differentiation with egress. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework for dissecting lytic cycle termination and offers a versatile platform for phenotypic screening and drug discovery.\n\nImportanceChagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions worldwide and remains a major global health burden, causing chronic cardiac, digestive, and neurological complications. The disease, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations, lacks effective treatments or a vaccine. Parasite replication and host cell exit are tightly linked, but the mechanisms driving the transition from intracellular replicative parasites to infective forms and their subsequent release upon host cell lysis are poorly understood. Using real-time monitoring, fluorescent parasites, and high-resolution imaging, we show that cysteine proteases are critical for parasite maturation and that their inhibition uncouples differentiation from egress, leading to the release of non-infective parasites. These findings reveal fundamental principles of parasite biology, provide a platform for drug discovery, and highlight new avenues to target Chagas disease at a critical stage of infection.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Mycobiont-phycobiont interaction networks were constructed, and ecological niches of associated Trebouxia species were modelled using 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim v. 2.1.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed high diversity within Xanthoria parietina and clarified the placement of poorly studied species within the genus Xanthoria (e.g., X. monofoliosa and X. aureola s. lat.), and revealed a novel lineage (Xanthoria sp.  hydra). All the photobionts belonged to Trebouxia clade A; nine Trebouxia species-level lineages were detected, including a previously unrecognized lineage (Trebouxia sp. A56). Trebouxia decolorans (A33) was the most frequent photobiont and exhibited the broadest climatic niche, whereas T. solaris (A35) and T. tabarcae ad int. (A48) showed a more specialized climatic niche.

Agentic Lab uses multi-agent orchestration architecture, comprising of specialized subagents for knowledge retrieval, protocol design, multimodal data analysis, and training-free segmentation and representation learning for intrinsically explainable single-cell and organoid phenotyping. These agents operate under the orchestration of a virtual principal investigator MolAgent that is linked to an augmented reality (AR)-based physical AI interface, which can bridge digital reasoning with human physical execution.

This interaction allows scientists and AI agents to collaborate and co-evolve dynamically, closing the loop between planning, action, and analysis in the traditional cell and organoid research lifecycle. We demonstrate Agentic Lab in organoid differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells, where it autonomously generates protocols, monitors culture procedures, and identifies subtle morphological heterogeneity linked to growth conditions. The system interprets these phenotypes, grounds them in literature, and proposes targeted instructions for improving differentiation efficiency.

Extensive benchmarking across 23 classification (171 tasks) and 10 regression datasets demonstrates that CDI embeddings consistently achieve superior predictive performance compared to individual Featurizers and standard feature aggregation methods. The CDI-Generalised model achieves this performance with exceptional computational efficiency, outperforming deep learning Featurizers in terms of speed and resource overhead.

Understanding life processes relies on accurate protein function prediction, fundamentally requiring the integration of evolutionary information encoded in sequences with spatial characteristics from 3D structures.

Results. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrast-aware pre-training framework, ESMSCOP. ESMSCOP leverages a state-of-the-art protein language model to harness evolutionary insights embedded in sequences, and introduces a new encoder to fuse topological and fine-grained spatial structural features.

R.; Koslicki, D.; Martinez, C.", "abstract": "With the surge in sequencing data generated from an ever-expanding range of biological studies, designing scalable computational techniques has become essential. One effective strategy to enable large-scale computation is to split long DNA or protein sequences into k-mers, and summarize large k-mer sets into compact random samples (a.k.a. sketches). These random samples allow for rapid estimation of similarity metrics such as Jaccard or cosine, and thus facilitate scalable computations such as fast similarity search, classification, and clustering. Popular sketching tools in bioinformatics include Mash and sourmash. Mash uses the MinHash algorithm to generate fixed-size sketches; while sourmash employs FracMinHash, which produces sketches whose size scales linearly with the total number of k-mers. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, MaxGeomHash, which for a specified parameter r > 1, will produce, without prior knowledge of n (the number of k-mers) a random sample of size r lg(n/r)+O(r). Notably, this is the first deterministic, permutation-invariant, and parallelizable sketching algorithm to date that can produce sub-linear sketches. We also introduce a variant, -MaxGeomHash, that produces random samples of size{Theta} (n) for a given  [isin] (0, 1). We study the algorithm's properties, analyze generated sample sizes, verify theoretical results empirically, provide a fast implementation, and investigate similarity estimate quality. With intermediate-sized samples between constant (MinHash) and linear (FracMinHash), MaxGeomHash balances efficiency (smaller samples need less storage and processing) with accuracy (larger samples yield better estimates).

In the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, cytoplasmic and apoplastic effectors are secreted by different routes, but candidates must be confirmed by fluorescent labelling, consequently few are known. AA-ending codon usage rates are the fraction of AA-ending codons as a percentage of the total number of AA- and synonymous AG-ending codons in an mRNA. In M. oryzae, high AA % rates of the corresponding mRNAs distinguished seven experimentally confirmed cytoplasmic effectors from four experimentally confirmed apoplastic effectors, but whether AA % rates can identify new effectors is unknown. Here, using computational analyses and live-cell imaging confirmation, we successfully predicted, based on AA % rates, two new cytoplasmic effectors and two apoplastic effectors in the M. oryzae secretome.

To address this question, we designed a two-target temporal cueing task where participants discriminated the frequency sweep direction of one of two successive auditory stimuli, separated by 250 ms, while temporal attention was directed to one or both time points. We found that temporal attention improved auditory discrimination only for the first time point and could then remain sustained across the interval, without evidence of attentional tradeoffs across time. Further, manipulating auditory feature uncertainty changed overall performance but did not modulate the impact of temporal attention or yield tradeoffs.

Here we used precisely timed optogenetic stimulation of forelimb muscles to manipulate proprioceptive signals during a mouse reach-to-consume task. Mice were able to successfully reach and consume despite muscle stimulation-evoked forelimb deviations. Across the cortex, the caudal forelimb area (CFA) was preferentially activated by muscle-specific proprioceptive inputs and contributed to stabilizing perturbed forelimb movement. CFA extratelencephalic (ET) neurons encoded movement kinematics as well as proprioceptive feedback. At neuron population level, proprioceptive perturbations rapidly deflected CFA ET neural trajectories away from the task-relevant manifold yet exerted only limited effects on evolving task dynamics. These results reveal that descending cortical circuit implements activity subspace separation to encode and integrate distorted proprioceptive feedback while preserving task-relevant output.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, the precise reason for this association is not fully understood. Beyond its effects on amyloid and tau, APOE also influences fundamental cellular processes in the brain, including cholesterol trafficking between cells and within the endolysosomal system, which may be a critical component of the APOE4-associated vulnerability to AD. Here, we examined how APOE genotype, sex, and aging alter intracellular cholesterol processing and the endolysosomal system in the mouse brain. Using the novel cholesterol-binding probe D4H*-mCherry, we quantified intracellular cholesterol levels, the levels of early endosomes (Rab5), late endosomes (CD63), and lysosomes (LAMP1), and the colocalization of cholesterol with these endolysosomal compartments. This analysis was performed in the cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex of young, middle-aged, and old APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 mice. Our analysis revealed region-specific changes in intracellular cholesterol and the endolysosomal system in response to aging, sex, and APOE genotype. Notably, young APOE4 mice showed reduced cholesterol within early and late endosomes, but increased lysosomal abundance, suggesting impaired cholesterol processing. These APOE4-specific effects were less apparent in older animals. These effects were strongly modified by sex, with female APOE4 mice exhibiting elevated lysosomal cholesterol in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at old age, indicating sex-dependent susceptibility. Together, these results reveal that APOE genotype, age, and sex interact to influence endolysosomal cholesterol homeostasis, with female APOE4 mice showing the greatest dysregulation. These findings suggest that early and region-specific endolysosomal defects may contribute to the heightened AD risk associated with APOE4, particularly in females.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The extent to which a sequence of movements is prepared before initiating the first movement is a longstanding question in motor neuroscience. The observation that reaction time (RT) increases for longer sequences has been used as evidence of sequence preparation; reflecting the additional demands of preparing multiple movements before initiating a sequential action. However, many processes contribute to RT, making it unclear whether the observed RT increases specifically reflect sequence preparation. For example, with longer sequences, participants face greater ambiguity in selecting their first movement in the sequence. Here, we test how much of the observed RT increases can be explained by the first-target ambiguity when reaching toward spatial targets. In our paradigm, we independently manipulate: (i) the number of future targets displayed, (ii) the number of targets to be acquired, and (iii) the spatial arrangement of the targets. This approach allows us to vary the demands of sequence preparation and first-target ambiguity, thereby enabling a direct assessment of their respective influence on RT. We report that RT increases with additional sequence elements but that this effect is fully explained by the ambiguity in selecting the first reach target. That is, sequence preparation causes no RT increase. In fact, when first-target ambiguity is eliminated, RT is constant across the number of displayed targets even though kinematic analysis reveals that participants have prepared a sequence. Together, these results indicate that preparing multiple reaches to spatial targets does not impose additional temporal costs relative to preparing a single reach.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Understanding the role antibodies play in preventing or causing disease is often supported by studies in model systems wherein manipulation of IgG levels can be used as an experimental tool. Here, we report in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) the capacity of two orthogonal strategies to systemically deplete IgG - treatment with a neonatal Fc receptor blocking antibody (Rozanolixizumab) that restricts IgG rescue and recycling, and administration of the IgG protease Imlifidase (IdeS) that cleaves the Fc domain. Under the conditions evaluated, we observed more rapid and effective, although not necessarily more durable, IgG depletion mediated by IdeS, reducing levels by 74.1-95.1%, compared to a lesser reduction of 31.3-66.9% with anti-FcRn treatment. We observed a similar degree of depletion, comparable kinetics of rebound among SIV antigen-specific fractions as total IgG, but differential balance among IgG subclasses following treatment in some cases. In sum, this study in a nonhuman primate model describes the efficacy and downstream impacts of new tools to modify humoral immune states providing insight into the balance between protective and pathological effects of IgG antibodies.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, this view overlooks genes that are crucial during early development. Using zebrafish as a model system, we examined gene expression from the first hours of embryogenesis through adulthood. We found that many genes expressed throughout development remain broadly expressed in adults, but others do not; and some adult housekeeping genes are not active early on. This reveals that essential gene functions shift across life stages. Genes active throughout development are more likely to be evolutionarily ancient, shared with humans, and cause defects in many organs when disrupted. Yet some genes expressed only at specific developmental stages, especially around gastrulation, can be equally essential. This supports the developmental hourglass model, where mid-embryogenesis is the most conserved stage.

However, estimating these strategies typically requires detailed demographic data, which are unavailable for many species. Morphological traits may provide a practical proxy for life history strategies, offering a scalable approach for data-deficient populations. 2. We parameterised dynamic energy budget integral projection models for 290 marine and freshwater fish species to quantify life history strategies and measured nine morphological traits from lateral-view photographs for each species. We used phylogenetically corrected principal component analysis to summarise life history strategies and morphological traits, and tested whether morphology predicts life history strategies, and whether either predicts population growth rate or demographic resilience. 3. Lateral size morphology, comprising body elongation, relative eye size and oral gape position, predicted generation turnover depending on water column position, and predicted reproductive output depending on clade. Generation turnover, reproductive output and lateral size morphology predicted population growth rate and resilience, but population growth rate and resilience were not directly aligned, challenging common assumptions in fisheries management that treat them as interchangeable. 4. Our results show that morphology can reliably capture key axes of life history strategy and components of population performance. Incorporating morphological proxies into life history frameworks could enable rapid, low-cost assessments of population resilience, extending life history frameworks to species lacking demographic data, and providing actionable insights for fisheries management and conservation under increasing pressures from overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

In this study, we tested how individual fecundity dynamics influence vulnerability of female fecundity to the deleterious environmental factors, like injury. We injured Drosophila melanogaster females at various moments during the pre- and post-mating periods in a manner similar to the wounds observed in nature. Injuries are prevalent in nature and provide a punctuated stimulus, making them particularly well suited to study their connection with the dynamics of reproduction. Our aim was to determine periods of vulnerability and impact of wounds on female fitness resulting from the change. The observed fecundity dynamics exhibited a high early peak in offspring production, suggesting that early after mating females might be particularly vulnerable to environmental conditions.

The development of effective therapies against these diseases requires a profound understanding of how Ras mutations modify pathway output and interact with other pathway components. In this work we generated G12V activating mutations in the Drosophila Ras1 locus and used Ras1G12V and human KRASBG12V to analyze in vivo the consequences of endogenous RasG12V expression and its interplay with other components of the EGFR/Raf/MAPK pathway. We find that RasG12V alters the timing but not the spatial pattern of ERK activation. Consistently, RasG12V mutant proteins respond to EGFR stimulation and can partially compensates for EGFR loss to generate basal levels of ERK activity. However, full pathway activation is still strictly dependent on EGFR function. Altogether, our results suggest that RasG12V mutant proteins act as an amplifier of EGFR stimulation accelerating and raising baseline ERK activity but requiring EGFR signaling for maximal activation.

This preclinical study aimed to clarify whether CRD impairs intestinal barrier integrity via gut microbiota dysbiosis and the \"apoptosis-inflammation-oxidative stress\" cascade. Methods: Twenty-four male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into control (12h light/dark, n=12) and CRD (21-day continuous light, n=12) groups. Circadian disruption was verified via locomotor activity, serum melatonin/serotonin, and clock gene expression. Intestinal barrier function, microbiota, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed using FITC-dextran permeability, 16S rRNA sequencing, Western blotting (WB), TUNEL, and ELISA. Results: CRD increased intestinal permeability (+114.7%, p<0.001), shortened villi (-25.6%, p=0.018), downregulated tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, p<0.05), and altered microbiota (decreased Prevotellaceae, increased Bacteroidaceae, p<0.05).

While biochemical approaches for patterning angiogenesis via growth factor delivery have shown promise, their inability to pattern sustained growth factor gradients with precise spatiotemporal control limit their effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate that dynamically patterned mechanical forces can provide precise spatiotemporal control over angiogenic sprouting in 3D microvascular networks. We developed a magnetically actuated 3D human vessel-on-a-chip platform that integrates a perfusable endothelialized microchannel within a collagen matrix and allows non-invasive, tunable, multi-axial mechanical stimulation across all three spatial dimensions and time (4D). Using an automated 3-axis actuator, we systematically investigated how strain magnitude, frequency, and direction modulate endothelial cell behavior and vessel morphogenesis. Dynamic mechanical stimulation at physiological strain magnitudes (5-15%) enhanced endothelial alignment and barrier function while promoting angiogenesis in a strain-magnitude-dependent manner: lower dynamic strain (5%) maximized sprout initiation, whereas higher dynamic strain (15%) promoted elongation of individual sprouts. Sequential reorientation of strain direction further reprogrammed sprouting trajectories along X, Y, and Z directions, generating complex 3D microvascular geometries such as L-shaped branches. RNA sequencing revealed mechanically induced transcriptional profiles distinct from unstimulated controls, characterized by coordinated upregulation of angiogenic (VEGFA, FGFR1, PDGFA), mechanotransduction (ANKRD1, ZYX, FOSB), extracellular matrix remodeling (ABI3BP, SPOCK1, COL8A1), and barrier-associated (SERPINE2, P2RY1) genes and pathways.

Studies focused on delineating the underlying perturbed mechanisms resulting from this genetic mutation are often confounded by the heterogeneity present in current disease models, such as patient-derived iPSC lines, with estimations of up to 50% of the variation in iPSC cell phenotypes resulting from inter-individual differences. Isogenic models, in which the pathogenic mutation is introduced into a defined genetic background, offer a powerful approach to isolating mutation-specific effects and enable high-resolution comparison across distinct ALS/FTD-associated mutations. Such models are essential for uncovering convergent disease mechanisms and improving reproducibility in ALS/FTD research.\n\nMethodsA two-step scarless CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy was used to generate isogenic human iPSC lines carrying a de novo knock-in of a disease-length G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 locus. The resulting lines underwent thorough quality control and were differentiated into lower motor neurons and assessed for the presence of key ALS/FTD pathologies, including changes to C9ORF72 mRNA and protein expression, RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins.\n\nResultsTwo C9ORF72 knock-in iPSC lines were generated with 631 and 600 G4C2 repeats, alongside an isogenic genome editing control line.

Previously, we found that the purine salvage pathway is involved in the regulation of morphology and dynamics of the microglial cell line BV2. Here, we show that intraperitoneal administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, reduces microglial branching during postnatal development. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MMF administration decreases guanosine nucleotides in the brain. Interestingly, despite the essential role of guanosine nucleotides in cellular proliferation, MMF administration did not significantly affect microglial proliferation. On the other hand, MMF administration attenuated the level of GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Rac1 small GTPases. Notably, MMF administration decreased the number of branches, while process length remained unaffected. Since microglial branching affects microglial complexity and diversity, our findings suggest that guanosine nucleotide production is essential for generating proper microglial diversity.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here we studied the impact of a decade-long drought on plant litter chemistry and microbial decomposition traits in a semi-arid ecosystem during an 18-month litter bag experiment. We investigated litter sourced from four conditions: grass and shrub vegetation under ambient and reduced precipitation. We hypothesized that litter chemistry drives microbial decomposition capabilities and enzyme activity, either due to vegetation differences or drought effects on litter chemistry. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was used to characterize litter chemistry; we found that carbohydrate-rich grass litter decomposed faster than more recalcitrant shrub litter which was richer in lignin and lipids. There were significant changes in litter chemistry under drought but no increase in lignin fraction suggesting that drought does not make litter more recalcitrant. Metagenomics-derived decomposition genes and extracellular enzyme activity were higher in grass litter; patterns related to differences in substrate supply. Genes linked to lignin depolymerization decreased in abundance under drought. However, most decomposition genes and enzyme activities were not significantly affected by drought thereby maintaining decomposition rates. Microbial community succession with higher abundance of fungi at early and bacteria at later stages of decomposition corresponded with genes for fungal and bacterial necromass recycling along with protein accumulation over time. We demonstrate minimal litter chemistry-mediated effects of drought but show significant changes in community composition and their decomposition capabilities over time highlighting that complex microbial-chemical interactions under climate change can influence ecosystem-scale processes.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Metabarcoding has become the method of choice for characterising complex arthropod communities. The extent to which metabarcoded bulk samples will recover the same community composition as individual sequencing of all individuals in the sample remains poorly quantified. Biases such as unequal extraction of DNA from different taxa, primer mismatches and non-random PCR may cause the selective drop-out of species from metabarcoding data. At the same time, DNA metabarcoding may reveal arthropod taxa present not as individuals, but as DNA residues on the surface or in the gut of insects. 2. To quantify the consistency in sample contents established by different means, we metabarcoded 45 bulk insect samples, then extracted all arthropods and sequenced them individually. Metabarcoding targeted 418 bp at the 3-prime end of the Folmer barcoding region, while individual barcodes captured the entire 658 bp Folmer region. The metabarcoding workflow, including PCR amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatics, was performed in three replicates from three separate lysate aliquots per sample. Sequences were assigned to Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) as identical taxonomic categories across data types. 3. We found that metabarcoding is replicable, as different replicates of the same sample recover similar species richness and composition. Individual barcoding and metabarcoding provide the same impression of relative differences in community structure: estimates of relative species richness and relative dissimilarity between sample pairs are congruent among data types. Dissimilarity between data types varies with BIN richness in the sample, but this relationship reflects nestedness rather than turnover: metabarcoding recovers the same set of core species as individual barcoding but adds hundreds of species on top. Any BIN recovered as an individual occurred with high probability in the metabarcoding data, and any BIN found in high read abundances by metabarcoding was likely found as an individual. 4. Our analysis suggests that metabarcoding data will closely mimic the sample contents in terms of arthropod species richness and composition. Taxa recovered in low copy numbers in metabarcoding sequence data will typically represent DNA left as residues from past biotic interactions.

R.; Weinhardt, V.; Zilova, L.; Wittbrodt, J.", "abstract": "Photosensitive organs are essential for most animals to perceive and respond to their environment. While the gene regulatory networks establishing retinal identity are deeply conserved across metazoans (reviewed in Gehring, 2012; Vopalensky & Kozmik, 2009; Hahn et al., 2023), the retinal architecture varies widely - from invertebrate compound eyes to vertebrate camera-type eyes (Lamb et al., 2007; Schwab, 2017; Arendt & Wittbrodt, 2001). Despite this morphological diversity, early eye anlagen in both, invertebrates and vertebrates, share an initial pseudo-stratified epithelial organization (Weasner & Kumar, 2022; Randlett et al., 2010; Das et al., 2003; Kitambi & Malicki, 2008), which is maintained and elaborated into multi-layered retinae in vertebrates. In contrast, the invertebrate neuroepithelium is re-organized as ommatidia develop. Laminar organisation of the vertebrate retina appears to be a consequence of initial polarisation of the retinal neuroepithelium. This is, however, challenging to test in the organismal context. To address the plasticity of retinal architecture and the impact of epithelial polarity on the structuring of retinal tissue, we take advantage of retinal organoids derived from medaka (Oryzias latipes) (Zilova et al., 2021) that allow to modulate polarity cues and test their impact on the level of epithelialization and structural organisation of the forming retina. We show that under specific culture conditions, medaka retinal organoids undergo a striking morphological switch depending on the level of apico-basal polarity imposed. When polarity cues are continuously provided, a laminated retinal epithelium is established in the organoid. The absence of polarity cues results in the formation of horizontal cellular clusters containing the retinal cell types, which form the vertical retinal column in the developing embryo. We demonstrate that the emergence of this alternative retinal architecture is associated with a loss of epithelial polarity, notably the absence of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as laminin, which efficiently rescues lamination. Our findings indicate that tissue-level polarization and lamination in vertebrate retinae require specific extrinsic cues, and that in their absence, differentiating retinal cell types self-organize into structurally distinct, retinal units. This reveals an unexpected plasticity in vertebrate retinal development and indicates a potential for alternative modes of retinal patterning.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

R.; Koslicki, D.", "abstract": "Increasing availability of genomic data demands algorithmic approaches that can efficiently and accurately conduct downstream genomic analyses. These analyses, such as evaluating selection pressures within and across genomes, can reveal developmental and environmental pressures. One such commonly used metric to measure evolutionary pressures is based on the ratio of non-synonymous and synonomous substitution rates, dN/dS. Conventionally, the dN/dS ratio is used to infer selection pressures employing alignments to estimate total non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates along protein-coding genes. However, this process can be time consuming and not scalable for larger datasets. Recently, a fast, approximate similarity measure, FracMinHash containment, was introduced and related to average nucleotide identity. In this work, we show how FracMinHash containment can be used to quickly estimate dN/dS enabling alignment-free estimations at a genomic level. Through simulated and real world experiments, our results indicate that employing FracMinHash containment to estimate $d_N/d_S$ is scalable, enabling pairwise dN/dS estimations for 85,205 genomes within 5 hours. Furthermore, our approach is comparable to traditional dN/dS methods, representing sequences subject to positive and negative selection across various mutation rates. Moreover, we used this model to evaluate signatures of selection between Archaeal and Bacterial genomes, identifying a previously unreported metabolic island between Methanobrevibacter sp. RGIG2411 and Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium RGIG2249.. We present, FracMinHash dN/dS, a novel alignment-free approach for estimating dN/dS at a genome level that is accurate and scalable beyond gene-level estimations while demonstrating comparability to conventional alignment-based dN/dS methods. Leveraging the alignment-free similarity estimation, FracMinHash containment, pairwise dN/dS estimations are facilitated within milliseconds, making it suitable for large-scale evolutionary analyses across diverse taxa.

Callus induction was achieved in 38.9% of explants, and 45.5% of embryogenic calli regenerated into plantlets producing leaves and radicles without requiring exogenous organogenesis-inducing hormones. The regenerated plants continued to develop further on MS + sucrose medium, confirming the totipotent capacity of mesocotyl-derived calli.

Though CNIH3 was identified as a gene of interest in OUD, its role in opioid use and accompanying risk factors has not been studied. Using mice with Cnih3 deletion, we assess the role of CNIH3 in risk factors for opioid use, cognition, and opioid use itself. We find that Cnih3 deletion moderately impairs spatial memory, reward-cue association, and reversal learning. Cnih3 deletion also impairs fentanyl-cue association and blunts fentanyl intake during IVSA. We use principal component analysis to pinpoint the dimensions in which Cnih3 deletion impacts behavior in an unbiased manner. Additionally, we identify in previously published human data that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are more protective against progression to daily opioid use in women than in men, suggesting a potential sex-specific role of CNIH3.

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed characteristic patterns of brain atrophy and microstructural alterations in MSA, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these imaging abnormalities remain poorly understood. The proteolipid protein-human -synuclein (PLP-Syn) transgenic mouse model reproduces key pathological and behavioral features of MSA and provides a valuable platform to dissect the biological substrates of MRI-detected changes and their relevance to disease mechanisms.\n\nMethodsWe performed the first whole-brain MRI characterization of the PLP-Syn model using ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with imaging alterations, we applied an imaging transcriptomics framework integrating MRI-derived phenotypes with more than 4,000 spatial gene expression maps from the Allen Brain Atlas. Gene ontology and cell-type enrichment analyses identified biological processes and cellular contributors linked to MRI changes, and imaging-correlated genes were compared with differentially expressed genes from cerebellar RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to assess molecular concordance.\n\nResultsPLP-Syn mice exhibited widespread brain atrophy involving the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and white matter tracts, closely mirroring neuroimaging findings in patients with MSA. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in major white matter tracts and increased mean diffusivity in the brainstem and cerebellum, reflecting distinct microstructural pathologies. Imaging transcriptomics linked these alterations to genes regulating myelination, gliogenesis, and neuroinflammation, strongly enriched for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte markers, while diffusivity changes were associated with neuronal connectivity and energy metabolism. Imaging-correlated gene signatures showed significant overlap with RNAseq-derived molecular profiles, reinforcing the biological validity of the imaging-derived mechanisms.\n\nConclusionsMRI sensitively detects MSA-like neurodegeneration in the PLP-Syn mouse, providing a translationally relevant platform to investigate the biological basis of imaging biomarkers. Integrating MRI with spatial transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MRI-detected alterations, advancing mechanistic understanding of MRI changes in MSA and establishing imaging transcriptomics as a powerful approach to bridge neuroimaging with molecular pathology in -synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Likewise, inflammatory mediators produced by immune cells are known to contribute to psychiatric diseases like major depressive disorder. Here we investigated the dynamic relationship between stress hormones and neutrophils and their contribution to mood disorders. We found that chronic restraint stress leads to plasma elevation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and increased NET formation in mice. Interestingly, the stress hormones, cortisol and epinephrine induce NET formation in human neutrophils ex vivo. Activation of neutrophils to form NETs leads to their increased expression of adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors and neutrophil production of both cortisol and epinephrine indicating an autocrine/paracrine mechanism for the regulation of neutrophil inflammatory response by stress hormones. Strikingly, administration of NET components to mice induces depressive-like behavior. Moreover, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in human volunteers leads to increase in gene expression of NET proteins.

Many translation factors are components of stress granules, but it is unclear how they contribute to granule assembly. Here we show that the eIF3d component of the eIF3 translation initiation complex is recruited to stress granules in human cells and is required for stress granule assembly in response to specific stresses. The RNA-binding domain of eIF3d mediates its recruitment to stress granules and deletion of this domain blocks granule formation and decreases cell viability. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of just the eIF3d RNA-binding domain can rescue stress granule assembly in eIF3d-depleted cells. We confirmed the importance of eIF3d for robust stress granule assembly in vivo using the nematode worm C. elegans.

To transmit force efficiently, both FA and SF contractility are built as clutches and in positive feedback with each other; conversely, the SF-engaging FA imposes a strong cell-ECM anchorage and must be disassembled timely to facilitate the cell migration. How the cell balances the two opposing roles of FA in cell migration is an open question. Particularly, it is not well-understood how a cell builds the FA de novo to clutch with SF and disassemble the clutches when needed in a coherent manner. Combining theory and experiments, we show that the entire life cycle of FA is seamlessly orchestrated by the FA-localized spatiotemporal coordination between retrograde actin flow and SF, without destroying the FA constituent molecules. Retrograde actin flow drives the centripetal growth of nascent FA, paving the way for SF engagement. The SF further stabilizes the growing FA into maturation via the positive feedback that clutches the contractility with the FA. Finally, the retrograde actin flow increase, in coupling to the local cell edge retraction, tugs the mature FA in the proximal direction that relaxes the associated SF contractility, turns off the clutching, and triggers the FA disassembly. Our finding sheds light on the organizational principles that cell streamlines the mechanochemical interplay between FA, actin cytoskeleton, and cell edge dynamics for efficient cell migration.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Multiple embryonic timing systems set the onset and pace of developmental events, and blocking transcription arrests many of these events. However, the genes comprising the vertebrate embryonic timing system(s) remain largely unknown. To identify genes whose expression changes with time alone, we examine naive zebrafish embryonic explants that form only two tissue types yet maintain developmental timing, thus uncoupling developmental age from most differentiation programs. By comparing longitudinal gene expression in naive explants with Nodal-induced explants that differentiate into all three germ layers, we identify \"timekeeping\" genes whose temporal expression patterns vary strictly with developmental age. Consensus clustering of temporally dynamic genes identified 20 gene clusters, termed \"chrono-constitutive modules\" (CCMs), that maintain distinct schedules of expression regardless of tissue type. These CCM trajectories are similar in intact zebrafish embryos and single embryonic cells of multiple distinct lineages. Enrichment analysis of microRNA targets and transcription factor regulons within the CCMs further reveal distinct putative regulators of several modules. Strikingly, CCM expression patterns are also largely conserved during early development of another fish species, Japanese medaka. Machine learning models trained on only zebrafish CCM transcript levels accurately predict the developmental age of embryonic explants, intact embryos, and even individual embryonic cells, demonstrating their utility in developmental timekeeping.

Utilizing a range of interdisciplinary methodologies, we show that sodium aurothiomalate (ATM), an FDA-approved drug, induces ferroptosis by covalently targeting GPX4 via formation of a selenenylsulfide bond. In preclinical models of neuroblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ATM combined with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) yields a synergistic effect, resulting in a significant reduction in tumor growth. Mechanistically, ATM disrupts GPX4 activity by covalently binding thiomalate to the active site selenocysteine, while modification of specific cysteine residues leads to destabilization of the protein and impaired binding to phospholipids. We propose that these covalent modifications are achieved through a unique reaction mechanism, in which the gold component of ATM acts as a thiol-masking carrier and is only transiently present, being subsequently displaced and allowing the reaction of the thiomalate moiety with the target selenocysteine or cysteine. Our data lay the foundation for development of novel, drug-like thiol-based GPX4 inhibitors.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

This study presents a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the RAD51-BRC repeats interaction, integrating computational and experimental approaches. Starting with assessing the correlation between the binding affinities of individual BRC repeats and their impact on RAD51 disassembly, our investigation extends to larger BRCA2 truncations, offering unprecedented insights into the molecular determinants of RAD51 recognition.

While mucosal IgA has been studied extensively, characterization of human IgA in serum and its distinctive functions lags behind. Circulatory IgA is regularly assumed to be monomeric, despite some reports describing a minor population of J-chain-coupled dimers. Here, we first charted the compositional landscape of human serum IgA in individual healthy donors. In addition to the expected predominating monomers, we consistently observed J-coupled dimers, even representing ~30% of one donors total serum IgA. To determine whether these structurally distinct populations were also clonally distinct, we employed mass spectrometry-based IgA1 clonal profiling in sera of two donors. Our data revealed the majority of IgA1 clones are present solely as monomers, with a smaller number exclusively dimeric. Strikingly, a third population of IgA1 clones is present in circulation as both monomers and J-coupled dimers. In fact, these shared, structurally-promiscuous IgA1 clones dominated both individuals serum IgA1 clonal repertoires. Our findings suggest likely every J+ IgA-secreting cell can co-produce monomers and J-coupled dimers, but what exactly determines this ratio requires further investigation. This finding is important, as IgA monomers and J-coupled dimers have distinct characteristics in antigen binding, receptor activation, and clearance from circulation, with several reports highlighting, for instance, the enhanced neutralization capacity of dimeric IgA.

Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, affects approximately 500 children annually in the United States with overall survival rates varying dramatically by subgroup.

MVP builds on contrastive multiview learning to capture mutual information across views, leading to more robust and generalizable representations for spectral annotation. Unlike prior approaches that consider multiple views via concatenation or as targets of auxiliary tasks, MVP learns from all views jointly, resulting in improved molecular candidate ranking. Notably, MVP supports annotation using either individual spectra or consensus spectra, enabling flexible use of multiple measurements. On the MassSpecGym benchmark, we show that annotation using query consensus spectra significantly outperforms rank aggregation strategies based on constituent spectrum annotation. Using the consensus spectrum view, MVP achieves 35.99% and 13.96% rank@1 when retrieving candidates by mass and formula, respectively.

Unfortunately, DOX also has some undesirable and off-target effects, particularly debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. The mechanism behind this DOX-induced skeletal myotoxicity (DISM) remains unclear. Here, we show that acute DOX exposure, at clinically relevant concentrations, impairs isometric force production and accelerates fatigue in ex vivo murine flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles. Mechanistically, we found that DOX increases the open probability of single RyR1 and disrupts calcium (Ca2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI). This results in a persistent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak, elevated basal cytosolic Ca2+, and abnormal Ca2+ release during action potentials. This abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling ultimately leads to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which, in turn, exacerbates the functional instability of RyR1. Interestingly, the cytosolic basal Ca2+ elevation precedes ROS generation, suggesting that it initiates a destructive cross-talk between Ca2+ dysregulation and oxidative stress. Notably, pharmacological stabilization of the RyR1-FKBP12 complex with novel triazole compounds, MP-001 and MP-034, normalizes RyR1 function, Ca2+ and ROS homeostasis, as well as muscle force and fatigue resistance. Our findings indicate that DISM is initiated by DOX destabilization of the RyR1-FKBP12 complex (abnormal SR Ca2+ leak) and then exacerbated by the Ca-ROS vicious cycle.

Advancing the speed and accuracy of spike sorting is essential to fully realize the potential of large-scale electrophysiology.

The same workflow can run reproducibly on individual workstations, high-performance computing clusters, or cloud environments, with computing resources tailored to each processing step to reduce costs and execution times.

Downstream effectors of GPCR signaling can directly stimulate TRPV channels or enhance their sensitivity to stimuli, a process known as TRPV sensitization. Traditionally, GPCRs are activated at the cell surface by extracellular agonists, triggering signaling cascades. Recent evidence suggests GPCRs continue to signal from intracellular organelles. The human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor X1 (MrGPRX1) is a GPCR expressed in primary sensory neurons involved in nociception and pruritus. Recent studies demonstrated how intracellular GPCR signaling regulates neuronal activity. However, there is no evidence characterizing MrGPRX1 trafficking or intracellular signaling. Herein, we characterized MrGPRX1 signaling within the endosomal network and its role in sensitizing TRPV1 channels to enhance itch signaling. Utilizing subcellular targeted biosensors, we demonstrated MrGPRX1 can traffic and signal from endosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MrGPRX1 internalizes following BAM8-22 stimulation. BRET assays revealed that MrGPRX1 activation induces Gq and {beta}-arrestin-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin blocked BAM8-22-induced MrGPRX1 endocytosis and decreased nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Calcium signaling confirmed that MrGPRX1-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is mediated by protein kinase C and ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel role for MrGPRX1 endosomal signaling in TRPV1 sensitization.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of MrGPRX1 signaling offers valuable insights into differentiating between pain and itch pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain and persistent itch.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we extend a neural mass model of EEG to capture transitions between wake-like and sleep-like dynamics and embed it in connectome-based networks with virtual lesions. This model supports that local disfacilitation, topology-dependent propagation, and synchrony-dependent amplification throughout the connectome are sufficient to produce post-lesional SWs.

Because PMHS brains undergo significant changes following death, it is important to understand the relationship between the mechanical properties of PMHS brain tissue and living tissue. In this study, we performed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) on three PMHS specimens to estimate the material properties of the cadaveric brain, namely the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as well as the resulting shear stiffness and damping ratio. We also performed longitudinal MRE scans on one of the PMHS over the span of two months to investigate the evolution of tissue properties with post-mortem degradation. In comparison to in vivo subjects of age range 70-75 years, a substantially higher stiffness (mean: 5.96kPa) and lower damping ratio (mean: 0.09) were found in PMHS models. This study also revealed an initial increase in shear stiffness up to the seventh day post-mortem, followed by a steady decrease by the fifty-eighth day.

Therapeutic Inducers of Natural Killer cell Killing represent a novel class of immunotherapy designed to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with high-risk or relapse leukemia. Our previous work identified high expression of TRAIL as a key signature of NK cell stimulation by ThINKK. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying leukemia killing by ThINNK-stimulated NK cells, and to identify predictive sensitivity markers of this innovative approach. Methods. We performed NK cell cytotoxic assays using a panel of genetically diverse leukemia cell lines and patients' samples. Gene deletion and gene enforced expression in sensitive or resistant cell lines were performed to demonstrate the role of TRAIL-receptors expression and death receptor signaling pathway in leukemoia killing by ThINKK-stimulated NK cells. These findings were further validated through the analysis of primary patients' samples and transcriptomic profiling of a cohort of 320 leukemia patients. Results. We found that ALL sensitivity to ThINKK-stimulated NK cell killing was independent of their genetic background or their expression of HLA. In addition, our data revealed the dual role of TRAIL: first, a strong NK cell activating receptor that induced rapid cell death of leukemia expressing TRAIL-R2, and second, a death-receptor ligand inducing ALL apoptosis following sustained engagement with its receptors. The transcriptomic analysis of ALL patients' samples indicated that TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R1 are widely expressed across leukemia subtypes and are not downregulated at relapse. Conclusion.

While antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) have been implicated in antiviral activity, the extent to which these functions vary across bNAb epitopes, viral strains, and Fc region remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluated twenty bNAbs targeting five distinct Env epitopes against a diverse panel of nine HIV-1 strains. We found that epitope specificity and Env sequence both critically influenced bNAb effector functions. CD4 binding site (CD4bs)- and V3 glycan-targeting bNAbs mediated the broadest and most potent ADCC and ADCP, while V1/V2 apex-directed bNAbs preferentially induced ADCP. In contrast, MPER-targeting bNAbs triggered ADCC more selectively, and gp120/gp41 interface-targeting bNAbs showed limited activity. Irrespective of binding epitope, different strains exhibited a broad range of effector function sensitivities. To investigate the impact of Fc modifications on this variability, we subclass-switched and introduced previously identified Fc mutations known to change Fc{gamma} receptor affinity. Some of these mutations significantly boosted ADCC, while IgG3 subclass switching dramatically enhanced ADCP, even against highly resistant strains.

Across all kingdoms of life, protein complexes frequently assemble co-translationally, either when one subunit is fully synthesized before interaction with nascent partner subunits (co-post) or when multiple nascent subunits interact co-translationally (co-co), with homomeric proteins particularly enriched among co-co assembling complexes. However, it is unknown whether co-co assembly of homomers occurs on the same mRNA in cis or across neighboring mRNAs in trans, and how ribosomes spatially organize to enable co-co assembly. Using E. coli homodimeric protein PheA as a proof-of-concept model, we show by ribosome profiling and cryo-EM structural analysis that it employs the co-co assembly route. Co-co assembly of PheA is facilitated by the proximity of polypeptide exit tunnels, but does not rely on fixed ribosomal orientations. Surprisingly, we identified trans-assembly as potentially the primary mode of PheA co-co assembly, generating large polysomal networks for PheA synthesis. Cis-assembly of PheA was less frequent and occurred mainly between non-adjacent ribosomes on the mRNA due to spatial restraints imposed by the arrangement of directly neighboring ribosomes in polysomes.

We tested the N-Views method on chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs, comparing its accuracy with 2 other existing optical measurement methods (Photogrammetry and Silhouette). Across all tested methods, N-Views provided the best estimate of egg volume when compared with the reference manual measurements (Archimedean buoyancy force), resulting in a MAE of 125 mm3 and 1.03% and 0.28% relative error for Coturnix and Gallus eggs, respectively. We further quantified the sensitivity of the N-Views and Silhouette methods to error sources arising from perspective and egg-camera alignment, highlighting the characteristics needed in optical measurement protocols for the estimation of egg geometries. Finally, we discuss the transferability of the N-Views method to the size estimation of microscopic arthropod eggs. This novel approach opens a new door for the non-intrusive exploration of relationships between egg size and life history traits in avian and arthropod species.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Whether HP1 in molecular terms works primarily via dimerization or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is unresolved. Using the C. elegans HP1 orthologue HPL-2 and a combined in vitro-in vivo approach, we systematically dissected the molecular determinants of HPL-2 function in heterochromatin condensation. Through specific mutants, we demonstrate that HPL-2 dimerization, but not LLPS, is essential for condensing H3K9me chromatin arrays in vitro and for maintaining H3K9me heterochromatin foci in C. elegans embryos. We further show that HPL-2 dimerization is sufficient to mediate segregation of H3K9me from unmodified chromatin arrays in vitro, generating biphasic condensates reminiscent of cellular heterochromatin domains. Surprisingly, HPL-2 mutants defective in condensation cause only minor transcriptional changes at canonical heterochromatin loci, implying that HP1-dependent heterochromatin foci and gene silencing are not tightly coupled in vivo. Nonetheless, these mutant C. elegans exhibit profound physiological and developmental defects. Our findings establish dimerization as the principal molecular mechanism of HP1-driven H3K9me-chromatin condensation, elucidate the auxiliary role of LLPS, and reveal the uncoupling between HP1-dependent heterochromatin and transcriptional regulation.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/687974v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8c7584org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1772e6aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1885bf5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d4d48_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that regulate lipid storage and metabolism pathways central to metabolic liver disease. LD turnover occurs in part through lysosomal catabolism (i.e. lipophagy) whereby LDs are thought to follow two distinct trafficking pathways: autophagosome-dependent macrolipophagy and the autophagosome-independent microlipophagy. However, the molecular machinery that regulates these two distinct pathways, especially that of microlipophagy in mammalian cells, is poorly understood. In yeast, microlipophagy has been shown to rely on a protein family known as the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Here, we used an ESCRT-specific RNAi library in hepatocytes which identified the ESCRT-0 protein hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate (HRS) as a critical regulator of LD homeostasis. HRS depletion leads to significant LD accumulation which is not due to increased LD formation but from impaired LD catabolism. HRS-deficient cells retain lipolysis activity; however, they exhibit decreased LD targeting via microlipophagy, accompanied by compensatory increases in autophagosome targeting to LDs. In agreement with these findings, HRS knockdown suppressed mTOR signaling, boosted autophagosome formation, and reduced the degradation of autophagic cargo. Despite maintaining lysosome numbers, HRS knockdown raised lysosomal pH causing decreased autophagic degradative capacity and contributing to LD accumulation. Overall, these findings identify HRS as a modulator of LD turnover in mammalian cells, regulating lipophagy through lysosomal function.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Using liquid chromatography, iECM is separated into a high molecular weight (MW) and low MW component. Mass spectrometry confirms compositional similarity, while biochemical assays and transmission electron microscopy highlight differences in biochemical features and structure, revealing a nanofibrillar high MW component and a globular peptide low MW. Quartz crystal microbalance studies show binding of each component to basal lamina ECM proteins and endothelial cell surface receptors under flow, demonstrating the specificity of ECM biomaterials to permeable vasculature. In vivo, the low MW component reduces vascular permeability, while neither component alone achieves the retention levels of complete iECM. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing to probe bioactivity, both components elicited comparable angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and pro-reparative transcriptional programs.

To address this challenge, we conducted a study using fluorescent DNA calibrator beads to test, calibrate, and compare the sensitivity of five different flow cytometers. Our approach involves DNA beads produced through a bottom-up DNA origami method. These beads contain a defined number of fluorophores (0-220) and exhibit no autofluorescence. Fluorophores are precisely conjugated onto the beads in a controlled array, minimizing dye interactions. This allows triggering on one fluorophore and calibration based on another, facilitating precise and accurate calibration in absolute fluorophore numbers.

R.; Scalise, K. L.; Esch, R. M.; Nevo, L.; Goldhamer, D. J.", "abstract": "The rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) of skeletal muscles and associated soft tissues. FOP is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the type l BMP receptor ACVR1 (ALK2) that renders the receptor inappropriately responsive to activin ligands. HO is associated with muscle destruction and compromised muscle regeneration, although little is known of the mechanistic relationship between these pathophysiological disease manifestations. In mouse FOP models, HO is experimentally induced by direct injury to muscle using chemical or mechanical means, thereby obscuring the relationship between HO formation and muscle destruction. We show that direct muscle injury is not required for induction of a robust HO response. Rather, a small incision in the fascia superior to the tibialis anterior muscle was sufficient to induce HO when fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) were targeted for Acvr1R206H expression. Intermuscular fascial layers were the primary sites of lesional growth when HO was exacerbated by genetic, pharmacological, or physical means. In contrast to control mice, fascial injury in FOP mice caused pronounced destruction of the muscle subjacent to the injured fascia. Further, areas of muscle degeneration did not undergo a productive regenerative response. Unlike most models of impaired regeneration, adipocyte accumulations were not observed in areas of muscle degeneration, which were destined for pathological bone formation. These data point to the primary role of fascia in HO initiation and growth, and indicate that Acvr1R206H-expressing FAPs directly or indirectly create an abnormal tissue environment that destabilizes muscle tissue and is incompatible with muscle regeneration. The advantages of this new model of injury-induced HO for understanding early events in FOP pathogenesis are discussed.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

The ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region involved in reward learning, and the lateral habenula (LHb), a region involved in aversive learning, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders. Here, we seek to understand the molecular adaptations in these regions at the level of single cells that mediate susceptibility versus resilience. In particular, it remains unclear whether, at the level of gene expression, different cell types within different brain regions mediate stress susceptibility versus resilience, or if these phenotypes are mediated by distinct trajectories within the same cell types. To address this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of LHb and VTA of mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. While we found minimal gene expression changes in the LHb after stress, the VTA exhibited widespread, cell type-specific transcriptional remodeling in resilient individuals and few gene expression changes in susceptible individuals. Across VTA cell types, resilience was associated with the coordinated upregulation of genes involved in intercellular signaling and neural communication, with maintenance of receptor-ligand interaction strength in resilience that was not present in susceptibility. Within VTA neurons, gene expression changes were most prominent in glutamatergic and dopaminergic clusters. Multivariate analyses of dopamine and glutamate subclusters showed that resilient neurons diverged more from control than susceptible neurons, but along a similar trajectory, supporting a model in which resilience reflects greater stress-related adaptations in these cell types. Together, these findings highlight the VTA as a key site of molecular plasticity in stress resilience and therefore a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single neuron and population levels: direct measurements suggest that the population code is high-dimensional, but current understanding of single-cell tuning curves implies low dimensionality. To reconcile this discrepancy, we used AI to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for tuning curves to oriented stimuli. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs, and evolved using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their fits to single-cell tuning. This resulted in an equation that not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code's high-dimensional structure, even though population dimensionality was not the AI system's objective. This high-dimensionality occurred because the AI-derived tuning curves were not smooth at their peaks, which we proved is mathematically required for high-dimensional population coding of low-dimensional stimuli. We used the AI-generated tuning equation to demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional codes in a simulated hyperacuity task, and showed that non-smooth peaks are also present in other brain systems, leading to high-dimensional population coding in head direction cells. These results suggest that the smoothness of neuronal tuning curves has an important role in setting the dimensionality of the population code, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can accelerate scientific theory building in neuroscience and beyond.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Inhibition has been proposed to protect NL neurons from losing ITD sensitivity with increasing sound level, although the nature of this inhibition is incompletely understood. Anatomical studies show GABAergic synapses throughout NL and the first order nuclei, while in vitro studies in chicken NL showed that depolarizing, GABAergic IPSPs shorten membrane time constants, perhaps to allow the membrane potential to follow rapid synaptic currents accurately over a range of sound levels. Given the importance of inhibition in regulating auditory brainstem activity, we examined the nature of the inhibitory input to NL in vivo. The Superior Olivary Nucleus (SON) is the major source of descending GABAergic inhibition to the ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus angularis (NA) and NL, and receives excitatory input from NA and NL. We used viral tracers to reveal projections from SON to NL, and characterized response types within SON. In NL, we isolated inhibitory synaptic currents from extracellular field potentials through the iontophoretic application of blockers of GABA (gabazine) or glycine (strychnine). These blockers increase the onset and offset responses evoked by tonal stimuli, but did not shift best ITD. The co-application of gabazine and strychnine revealed supra-linear summation of GABA and glycine. Profiles of synaptic activation revealed more prominent inhibition following stimulus offset, suggesting inputs to NL originate from both the sustained and offset response types of the SON. These heterogeneous responses may represent separate SON neuronal populations.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

MDM promoted the formation of lumenized capillary networks, an effect reproduced by iPSC-derived macrophages and the THP-1 monocyte line. In contrast, organoids without MDM displayed only transient endothelial differentiation that coincided with transient VEGFA upregulation and that regressed during maturation. MDM counteracted this transient phase by releasing soluble Neuropilin-1 (sNRP1), which sequestered VEGFA and stabilized late endothelial development, evidenced by sustained CD31 promoter activity.

To ensure postural stability and effective movement, animals must appropriately regulate their responses to such vibratory disturbances. Therefore, understanding how animals respond to vibration is of growing importance. However, compared with humans, knowledge of mouse responses to WB vibration remains limited, as previous studies have primarily examined anesthetized or euthanized mice. Here, we used high-speed video-based quantitative analyses to characterize body part movements in both awake and anesthetized mice under vertical, longitudinal, and lateral WB vibration. Awake mice exhibited lower resonance frequencies and smaller displacement amplitudes than anesthetized mice during both vertical and lateral WB vibration, whereas longitudinal WB vibration produced minimal differences. These results indicate that the active neuro-musculoskeletal (NMS) system contributes to postural stability in a vibration axis-dependent manner. Axis-specific vibration control may reflect an evolutionarily acquired balance between postural stability and locomotor efficiency. Vibration modeling further suggests that the NMS system acts as a vibration absorber by reducing stiffness and providing feedback-controlled active damping, analogous to active vehicle suspensions. Behavioral preference tests revealed that mice selectively avoid vertical WB vibration at specific frequencies, but not lateral or longitudinal vibration, regardless of resonance frequencies. These findings suggest that resonated body part displacement during WB vibration do not directly determine vibration discomfort, and that vertical WB vibration along the gravitational axis exerts a distinct impact on postural control and behavior in mice. This study provides new insights into the biomechanics and behavior of quadrupeds exposed to WB vibration, with analogies to four-wheeled vehicles offering a useful perspective.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) have emerged as powerful probes for intracellular microrheology; however, current analyses rely on single-particle tracking, which is limited by probe density, imaging noise, and expression variability. Here, we combine GEMs with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) to enable quantitative, non-invasive, and rapid measurement of intracellular viscosity using standard wide-field fluorescence imaging. DDM extracts particle dynamics from ensemble spatiotemporal intensity fluctuations, yielding reliable diffusion coefficients and viscosity values even in crowded or heterogeneous environments where tracking fails. Validation with fluorescent nanoparticles diffusing in water confirmed that DDM accurately reproduced theoretical viscosities across a wide range of particle sizes and concentrations. Comparison with single-particle tracking (SPT) demonstrated equivalent precision under dilute conditions and superior robustness under crowding. To showcase the potential of this approach, we applied GEM-DDM to colorectal cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Cytoplasmic viscosity correlated with aggressiveness, increasing from 1.9-2.3 cP in poorly metastatic to 3.6-3.7 cP in highly metastatic lines, consistent with greater macromolecular crowding and cytoplasmic reorganization reported in aggressive cells. Together, these results establish GEM-DDM as a fast, reproducible, and accessible platform for intracellular microrheology, providing new opportunities to link the physical state of the cytoplasm to cell function and disease progression.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of large-scale genetic and metabolic networks remains an open area of research with profound implications for understanding biochemical signaling systems in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this work, we extend the biochemical modeling framework based on the Power Law formalism, originally developed by M.A. Savageau to elucidate design principles in small bacterial networks. This formalism captures gene regulation and metabolic fluxes through two fundamental sets of parameters: kinetic parameters and kinetic orders. The kinetic parameters determine the magnitudes of fluxes, while the kinetic orders appearing as exponents in the power-law representation encode the regulatory structure of the system. We propose a mathematical technique to characterize the entire family of systems associated with the space of kinetic orders. We show that this exponent space possesses a well-defined structure in toric geometry and can therefore be modeled using algebraic varieties. To represent large-scale networks, we associate a toric variety with each polynomial equation of the system and then use geometric techniques to coherently combine these varieties into a global structure, or fan. This construction enables a modular and geometrically consistent representation of complex biochemical networks.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Objective: Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19)-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is a severe genetic epilepsy that manifests with early-onset cluster seizures often triggered by fever, intellectual disability, autistic features, and later neuropsychiatric risk. PCDH19 is an X-linked gene critical for brain development. PCE predominantly affects females and rare mosaic males, but not hemizygous males, likely due to cellular mosaicism arising from random X-inactivation and resultant segregation of wild-type and mutant neurons (so-called cellular interference) during development. We generated a novel PCE mouse model and explored neuronal segregation, seizure susceptibility and cortical interneuron distributions. Methods: Female Pcdh19+/- mice were crossed with X-GFP males to visualize random X-inactivation patterns. Seizure susceptibility was assessed in juvenile mice using hyperthermia and flurothyl exposure. Behavioral testing evaluated cognitive domains. Interneuron distribution in hippocampus and cortex was examined histologically by immunolabeling and crosses with parvalbumin reporter mice. Results: Juvenile Pcdh19+/- females lacked spontaneous seizures but displayed lower seizure thresholds and more severe seizures during hyperthermia. Seizure susceptibility did not differ from controls after flurothyl exposure. Pcdh19+/- females also exhibited segregation of GFP+ cells in the cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and medial ganglionic eminence, with a marked reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal region. Although parvalbumin interneuron density was unchanged in the Pcdh19+/- female cortex overall, localized decreases arose in GFP- (Pcdh19 knockout) cortical stripes. Interpretation: Juvenile PCE mice exhibit seizure susceptibility to hyperthermia and disrupted the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings suggest focal parvalbumin interneuron alterations may contribute to PCE pathophysiology.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Organisms have access to a limited amount of energy that must be distributed among multiple physiological processes. Broadly, the total daily energy expenditure (DEE) can be partitioned into maintenance costs (i.e., resting metabolic rate RMR) and active energy expenditure (AEE). The slope (b) between DEE and RMR provides insights into energy management strategies. In the additive model, where changes in activity are independent of maintenance energy, DEE and RMR follow a part-whole relationship with b=1. In the allocation model, where increased activity requires compensatory reductions in maintenance costs, a limit on DEE causes a DEE-RMR relationship with b<1. In the performance model, increased activity causes an increase in maintenance costs, which causes a DEE-RMR relationship with b>1). Despite their high lifetime energy expenditure and resistance to age-related metabolic decline, energy management is yet to be explored in the African naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber). To investigate metabolic strategies in the NMR, repeated metabolic and activity measurements were taken in 32 individual NMRs using a multiplexed metabolic system. DEE was not repeatable, thus the DEE-RMR covariances at the among-individual level could not be fitted. At the within-individual level, however, the positive correlation between RMR and activity and the DEE-RMR relationship with b > 1) indicated support for the performance model. Hence, our results indicate that within-individual changes in activity and RMR are associated, suggesting that when a NMR increases activity on a given day, the impact on DEE are disproportionate because of a concurrent increase RMR.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Although fungal nematode antagonists are regularly detected in soils worldwide, their global distribution has not been systematically documented. We mined a global fungal dataset comprising nearly 28,000 samples from 484 studies focusing on biomes and sample types that might comprise nematode antagonists. After selecting DNA read data that allowed for fungal identification until the species level, we showed that 82.6% of the soil samples contained one or more nematode antagonist. Antagonist presence differed among biomes; the probability of detecting antagonists was highest in croplands and other anthropogenically disturbed biomes (86%), whereas samples from deserts and tundra showed relatively low detection probability (respectively 20% and 6%). Our analyses revealed that most of the common nematode antagonists show barely any biogeography; their presence in all continents underlines the enormous ecological flexibility of these fungal species. Remarkably, half of fungal antagonist species present in a selection of the six most common taxa across all biomes, were also most prevalent in a single biome, croplands. With one exception, Chaetomium globosum, the most frequently detected antagonistic fungi belonged to a single fungal order, the Hypocreales. These common and widespread nematode antagonists all parasitize representatives of fungi and insects as well. Next, we also investigated the commonness and the global distribution of microbial antagonists that are frequently applied as biological control agents against plant-parasitic nematodes. Species such as Purpureocillium lilacinum, Metacordyceps chlamydosporium, and Trichoderma harzianum were detected in 6 - 23% of the cropland samples, and occurred on all continents. Analysis of the impact of mean annual temperature and annual precipitation on the most common nematode antagonists in croplands revealed that, except for Trichoderma asperellum, all were promoted by higher temperatures, and inhibited by higher annual precipitation. Insights in the prevalence and the distribution of specific and non-specific nematode antagonists at a global scale, especially in croplands, might contribute to the exploration of the nematode-suppressive potential that is more common than often assumed.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Chromatin quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) can address this challenge by revealing the effects of disease-linked genetic variants on regulatory element activity. Discovering cQTLs in disease-relevant tissues at scale remains challenging, however. To address this limitation, we leveraged advances in epigenomic liquid biopsy. We profiled histone modifications in circulating chromatin from patients with cancer to identify cell-free chromatin QTLs (cfcQTLs). By sampling cancer-derived chromatin in plasma, we captured cfcQTLs affecting regulatory elements from diverse non-hematologic tissues, as well as developmentally restricted elements that are reactivated in cancer (enriched 16-fold). Applying a cistrome-wide association study (CWAS), we linked 4,891 cfcQTLs to 1,011 traits and diseases. Developmentally restricted cfcQTLs that were not found in white blood cells were associated with 22.7 traits per 100 QTLs, compared to 0.58 for WBC-restricted cQTLs, underscoring the power of cfcQTLs for capturing genetic variation that shapes phenotypes. We extended our approach beyond germline variants to non-coding somatic mutations in cancer by measuring the activating effects of TERT promoter mutations from circulating chromatin.

In a 27-day mesocosm experiment, plants were exposed to fluctuating temperatures representing a severe MHW (23.5 {+/-} 1.5 {degrees}C) and an extreme MHW (26.5 {+/-} 1.5 {degrees}C), while photosynthetic performance, respiration, nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress, and growth were monitored during and after warming. Phyllospadix scouleri maintained photosynthetic capacity and carbon balance under severe warming but exhibited pronounced physiological disruption at extreme temperatures, including sustained photoinhibition, reduced nitrate assimilation, elevated respiration, and negative daily productivity. These effects persisted after heat stress, leading to reduced growth and indicating incomplete recovery. Multivariate analyses revealed a distinct transition from tolerance to functional breakdown near 26.5 {degrees}C, suggesting a physiological tipping point only 5-6 {degrees}C above current summer maxima in the area of the studied population.

The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a non-invasive MRI marker of glymphatic flow, although its biological specificity remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the determinants of DTI-ALPS and evaluate whether it primarily reflects white matter (WM) microstructure rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration. 1.2 Methods We examined 100 individuals referred to the Memory Clinic of the Policlinico Hospital in Milan for suspected dementia. All participants underwent a 3T-MRI protocol including 3D-T1-weighted and 3D-FLAIR imaging, double-shell diffusion-weighted imaging (b=1000/2000 s/mm2), and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences for quantitative susceptibility mapping. Within standard DTI-ALPS ROIs, we extracted DTI-ALPS values together with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MA) at both b-values, as well as neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, particularly the orientation dispersion index (ODI). WM microstructure was further characterized using the T1/FLAIR ratio and diamagnetic component of susceptibility (DCS). 1.3 Results and conclusions DTI-ALPS correlated inversely with MA (r = -0.84 at b = 1000; r = -0.86 at b = 2000) and positively with ODI (r = 0.73). Moderate correlations with the T1/FLAIR ratio and DCS supported sensitivity to WM alterations.

This progress was made possible by foundational gene discovery efforts in model species and natural apomicts, but pleiotropic obstacles still limit its broad agricultural adoption, especially in eudicots. Thus, it follows that investigations of novel apomicts will lead to the development of new molecular tools for plant breeding. The three most common ways to identify clonal seed production are cytoembryological analyses, genome sequencing to compare the DNA sequence of mother and child, and flow-cytometry seed screens. While flow-cytometry has been the dominant method for more than two decades, it requires specialized equipment, expertise, and occasional troubleshooting. Here we developed a method using short-read skim-seq at moderately low sequencing depths (3X and 6X) to screen diverse Malus (apple, Rosaceae) genotypes maintained in a USDA germplasm collection for clonal seed production. By sequencing 55 genotypes and 1,216 of their embryos, our screening-by-sequencing method found 17 previously undescribed apomictic genotypes. Five additional apomictic genotypes were detected with flow cytometry data and using internal sequencing controls.

For this, we utilize the T7 promoter as a positive control and the Mango III RNA aptamer for fluorescent readout of transcription in an in vitro setup. First, DNA templates are compartmentalized into picolitre droplets along with rolling circle amplification reagents and incubated off-chip.

In the present study, we further found that compared with ISKNV-WT, the ISKNV-{Delta}71 mutant is more capable of maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, alleviating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, preserving mitochondrial membrane integrity, sustaining lower cytochrome c release, and thereby reducing the apoptosis rate of infected cells.

Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, VDAC2-knockout zebrafish were successfully constructed. Infection experiments showed that ISKNV-{Delta}71 exhibits significantly reduced lethality to both wild-type zebrafish and zfVDAC2-knockout zebrafish. In conclusion, our findings reveal that p71 exerts its function during ISKNV infection by hijacking VDAC2 into the nucleus, which alters mitochondrial membrane permeability and enhances ISKNV-induced apoptosis. The phenotypic characteristics of VDAC2 knockout (vdac-/-) zebrafish were also thoroughly analyzed and discussed.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

To investigate the connection between the bacterial physiological activity and the host environment during the early stages of bacterial infections, we have established a dual-fluorescent reporter system to monitor growth activity of P. aeruginosa during infection of a human airway epithelial model. This approach enables quantitative and spatially resolved analysis of bacterial growth within distinct infection micro-niches. Using this infection model, we compared the infection routes for the reference strain PAO1 as well as for two patho-adaptive mutants, PAO1{Delta}pscC ({Delta}pscC) and PAO1{Delta}mexZ ({Delta}mexZ). All three strains colonized apical-, intracellular-, interepithelial-, and epithelial barrier breach sites, but with strain-specific patterns of localisation. PAO1 was rarely observed intracellularly, {Delta}pscC was detected in few cases at epithelial-barrier breach- and interepithelial sites, and {Delta}mexZ colonized apical and intracellular niches in only few cases. Measurements of bacterial growth activities in these niches further revealed distinct hierarchies of bacterial growth activity among the tissue sites: PAO1 bacteria were most active at epithelial-barrier breach sites, {Delta}pscC at interepithelial sites, and {Delta}mexZ in intracellular niches. Taken together, these data support a model in which P. aeruginosa follows a progressive infection continuum from apical colonization to barrier breach, involving interepithelial spread, whereas the mutant strains represented truncated or altered versions of this infection program. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of unstable fluorescent reporters for capturing dynamic, niche-specific growth activity patterns during host-pathogen interactions, with implications for both basic pathogenesis research and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that M-Sec promotes the production of infectious HIV-1 virus. The major viral structural protein Gag distributed as many puncta in infected cells, which is one of the indicators of viral particle formation. The knockdown of M-Sec hindered the Gag puncta formation and co-localization of Gag with the viral envelope protein Env in cells, and reduced the amount of Env and infectivity of the produced virus. Consistent with these results, the over-expression of M-Sec induced the accumulation of Gag puncta, Gag/Env co-localization, and Env incorporation into virus and viral infectivity. M-Sec is known to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and a small GTPase Ral, both of which were required for the M-Sec-mediated HIV-1 regulation. The exocyst complex, which is the downstream effector of Ral, was also required for the M-Sec-mediated HIV-1 regulation. Because PIP2, Ral and the exocyst complex are important for the M-Sec-mediated formation of the long plasma membrane protrusions, the present study suggests that M-Sec promotes HIV-1 transmission by acting on both cell structures and viral production through these overlapping components.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host phagocyte, we show that Mycobacterium marinum rapidly sheds its envelope components, including surface proteins, carbohydrates, and virulence-associated lipids, within minutes of uptake. Shed material is actively trafficking within host endocytic pathways and disseminates to neighboring bystander cells, where it accumulates and triggers several responses. Notably, bystander cells exposed to shed material exhibit a transient delay in G1/S cell cycle progression, an activation of membrane damage-response pathways, and an enhanced resistance to subsequent mycobacterial infection. These phenotypes are recapitulated by infection-free conditioning with purified envelope extracts, demonstrating that superficial components of the envelope alone are sufficient to modulate host cell responses. Moreover, this priming effect is independent of bacterial viability or the Esx-1 secretion systems, underscoring the intrinsic immunomodulatory capacity of the envelope. Interestingly, bacteria that lose their outer layer are more frequently ubiquitinated, suggesting that host-driven stripping exposes molecules that are recognized by cytosolic sensors to mount a cell-autonomous defense. Together, our findings reveal that mycobacterial envelope shedding is a widespread, early event during intracellular infection that impacts both infected and bystander cells. These findings suggest that mycobacterial outermost envelope components can influence host cell physiology and contribute to early innate immune modulation, with implications for understanding the initial determinants of infection outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Although the genome of Mtb was sequenced nearly 25 years ago, the genetic basis of Mtbs success as a human pathogen remains to be fully elucidated. Large-scale genetic approaches to understanding gene function are hindered by the limited throughput of traditional transposon sequencing strategies used in mycobacteria. To create a resource for determining the function of genes, we generated a pooled random barcode transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) library in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). A unique twenty-nucleotide barcode in the transposon allows for rapid, high-throughput genetic screening without the laborious protocol of standard bacterial TnSeq screens. We performed 95 RB-TnSeq screens on an array of carbon sources, nitrogen sources, stressors, and antibiotics. Using the resulting dataset, we examined phenotypes of PE/PPE genes, a mycobacterial gene family whose function has long been elusive, uncovering 187 novel phenotypes across 37 genes in this family. We propose a pathway for lactate utilization in which the ESX-5 type VII secretion system exports PPE3, facilitating the import of D- and L-lactate into the bacterial cell. Notably, we identify a candidate D-lactate dehydrogenase that may mediate this metabolic capability. Additionally, we find that the proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase Nuo is required for utilization of propionate, highlighting the metabolic flexibility of Mtb.

Small RNAs and RNA fragments (sRNA) can potentially provide higher detection sensitivity and specificity than ctDNA. Sequencing analysis of the variety of sRNAs representing the entire RNA fragmentome would improve our understanding of their roles in cancer development and help to discover novel sRNA biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and personalized treatments. However, conventional methods of sRNA-Seq library preparation are limited to detection of sRNA with 5'-P and 3'-OH ends that represent only less than 10% of the whole RNA fragmentome, whereas sRNAs having different phosphorylation statuses (P or OH) of their termini are hidden. Although recently developed sRNA-Seq methods allow detection of most sRNA (including the hidden ones) simultaneously, these methods cannot both detect and distinguish among the individual RNAs with differing termini combinations (RNA Types). Here we describe the RiboMarker(R) platform for preparation of sRNA sequencing libraries that addresses these shortcomings.

PRDX1-null mice exhibited genomic instability, shortened lifespan, and accelerated tumorigenesis, including development of lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas. Despite extensive characterization of these phenotypes, the molecular mechanism by which PRDX1 loss causes genomic instability remains poorly understood. Here we show that PRDX1 deficiency alters nucleolar morphology, impairs RNA Polymerase I (POL-I)-dependent transcription of pre-ribosomal RNAs and triggers nucleolar genomic instability. This oxidative stress-induced nucleolar dysfunction promotes the stability of secondary DNA structures, such as RNA-DNA hybrids and G-quadruplex DNA, contributing to nucleolar genomic instability. We demonstrate that PRDX1 loss reduces nascent rRNA levels and impairs rRNA processing, further affecting ribosome biogenesis. Mechanistically, we established that PRDX1 loss triggers activation of the nucleolar DNA damage response including activation of DNA repair kinase ATM and the nucleolar factor TCOF1 within the nucleolus, and recruitment of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex subunit NBS1 to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. NBS1 accumulation correlates with the repression of rDNA transcription by POL-I, potentially delaying rRNA synthesis, and safeguarding the nucleolar genome from further oxidative damage. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized, but critical role, for PRDX1 in maintaining nucleolar integrity and ribosomal biogenesis through redox-dependent regulation of rDNA transcription and processing machinery.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

While previous studies focused on how innovation generates cultural diversity, we investigated whether ecological theory, specifically the invasion criterion for understanding species coexistence in community ecology, could predict the maintenance of cultural diversity under various social learning biases. Using mathematical and individual-based models, we showed that the invasion criterion reliably predicts the duration of coexistence in the stochastic dynamics of multiple cultural traits under content-, conformity-, and anticonformity-biased social learning as well as under unbiased learning. The invasion criterion predicted moderate cultural coexistence under two types of model-biased social learning: prestige and success biases. In contrast, similarity-biased social learning, where people tend to learn from those with the same ``tag'' traits (e.g., gender, language), breaks the predictive power of the invasion criterion because the cultural traits were associated with the tag traits. Our results demonstrate that ecological theory offers valuable tools for understanding cultural evolution, but modifications are required to account for dynamic learning environments. Our model also showed that increasing the number of cultural models can prolong cultural coexistence under certain biases, with implications for fostering innovation and preserving culture.

We identified and quantified dozens of neuronal tRNA modifications using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), revealing characteristic distributions of select small RNA modifications across different neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Upon behavioral habituation of the siphon-elicited siphon withdrawal reflex (SSWR), we found that tRNA modification profiles in the major ganglion that controls the SSWR were repatterned with predictable, learning-related changes.

These tRNA modification dynamics occurred independently of changes in expression of their parent tRNAs, illustrating that behavioral habituation alters the activity of tRNA-modifying enzymes.

Performance scales with model size from 150M to 600M parameters, and E1 can be used flexibly in single-sequence or retrieval-augmented inference mode for fitness prediction, variant ranking, and embeddings for structural tasks. To encourage open science and further development in retrieval-augmented protein language models, we release three models for free research and commercial use at https://github.com/Profluent-AI/E1.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Conjugative plasmids which play a role in the natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. In this work, we have demonstrated the first protocol for delivering DNA from Escherichia coli to the filamentous phytopathogen, Ustilago maydis through conjugation. DNA delivery was confirmed using PCR screening of DNA isolated from the re-streaked transconjugants.

Although cortico-cortical reorganization is widely established, changes in interhemispheric striatal connections following ischemia remain poorly understood, even when stroke occurs in motor areas. Given the importance of the striatum to motor function, we investigated network-level striatal coupling in stroke using ultrafast resting-state fMRI, which has recently been shown to facilitate the dissection of synchronous oscillatory activity better than its conventional ~1 sec time-resolution counterparts. Methods: A cohort of (N=18) sedated rats were randomized and N=9 rats underwent unilateral photothrombotic ischemic lesioning in motor cortex. One week after the lesion, when plasticity and recovery are well established, all animals were scanned on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a cryogenic coil using an ultrafast resting-state functional MRI sequence with temporal resolution of 90 ms. Data were collected for 24 minutes, and spectral power, phase locking, and functional connectivity were quantified. Histology was performed to confirm lesion extent. Results: While cortico-cortical power, connectivity and synchrony were diminished one week post-stroke as expected, we surprisingly found increased striato-striatal power, synchrony and functional connectivity in the stroked group compared with the control group. In stroked animals, the spectral power in the ultraslow oscillation frequency band (0.02-0.4 Hz) significantly increased in the striatum while decreasing in the cortex. When data were undersampled to \"conventional\" fMRI temporal resolution (900 ms), the striatal effects were lost, revealing the power of ultrafast fMRI approaches in unveiling such phenomena. Conclusions: Increased striato-striatal coupling, in the form of increased synchrony, spectral power, and functional connectivity, was revealed by ultrafast resting-state fMRI, but not conventional temporal resolution resting-state fMRI. Our findings suggest more involvement of subcortical areas in network reorganization than previously thought.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Animals stabilize their heads in response to vestibular stimuli through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). While the VCR has been characterized in tetrapod vertebrates, it remains unknown whether fish, which lack an anatomical neck, employ a comparable behavior. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit VCR-like behaviors: they adjust their head orientation relative to the body by rostral body flexion during pitch tilts. The rostral body flexed ventrally during head-up posture, whereas it flexed dorsally during head-down posture. These flexions partially compensated for the head pitch changes, thereby contributing to head stabilization. We also identified the muscles and neural circuits responsible for these two types of body flexions. Both the dorsal and ventral flexions were mediated by the same vestibular nucleus, but neural signals were transmitted through distinct pathways, either involving or bypassing a class of reticulospinal neurons. The dorsal and ventral flexions were ultimately produced by specialized dorsal and ventral muscles in the rostral body, respectively. The neural circuits underlying these body flexions in fish share similarities with those underlying the mammalian VCR. Together, our results demonstrate that fish exhibit a VCR-like behavior through comparable circuit mechanisms, suggesting that the VCR is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomics reveal that cerebellar astrocytes, but not cortical, exhibit an antiviral state that intensifies with age, with increased expression of Stat1. Aged mice display motor deficits similar to humans that improve after peripheral IFN-I receptor neutralization, whereas astrocyte Stat1 induces motor deficits during chronic inflammation in adults. While strong systemic inflammation induces astrocyte antiviral state, in aging, chromatin de-repression of Stat1 and nucleotide sensors in cerebellar astrocytes amplifies local IFN-I signaling.

Here, we investigated how Pi availability affects OMV production, composition, and toxicity in the pandemic strain N16961 and its {Delta}phoB mutant. Using transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we show that OMV size remains constant (~140 nm) across conditions, but production is significantly increased under Pi limitation in a PhoB-dependent manner. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses revealed selective packaging of PhoB-regulated proteins involved in phosphate metabolism, stress response, carbon metabolism, and toxicity, as well as enrichment in phosphorus-free ornithine lipids under low Pi. Functional assays in Galleria mellonella demonstrated that OMVs from N16961 under Pi limitation are highly toxic, whereas OMVs from high-Pi or {Delta}phoB cultures exhibit minimal lethality. Our findings indicate that phosphate limitation acts as an environmental cue that shapes OMV composition, enhancing both bacterial survival and pathogenic potential.

However, the molecular basis of resource specialization and niche separation in the gut remains poorly understood. Here we show that structural differences in glycan transporters drive members of the genus Bacteroides, common human gut commensals, to specialize on distinct chain lengths of the same fructan molecule. While species encoding canonical SusCD systems for glycan import formed by a membrane-embedded barrel capped with a lipoprotein lid specialized in long-chain fructans, species with smaller lidless transporters, not previously described in Bacteroides, specialized in short-chain fructans. Strikingly, we found that a ~140-amino acid domain in the SusC barrel is a structural feature that governs substrate preference: deleting it does not impair transport but instead shifts uptake preferences from long- to short-chain fructans. These structural differences predict competitive outcomes in vivo on fructans of varying lengths, suggesting that glycan uptake mechanisms shape ecological niches in the gut and can inform fiber-based dietary interventions. Similar small lidless transporters exist across the Bacteroidota, expanding the paradigm of glycan utilization in this phylum beyond the canonical SusCD architecture.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

FACS-sequencing using the optimized DNA extraction method distorted the composition of sorted microbiota by introducing sheath fluid contaminants, termed the FACSome.

The optimized extraction and decontamination were validated in soil, water, feces, saliva, gut reactor and mock microbial communities. Metataxonomic profiles of non-selectively sorted and unsorted samples derived from these ecosystems did not perfectly match due to relic DNA depletion during FACS.

Recent reports suggest SGs induced during viral infection, may act as a crossroad between the cellular stress response and the activation of the innate immune response. Here, we aimed to dissect the role of SGs in the context of yellow fever virus (YFV) infection. We found that YFV infection resulted in translational shut-off from 24 hpi on followed by the formation of SGs at 48 hpi, a delay potentially associated with the ability of the YFV capsid to inhibit SG formation, through an interaction with the major SG scaffolding protein G3BP1. To elucidate the role of YFV-induced SGs during infection, we inhibited SG assembly using a small-molecule inhibitor and find that SG formation does not influence viral replication. Uncovering the first proteome of virus-induced SGs, our compositional analysis revealed a specific enrichment of proteins associated with mitochondrial processes in YFV-induced SGs. Indeed, we show that YFV infection results in mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Together, we propose that YFV-induced SGs may be involved not only in the modulation of cellular homeostasis but also in influencing mitochondrial functions.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Infection with the HCV-related Norway rat hepacivirus 1 (NrHV) in rats or mice shares HCV defining characteristics, including chronicity, delayed immune responses, and liver disease, thereby providing immunocompetent small animal models for immune responses and pathology. Infectious NrHV cell culture systems allow studies of host factors and neutralising antibodies, however, quantification relies on laborious manual counting of infected cells. To permit high-throughput quantification, we engineered culture adapted NrHV to encode green fluorescent protein (GFP), firefly luciferase (FLuc), or the 11 amino acid HiBiT tag at sites corresponding to those permissive for HCV. While GFP and FLuc constructs were not viable, a reporter with a HiBiT insertion in NS5A domain III was replication competent and produced infectious virus in rat hepatoma cells. Two mutations in NS5A adapted this virus to levels comparable to wildtype, enabling robust luciferase readouts and stability. The NrHV-HiBiT-NS5A reporter was viable in rats and permitted quantification of luciferase from liver homogenates. Luciferase-based quantification of viral infection after antibody neutralisation correlated well with manual quantification. High-throughput luciferase quantification was also used to confirm dependency on the known host factors SR-BI and miR-122, and to assess sensitivity to antivirals. Finally, sensitivity to a specific inhibitor suggested that cyclophilin A, similarly to HCV, may also be a host factor for NrHV.

While 100s of somatic mutations in the DNA binding domain are known, a small number of mutants are enriched in cancer, suggesting a gain-of-function role. Here we deploy an intein-based approach to localize uMap photoproximity labeling to p53 to define novel interactions contributing to the loss and gain of function roles of 5 separate hotspot mutants.

Here, we report another radical departure from canonical tRNA gene architecture in animal mitochondria: two tRNA loci that produce overlapping tRNAs from both strands. These 'mirror' tRNA pairs eliminate the need to retain separate loci for all tRNA genes, as a single locus can produce two tRNAs that decode two different amino acids. We show that these mirror tRNAs are aminoacylated and present on mitoribosomes. Furthermore, mirror tRNAs display strand-specific patterns of nucleotide modification and RNA editing, reflecting specific post-transcriptional maturation that depends on transcriptional orientation.

However, increased reports of Pv across Africa lead to the hypothesis that the parasites have evolved alternate invasion mechanisms that are DARC-independent but rely on other ligand-receptor interactions. In this study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on whole genome sequence data of 110 Pv samples isolated from 38 Duffy-negative and 72 Duffy-positive individuals in Ethiopia. SNPs detected in Pv from Duffy positives (477,561 SNPs) were more than two-fold higher than Duffy negatives (197,461 SNPs). Chromosomes 9, 10, and 12 were shown to be most variable in both Duffy groups. Among 43 erythrocyte binding gene candidates, tryptophan rich antigen 3 and 34 (TRAg3 and TRAg34) and members of the merozoite surface protein (MSP) 3 family had the highest variation. In Duffy positive Pv, significant signal of positive selection was observed in genes related to drug resistance (chloroquine resistance associated protein CG1 and the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN2) and erythrocyte binding (membrane associated erythrocyte binding-like protein MAEBL); whereas in Duffy negative Pv, positive selection was observed in the plastid replication repair enzyme and the AP-5 complex subunit beta 1 genes associated with parasite mobility, transport and DNA repair. Several amino acid substitutions were found in PvDBP1, PvEBP/DBP2, and PvRBP2b of Duffy positive but not Duffy negative samples, with almost half of the mutations located in the binding regions. No genetic differentiation was detected between Duffy positive and Duffy negative Pv from Ethiopia. These isolates were genetically similar to other East Africa Pv, but markedly different from those from Southeast Asia and South America.

EHT computational models were developed and integrated into nine validated porcine-specific biventricular models from pigs with left circumflex (LCx, n=4) or left anterior descending (LAD, n=5) MIs. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) susceptibility was evaluated using an S1-S2 stimulation protocol across varying pacing sites and coupling intervals, accounting for infarct characteristics, implantation site, conductivity, and the ventricular conduction system (CS). VT burden was quantified with a 0-1 inducibility score (IS). In silico reentrant activity reproduced the arrhythmic patterns observed experimentally in porcine MI models. VT vulnerability was greater in LAD than in LCx infarcts, consistent with a larger infarct size. Inclusion of the CS modified VT burden by providing conduction shortcuts that either facilitated or suppressed reentry. Remuscularization directly on the MI region (IS = 0.49) heightened VT inducibility in dense, transmural scars (IS = 0.16), whereas lateral EHT implantation (IS = 0.35) reduced this risk with respect to direct implantation. In non-transmural scars, VT inducibility varied with the implantation site. Matching EHT conductivity to host myocardium lowered or contained arrhythmogenicity (LCx-IS: from 0.5 to 0.25; LAD-IS: stable at 0.57).

Over the past decades, genome assembly quality has advanced remarkably from draft assemblies in the early 2010s, to chromosome-level assemblies using error-prone long reads in the late 2010s, to the recent T2T gapless assemblies enabled by high-quality next-generation long-read technologies. That said, a systematic evaluation of trade-offs from assemblies obtained at various coverages, starting at 3x, from a single long-read sequencing platform, is critical for developing a cost-effective and practical strategy for catalyzing individual genome initiative. Here, by assembling contigs at various coverage levels through downsampling of existing PacBio HiFi reads from three individuals, we demonstrate that high-quality assemblies, as measured by standard assembly metrics and DNA-level linearity relative to a reference across most chromosomes (developed inhouse), can be achieved at approximately 12x coverage. Interestingly, starting at coverages as low as 6x, assembly metrics, including BUSCO scores and DNA-level linearity, begin to saturate, suggesting minimal trade-offs. Furthermore, we show that known structural variants (e.g., the 8p23.1 inversion) can be reliably identified even at 6x coverage.

To understand the mechanistic basis for hSERINC3-mediated PS lipid scrambling at atomistic resolution, we implemented the transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) enhanced sampling method. Our simulations sampled close-to-open hSERINC3 conformational transition during PS scrambling and demonstrated that while other non-ATP-dependent lipid transporters with similar architecture transport lipid following a ''trap-and-flip'' mechanism, hSERINC3 adopts a ''credit card'' mechanism of lipid scrambling and does not follow the classical ''alternating access'' mechanism. Notably, we observe unfolding of the H8 NTD, consistent with the cryo-EM density map of WT-hSERINC3, mediates PS scrambling.

Phosphatidylserine(PS) scrambling and exposure at the outer leaflet are recognized to play important roles in several biological processes. To understand the mechanistic basis for hSERINC3-mediated PS lipid scrambling at atomistic resolution, we implemented the transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) enhanced sampling method. Our simulations sampled close-to-open hSERINC3 conformational transition during PS scrambling and demonstrated that while other non-ATP-dependent lipid transporters with similar architecture transport lipid following a ''trap-and-flip'' mechanism, hSERINC3 adopts a ''credit card'' mechanism of lipid scrambling and does not follow the classical ''alternating access'' mechanism. Notably, we observe unfolding of the H8 NTD, consistent with the cryo-EM density map of WT-hSERINC3, mediates PS scrambling.

However, therapeutic resistance remains a major clinical challenge, necessitating the identification of new molecular targets. Myosin VI (MVI), a motor protein increasingly linked to cancer, directly interacts with the ER and plays a key role in the spatial regulation of RNA Polymerase II. Notably, expression levels of MVI and ER are positively correlated across breast cancer tissues. Here, we present a multidisciplinary investigation combining advanced imaging, genomic profiling, and phenotypic characterisation to elucidate the interplay between MVI and the ER. We demonstrate that MVI nuclear localisation is dynamically regulated by estrogen signalling and ER activity. Conversely, ER nuclear localisation requires active MVI, suggesting a reciprocal regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, MVI influences subnuclear architecture, modulating ER transcriptional activity and downstream gene expression programmes that govern cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MVI enhances the effect of hormone therapy, resulting in greater disruption of ER function than monotherapy alone. Moreover, MVI inhibition also suppresses the activity of hormone-resistant ER mutants, highlighting its potential to overcome therapy resistance. Our findings establish MVI as a critical regulator of ER nuclear dynamics and gene expression, supporting its candidacy as a novel therapeutic target in ER-positive breast cancer.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

While circadian clock photoreceptors represent promising candidates, only Arabidopsis Cryptochrome 2 (AtCRY2) has been widely adopted in current applications. Notably, both the light-dependent interaction of AtCRY2 with the CIB1 protein and its homodimerization have been exploited for diverse optogenetic applications. In our search for alternative circadian photoreceptors for optogenetic control, we aimed to develop a system functioning without the co-expression of interacting partners. In this context, Drosophila Cryptochrome (DmCRY) was a promising candidate due to its well-characterized photoreceptor function and defined light-dependent reaction mechanism. Upon illumination, DmCRY undergoes a conformational change that enables interactions with Jetlag and Timeless proteins, facilitating circadian clock resetting. DmCRY is also targeted for degradation via ubiquitylation by Jetlag and/or BRWD3, ensuring resetting occurs only once each morning. Notably, DmCRY is susceptible to light-induced degradation even when expressed in mammalian cells. Leveraging this property, we fused the Tet repressor (TetR) to the C-terminus of DmCRY to enable light-dependent regulation of gene expression via TetR-responsive elements. We demonstrate that this system modulates expression of Cas9 for gene knockout, dCas9 for transcriptional regulation, and recombinant proteins. Furthermore, using these tools with a photomasking technique, we generated human portrait images from cultured cells. These findings highlight DmCRY as a versatile optogenetic tool capable of controlling cellular processes with standard visible light, with potential for novel optogenetic platforms.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Understanding how the brain computationally navigates such multi-level decisions remains an open challenge. While existing models offer statistical insights, they often fall short in capturing the neural mechanisms and trial-by-trial variability underlying individual choices. To address this gap, we developed a neurocomputational model that integrates a biologically inspired attractor network for low-level perceptual decisions with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-level strategic adjustments. With minimal architectural constraints, the RNN receives only raw firing rates, feedback, and prior environment, learning to infer environment-switching strategies without explicit access to confidence or stimulus strength. In a hierarchical task combining motion discrimination and bandit decisions (N = 9; ~10,800 trials), the model successfully reproduced three hallmark behavioral patterns observed in humans. Unlike previous models, the model also captured trial-to-trial variability in switching decisions and implicitly learned to estimate decision confidence. For interpretability, we used representational and sensitivity analyses. Representational analyses revealed internal dynamics consistent with evidence accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while sensitivity analysis identified feedback as the dominant influence on strategy, modulated by recent trial history. This framework combines interpretability and predictive power, moving beyond simple data fitting to provide mechanistic insights into how the brain integrates confidence and feedback to guide adaptive behavior in hierarchical decision-making.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

To understand the complex mechanisms regulating the PBS assembly, we knocked out the terminal emitter apcE, which forms the structural scaffold for the PBS core.

TRIM24, a multidomain chromatin reader implicated in cancer and inflammation, has not been previously studied in the heart. Here, we investigated whether TRIM24 regulates interferon/STAT-driven inflammatory programs and paracrine signaling in cardiomyocytes. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a pronounced downregulation of TRIM24 specifically in cardiomyocytes from human ischemic cardiomyopathy, a change not detected by bulk RNA-sequencing in either human or mouse myocardial infarction samples, likely due to masking by non-cardiomyocyte cell populations. Fractionated protein analysis further demonstrated that TRIM24 is enriched in cardiomyocyte nuclei. Functional studies in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes showed that TRIM24 represses interferon-stimulated and STAT-dependent genes, including Mx1, Irf7, and Ifit3. ChIP-Seq revealed TRIM24 occupancy at STAT-bound regulatory regions, suggesting cooperative suppression of inflammatory gene networks. Mechanistically, TRIM24 decreased Stat1a/b and Stat3 transcription, reduced protein abundance, and inhibited phosphorylation independently of proteasomal degradation; these effects were partially reversible by bromodomain inhibition. Functionally, TRIM24 overexpression dampened paracrine macrophage recruitment, whereas TRIM24 depletion amplified it. Collectively, these findings identify TRIM24 as a cardiomyocyte-enriched chromatin regulator that restrains STAT1/3 signaling and suppresses paracrine inflammatory activation. TRIM24 acts as a transcriptional safeguard of immune quiescence in the heart and represents a potential therapeutic target for limiting cardiac inflammation.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

We hypothesised that cfChP like DNA protein complexes generated following organismal death are exchanged among species and progressively accumulate to form a dense patchwork that constitutes ncDNA, and that apoptosis may dissociate these complexes and render them amenable to detection. To test this hypothesis, we used species-specific DNA fluorescent in situ hybridisation probes and antibodies against archaea, eubacteria, plants, algae, fungi, protozoa, Drosophila, fish, chicken, mouse, rat, pig, dog and monkey on intact and apoptotic human cells. We observed no reactivity with intact cells but strong reactivity with the ncDNA component of apoptotic cells.

CpGs with different flanking sequences also exhibit mutation rate variation, but this variation is only partially correlated with context-specific methylation level. Here, we quantify the CpG mutation rate and mutagenic effect of methylation across sequence contexts. Using a regression framework that accounts for recurrent mutations, we analyze human polymorphisms from the gnomAD dataset to estimate mutation rates of unmethylated and methylated CpGs in each unique 4-mer or 6-mer context. We find that CpG mutation rate variation in the human genome is shaped by methylation at the focal cytosine, the flanking nucleotides, and interactions between them. Our analysis reveals distinct context-dependent mutation patterns for unmethylated and methylated cytosines, driven by largely independent effects of upstream and downstream sequences. Notably, an upstream adenine markedly increases CpG mutation rates regardless of methylation status or downstream sequences. Furthermore, upstream and downstream sequences have qualitatively similar effects in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, indicating that some conserved, intrinsic sequence features shape CpG mutability. On the other hand, some inter-species differences, which are especially pronounced at methylated sites, point to recent evolutionary changes, possibly in context-specificity of proteins governing DNA demethylation and repair processes.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Plants with elevated vascular-derived Tre6P levels had smaller root systems, reduced sucrose levels, and lower root metabolite levels, whereas vascular TPP overexpression had the opposite effect. Using reciprocal grafting experiments, we identified shoot-derived vascular Tre6P to be the main driver of these systemic responses. In lines with increased Tre6P in the shoot vasculature, the shoot-to-root metabolite ratios were consistently increased, indicating that Tre6P modulates metabolite allocation and utilization to balance carbon partitioning between shoot and root growth.

Using a pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and a centric diatom Chaetoceros gracilis, we evaluated differences in the photosynthetic machinery under a wide range of growth irradiances. The chlorophyll a-specific amounts of the major accessory pigments remained relatively constant irrespective of growth irradiance in both diatoms. However, fluorescence spectra at 77K differed drastically depending on the growth irradiance: In P. tricornutum, fluorescence from photosystem II was dominant in high-light-grown cells and negligible in low-light-grown cells, while in C. gracilis, the opposite trend was observed. These drastic changes in fluorescence spectra were slow processes. The amounts of the two reaction centers, as assessed by specific antibodies and absorption changes in P700, remained almost constant under different irradiances. These results indicate that under dim growth irradiance, more excitation energy is diverted to photosystem I in the pennate diatom, and to photosystem II in the centric diatom. Therefore, the light-harvesting antennas balance excitation energy distribution by changing their association between photosystems I and II in different manners between P. tricornutum and C. gracilis, depending on irradiance. This phenomenon is similar to state transitions, but differs in its magnitude and duration. Differences in the preference of energy distribution in the two diatoms suggest that the dynamic 'state conversion' - an antenna rearrangement during the long-term acclimation process in diatoms - is the species-specific strategy to achieve effective photosynthesis under the wide range of growth irradiances in the ocean.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Experimental evidence suggests that intestinal barrier permeability (IBP) and bacterial translocation (BT) critically influence stroke outcomes. However, biological variability among commonly used rodent sub-strains has received limited attention. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared post-stroke immune responses in two Wistar rat sub-strains obtained from different suppliers: RccHan (Envigo) and RjHan (Janvier). Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, animals were assessed 72 hours later and stratified according to the presence or absence of BT. Immune cell populations in blood and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry, and leukocyte infiltration into ischemic brain tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Results: Both sub-strains developed significant infarcts and neurological deficits. RccHan rats displayed larger infarct volumes and more extensive BT across multiple organs. In contrast, RjHan rats exhibited BT mainly confined to mesenteric lymph nodes but showed greater IBP. Although dissemination was broader in RccHan rats, overall bacterial burden was slightly lower compared with RjHan, and extra-intestinal bacterial composition differed between groups. Notably, RjHan rats presented stronger systemic and central immune activation, with marked alterations in lymphocyte and monocyte populations and enhanced granulocyte and T cell infiltration within ischemic lesions.

Continuity and pleasantness ratings were higher for stroking than tapping. Correlations between continuity and pleasantness ratings for stroking or tapping conditions were stronger when presented with touch videos than with photos.

Our framework combines approximate inference over latent causal structures with a mixture-of-controllers approach, in which each controller is optimized for a specific causal model and weighted by the current belief in that model. We show that classical static models of multisensory perception are special cases of our framework, and extend them to dynamic, action-oriented settings where inference and control evolve over time. Using simulations of previously published behavioral tasks, including visuo-vestibular heading discrimination and path integration with interception, we show that the model reproduces key empirical findings, such as S-shaped biases in heading estimation and motor strategies based on inferred object motion.

A.", "abstract": "The accumulation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins is the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). -Synuclein aggregation drives Parkinson's disease pathology, and is a suitable target for selective protein clearance. Biological proteolysis targeting chimeras (bioPROTACs) aim to eliminate disease-causing intracellular proteins using host cell ubiquitination and degradation functions. Here, we describe a bioPROTAC comprising the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain of CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) fused to NbSyn87, a nanobody specific for -synuclein. Co-expression with -synuclein resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance or complete degradation of both wild-type and Parkinson's disease-associated mutant -synuclein (A53T, A53V, and G51D) dependent on cell type. The bioPROTAC also significantly reduced abundance of insoluble -synuclein aggregates. In contrast, CHIP-based bioPROTACs targeting superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) or LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) failed to degrade their targets and in some instances, increased target abundance due to stabilising interactions with the recognition domain. These findings demonstrate key parameters for consideration during BioPROTAC design including target half-life, bioPROTAC solubility, recognition domain binding affinity, molecular chaperone activity, and interdomain linker optimisation. This work demonstrates the use of CHIP-based bioPROTACs for therapeutic degradation of -synuclein in the synucleinopathies and provides insights for future targeted degrader development.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Inflammation did not alter placental aging trajectories. Antioxidant treatment (superoxide dismutase) preserved telomere length, reduced DNA damage and restored angiogenic balance, highlighting oxidative stress as a modifiable determinant of placental aging. We identify reduced expression of telomeric repeat-containing RNAs (TERRAs) as a molecular hallmark of LOPE, and show that antisense oligonucleotide-mediated TERRA depletion exacerbates telomere erosion and senescence.

T.; Zengeya, T. A.", "abstract": "Alien freshwater crayfish have been widely introduced worldwide for aquaculture and the pet trade. Despite providing societal benefits, crayfish introductions are also known to cause adverse impacts in areas of introduction. This study used the recently developed Risk Analysis for Alien Taxa (RAAT) framework to assess the risk associated with 14 alien freshwater crayfish introductions in South Africa. Thirteen of the 14 species were assessed as high risk because they are likely to be introduced to South Africa and have the potential to cause major environmental impacts. Eight of these species are listed under the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM: BA) Alien and Invasive Species (A&IS) Regulations, which implies there is an obligation to manage them. This notion was supported by the recommendations from the risk analyses for Cherax cainii, C. tenuimanus, and C. quadricarinatus. The two marron species (C. cainii and C. tenuimanus) have no known naturalised populations and are likely confined to aquaculture facilities. Cherax quadricarinatus is already widespread and control methods should focus on minimising spread, as eradication is no longer feasible. The recommendations from some of the risk analyses do not agree with the current listing under the A&IS Regulations. Procambarus clarkii is already known to be invasive but is not listed and there is anecdotal evidence that C. destructor, Faxonius limosus, F. rusticus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, and Pontastacus leptodactylus are present in the pet trade and their presence needs to be verified. Crayfish can become conflict-generating alien species because they have both major negative impacts and socio-economic benefits. Therefore, the recommended management options aim to preserve benefits while limiting negative impacts by restricting the importation of high-risk species for new introductions and implementing interventions to prevent spread and minimise impacts for established introductions.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Using a common garden approach, we monitored mice in replicate mixed-sex group social behavior trials within an indoor mesocosm using radiofrequency identification (RFID) antennae. M. pahari exhibited markedly reduced spatial exploration and highly stereotyped circadian activity that was strongly coupled to the dark phase of the light-dark cycle compared to B6 mice. Most strikingly, M. pahari displayed distinctive social behaviors characterized by strong male-male gregariousness and enhanced overall social tolerance, contrasting sharply with the relatively less social nature of B6 mice. These results demonstrate the genetic influence on social organization within the Mus genus and identify unique socio-spatial phenotypes in M. pahari, highlighting the considerable potential of this strain and species as a novel model for social behavior research.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Ramdas, T.; Gershman, S. J.", "abstract": "Molecular memory storage mechanisms face two serious obstacles: they must be robust to the intrinsic noise characteristic of molecular-scale processes, and they must rely on components (like proteins) whose effective lifetimes are limited for biophysical reasons. For example, if one stores a memory by attaching a post-translational 'mark' to a protein, naively the lifetime of that memory is limited by protein turnover and ambient demarking activity. In this work, we investigate the principles of persistent and noise-robust molecular memory by studying simple mathematical models of protein-marking-state-based memory switches. We pay special attention to two possible strategies for improving memory storage: effectively averaging over noise by using a large number of proteins, and an enzyme-based 'error correction' mechanism first proposed by Francis Crick. Through an exhaustive mathematical analysis of these models, which includes solving most of them exactly, we find that error correction provides an effective mechanism for storing long-lived memories, and that using large populations of proteins only slightly improves the lifetime of stored memories. But we also find that error correction is not always useful, since too much of it can make the probability of false positives excessively high. Our findings lend credence to Crick's proposal, and suggest motifs that may be exploited by potential intracellular memory storage mechanisms. Finally, in addressing these issues, we also provide general insight about how to define memory performance in the molecular setting, as well as associated notions like lifetime and capacity.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Understanding the mechanisms whereby children's exposome influences their development is crucial to facilitate the design of interventions to foster positive developmental trajectories for all youth. Recent work has identified a general exposome factor associated with socio-economic inequality that is strongly related to cognition and individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in youth. Building on these findings, the current study explores whether alterations in functional connectivity may represent a potential mechanism linking variation in the exposome to cognitive performance. We apply a data-driven, cross-validated, whole-brain machine learning approach, connectome-based statistical inference, to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with exposome scores among early adolescents enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using data collected during three cognitive tasks and during rest. Additionally, we investigate whether the identified patterns of functional connectivity relate to individual differences in cognitive performance across three domains: General Cognition, Executive Functioning, and Learning/Memory. Models incorporating 10-fold cross-validation over 100 iterations identified consistent functional connections associated with the exposome across task and rest conditions (model performance: ns = 6,137-8,391, rs = 0.34 - 0.44, ps <.001). Results were robust across data collection sites and functional connections common across all significant models were associated with cognitive performance across domains (ps < 0.0009). Collectively, these findings reveal that multidimensional environmental exposures are reflected in patterns of functional connectivity and relate to cognitive functioning among youth.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, it is possible that the specific functions of OT depend on different time periods of action. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

Working memory, which transiently maintains and manipulates task-relevant information, supports skill acquisition expanding with extensive training, as shown in expert domains such as in master chess players. Yet, the temporal dynamics of working memory emergence and expansion during the rapid performance gains that define early skill learning remain unclear. We addressed this question across three experiments in which participants learned various naturalistic sequential keypress skills. Within each practice trial, we observed segments of high-initial-skill (HIS)--transient periods of elevated performance followed by skill drops--that persisted throughout training. The keypress content of HIS segments scaled with execution speed and systematically increased with practice, reflecting an expansion of keypress chunk content consistent with the progressive enlargement of working memory capacity. Importantly, HIS segment keypress content continued to rise even after overall performance plateaued. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling ({theta}/{gamma} PAC) and beta ({beta})-band bursts, mechanisms implicated in maintaining and binding individual actions into sequences in working memory, were elevated during HIS segments with hippocampal {theta}/{gamma} PAC predicting HIS segment content. Our results suggest that working memory capacity expands during early learning of a naturalistic skill and continues strengthening with practice after skill plateau is reached, possibly supported by hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

G.; Foxe, J. J.", "abstract": "Those with an autism spectrum diagnosis (ASD) have been found to process emotional faces differently than other populations. Processing of emotional faces requires engagement of temporal, frontal, occipital, and limbic brain regions. Functional activity has been shown to differ in those with an ASD, particularly in the amygdala, inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and temporal brain regions. However, the consistency and direction of these associations have been inconsistent across studies. Recent findings have demonstrated that measures of neuron density differ in those with an ASD. Some of these regional differences in cytoarchitecture coincide with regions important to emotional facial processing. Therefore, the interaction between cytoarchitecture and functional activity may be important in elucidating unique neurophysiology in ASD. The present study uses diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between cytoarchitecture and functional activity during emotional face processing in those with an ASD. 75 individuals with a reported ASD and 6,396 individuals with no reported diagnosis of an ASD (nASD) were identified. The emotional n-back (EN-Back) task was administered during fMRI acquisition, activating regions of the brain associated with processing emotional faces. Neuron cell body density was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala in the ASD group but not the nASD group. These findings suggest that a unique relationship may exist between neuron cell body density in the left amygdala and functional activity while processing emotional faces in those with an ASD.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

The centro-parietal positivity (CPP), an event-related EEG potential, has recently been identified as a neural correlate of sensory evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this component also reflects evidence accumulation during decisions based on long-term memory. The present study investigated whether the CPP serves as a domain-general signal of evidence accumulation across both perception and semantic memory-based decisions. We designed a visual discrimination task in which participants discriminated between the luminance of two alphanumeric strings across three levels of difficulty defined by the luminance difference. In a semantic memory task, participants discriminated between the populations of two different U.S. states, binned into three difficulty levels using US census data. After each decision, participants rated their confidence on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). We observed a CPP component in both tasks, the slope of which scaled with the sensory or mnemonic evidence in both stimulus- and response-locked analyses. Furthermore, these CPP slopes were sensitive to reaction times (RT) and confidence in both tasks. Finally, the peak height of the CPP just prior to the response, indicative of one's decision boundary, was strongly correlated across tasks, suggesting that a common threshold was applied to the abstract evidence quantity being accumulated. Our results indicate that the CPP can be used to track the unfolding dynamics underlying decisions made both on the basis of external sensory evidence and internal mnemonic evidence.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Beker, S.; Molholm, S.", "abstract": "Atypical sensory processing is a core feature of autism, particularly when integration across sensory modalities is required. The neural mechanisms underlying these multisensory differences remain unclear. We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8-13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.", "date": "2025-11-13", "journal": ""}

However, data on LBS are relatively rare for wild populations of long-lived species, while time-limited metrics such as annual survival or fertility are more readily available. The magnitude of VA for these time-limited metrics, and the degree to which they are genetically correlated with LBS, remains unclear in most cases. Here we estimated the VA and heritability (h2) of LBS and four time-limited fitness metrics in wild female baboons in Kenya. The most highly heritable metrics were LBS (h2=0.25) and annual survival (h2=0.23). Notably, all the VA for LBS was attributable to survival to first successful reproduction. Furthermore, all fitness metrics examined were highly genetically correlated with each other, supporting the potential use of time-limited metrics where LBS data are limited. Our analyses predicted faster phenotypic evolution than we observed, raising the possibility that environmental effects have masked responses to selection (cryptic evolution) or that social effects inflate estimated VA.
