So, an exquisite regulatory network controls the choice between different repair mechanisms to maximize genome integrity. This relies mostly at the level of DNA end resection, the initial steps of the homologous recombination. On the other hand, numerous cellular activities follow a 24 h oscillation known as the circadian cycle. Thus, we explored the regulation of the choice between different DNA break repair pathways along the circadian cycle. Here we show that in human cells DNA resection shows a circadian oscillation, with a peak at early morning followed by a partial and progressive reduction until late afternoon. Such regulation depends on the circadian clock core component CRY1, which modulates the anti-resection activity of CCAR2 to limit CtIP at nightfall. Additionally, such regulation requires DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of CRY1. Finally, this circadian regulation impacts cancer progression and response to radiation therapy of specific tumours.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Examples range from simple hard-wired spatial filters (re-referencing, gradient, Laplacian, etc.) to more complex data-driven transforms (beamforming, independent component analysis, etc.). The principle is straightforward, but the properties are obscured by the high dimensionality of the data, and the various \"spaces\" in which a \"spatial\" filter operates, inhabited by sources, sensors, fields, or signals. This paper reviews the properties and limits of spatial filters, with particular focus on the popular concept of a \"virtual electrode\" created by combining channels of a non-invasive recording technique such as EEG or MEG. Whereas a spatial filter can perfectly suppress one or more sources (as many as there are sensors, minus one), it cannot select one source and suppress all others, as might a real electrode. This puts hard limits on what to expect of a virtual electrode, and suggests a slightly different perspective, that of a \"virtual scalpel\". Spatial filtering, like temporal filtering, plays an important role in brain data analysis.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We use human FSGS-associated genes (NEPTUNE) to identify common molecular pathways rescued by TUDCA in human glomerular disease and the Alport mouse model. In Col43-/- mice, podocyte injury is evident by 3 months, with 40% podocyte loss and maximum deformability of glomeruli at 4 months, followed from months 4 to 7 by progressive capillary stiffening, increasing proteinuria, reduced renal function, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis. Evidence of ER stress progresses over this timeframe. Glomerular and renal disease in Col43-/- mice are suppressed by TUDCA. RNA sequencing at 2, 4, and 7 months reveals an injury-associated gene expression pattern shared by FSGS patients. Deconvolution analysis identified podocyte-associated FSGS gene set that when projected onto 4-month Col43-/- mouse data was characteristic of hypertrophy, differentiation, and cytoskeleton/adhesion signals. Disease-associated changes in RNAs suppressed by TUDCA in Col43-/- mice. We define two phases of Col43-/- nephropathy. The first is characterized by podocytopathy and accelerated podocyte loss, while the second is marked by increased capillary wall stiffening, activation of renal inflammatory and profibrotic pathways, and loss of renal function.

We describe the distributions of the different FG-Nups in the central transporter and highlight the dynamic nature of the FG-meshwork, with FG-FG interaction lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds. Our findings reveal that Nsp1, the most abundant FG-Nup in the NPC, creates a central meshwork due to its unique bimodal structure, that is essential for controlling both passive and active transport. By adding nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) - specifically Kap95 - to the pore, we demonstrate that NTRs play a key role in increasing the energy barrier for translocation of inert particles. The NTRs are subject to a dynamic interplay between binding to FG motifs and the temporal fluctuations of the FG-meshwork, leading to transient voids through which they move. Overall, our simulations identify a dense GLFG-ring coated by lower-mobility Kaps and a central dynamic FG-FG meshwork to create a reduced-dimensional transport surface of optimal binding avidity that drives Kap translocation.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

To help achieve this, many bacteria utilise regulatory pathways that ensure DNA replication initiation only occurs once per cell cycle. When dysregulated, loss of DNA replication control can have severe consequences. In Escherichia coli it has been established that hyper-initiation of DNA synthesis leads to pleiotropic genome instability and cell death. Therefore, targeting DNA replication initiation proteins to promote hyper-initiation may be an approach to generate novel antimicrobials. However, the pathways and potential consequences of replication hyper-initiation in Gram-positive species remain enigmatic. To address this question, we devised genetic systems to artificially induce hyper-initiation in the model organism Bacillus subtilis and the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In both species, hyper-initiation elicited cellular degeneration culminating in growth inhibition by cell death. During this process in B. subtilis, temporal analyses revealed the early onset of the DNA damage response, followed by membrane depolarisation and cell lysis. This phenotype could be supressed by removing pathways that repair damaged DNA, suggesting that cell death is a consequence of conflicts between DNA replication and repair. In S. aureus, cells quickly accumulated striking morphological changes associated with rapid loss of chromosomal DNA and death via a lysis-independent pathway. Moreover, inducing hyper-initiation in S. aureus was observed to decrease bacterial survival during infection of murine macrophages. Taken together, the data suggest that stimulating initiation of bacterial DNA synthesis could be an alternative approach to inhibiting microbial growth, particularly in combination with compounds that inhibit or poison DNA repair, akin to cancer therapies.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Extraocular muscles (EOMs) are particularly resistant to ALS progression, and exploring the underlying molecular nature may offer significant therapeutic value. Reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is implicated in ALS pathogenesis, and Aldh3a1 is an inactivation-resistant intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase that detoxifies 4-HNE to protect eyes against UV-induced oxidative stress. We detected prominently higher levels of Aldh3a1 in mouse EOMs compared to other muscles under normal physiological conditions. In an ALS mouse model (hSOD1G93A) reaching end-stage, Aldh3a1 expression was maintained high in EOMs, substantially elevated in soleus and diaphragm, but only moderately increased in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, which endured the most severe pathological remodeling, as demonstrated by unparalleled upregulation of a denervation marker Ankrd1. Importantly, sciatic nerve transection in wildtype mice further confirmed induced Aldh3a1 and Ankrd1 expression in an inverse manner across muscle types in response to denervation. Mechanistically, whole-muscle RNA-Seq and pharmacological tests indicate that higher basal levels of lipid oxidation in soleus and diaphragm muscles may predispose them to stronger Nrf2 antioxidant responses under pathological stress compared to EDL, leading to more prominent Aldh3a1 upregulation. Additionally, the identification of the myoblast fusion marker Mymk as an EOM signature gene suggests that the spontaneous activation of satellite cells contributes to high levels of Aldh3a1 in EOMs. Functionally, adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of Aldh3a1 protected myotubes from 4-HNE-induced DNA fragmentation and plasma membrane leakage.

In this study, we recorded electrocorticography in 5 urethane-anaesthetised rats and identified cortical slow oscillations, characterised by spontaneous transitions between Up and Down states. Deviant stimuli in an auditory oddball paradigm evoked an initial positive prediction error, followed by a prolonged, all-or-nothing response which spread in a travelling wave across the cortex. Identified as putative evoked cortical Up states, these responses were not evoked by standards, omissions or a many-standards control. Up states following deviants occurred more recently after a previous Up state when compared to spontaneous Up states. In preliminary data from an awake rat, long-latency Up states were not present spontaneously or evoked. In a different rat, anaesthetic depth was key to spontaneous and evoked Up states, with more robust Up/Down states and more reliable triggering of Up states under deeper anaesthesia. These results suggest that sensory deviants may cause shifts in cortical state under anaesthesia, explaining the long-latency MMR under anaesthesia and sleep.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated a genomic region in chromosome 11, overlapping the transcription factor WT1, in BrS susceptibility. Here, we investigated the role of WT1 on cardiac conduction using a heterozygous knockout mouse model (Wt1+/-). Transcriptomic analysis revealed increased Scn5a expression predominantly in Wt1+/-cardiomyocytes of the (sub)epicardium of the RV and RVOT without any changes in electrical properties. To unmask an effect on cardiac conduction, we performed optical mapping in a severely challenged setting offered by Scn5a haploinsufficiency, ageing, and exposure to the sodium channel blocker ajmaline and found that diminished Wt1 improved the observed slowed conduction. Examination of human single-nuclei cardiac datasets indicated a strong negative correlation between WT1 and SCN5A expression. In line with this observation, cardiac samples from patients with mutations in SCN5A showed increased WT1 protein abundance in histological sections, suggesting that increased WT1, and not loss, is associated with BrS pathophysiology. By deleting the mouse orthologue of a BrS-associated noncoding region (RE) harboring a candidate regulatory element, we established that this RE controls expression of Wt1 specifically in the (sub)epicardium of the RV. Lastly, transient overexpression of WT1 in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes resulted in reduced sodium current density.

This is partly due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which blocks the free passage of lipophobic molecules and those larger than 400 Da. One strategy to bypass this natural barrier is to use low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) to oscillate circulating micro-sized microbubbles which then exert mechanical stress on the vessel walls. This procedure allows for temporary disruption of the BBB and enhanced local delivery of therapeutics from the blood to the brain parenchyma. In this study, the effect of repeated BBB opening on neuroinflammation in a healthy mouse model was first explored followed by the effect of repeated opening on amyloid pathology in a model for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A cohort of wildtype mice was used to determine the effect of a single BBB opening mediated by ultrasound/microbubbles (US/MB) on the inflammatory profile, using RT-Q-PCR on brain extracts at 2-, 4-, 8- and 15-days post opening. A second cohort of ARTE10 mice, a mouse model for amyloid pathology, was treated with a different sequence of repeated US/MB mediated BBB opening to explore the effect on the pathology. Tissues were also analyzed for immune cell infiltration, microglia and astrocyte activation, and inflammatory response. Results: Our results demonstrate that the opening of the BBB leads to a mild inflammatory response in wild-type animals. However, repeated opening of the BBB in the ARTE10 model resulted in a decrease in amyloid pathology, along with a mild increase of growth factor. Conclusions: Altogether, this study suggests that sonication is not only a safe method to deliver therapeutics to the brain but could also have synergistic effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that these peptides exhibit variable antimicrobial potency but surprisingly similar abilities to activate the PhoQ-PhoP pathway, indicating that signaling function is separable from bactericidal activity. Notably, sublethal concentrations of these peptides induce significant cell elongation, a phenotype dependent on PhoQ and mediated by the upregulation of QueE, which interferes with bacterial cell division.

Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder characterized by disrupted basal ganglia function, offers a unique framework to probe the neural mechanisms underlying rhythmic cognition. We measured beta-band activity and connectivity across cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex during a rhythmic somatosensory timing task to compare prediction- and evaluation-related activity between participants with Parkinson's disease and controls. Using magnetoencephalography, participants received tactile stimuli in regular (non-jittered) and irregular (jittered) sequences, with the final stimulus omitted to probe prediction before and evaluation after the omission. We found prediction-related differences between participants with Parkinson's disease and controls in the cerebellum and basal ganglia before the omissions, while replicating earlier findings in controls, showcasing cerebellar evaluation responses after the omissions. In Parkinson's disease, basal ganglia activity favored jittered over non-jittered somatosensory rhythms, opposite to controls. Altered cerebellar beta-band responses correlated with Parkinson's disease symptom severity. Connectivity analyzes revealed group-by-regularity interactions in a sensory-integration network. These findings demonstrate that temporal prediction and evaluation in rhythmic cognition rely on coordinated beta-band dynamics across the cerebello-striatal-thalamo-cortical network. In Parkinson's disease, disrupted basal ganglia function shifts the network towards compensatory cerebellar engagement and increased connectivity demands under irregular temporal conditions, exposing core mechanisms by which the brain encodes and adapts to rhythmic structure.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

P.; Chen, S.; Tanumihardja, E.; Han, X.; Shi, W.; Shea-Brown, E.; Rao, R. P. N.", "abstract": "A key challenge in analyzing neuroscience datasets is the profound variability they exhibit across sessions, animals, and data modalities--i.e., heterogeneity. Several recent studies have demonstrated performance gains from pretraining neural foundation models on multi-session datasets, seemingly overcoming this challenge. However, these studies typically lack fine-grained data scaling analyses. It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuron- and region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature. This work both highlights the importance of incremental data scaling analyses and suggests new avenues toward optimally selecting pretraining data when developing foundation models on large-scale neuroscience datasets.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

In line with the SENECA model, our findings highlight midlife as a critical transition period: network energy is redistributed along the sensory-transmodal hierarchy, shifting from higher-level networks (DMN-FPN) to lower-level networks (SMN, CON, Auditory, Visual, Language). This reorganization (i) helps preserve a global wiring economy across the lifespan, hinting at an allostatic mechanism (i.e., stability through change); and (ii) may support embodied semantic strategies in older adulthood, leveraging more predictive processing to sustain cognitive flexibility at lower costs.

However, a limited understanding of the genetic determinants of methanotrophy hinders the development of biotechnologies leveraging these unique microbes. Here, we developed and optimized a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system to enable functional genomic screening in methanotrophic bacteria. We built a genome-wide single guide RNA (sgRNA) library in the industrial methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus, consisting of ~45,000 unique sgRNAs mediating inducible, CRISPRi-dependent transcriptional repression. A selective screen during growth on CH4 identified 233 genes whose transcription repression resulted in a fitness defect and repression of 13 genes associated with a fitness advantage. Enrichment analysis of the 233 putative essential genes linked many of the encoded proteins with critical cellular processes like ribosome biosynthesis, translation, transcription, and other central biosynthetic metabolism, highlighting the utility of CRISPRi for functional genetic screening in methanotrophs. The CRISPRi screen uncovered that 50 ppb Co2+ in methanotroph Nitrate Mineral Salts medium is growth inhibitory and decreasing Co2+ to < 10 ppb improved biomass productivity from CH4. Collectively, our results show that the CRISPRi system and sgRNA library developed here can be used for facile gene-function analyses and genomic screening to identify novel genetic determinants of methanotrophy and isolation of improved methanotroph biocatalysts.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We subjected human endothelial and skeletal muscle cells to cyclic mechanical stretch and investigated acute molecular responses. Mechanical loading elicited both shared and cell type-specific alterations in transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles, several of which mirror changes observed in vivo following exercise. Notably, both cell types released acetate in response to mechanical loading, however, many of the changes occurred in opposite directions. For example, genes associated with the electron transport chain were repressed in endothelial cells but upregulated in skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, mechanical loading promoted a transcriptomic shift in endothelial cells indicative of maturation, and reduced their proliferation. Metabolic changes were more pronounced in endothelial cells, which exhibited increased serine biosynthesis from glucose, as demonstrated by 13C-(U)-glucose tracing. Further experiments targeting phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a key enzyme in the serine synthesis pathway, underscored its role in endothelial cell anabolism. These findings suggest that mechanical loading alone can recapitulate several exercise-induced effects in endothelial and muscle cells, and highlight a potential link between mechanical stimuli, serine synthesis, and endothelial cell maturation.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Prior studies suggest that prediction error computations, which represent the difference between heard and expected speech sounds, play a central role in speech perception. However, these studies have relied on non- ecological listening conditions, involving isolated words predicted by artificial cues. In two experiments, we presented 61 listeners with semantically coherent sentences that ended in words of varying predictability. We also manipulated the signal quality of the final word by applying time-limited degradation. Using linear encoding models of EEG responses, we found that neural representations of speech features were jointly influenced by top-down predictions and bottom-up signal quality. Specifically, for unpredicted final words, increasing signal quality resulted in enhanced neural tracking of speech acoustic modulations in low frequency EEG (0-2 Hz delta band). In contrast, for strongly predicted final words, greater signal quality led to reduced tracking of speech modulations. Computational simulations revealed that this interaction is consistent with prediction error computations, but not with an alternative signal sharpening model. These findings extend the evidence for prediction error computations to more naturalistic listening situations.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Among these, the KSHV protein ORF24 serves as a TATA-binding protein (TBP) mimic essential for recognizing viral late promoters, although the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain poorly characterized. Here, we used AlphaFold3 to predict the structure of ORF24 in complex with DNA and validated key features in both transfected cells and during KSHV lytic replication. Structural modeling revealed that ORF24 employs a non-canonical DNA binding mode where the C-terminal domain (CTD) makes critical DNA contacts beyond the canonical TBP fold. Targeted mutagenesis confirmed that ORF24 requires conserved TBP-like phenylalanines alongside a polar-rich binding interface distinct from cellular TBP. During infection, both the TBP-like domain and CTD are essential for ORF24 occupancy at viral late promoters. Most surprisingly, we discovered that ORF24 pre-assembles with RNA polymerase II and the viral protein ORF34 to achieve stable promoter binding. This cooperative assembly mechanism represents a fundamental departure from stepwise eukaryotic transcription initiation, resembling a prokaryotic strategy within the eukaryotic nucleus.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

R.; Gao, C.-F.; Wu, S.-F.", "abstract": "Mating in insects commonly induces an alteration in behavior and physiology in the female that ensures optimal offspring. This is referred to as a post-mating response (PMR). The induction of a PMR requires not only male-derived factors transferred with semen during copulation, such as sex peptide (SP) in Drosophila, but also intrinsic female signaling components. The latter signaling remains poorly understood in most insects, including the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a devastating rice pest. In BPHs the PMR comprises a reduced receptivity to re-mating and increased oviposition. Here, we demonstrate that the neuropeptide corazonin (CRZ) and its receptor (CrzR) are critical for the PMR in female BPHs. Peptide injection and knockdown of CRZ expression by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis demonstrate that distensible CRZ signaling suppresses mating receptivity in virgin N. lugens females and mediates a reduction in re-mating frequency and increased ovulation. The CrzR is highly expressed in the female reproductive tract, and CrzR-knockdown phenocopies Crz diminishment. Importantly, female CRZ/CrzR signaling is indispensable for male seminal fluid factors (e.g. maccessin) to induce the PMR. With disrupted CrzR signaling, seminal fluid or maccessin injection fails to reduce female receptivity. Notably, CRZ is not produced in male accessory gland (MAG) and thus not transferred during copulation. However, male Crz knockout impairs the PMR in mated females and combining male and female Crz knockouts nearly abolished the PMR. Transcriptomics of the MAG indicates that Crz knockout affects the expression of numerous seminal fluid protein genes. Finally, we found that also in female Drosophila melanogaster, disrupted Crz signaling resulted in increased re-mating and reduced oviposition, while CRZ injection suppressed virgin receptivity and increased oviposition. In summary, our study reveals that endogenous female CRZ signaling and male-derived signals cooperate to regulate post-mating transitions in BPHs and Drosophila.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

TGF is known to induce spontaneous oscillations in single-nephron tubular fluid flow in male kidneys. However, male-female differences in this dynamic behavior have not been studied. Leveraging intravital two-photon microscopy, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound-based and transdermal recordings, we found TGF-mediated oscillations across spatial scales in the rodent kidney, from single-nephron to whole-organ levels, and that male kidneys exhibited higher operating frequencies than females. To understand the mechanisms involved, we developed a dynamical systems model of TGF that agrees with physiological observations. Analysis of the mathematical model indicated that higher reabsorption rate and fluid flow efficiency in male proximal tubules not only result in higher frequencies, but also render male nephrons more susceptible to lose TGF-mediated oscillations. Furosemide abolished TGF-mediated oscillations in male kidneys and upregulated tubular injury marker KIM-1, suggesting that the propensity to lose TGF-mediated oscillations underlies the heightened risk for injury in males. Our analysis also indicated that SGLT-2 inhibition confers renoprotection by preserving TGF-mediated oscillations in hyperglycemia.

However, current models of these neural interactions, typically based on divisive normalization or descriptive frameworks, fail to account for the wide range of center-surround effects. Focusing on the domain of motion processing, we propose that both neural and perceptual phenomena related to center-surround motion emerge from a single normative principle: Bayesian causal inference over the latent structure of motion. We derived neural predictions from a causal inference model of perception that dynamically infers the most probable reference frame for moving stimuli. Specifically, we generated predictions for both the mean response and variability of single neurons across the full 4D stimulus space of center and surround motion (i.e., directions and speeds). These predictions exhibit complex interactions that are unexplainable by classic DN models but qualitatively match the wide range of neural data from the primate middle temporal area (MT). Our model resolves two long-standing puzzles: it explains when and why surround stimuli suppress versus facilitate neural responses, and it shows why some MT neurons are found to encode motion in retinal coordinates while others encode motion relative to an inferred reference frame. By unifying disparate neural observations with perception through this model, our work suggests new, theory-driven experiments to probe the circuit-level implementation of these computations.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Social interactions drew more and longer attention than social control scenes lacking the interaction, highlighting the relevance of interaction. The effect of both social bond strength and dominance relations between subject and stimulus on the probability to attend was independently modulated by scene valence. Moreover, beyond reacting to the affordances of the social scene and independent of their social status, males differed in how long they observed the interactions of others.

This study demonstrated the role of the HGFMET axis in invadopodia formation and associated protease trafficking. MET interacts with MT1-MMP and is co-transported to the cell surface. Further, the RTK is found to reside at invadopodia, and its recruitment increases upon HGF stimulation due to enhanced recycling mediated by RAB4 and RAB14. The study further highlights the role of RCP in MET recycling by bringing RAB14 and MET together onto endosomal subdomains. KIF16B, a molecular motor, gets recruited to MET-containing endosomes via RAB14 and promotes the endosomal tubulation, which could be crucial for MET recycling.

Theoretically, we apply a jump-diffusion damage model within a structured population framework to explore the roles of damage rate, noise, and partitioning asymmetry. Our theoretical analyses show that these parameters influence population growth both at equilibrium and during transient dynamics, suggesting that their cellular regulation may be a key strategy for sustaining population fitness. Experimentally, we expose Escherichia coli to glucose limitation and monitor stress responses using a RpoS fluorescent reporter, tracking both single-cell behavior in a microfluidic device combined with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and population growth in a plate reader. Glucose limitation leads to the effects of elevated stress, reduced division, and increased mortality, which are consistently observed across scales.

Previous reports using Shank3B knockout (KO) mice, a genetic model with relevance to ASD and PMDS, revealed deficits in social memory in adulthood, but the postnatal onset and mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. In the hippocampus, area CA2 contributes to the emergence of social memory during development and remains important for this ability through the lifespan. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, support social memory in CA2 and help orchestrate critical periods of plasticity in other brain regions. We found that Shank3B KO pups exhibit specific deficits in short-term social recognition and social novelty preference, which become evident at the end of the second postnatal week and persist into adulthood along with CA2 network aberrations. Excessive PNNs in area CA2 were detected in KO pups at the postnatal time when social recognition function typically emerges in healthy pups. This time was also characterized by greater sequestration of the guidance cue semaphorin-3A (sema3A) and overgrowth of afferents from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in KOs, suggesting that inordinate PNNs during a sensitive period may disorganize developing CA2 circuitry. Reduction of CA2 PNN levels prior to the onset of social dysfunction recovered social recognition function during development, as well as reduced sema3A and SuM inputs to the CA2. The restoration of behavioral function persisted into adulthood along with partial normalization of CA2 network activity.

Over the past two decades, transgenic mosquito strains have been instrumental for studying mosquito biology and developing genetic control strategies such as gene drives. Mosquito transformants are typically identified using fluorescent markers which are assumed to be phenotypically neutral. While generating CRISPR-based gene drive strains with an OpIE2-DsRed marker we unexpectedly found that transgenic females were unable to blood-feed and were consequently sterile. Males, in contrast, appeared physiologically normal and fertile and enabled maintenance of the strains. Recognizing the potential utility of dominant, female-specific sterility for mosquito control, we established new strains controlling for transgene content and integration site, which confirmed that the specific OpIE2-DsRed marker was directly responsible for the blood-feeding defect. Behavioral assays showed that females exhibited normal attraction to a membrane feeder but failed to initiate blood-feeding, performing repeated cycles of probing and proboscis grooming in rapid succession before ultimately leaving the feeder unfed. Microscopic examination of OpIE2a females revealed a pronounced curvature of the proboscis. Similar malformations were also present in males and likely contributed to their reduced adult lifespan, overturning our preliminary conclusion of normal male fitness. A second promoter variant (OpIE2b), differing in flanking sequences at the IE-2 junction, drove bright marker expression without impairing blood-feeding or survival when integrated at the same genomic site. These findings demonstrate how minor differences in promoter architecture can elicit major, unexpected phenotypes.

As many new sequencing technologies in single-cell and spatial resolutions are raised, the construction of GRNs gains opportunities to be generalized to the cell-specific level. Here we propose SVGRN, a deep learning model to infer cell-specific GRNs using spatial transcriptomics data. We model the gene expression, GRN matrix, and spatial coordinates of cells in the structural equation model (SEM) to learn gene interactions in an unsupervised way. Conditioned on the target cell position, the model is able to tune the whole tissue GRN to the target cell through also borrowing information from neighborhood cells. Results on simulated datasets show that SVGRN achieves better performance in cases with more noises, genes, or cells, which illustrates its ability to solve more complex situations. Our model was further applied to spatial transcriptomics datasets generated using different technologies and resolutions, including a seqFISH-based mouse embryo dataset and two Visium-based datasets from human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and fallopian tube tissues. The GRNs predicted by SVGRN from these datasets reveal dynamic gene regulatory patterns in mouse organogenesis, tumor development and the functional organization of the fallopian tube, highlighting the efficiency and broad applicability of our model.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Such a process is called evolutionary branching in adaptive dynamics theory. In one-dimensional trait spaces, the existence of an evolutionary branching point ensures evolutionary branching of an asexual monomorphic population in its neighborhood under rare and small mutations. An evolutionary branching point is a convergence stable point (i.e., a point attractor for a monomorphic population through directional selection) that is not an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy). For analysis of arbitrary higher-dimensional trait spaces with respect to evolutionary branching induced by convergence stable non-ESSes, this study develops two kinds of criteria. The two criteria, referred to as branching possibility and branching inevitability, are based respectively on the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics theory and on the local Lyapunov function. The branching possibility ensures the existence of evolutionary paths achieving evolutionary branching. The branching inevitability ensures steady progress of evolutionary branching through repeated invasions by arbitrary mutants having positive invasion fitnesses, even when the timescale separation between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics is incomplete.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, high dimensionality and spurious associations remain major obstacles to extracting meaningful biological insight from multi-omic host-associated microbiome data; a challenge further exacerbated when \"holo-omic\" analyses across the host-microbiome boundary is considered. Here, we show that a computational method designed for multi-omic analysis in eukaryotes can be leveraged to integrate and analyse five layers of holo-omic data from porcine hosts and their gut microbiomes. We collected caecal tissue and digesta samples during a feeding trial that tested the impact of microbiota-directed fibres (acetylated galactoglucomannan) at critical developmental stages. From 800,000 features including microbial and host genes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metabolites from caecal tissue and digesta, we used multiset correlation and factor analysis to select the most relevant features for capturing coordinated patterns across omic layers. From these features, we predicted over 2,000 putative host-microbiome interactions based on co-occurrence. Some of them reflected previously known relationships between animal and microbiome features, such as microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism being linked to glycoside abundances in host tissue. Other predicted co-occurrences included features that were not detected in single-omic analysis and offer new hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions that warrant future investigation. Hence, we showcase an application of holo-omic analysis that avoids common pitfalls in high-dimensional data analysis; identifies known interactions as a form of validation; and most importantly, predicts new leads for understanding host-microbiome symbiosis.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Excess LB1 in neurons halted migration without altering laminar identity or overall gene expressions in vivo, while in vitro, it elevated nuclear stiffness and impaired neuronal motility in confined spaces. Moreover, mispositioned neurons resulted in electrophysiological defects in the brain. Computational modeling predicted a temporal relationship between nuclear deformation and enhanced migration velocity, which was validated experimentally through live imaging.

Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting rewarding and aversive experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories and motivation. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes, and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of the fluorescent calcium indicator jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of Long-Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue-alcohol association, a mild foot shock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we trained rats to associate three different cues with either alcohol, foot-shock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, LH-GABA activity responds to an aversive shock stimulus, but this response is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations, and their interaction in conflict.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Given the importance of GluN2 subunits in shaping NMDAR function and plasticity, we investigated the expression and localization of specific GluN2 NMDAR variants in the dorsal horn of viable spinal cord tissue from male and female rodents and human organ donors. Analysis of single-cell/nuclei sequencing datasets revealed that the GluN2A (GRIN2A) and GluN2B (GRIN2B) subunits are robustly expressed in dorsal horn neurons of both mice and humans, with moderate expression of GluN2D (GRIN2D) and minimal expression of GluN2C (GRIN2C). Immunohistochemistry with antigen retrieval demonstrated that GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D proteins are all preferentially localized to the superficial dorsal horn of both adult rats and humans, which is conserved between males and females. Surprisingly, we found that these GluN2 NMDAR subunits are enriched in the lateral superficial dorsal horn for rats but not for humans, while presynaptic and neuronal markers are symmetrically distributed across the rat mediolateral axis. A dramatic shift in localization of GluN2A to the lateral superficial dorsal horn was observed across later postnatal development (PD21-PD90) in both male and female rats, with a corresponding change in synaptic NMDAR currents.

They represent syllabic rate (between 2 and 6 Hz), vocalic features (between 30 and 50 Hz), and fundamental frequency (between 100 and 150 Hz). Intracerebral (sEEG) recordings from the auditory cortex of 18 epilepsy patients revealed that theta-gamma dynamics and their coupling are absent at rest but emerge during speech perception, linearly driven by the acoustic envelope.

Here, we provide the first systematic in-vivo visualization of these pathways in the human brain. By guiding high-resolution probabilistic tractography with established histological findings, we mapped the short-range connections within and between five major PFC subdivisions in 1,003 individuals (547 F, 456 M).

However, the evidence that supports the idea that FTO demethylates m6A in AML relies on methods that are non-quantitative and unable to reveal m6A stoichiometry changes before or after FTO depletion. To directly test whether FTO regulates m6A in mRNA, we employed Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to map and quantify m6A at single-nucleotide resolution. We find that the stoichiometry of m6A sites throughout the transcriptome and especially at MYC-specific sites are unaffected despite depletion of FTO activity by knockout, knockdown, or pharmacologic inhibition. This pattern was seen in AML cell lines MONOMAC-6 and MOLM-13, as well as in the non-AML cell line HEK293T. We also do not find that FTO is an oncogene in AML cell lines. Instead, FTO depletion has minimal impact on AML cell viability. We find that the anti-leukemia effect of the small-molecule FTO inhibitor FB23-2 is not due to FTO inhibition since it remains cytotoxic to FTO-deficient cells. Instead of regulating m6A, we find that FTO depletion markedly increases N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) in snRNAs, consistent with m6Am in snRNA being a target of FTO. Overall, our findings do not support an 'm6A eraser' role for FTO in AML cell lines under the conditions tested, and they suggest that the reported demethylation functions of FTO on m6A should be reinvestigated using quantitative m6A mapping methods.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

In mitosis, PI(4,5)P2 accumulation at the plasma membrane is essential for the recruitment of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the anchoring of the mitotic spindle at the plasma membrane. This is largely regulated by the function of kinases and phosphatases that interconvert phosphoinositide species. Here we demonstrate that during mitosis the ORP3 lipid transfer protein, which transfers PI4P from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indirectly regulates PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane, in concert with the regulation by phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation of a secondary ORP3 binding domain to the VAPA ER membrane protein strongly recruits ORP3 to the ER, where it is primed for PI4P transfer at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. Defects in ORP3 function during mitosis result in abnormal PI(4,5)P2 distribution and actin cytoskeleton, abnormal cell division, and various cell division phenotypes, which lead to aneuploidy and eventually to cell death or genomic instability.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Inducing immunogenic forms of programmed cell death (PCD) offers a promising strategy to strengthen anti-tumor immunity and improve therapeutic outcomes. Necroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of regulated cell death triggered by TNF signaling, can elicit robust immune activation. However, its regulation in tumor cells remains incompletely understood, limiting its therapeutic exploitation. To investigate the protein-protein interactions that govern necroptotic cell death in tumor cells, we established a co-Immunoprecipitation - Mass Spectrometry (coIP-MS) workflow using RIPK3, the central effector kinase driving necroptosis in TNF-induced signaling, as bait. This unbiased proteomic approach enables the identification of candidate regulators directly associated with the necrosome complex components under active necroptotic conditions. Among identified candidates, TCOF1 and GDF15 emerged as previously unrecognized modulators, with functional knockout of either gene markedly enhancing necroptotic cell death in tumor cells. Reciprocal IP experiments confirmed a direct interaction between GDF15 and RIPK3, supporting its mechanistic role as a negative regulator that suppresses necroptotic signaling. Thus, our findings extend the function of GDF15 beyond its established role in inflammation, uncovering an additional layer of regulation at the level of cell-intrinsic death signaling.

Through lipidomic profiling of Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that Syn progressively alters lipid metabolism in aging worms. Syn strongly reduces overall content of triacylglycerols (TAG) and disrupts the structure of lipid droplets (LD). These pathological changes depend on Syn's properties to condensate and form inclusions. Apart from lowering TAG levels, Syn also increases the proportion of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFAs). Consequently, genetic inhibition of LCUFA biosynthesis alleviates Syn-induced loss of C. elegans motility. Strikingly, bypassing lipid metabolic defects by supplementing Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MCFAs) restores the Syn-impaired mitochondrial response and rescues motility. These results link Syn condensation to impaired TAG metabolism, which reduces mitochondrial function and enhances overall toxicity.

Canines, sharing aging characteristics with humans, serve as a valuable model to study this process in a translational context. Methods: In the present study, we performed an in-depth characterization of senescence in canine MSCs using a combination of morphological, molecular, and transcriptomic analyses. Early (P2) and late-passage (P6) canine MSCs were characterized using a combination of senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase staining, cell cycle profiling, and both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to capture global transcriptional changes. Results: By employing a passage-based in vitro approach, the present study demonstrates that late-passage cells (P6) compared to early-passage cells (P2) exhibit hallmark features of senescence, including morphological alterations, elevated SA-{beta}-galactosidase activity, and considerable transcriptional changes. These changes were represented by significant upregulation of established senescence marker genes, alongside potential novel candidates and downregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered heterogeneous distribution of senescent subpopulations, upregulation of SASP-related genes and reduced proliferation markers.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Cilia assembly requires the crossing of this barrier by intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, scaffolded by IFT-A and IFT-B complexes, which move cargo bidirectionally using kinesin-2 and dynein-2 motors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, IFT-A loss abolishes retrograde transport, resulting in truncated cilia packed with IFT material. Here, we show that blocking TZ assembly prevents dynein-2 and IFT-B accumulation inside IFT-A-deficient cilia and partially rescues axoneme length. Single-particle imaging reveals that this rescue occurs without recovery of retrograde IFT. Instead, IFT particles exit cilia by passively diffusing through the disrupted TZ. Moreover, IFT-A/TZ double mutants shed ciliary extracellular vesicles (EVs) abnormally enriched in IFT components, providing a second clearance route. We conclude that TZ removal alters ciliary responses to retrograde transport defects, promoting diffusion and EV release to clear IFT machinery and facilitate axoneme extension.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Here we report that the clock regulates oxidative metabolism through diurnal respiration of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Genetic loss of the clock and high fat diet feeding in male mice led to reduced complex I respiration within adipocytes, leading to suppression of PPAR and insulin signaling pathways. In contrast, preserving complex I function maintained adipogenic and metabolic gene networks and protected against diet- and circadian-induced metabolic dysfunction independently of weight gain.

In oogenic germlines, the removal of developing oocytes by apoptosis ensures that oocytes do not contain DNA damage or multiple nuclei. Beyond this chromatin-quality control assurance role, it was unknown how apoptosis contributes to oocyte quality. We used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to study the consequences of loss of apoptosis on oogenesis. Blocking apoptosis reduced fecundity in hermaphrodites at peak fertility and caused germline architectural defects such as abnormal rachis morphology and perturbed the arrangement and distribution of oogenic germline compartments. We posit that the defects associated with the loss of germline apoptosis arise due to lack of sufficient space for normal oogonia growth. In support of this idea, oocytes and embryos are abnormally small and exhibit low viability in animals unable to execute apoptosis. These findings suggest that in addition to preventing ploidy defects during oogenesis, apoptosis contributes to fertility by preserving homeostatic germline structure required for the fidelity of oogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Building on this insight, we introduce NyxBind, the first TFBS prediction model that applies contrastive learning across multiple TFBS types to enhance regulatory sequence representations. NyxBind better captures discriminative sequence features, enabling more accurate and biologically meaningful TFBS prediction. Extensive evaluations show that NyxBind consistently outperforms alternative models across multiple TFBS classification benchmarks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability.

Existing methods often fail to capture inhibitor-bound structural states of kinases, particularly in clinically relevant contexts such as treatment response and acquired resistance, where genomic data alone are insufficient. Here, we use activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to monitor composite amino acid reactivity changes - across cysteine, lysine, and carboxylic acid residues - as a functional readout of kinase conformation and activation state. Using electrophilic probes, we show that treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells with vemurafenib or trametinib decreases overall cysteine and lysine reactivity in BRAFV600E and MEK1/2, likely reflecting composite changes in amino acid accessibility across multiple reactive residues associated with inhibitor binding. Changing the order of probe addition and inhibitor treatment altered labeling outcomes, consistent with competitive engagement and structural stabilization. Comparative analysis of ATP-competitive BRAFV600E inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib revealed distinct impacts on aspartate and glutamate labeling patterns, suggesting that ABPP can distinguish inhibitor-dependent differences in residue accessibility that may reflect distinct inhibitor-bound conformations. In inhibitor-resistant melanoma models, ABPP detected differential residue reactivity relative to parental cells, consistent with BRAF overexpression and the MEK2 Q60P activation mutation, both established mechanisms of MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, global proteome analyses of cysteine and lysine reactivity upon BRAFV600E inhibition, revealed probe-accessible cysteine labeling changes in labeling on KSR2, indicating broader MAPK pathway remodeling. Together, these findings establish ABPP as a powerful chemical biology approach for investigating inhibitor-dependent changes in kinase residue accessibility, providing a framework to explore how conformational dynamics and pathway adaptation shape therapeutic response and resistance in oncogenic signaling networks.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) RT may preferentially spare normal tissue while maintaining tumor control. This study evaluates the impact of single-fraction and multi-fraction thoracic FLASH RT on lymphocyte preservation, apoptosis, and immunosuppressive signaling in mice. Methods: We compared the immunological impact of thoracic FLASH RT and CONV RT in C57BL/6 mice using single-fraction (17 Gy) and multi-fraction (2 Gy x 5) regimens using the Mobetron (IntraOp). Longitudinal blood sampling was performed at multiple time-points post-irradiation through facial vein bleed with flow cytometry analysis for CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and NK cells to assess lymphocyte counts, apoptotic lymphocytes through Annexin V staining, and immune suppression by examining regulatory T cells (Tregs) and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Mechanistic studies included immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses of splenic tissues to evaluate Chk1 and STAT3 signaling pathways. Results: In single-fraction RT, FLASH significantly reduced lung and heart fibrosis (p < 0.0001) at 28 weeks post-RT. The FLASH effect was also seen acutely on circulating immune cells, with significantly reduced lymphocyte apoptosis and accelerated recovery of CD4+, CD8+, CD3+, NK, and B cell populations compared to CONV RT in both single-fraction and multi-fraction regimens. Conversely, CONV RT induced long-lasting increases in Tregs and sustained PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on T- and B-cells at 2- and 5-months post-irradiation in both fractionation regimens. Within the spleen, we also found CONV RT induced sustained activation of the Chk1-STAT3 pathway in CD45+ immune cells, which correlates with increased PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Conclusion: FLASH RT mitigates RIL, reduces lymphocyte apoptosis, and prevents long-term immunosuppression by reduced activation of the Chk1-STAT3 pathway. These findings suggest FLASH RT may confer immunological advantages over CONV RT to enhance therapeutic efficacy.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model to explore this behavior that probabilistically models cell growth, migration and interaction parameters. Through this project, we explore the influence of cytokines like IL-2 and CCL2 on T-cell behavior and optimize the interactions between T-cells and cancer cells to most efficiently kill tumors using modeling.

Our study found that, from greatest to least effect, increasing the killing, proliferation, and infiltration rate of T-cells increased the clearance rate of the tumor. A 17% increase in killing rate was enough to control and shrink the tumor, while a 15% increase in their proliferation rate was sufficient to control the tumor without regressing it; a 30% increase in their proliferation rate was sufficient to shrink the tumor.

These experiments revealed a striking enrichment of proteins involved in SUMOylation and proteins that reside in PML nuclear bodies. A strong enrichment of the adenoviral E1B protein, originally used for transformation of this cell line, may explain this striking observation, and can shed light on the remarkable difference with the proximity map of p53 in the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line. Strong enrichment of the mediator complex in HCT116, related to active p53-dependent transcription, is missing in 293 cells and can explain the lack of p53 transcriptional activity in these cells.

AP1 transcription factors are notoriously difficult to modulate pharmacologically due to the absence of well-defined binding pockets. Here, we identify a novel site on deltaFOSB, located outside the DNA-binding cleft, that accommodates small molecules. We show that sulfonic acid-containing compounds bind to this site via an induced-fit mechanism, reorienting side chains critical for DNA binding, and that they may hinder the deltaFOSB bZIP alpha-helix from binding to the major groove of DNA. In vivo, direct administration of one such compound, JPC0661, into the brain reduces deltaFOSB occupancy at genomic AP1 consensus sites by approximately 60% as determined by CUT&RUN-sequencing. These findings suggest that DNA binding and release by AP1 transcription factors can be controlled via small molecules that dock into a novel site that falls outside of the DNA-binding cleft. Minimal sequence conservation across 29 bZIP domain-containing transcription factors in this druggable groove suggests that it can be exploited to develop AP1-subunit-selective compounds.

BACE aggregates many micro contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.

We described patterns in gut microbial community structure and composition across eight sites. The velvet worms were unfed for two weeks prior to dissection to lessen the influence of transient prey-associated microorganisms. Amplicon sequencing of the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, with positive and negative controls integrated to assess contamination and ensure data quality.

A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 3,307 bin markers generated by next-generation sequencing. Comprehensive phenotypic analysis was conducted for heading date, internode length, and diameter. A total of 54 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified across the genome.

These pleiotropic loci include well-known functional genes such as SCM2 and Gn1a, as well as several novel loci potentially involved in regulating stem strength and lodging resistance. Additionally, RNA-Seq analysis was performed to identify candidate genes associated with these traits. Among the 1,263 expressed genes within the 15 pleiotropic QTL regions, 183 differentially expressed genes were identified. LOC_Os06g11130 was highlighted as a key gene for further investigation.

Determining the characteristics of kinases that phosphorylate specific substrates have been extensively studied. Most tools utilize amino acid sequence motifs around phosphosites but do not consider the biological characteristics of substrate proteins. Results: We present KSMoFinder, a kinase-substrate-motif prediction model that learns factors beyond motif similarities by integrating the biological contexts of proteins. We learn the semantics in a knowledge graph containing contextual relationships of proteins, kinase-specific motifs and motif composition, and represent the proteins and motifs as embedded vectors. Using the representations as features, we train a supervised deep learning classifier to identify kinase-phosphosite relationships. We use ground truth kinase-substrate-motif dataset from iPTMnet and PhosphositePlus and evaluate the prediction performance of KSMoFinder. Pairwise comparative assessments with prior kinase-substrate prediction tools demonstrate the superior performance of KSMoFinder. KSMoFinder trained using our knowledge graph embeddings surpasses the prediction performances using embeddings of popular protein language models such as ProtT5, ESM2 and ESM3 with a ROC-AUC of 0.851 and PR-AUC of 0.839 on a testing dataset with equal number of positives and negatives. Unlike most existing tools, KSMoFinder can be utilized to predict at the motif and at the substrate protein level.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Identifying the steady state a cell occupies requires measuring molecular concentrations. This in turn raises a fundamental question: which chemical species should be selected to reliably distinguish among multiple steady states? We introduce a network-structural approach for identifying indicator species--a subset of species whose concentrations alone suffice to identify which steady state the system occupies. By decomposing a CRN into subnetworks based on structural criteria and applying topological degree theory, we show that the concentrations within certain subnetworks uniquely determine those of all remaining species. These subnetworks thus provide indicator species that distinguish all possible steady states. Crucially, our method relies only on stoichiometric and regulatory information, without requiring kinetic parameters. Implemented via a computational algorithm, the framework is validated through numerical simulations and applied to biochemical networks. This work provides a principled strategy for steady-state identification in high-dimensional biochemical networks from partial observations, with potential applications in single-cell data analysis and biomarker discovery.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Nearly all well-validated chemicals involved in PD affect mitochondria, and the great majority of those identified inhibit mitochondrial complex I, causing ATP depletion and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that inhibition of mitochondrial complex III would also cause dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Using Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate the in vivo effects of the complex III-inhibiting pesticides antimycin A and pyraclostrobin, we found that both caused neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration was specific to the dopamine neurons, and complex III inhibition caused a more-oxidized cellular environment in those neurons. Pharmacological and genetic antioxidant interventions rescued neurodegeneration, but energetic rescue attempts did not. Finally, optogenetic production of superoxide anion specifically at complex III caused dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Thus, redox stress at complex III is sufficient for dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and redox stress following chemical inhibition is necessary for dopaminergic neurodegeneration in vivo in C. elegans.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Behaviorally, VWM and LTM accuracies are reliably correlated at the behavioral level, raising the question of whether LTM encoding uniquely engages processes that are distinct from VWM encoding. To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity as participants completed recognition memory tasks with set sizes of 32 and 128, far beyond typical VWM capacity. Using interelectrode correlation (IC) analysis, we found that IC patterns reliably predicted individual differences in LTM encoding across both set sizes, indicating a robust, domain-general neural signature. Importantly, this predictive power remained even after controlling for VWM and attentional control performance, suggesting that the model captures variance specific to LTM encoding. Temporally, predictive signals emerged only after stimulus onset and persisted for 500-600 ms. Early and late encoding phases involved distinct network structures, reflecting dynamic neural processes underlying individual differences in LTM encoding. Together, our findings reveal a unique and temporally dynamic neural signature that supports individual differences in LTM encoding, independent of general cognitive abilities.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, despite its pervasiveness, experimental work investigating how parasites adapt to the conditions provided by a coinfected host is mostly missing. Here, we adopted an experimental evolution approach to investigate if coinfection with the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp) affected the infection dynamics and virulence of the murine malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii (Py). To this purpose, lines of Py were passaged either in single infected hosts (SI-lines) or in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp (COI-lines). After five and seven passages, the infection dynamics and virulence of evolved lines were compared to the ancestral Py population during single infection trials. As expected, we found that serial passages increased parasitemia and Py virulence, due to the competitive advantage of genotypes with the fastest replication rate, but SI-lines and COI-lines had similar replication rate and virulence. Hosts infected with evolved lines of Py were also less tolerant (steeper slope between red blood cell counts and parasitemia) but again there was no difference between SI-lines and COI-lines. In a second experiment, COI-lines were also used to infect hosts during coinfection trials, allowing us to compare within-host Py replication when the environment during the evaluation trials matched the environment experienced during the passages and when they were mismatched. The results showed that COI-lines used during single infection trials (mismatched environment) had a slower replication rate compared to both SI-lines and COI-lines used during matched-environment trials. Overall, although we did not find any difference in the virulence of SI-lines and COI-lines after seven passages, Py rapidly adapted to the environmental conditions provided by single infected or coinfected hosts, as shown by the slower replication rate found in mismatched-environment trials.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

In rats, long daily cocaine access (4-6 h vs. 1-2 h) increases drug self-administration and cue-induced cocaine seeking, suggesting that greater intake promotes relapse. However, prior studies used continuous-access paradigms, whereas human cocaine use is typically intermittent. Moreover, these studies used conditioned stimuli (CS), whereas discriminative stimuli (DS) are more effective in triggering increases in drug-seeking actions. Here, we used intermittent access (IntA) self-administration to examine how session length (Short-IntA: 2 h vs. Long-IntA: 4 h) affects CS- and DS-induced cocaine seeking. Experimental approach: Female rats self-administered cocaine intermittently during daily 2- or 4-h IntA sessions, with alternating DS+ (cocaine available; 5 min) and DS- (no cocaine; 25 min) periods. Lever pressing during DS+ delivered cocaine and a CS+; lever pressing during DS- delivered only a CS-. After four weeks of abstinence, rats received a cocaine-seeking test where all cues were presented response-independently, and lever presses - which had no consequence - measured cocaine seeking. Key results: Long-IntA rats took twice more cocaine than did Short-IntA rats. Both groups later showed significant (DS+)- but not (CS+)-triggered cocaine seeking, with no group differences. Thus, total intake did not predict cue-induced relapse propensity. However, individual cocaine intake patterns did (hourly consumption, burst-like self-administration, and latency to first infusion). Conclusions and Implications: Under intermittent-access conditions, individual cocaine-use patterns, not cumulative intake, predict vulnerability to cue-induced relapse. This highlights the importance of individual drug-taking profiles in relapse risk assessment.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Though there are existing methods of CNV analysis, they are often limited by slow speed, high memory consumption, lower accuracy in the absence of a reference for diploid cells, lower sensitivity at low read counts, and no support for clonal tree construction. Results: To overcome these issues, we developed the R package fastCNV for detecting CNVs from ST, including Visium HD, or scRNA-seq data. FastCNV pools diploid references across samples and, within each sample, aggregates similar spots or cells with few reads into meta spots or cells. It automatically builds a clonality tree, and runs several times faster than other methods while using less memory. To measure the accuracy of fastCNV, we used 117 cancer cell line samples with both scRNA-seq and bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. FastCNV identified CNVs highly correlated to those calculated from WES data (median correlation above 0.75), showing a significant improvement as compared to other methods such as inferCNV. Notably, fastCNV enables, for the first time, the analysis of CNVs from the Visium HD spatial transcriptomics technology. Applied to Visium HD breast cancer ST data, fastCNV identifies tumor subclones tightly related to different histologies, linking specific genetic aberrations to tumor progression. Conclusions: FastCNV is a significant improvement on existing R methods for CNV detection from ST, including Visium HD, or scRNA-seq data in terms of speed, memory usage, sensitivity and accuracy.

Despite their considerable sequence similarity and conserved overall architecture, these channels exhibit striking differences in ion conductance, K+ selectivity, and voltage dependence. Here, we performed microsecond-timescale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to directly compare the ion conduction mechanisms of HCN and CNG channels, using the prototypical K+-selective channel MthK as a reference. Our simulations reproduced key features observed in single-channel patch-clamp electrophysiology and revealed that distinct selectivity filter architectures and dynamic behaviors are the primary determinants underlying the divergence in ion conductance and K+ selectivity between HCN and CNG channels.

Emerging evidence has identified roles for individual protein acyltransferases encoded by the ZDHHC in cancers, yet the roles of de-S-acylation enzymes are less clear. Recent evidence suggests that acyl-protein thioesterase (APT1)/LYPLA1 can impact epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. This study integrates patient datasets, CRISPR dependency data, and in vitro assays to find APT1 as a context-dependent vulnerability in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Despite the highest protein abundance in luminal MCF7 cells, basal-like MDA-MB-468 cells exhibited the most prominent specific APT1 activity, reflecting subtype-specific regulation. Inhibition of APT1 with ML348 increased S-acylation of nuclear and mitochondrial proteins without altering global acylation. Functionally, APT1 inhibition reduced cell proliferation while inducing minimal apoptosis, consistent with cytostatic growth arrest. Cell-cycle analysis revealed G1 accumulation and reduced S/G2 transition, linking proteomic changes to impaired replication. These findings establish APT1 as a regulator of TNBC proliferation through dynamic de-S-acylation of cell-cycle and mitochondrial proteins, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic vulnerability in aggressive breast cancers.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

A paradox exists in that both diurnal and nocturnal animals experience nocturnal IOP elevation despite their contrasting behavioral chronotypes. Here, we developed a minimal mathematical framework where IOP rhythms arise from the linear superposition of two sinusoidal signals: adrenal glucocorticoids (GC) and norepinephrine (NE) from the superior cervical ganglion. In both diurnal and nocturnal species, NE levels increase at night, while GC levels peak oppositely in the morning and evening. A meta-analysis of published datasets showed that IOP peaks in the early night for nocturnal animals and in the late night for diurnal animals, aligning with the predicted maxima of the combined GC and NE sine waves. In aged mice and following superior cervical ganglionectomy, IOP rhythms shifted in phase and decreased in amplitude and mean level; these changes were accounted for by selectively reducing the NE component's amplitude in the model. Conversely, in diurnal humans, aging results in a delayed IOP phase, which is replicated by diminishing NE amplitude. Thus, species differences, age-related changes, and the effects of sympathetic ablation on IOP can be coherently explained by the combination of the two zeitgeber signals with distinct phases. This straightforward yet robust framework offers a unifying concept for the circadian regulation of IOP across species and may inform the development of novel diagnostic algorithms and chronotherapeutic strategies for glaucoma.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, whether platelet-driven thrombo-inflammatory pathways affect acute inflammation and cardiac repair processes in permanent, non-reperfused myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Methods: We targeted GPVI and GPIIb/IIIa in experimental permanent MI in mice. Cardiac, bone marrow, and blood innate immune responses were evaluated by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Survival and cardiac repair were assessed over the inflammatory and scar formation phase, until day 10 after permanent MI. Results: Platelet GPVI immunodepletion by injection of the anti-GPVI antibody JAQ1 did not affect levels of neutrophil or monocyte subsets (Ly6Chi and Ly6Clow) in the bone marrow and blood, and did not alter accumulation of monocytes, macrophage subsets (defined by expression of MHCII and TIM4), or neutrophil subsets (SiglecFhi/low) in the infarcted heart on day 4. GPVI depletion only had a minimal effect on cardiac repair, slightly decreasing interstitial fibrosis in the infarct border zone on day 10. Four days after MI, GPIIb/IIIa inhibition by JON/A-F(ab')2 had no effect on cardiac or systemic innate immune cell levels as measured by flow cytometry and did not affect composition and transcriptomic profile of the cardiac immune infiltrate as revealed by single-cell RNA-sequencing. GPIIb/IIIa inhibition did not improve cardiac remodeling, and was even associated with an increased mortality rate over 10 days post-MI.

DREB subfamily A4, contains a sub-group named TINY. Previous studies in Arabidopsis suggest that TINYs suppress plant growth and mediate abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. In this study, we investigated the function of the tomato drought-induced TINY1. Under drought conditions, tiny1 mutant lost turgor and wilted more rapidly than control M82 plants. However, this sensitivity was attributed to its larger leaf area, rather than intrinsic differences in drought response. Measurements of stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, and osmotic adjustment revealed no significant differences between tiny1 and M82. Furthermore, whole plant daily transpiration of M82 and tiny1 with similar leaf area, showed no differences. Interestingly, the growth-promoting effect of tiny1 was confined to early developmental stages; enhanced embryo growth and hypocotyl elongation, and accelerated emergence of the first true leaves-trait that later contributed to increased leaf area. At later stages, the mutation had no observable impact on growth rate. Our results show increased gibberellin (GA) activity in the mature tiny1 embryo and suggest that TINY1 suppresses embryonic growth by repressing GA biosynthesis through downregulation of GA 20-oxidase 4 (GA20ox4) gene expression.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

These functions are largely based on the metabolic activity of microbial communities, which arises from the individual members' contributions and their interactions. However, microbial functions and interactions are often inferred from simplified systems such as pure or pairwise cultures. Larger communities, in particular, are mainly analysed by metagenomics and the activity is deduced from the genetic potential of their community members. Although these approaches allow detailed insights into compositions, pairwise interactions and potential functions, they neglect the complexities of microbial communities, as evident in higher-order relationships, competition outcomes and the regulatory influence of environmental factors and other community members. Here, we study a mouse gut community along a gradient of complexity - from monocultures, to in vitro communities, to the mouse gut, to probe how bacteria adapt metabolically to their biotic and abiotic environments. Using metaproteomics to analyze realized bacterial niches and metabolic modeling to infer community interactions, we found that bacteria substantially modify their carbon source usage, biosynthetic activities, and protein allocation when grown in communities versus isolation. Furthermore, communities themselves adapted to their growth environment, changing in functionality as well as in the metabolic network between members. Host-associated communities isolated from the mouse gut invested in resource acquisition and utilized a broader spectrum of carbon sources, resulting in a large increase of predicted interactions between them.

Emerging evidence implicates mechanoactivity in CAR T cell biology, but CAR-transmitted T cell forces have not been directly measured. Here, we utilize DNA-based molecular tension probes (MTPs) conjugated to CAR target ligands, providing evidence of actin-polymerization dependent forces exceeding 4.7-19 pN borne by the CAR. We demonstrate force transmission by three clinically relevant CARs (CD123, CD33, and CD19), suggesting that these forces are generalizable across CAR targets and constructs. Additionally, we identify intracellular co-stimulatory domains as the main determinants of CAR-mediated forces, because first-generation CARs lacking co-stimulatory domains do not transmit measurable forces to their ligand. Finally, we demonstrate that CAR forces temporally precede Ca2+ signaling and are spatially correlated with phosphorylation of classical TCR-signaling machinery, indicating a link between CAR T cell forces and early biochemical signaling. Our study introduces CAR-mediated mechanobiology as a key correlate of early CAR T cell activation events.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

A.; Abrego, N.; Morin, P.; Roslin, T.; Ovaskainen, O. T.", "abstract": "Community dynamics are complex and thus challenging to infer from observational data alone. Experiments, with their ability to control variables and isolate mechanisms, are a powerful tool for uncovering the causal processes that drive community dynamics. They therefore allow us to move beyond correlations and to directly test theoretical predictions. Yet, because experiments are often logistically demanding and resource-intensive, they are less frequently employed than observational approaches in community ecology. Here, we trace the past three decades of experimental research in community ecology through a systematic literature review. We focus on the motivation behind experiments, their links to ecological theory, the types of questions they address, their scale, and the methods used to do this. Our results corroborate the historically tight relationship between experiments and ecological theory and document a gradual increase in experimental complexity -particularly related to the use of molecular methods. However, persistent gaps remain in the taxa and ecosystems studied, with aquatic ecosystems, fungi, and microbes still underrepresented compared to terrestrial plants and animals. Moreover, experiments are still limited in their spatial and temporal scale; they are typically short-term, local, and reliant on manual methods. The integration of high-throughput technologies with experimental workflows is still in its infancy, even though they are increasingly common in biomonitoring. To illustrate the potential of such tools in experimental research, we present a proof-of-concept study. It shows how automated technologies can be incorporated at different stages of the experimental workflow to expand the scale of experiments while reducing the reliance on human labor and potentially lowering financial costs. We conclude that many of the long-lasting biases and challenges in experimental community ecology could be addressed by combining technological innovations with broader collaboration among research groups. Coordinated networks, standardized protocols, and the integration of long-term and large-scale experimental designs can substantially improve in situ replication as well as cross-site comparability. Such efforts are essential for developing a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of community dynamics across diverse ecosystems.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, the identification of sex-determining gene/s in Spinacia is challenging due to incomplete genome assemblies, high genomic similarity between males and females, and the limitations of transcriptome-only analyses, which may miss unannotated or novel genes in poorly assembled or absent genomic regions. To overcome these limitations, we employed a reference-genome-free k-mer approach to identify candidate sex-determining genes in Spinacia turkestanica, the closest evolutionary relative of cultivated spinach (S. oleracea). Male-specific reads were de novo assembled into contigs, revealing 21.5 Mb of the sex-determining region (SDR). Using the MAKER pipeline, which integrates transcriptomic and proteomic evidence, we predicted 226 protein-coding genes within the SDR, including nine previously unannotated. Transcriptomic profiling combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified eight SDR DEGs, including two newly annotated genes, co-expressing during early male flower development. qPCR validation confirmed three SDR genes as candidate sex-determining factors, including TU_SDR00087 (bZIP domain), TU_SDR000168 (RNA-binding splicing factor domain), and TU_SDR000174 (MYB domain).

F.; Brodie, E. L.", "abstract": "As a consequence of climate change and unsustainable management practices, agricultural soils in the Mediterranean region are often degraded. The application of composted organic wastes is traditionally considered a beneficial practice to improve soil health. We studied the permanence of the beneficial effects of the long-term (20 years) application of composted organic wastes, versus mineral fertilization or no fertilization, on Mediterranean vineyard soil health. To this aim, four years after ceasing fertilization, a comprehensive analysis of soil physicochemical and biological properties, including prokaryotic diversity and functional traits by genome-centric metagenomics, was conducted to ascertain whether the beneficial effects of organic fertilization were maintained 4 years after its end. In general, but not always, soils treated with composted organic wastes showed significantly higher values of many physicochemical and biological properties (e.g., organic matter, Olsen phosphorus and extractable potassium), resulting in improved soil multifunctionality. However, despite such statistical significance, the quantitative magnitude of many of those differences was small. Fertilization regimes had a lasting strong influence on soil prokaryotic communities, as 70% of the 200 metagenome-assembled genomes and 86% of the prokaryotic functional traits showed significant differences among treatments. Organic amendments promoted nitrifying taxa such as Nitrosocosmicus oleophilus and Nitrospira japonica. In minerally-fertilized soils, resource acquisition and stress tolerance strategies were fostered among prokaryotic communities, possibly due to resource limitation and soil degradation, respectively. Stress tolerance traits were lower under organic fertilization, likely due to the improved soil properties and functions. The results obtained suggest that soil functions are influenced by microbial genes involved in nitrogen and carbon cycling, underscoring the central role of microbial metabolism in sustaining soil health and ecosystem functioning. This study demonstrates the lasting benefits of composted organic amendments in promoting soil multifunctionality in vineyard soils.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Diversity of such processes usually arises through the addition or loss of components rather than through changes in their order, since reordering can disrupt functional integration. Here we show that reordering of the steps associated with termite nuptial pairing can generate behavioral diversity. In most termites, dispersed adults shed their wings before initiating tandem pairing, as wings interfere with communication between females and males. However, we found that in the Australian termite, Microcerotermes nervosus, tandem running occurs prior to wing shedding, and the act of tandem running itself facilitates dealation. Video tracking revealed that wing removal improves movement coordination, and comparative analysis of sympatric species showed that M. nervosus exhibits much higher tandem stability than others. These results suggest that enhanced movement coordination of this species may have potentiated step reordering. Our findings demonstrate that even functionally conserved sequences can be reorganized and that overcoming such constraints can open novel pathways for behavioral diversification.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Although the enzymatic activity of Rlig1 implies a role in RNA maintenance or repair, its broader molecular context remains insufficiently characterised. Here we identify cellular interactors of Rlig1 using affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry in a HEK293 Rlig1-KO model. Our approach revealed several RNA and DNA surveillance, degradation and repair proteins as well as a diverse set of RNA binding and RNA processing enzymes as potential interactors. Notably, ribosomal proteins were highly enriched, suggesting a link between Rlig1 and the translational machinery. Cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry confirmed that Rlig1 interacts with 80S ribosomes in vitro and preferentially binds the large ribosomal subunit near the 28S rRNA. Polysome profiling corroborated this interaction, as Rlig1 was recruited to ribosomal fractions containing the large ribosomal subunit in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, Rlig1-deficient cells exhibited earlier polysome loss and significantly impaired translational activity compared to their WT counterparts under these conditions.

M.; Ma, Q.; Liu, Z.", "abstract": "Background Woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) is a widely used model system for cultivated strawberries and Rosaceae for molecular genetic studies. Nevertheless, available databases for its cis-regulatory element identification are limited. With the emergence of large language models in plant research, strawberry research could benefit significantly from applying these models. One such model derived from Plant DNA Large Language Models (PDLLMs) effectively predicts open chromatin regions (OCRs), which are nucleosome-depleted areas typically associated with cis-regulatory elements. However, improvement of the model's accessibility and utility will be needed to facilitate the model's application in strawberry as well as other plant species. Results We developed the FveOCRs database (http://liulab.online:33838/FveOCRLiuLabTestVer25), which predicts open chromatin regions located within 5,000 bp upstream sequences, the first and second introns and exons, and the longest introns in Fragaria vesca genes. Predictions were generated using a sliding-window approach based on one of the PDLLMs. In the database, users could predict open chromatin regions for input DNA sequences from any plant species and obtain visual graphs with precise predicted regions of open chromatins. Conclusions The FveOCRs database is the first database for open chromatin region prediction in Fragaria vesca based on a Plant DNA Large Language Model. It can also predict OCRs in user-provided DNA sequences from any plant species. The resource and its accessible visual graphs will facilitate discovery of cis-regulatory elements and engineering of gene expression in strawberry and other plant species.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, existing methods either rely on computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes or adopt variational approaches that forgo principled uncertainty quantification. To address this limitation and cater to practical needs, we abandon the MCMC framework and turn to resampling-based posterior inference for multimodal integration. Our method, Bayesian Cooperative Learning (BayesCOOP), embeds fast maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Bayesian bootstrap, combining a novel jittered group spike-and-slab prior with an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) coordinate descent algorithm under randomly weighted data perturbations. Averaging posterior summaries (MAP estimates) across bootstrap replicates yields approximate posterior samples that retain Bayesian interpretability while avoiding the computational burden of traditional sampling-based inference. We establish theoretical connections between BayesCOOP's pseudo-posterior averaging and posterior contraction principles, demonstrating near-optimal posterior consistency under sparsity. Extensive simulation studies and analyses of pregnancy multi-omics datasets demonstrate that BayesCOOP substantially outperforms state-of-the-art early, intermediate, and late fusion approaches in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty assessment.

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses. Results We performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end - either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences.

We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of microbial communities from 1,868 tumor and peritumor samples across 11 cancer types. Although 88.5% of microbial species are present in both tissue types, tumor and peritumor tissues exhibit profound transcriptional divergence: only 34.1% of microbial genes are expressed in both tissue types, and merely 18.2% of predicted HLA-binding peptides overlap. This transcriptional divergence represents microbial transcriptional reprogramming (MTR) in tumor tissues, through which microbes activate distinct genomic regions while adapting to tumor microenvironmental pressures, thereby generating tumor-specific peptide repertoires. Using Microbial Transcriptional Reprogramming Index (MiTRI) to quantify MTR, we found that higher MiTRI values correlate with expanded immunogenic peptide repertoires. Mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics confirmed that 25% of naturally presented microbial peptides originate from MTR regions. Crucially, in microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer, neo-adjuvant therapy responders exhibited significantly higher MiTRI values. T cell receptors (TCRs) recognized MTR-derived epitopes at 2.10-fold higher rates than genome-wide epitopes, accounting for 79.1% of clonally expanded TCRs.

To assess whether the neomorphic functions of EWS::FLI1 are fundamentally dependent on evolutionarily recent cofactors such as ETS transcription factors (ETS-TFs), Plycomb group (PcG) proteins, CBP/p300, or specific subunits of the BAF complex, we expressed EWS::FLI1 in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This minimal system was chosen because several key EWS::FLI 's cofactors possess greatly reduced sequence homology (e.g., BAF) or are lacking altogether (e.g., ETS-TFs, PcG, or CBP/p300). We used co-IP/MS to map the yeast interactome, Chip-Seq to identify gDNA binding sequences, RNA-Seq for global gene expression, and engineered reporters to test conversion of (GGAA) tandem repeats (GGAASat) into neoenhancers. We found that the yeast EWS::FLI1 interactome was more limited and qualitatively distinct from its human counterpart, sharing core machinery (e.g. RNA Polymerase II, FACT) but lacking the BAF/SWI-SNF and spliceosome complexes, and showing strong enrichment for the SAGA chromatin remodeling complex. We also found that EWS::FLI1 binds to hundreds of sites in the yeast genome with a clear preference for putative ETS-TF consensus sequences and (CA) dinucleotide repeats. Yet, EWS::FLI1 expressing cells presented only minimal transcriptional dysregulation, a stark contrast to the extensive changes observed in humans and Drosophila cells. Finally, we found that EWS::FLI1 successfully converted silent GGAASat sequences into active enhancers in yeast. This remarkable result occurs despite the absence of homologs for key human activators, such as CBP/p300, strongly suggesting that EWS::FLI1 can mobilize functionally related, non-homologous pathways to establish neoenhancers at GGAASat sites. Altogether, our results indicate that EWS::FLI1's core ability to drive GGAASat-dependent gene expression is a conserved, ancient property, while GGAASat-independent extensive transcriptome reprogramming is dependent on co-factors and pathways specific to animal cells.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

SIRT2 is a mammalian Sirtuin known to mediate the longevity benefits of calorie restriction and exercise. Currently, the role of SIRT2 in regulating stress-induced skeletal muscle atrophy is unclear. We found that SIRT2 is a critical regulator of muscle homeostasis and is required to protect against stress-induced muscle atrophy. SIRT2 levels are reduced during glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy. SIRT2 deficient mice are susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy, while muscle-specific SIRT2-transgenic mice exhibit improved muscle function and are protected from glucocorticoid-induced atrophy.

Objective To test whether PKP2 deficiency only in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to provoke premature aging and pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocytes, cardiac resident cells. Methods We studied mice with cardiomyocyte-specific, tamoxifen-activated loss of PKP2 (PKP2cKO) using conventional and multiplex imaging, cytokine arrays, epigenetic clocks, spatial transcriptomics, expansion and structured illumination microscopy, and correlative data analysis. We examined non-myocytes and cardiomyocytes for premature aging and senescence. Results We observed senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) and p21 staining in non-myocytes. Cytokines in media of non-myocyte cells were consistent with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Epigenetic clocks identified premature aging. Multiplex immunohistochemistry showed non-myocyte cells in niches, intermingled with cardiomyocytes. Spatial transcriptomics showed over-representation of SASP-related transcripts, predominantly in myocyte-rich areas of the left ventricle. SAHFs, p21 staining and increased epigenetic age were not found in cardiomyocytes from PKP2cKO hearts, though we observed structural features associated to premature aging. Cross-reference analysis showed correlation between the PKP2cKO cardiac proteome and that of mice 5 or 6 times their chronological age, as well as transcriptional signatures of neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusion Loss of PKP2 expression only in adult cardiac myocytes is sufficient to induce pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocytes, and overall premature cardiac aging.

Arabidopsis BR-deficient mutants display reduced PCK1 activity and elevated phosphorylation at conserved Ser-62 and Thr-66 residues. BR treatment induces PCK1 dephosphorylation and activation, whereas the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 phosphorylates these sites, altering quaternary structure and inactivating PCK1. Phospho-blocking mutations of Ser-62/Thr-66 confer BR-independent PCK1 activity and enhance seedling growth, while phosphomimetic mutations reduce PCK1 activity and impair seedling growth and establishment.

Pharmacological inhibitors were used to investigate the causal links between ROS and calcium responses. In response to compression, we observed transient ROS accumulation, with characteristics similar to the calcium response observed previously in the same microfluidic system. ROS and calcium response occurred in 3 kinetic phases: a fast calcium increase relying on mechanosensitive channels and external calcium entry followed by a long-lasting ROS accumulation and a slow calcium increase depending on NADPH oxidase activity. ROS accumulated in all root tissues while calcium increases were confined to the root center. These results suggest that two mechanotransduction mechanisms are involved in root response to compression.

Another independent mechanism induces ROS accumulation, which drives the slower secondary calcium increase.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

The NAM population was based on 23 diverse and one common founder plants and consisted of 708 F2 individuals. Reduced-representation sequencing (ddRAD) of the 708 F2 individuals, combined with whole genome sequencing data of the 24 founder plants, yielded a total of 3,199,253 SNPs that were used for population structure analysis, parentship analysis and genome-wide association studies.

A.", "abstract": "The bacterial cell envelope is essential for mechanical stability, barrier function, defining cell size and shape, and supporting cellular processes. Because external or internal stressors can challenge its integrity, bacteria have evolved stress response systems to maintain envelope homeostasis. For example, under stress, E. coli activates {sigma}E to induce a regulon that restores envelope homeostasis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of {sigma}E and its anti-sigma factor RseA have been well-mapped. However, how these regulatory layers function at the systems level to regulate {sigma}E activity remains unclear. Here, we combine mathematical modeling with quantitative gene expression measurements to determine how the interplay of transcription and post-translational regulation affects the dynamics of the {sigma}E response. The results suggest that the {sigma}E activity is determined by the balance between the release from RseA, resulting from its degradation, and slow binding of free {sigma}E to the intact RseA. Notably, the combined action of transcriptional and post-translational regulation reveals that autoregulation, traditionally assumed to be a positive feedback, transitions from negative to positive feedback under extreme stress, enabling a finely tuned response that prevents premature activation while ensuring a robust response under severe envelope stress. In summary, our findings elucidate the mechanisms of {sigma}E regulation, thereby advancing our understanding of how alternative sigma factor bacterial networks control stress-response pathways.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We train three different GNN architectures, the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), the Graph Attention Network (GAT), and the Graph U-Net, and evaluate their performances when trained on silver-standard cortical region labels created by FreeSurfer. We take a multimodal approach to brain segmentation by examining the influence of the structural connectivity values inferred from diffusion MRI (dMRI) in addition to using values from structural MRI (sMRI). Our results demonstrate the utility of GNN models, particularly the GAT architecture, which achieved Dice scores competitive to those reported in the literature with non-graph methods. Additionally, structural connectivity derived from dMRI revealed significant value in improving automatic segmentation, as models trained on combined attributes from dMRI and sMRI outperformed those trained only on sMRI.

While commonly linked to working memory and decision making, its existence during passive states and sleep remains unclear. Using chronic high-density electrophysiology in freely behaving mice, we show that population spiking activity across the auditory cortical hierarchy enables decoding of past stimuli long after their offset, during both wakefulness and sleep. Time-resolved decoding revealed that in wakefulness, persistent representations decay uniformly across sensory and association cortices, whereas during sleep, persistence is prolonged in association cortex but remains brief in early auditory regions. Recurrent neural network modeling showed that higher internal noise during wakefulness reproduces this pattern, suggesting that reduced interference during sleep stabilizes sensory traces in associative areas.

Here, we propose that consideration of both independent, linear relationships (as in standard approaches such as linear kernel ridge regression and connectome-based predictive modeling) as well as higher order statistical associations - such as tertiary interactions between matrix components and global features of the matrix space - will enhance identification of meaningful individual differences. To test this, we adopt a geometrically grounded measure of similarity that accounts for higher-order local statistical relationships and global interactions, the Wasserstein metric. Results indicate that considering connectivity matrices as representations of their associated Gaussian distributions significantly improves both identification of individuals based on their connectivity matrices (aka, 'fingerprinting') and prediction of individual differences in phenotypes such as fluid intelligence and openness to experience. Thus, both pairwise local and global brain connectivity properties encode for meaningful individual differences that relate to phenotypic expressions and should be considered in brain-behavior predictive models.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

E.; Li, W.; Migliavacca, M.; Jung, M.; Duveiller, G.", "abstract": "The development of remote sensing methods to estimate plant functional diversity is limited by mismatches between ecology and remote sensing sampling schemes, and the limited representativeness of local field campaigns. The Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment (BOSSE) provides a modeling framework for benchmarking new methodologies. We used BOSSE to simulate 180 different synthetic \"Scenes\" encompassing a two-year-long time series of plant trait maps and imagery of hyperspectral reflectance factors, spectral indices, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, land surface temperature, and estimates of plant traits (optical traits). We used these simulations to answer five fundamental, yet unsolved, questions: Q1. How should remote sensing characterize functional diversity in large surfaces (sites)? Diversity metric values saturate with the number of pixels involved, hampering comparisons between plant traits and remote sensing estimates in large areas. The average value of metrics computed over small samples should be used instead. Q2. Which sources of spectral information (or combinations thereof) can best capture plant functional diversity at the site scale? Accounting for background effects is the key. Optical traits (remote sensing estimates of plant traits) are the best estimators for plant functional diversity. Other variables succeed when filtered out of the soil pixels; their combination did not yield additional advantages. Q3. How should remote sensing estimates be validated/compared with plant functional diversity measurements? Leaf area index (LAI) is a better proxy of abundance than the pixel for QRao, but not for variance-based partitioning. It is more sensitive to sample size, but also more resistant to suboptimal spatial resolution. Q4. When (in the phenological year) can remote sensing best capture site-scale plant functional diversity? The estimation error decreased with LAI and stabilized at values above 1 m2/m2. Q5. Which approaches and remote sensing variables are more resistant to the effects of suboptimal spatial resolution? Optical traits, fluorescence, and reflectance factors were the most robust variables. Still, field data resolution needs to be degraded to match the sensor's resolution. We found a relative spatial resolution threshold of ~30 % (where the pixel is around three times larger than the plants). Simulation frameworks like BOSSE enable testing methodologies beyond local contexts and address the current shortage of suitable global datasets, supporting the application and development of methods for assessing plant functional diversity with remote sensing. In the future, BOSSE could contribute to understanding observational results, refining and pre-testing new methodologies, and supporting the development of comparable experimental datasets.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Because they lack one or more essential functions, DIPs cannot replicate on their own, but they can parasitize intact viruses during co-infection by competing for growth resources, thereby interfering with viral replication. The evolutionary interplay between viruses and their DIPs involves growth, mutation, interference, and resource trade-offs, but the mechanisms shaping population-level outcomes remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a continuous phenotype-space model using coupled partial differential equations that incorporate mutation, phenotype-dependent interference, intrinsic fitness costs, and de novo DIP generation. Unlike traditional strong-selection models, this framework captures strong-mutation regimes in which both virus and DIP populations diffuse through trait space and interact based on phenotypic similarity. Our analysis reveals two levels of dynamics. At the population level, viruses and DIPs undergo oscillations, consistent with predator-prey-like cycles (the von Magnus effect) observed experimentally. At the trait level, evolution drives shifts in resistance and interference, producing coevolutionary chases in which viruses temporarily escape and new DIPs emerge to follow, as observed in serial-passage evolution studies. Systematic variation of parameters reveals four qualitative regimes: viral-DIP coexistence, sustained coevolutionary (Red Queen) chase dynamics, DIP extinction, and mutual extinction. Chase dynamics are most strongly promoted by intermediate interference strength and low decay rates, while higher levels drive collapse of one or both populations. The model further predicts thresholds where viral escape is either constrained by intrinsic fitness penalties or enabled through phenotypic separation from DIPs. These findings establish a general framework for virus-DIP coevolution, showing how both population dynamics and trait evolution shape outcomes, with implications for designing DIP-based therapeutics that better resist viral escape.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We previously identified a 55-bp cis-repressive element in the PKD1 3'UTR. Here, we define a six-nucleotide miR-17 seed match within this element that is sufficient to reproduce PKD1 repression. In vivo base substitution of this motif stabilizes Pkd1 mRNA and increases polycystin-1 (PC1) protein levels, producing a robust reduction in cyst growth and preservation of kidney function in mouse models. To therapeutically recapitulate this effect, we developed a steric-blocking oligonucleotide that occludes the motif, stabilizes PKD1 transcript levels, increases PC1 expression, and mitigates cyst-pathogenic events in both murine and patient-derived ADPKD cells.

Here, by utilizing different mixing strategies (and notably the first time use of roller bottles) to modulate the volumetric gas interfacial mass transfer coefficient (kLa), we show that, under both mixotrophic (sugar and gas utilization) and autotrophic conditions, C. ljungdahlii growth and CO2 fixation are primarily electron-limited due to the low solubility of H2 relative to CO and CO2. We demonstrate that, with sufficiently high H2 mass transfer, C. ljungdahlii can grow at similar high rates using CO2 as its sole carbon source compared to CO or fructose, a finding with significant implications for the use of acetogens in CO2-negative biomanufacturing, especially because at least 50% of CO used is oxidized and released as CO2.

We have reported the presence of Sp7-positive cells with an osteogenic signature in primary mouse breast cancer, where they stimulate tumor growth; and genetic ablation of Cdh2 (encoding N-cadherin) in these cells enhances their pro-tumorigenic action. To study the molecular mechanisms of this biologic system, we used MC3T3 cells, phenotypically similar to tumor associated osteolineage cells. Ablation of Cdh2 in MC3T3 cells enhances PI3K-Akt-{beta}-catenin signaling in response to transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (Tgf-{beta}1), resulting in increased production of Tgf-{beta}1. Interference with PI3K activity is mediated by N-cadherin binding to PI3K components, p85 and p100, resulting in reduced activation of PI3K-Akt-{beta}-catenin signaling. Downstream, Cdh2 ablation enhances Tgf-{beta}1-induced binding of Sp1 and Lef-1 to the Tgfb1 promoter, leading to increased promoter activity and enhanced Tgf-{beta}1 production. This is associated with miR-21 up-regulation and decreased expression of Pten, a PI3K inhibitor. MC3T3 cells promote growth of breast cancer cells (BCC) when co-cultured in vitro or co-injected in mouse mammary fat pad, and Cdh2-deficiency enhances this pro-tumorigenic effect. Notably, genetic ablation of the Tgf-{beta}1 receptor subunit, Tgfbr1, in BCC abrogates the pro-tumorigenic action of MC3T3 cells and its enhancement by Cdh2 ablation. Finally, Sp7-driven Tgfbr1 ablation in mice also reduces the growth of BCC in the mammary fat pad. Thus, autocrine Tgf-{beta}1 production via PI3K-Akt-{beta}-catenin signaling is a key mechanism by which osteolineage cells promote BCC growth, an action restrained by Ncad via interference with PI3K components.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Here, using a Smad4 loss-of-function and {beta}-catenin gain-of-function (Smad4LOF:{beta}-cateninGOF) mouse model, we demonstrate that dedifferentiation-derived oncogenic stem cells sustain tumorigenesis more effectively than endogenous mutant stem cells harboring the mutation.

As glycogen stores are depleted, the body transitions to mobilizing fatty acids from adipose tissue and generating ketone bodies in the liver to sustain the function of vital organs. A network of hormonal signals and transcriptional programs coordinate these adaptations. Among these, the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is strongly upregulated during fasting and has been proposed as a key mediator of the fasting response. To investigate the physiological functions of FGF21, we studied mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Fgf21. Although the liver is the primary source of circulating FGF21 during fasting, its absence in hepatocytes did not alter typical fasting-induced gene expression or key metabolic pathways such as hepatic gluconeogenesis, adipose tissue lipolysis, or ketone production. Instead, we uncovered a distinct role for FGF21 in promoting protein appetite following a fast. These findings challenge the conventional view of hepatocyte-produced FGF21 as a fasting-acting hormone and reveal a more specialized function in guiding nutrient selection after energy depletion.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

While RLs trigger an immune response in plants, little is known about the signaling mechanisms involved after RL perception. Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs/CPKs) are a large family of kinases involved in various functions in plants including the regulation of the resistance response to phytopathogens. Here, we investigated the role of AtCPK5 and AtCPK6 in RL-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis). Gene expression analysis showed that RLs up-regulate the expression of both genes in Arabidopsis leaves. Using a functional approach, we demonstrated that signaling events exemplified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and defense gene expression including AtWRKY46, AtFRK1 and AtPR1 are increased in cpk5/6 mutant plants compared to wild-type (WT) plants. Moreover, cpk5 mutants displayed intermediary responses while cpk6 mutation alone did not change the immune profile activated by RLs, except for AtFRK1. Those results suggest that AtCPK5 and AtCPK6 regulate RL-triggered defenses, with AtCPK5 likely playing a more important role. Yet, the cpk5/6 mutations did not affect RL-triggered electrolyte leakage nor enhanced RL-mediated resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. Our results therefore show that additional signaling components regulate AtCPK5 and AtCPK6-mediated plant immune responses triggered by RLs.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, the causal relationship between HR and effective immunity remains unresolved. We show that the Arabidopsis cbp60g sard1 double mutant exhibits exaggerated ETI-associated HR but only partial resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens, thereby genetically uncoupling cell death from disease resistance without pleiotropic defects. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling reveals that the absence of CBP60g and SARD1 disrupts the balance between immune activators and suppressors, including reduced induction of the Nudix hydrolase NUDT7. Overexpression of NUDT7 diminishes but does not abolish the heightened HR phenotype in cbp60g sard1 mutant, indicating that multiple negative regulators act redundantly to restrain immune-associated cell death. These findings demonstrate that HR is not an obligatory determinant of effective resistance and provide mechanistic insight into how plants coordinate transcriptional networks to balance pathogen defence with the containment of host cell death.

These chemically-identical \"mass tags\" conjugate to peptides to encode samples with different mass offsets for parallel analysis. The current state-of-the-art for multiplexing with non-isobaric mass tags was recently improved from 3-plex to 9-plex, but what is the largest plex size that can be reasonably achieved with current technology? A full answer to this question requires evaluating current mass spectrometry hardware, facets of which have been well-investigated by others. However, it may be under-appreciated that multiplexing 1000s of samples with mass tags does not actually require 1000s of isotopes, or 1000s of synthesis steps to create. Non-intuitively, high plex mass tags can require relatively few different isotopes. The focus of this exposition is to characterize the potential of the differential mass defect to create tens to over a thousand isotopologues of small molecules and how careful combinations of these small molecules can combinatorially scale the plex size to minimize synthetic steps. Importantly, we show that plex sizes in the hundreds, an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art, are achievable using molecules comparable in size to existing commercial tags, and that going beyond hundreds may require larger molecules. Approaches to achieve high-plex proteomics will almost certainly require using the differential mass defect, so we hope this exposition serves to accelerate progress in reagent development to achieve high plex proteomics.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Mutations in a single allele of the FOXG1 gene cause disease, likely due to loss-of-function. However, current therapies do not target this root cause of FOXG1 syndrome and have little to modest therapeutic benefit on only a small subset of symptoms. Recently, we reported the beneficial effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV) human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection at postnatal day 6 (P6) on several behavioral deficits that are relevant to key features of human FOXG1 syndrome, in male FOXG1 mice that were engineered with a highly prevalent, patient-specific Q84P mutation. Here, we report the behavioral effects of AAV human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by ICV injection in female as well as male mice and at an earlier age - postnatal day 2 (P2). Although the earlier studies had suggested that AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of a subset of functional deficits in human FOXG1 syndrome with no toxicity observations, our current study shows that certain motor behaviors can be negatively impacted or exacerbated by P2 treatment with AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy, in female but not male FOXG1 mice. Given these results, the risk-benefit balance of AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy in patients with FOXG1 syndrome should be carefully considered, especially in female patients.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we reproduced the modulation of movement duration with varying reach distances and accuracy (Fitts' law), and extended the infinite horizon framework to include the effect of rewards and biomechanical costs. Furthermore, our model also featured a temporal evolution of feedback responses to perturbations that resembles experimental observations, and naturally accounted for motor decisions observed when participants select one among multiple goals in dynamic environments. Together, these developments show that in many cases, movement duration may not need to be specified a priori, but instead could result from task-dependent control policies. This framework validates a candidate explanation for varied movement durations, which invites to reconsider the nature and strength of evidence for the finite horizon formulation.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that neural inflammation in thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) drives cardiopulmonary afferent sensitization through suppression of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels after myocardial infarction (MI). MI was induced in rats by coronary ligation. Molecular profiling, immunofluorescence, tissue clearing, and functional assays were used to assess neuroinflammation and reflex responses. Post MI, thoracic DRGs showed macrophage infiltration, glial activation, cytokine upregulation, and reduced Kv channel expression. Bulk RNAseq identified enrichment of macrophage activation related genes, and in vitro studies confirmed that pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated macrophages suppressed Kv channels and increased DRG neuron excitability. Epicardial injection of biotinylated TNFalpha; demonstrated cardiac afferent mediated cytokine transport to DRGs, inducing macrophage infiltration via a cytokine receptor-dependent mechanism. Anti-inflammatory interventions including oral minocycline, systemic macrophage depletion, and local epidural delivery of thermoresponsive hydrogel forming dexamethasone prodrug (ProGel Dex) significantly reduced DRG neuroinflammation, restored Kv channel levels, and attenuated exaggerated CSAR and PSAR responses. ProGel Dex also improved cardiac chamber dilation in the post-MI rats. These findings identify a cytokine uptake/glial activation/macrophage activation pathway as a driver of cardiopulmonary afferent sensitization after MI. Targeting DRG inflammation, particularly with sustained local dexamethasone delivery using ProGel Dex, offers a precision medicine to dampen pathological sympathetic activation and improve cardiac outcomes in CHF.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

However, whether aging phenotypes captured by the frailty index reflect brain aging remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between frailty index and cognitive ability in young (3-4 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (24 months) male and female C57BL/6J mice using a battery of behavioral and locomotor assays to determine whether frailty index scores can predict performance in tasks evaluating behavioral and cognitive function. Among the behavioral assays tested, frailty index scores had good correlation with the percentage of time spent in the center of the open-field apparatus, the duration spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and the time spent in the target hole of the Barnes maze.

Recent advances in neuroanatomical techniques have greatly improved the possibilities to follow the axonal projections of individual neurons in full, and many reconstructed neurons are made available by the MouseLight database. We sampled individual cortical neurons with the majority of their axons within the neocortex and explored the extent of their axonal connections. We found that the efferent axon of individual cortical neurons can commonly cover as much as 30-40% of all types of cortical areas, with a coverage of up to 80% for a single neuron also being demonstrated.

Furthermore, most TCR-epitope models represent only one of three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the TCR, potentially limiting performance.

F.; Morimoto, R.; Fire, A.", "abstract": "Inducible gene expression programs require that target genes remain silent until the proper activation signal is received, a hallmark of stress-response pathways. This quiescence is typically assumed to be the default state of stress-inducible genes, maintained without active cellular intervention. Using a forward genetic screen for constitutive activation of inducible heat shock proteins (iHSPs) in C. elegans, we found that the multi-zinc-finger protein ZNF-236 is essential for maintaining iHSP quiescence under normal conditions. Loss of znf-236 causes constitutive iHSP expression throughout the genome, affecting both endogenous iHSP loci and iHSP sequences inserted at dispersed chromosomal sites. However, the effect is also chromosomal context-dependent: robustly heat-responsive iHSP transgenes integrated into the ribosomal DNA locus or extrachromosomal arrays are unaffected by znf-236 loss. This differential responsiveness suggests iHSP induction in znf-236 mutants results from a shift in genome organization, rather than from accumulated denatured proteins or engagement of the canonical heat shock response. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a potent ZNF-236-dependent default silencing mechanism that broadly restrains iHSP genes across the genome and helps ensure appropriate iHSP quiescence even at ectopic chromosomal locations. Contrary to prior assumptions, this suggests that quiescence of stress-inducible genes reflects an actively maintained genomic state rather than merely a passive absence of expression.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a restriction-enzyme based method to selectively enrich all phages containing 2-aminoadenine (diaminopurine or dZ) directly from purified metagenomic DNA from environmental samples. Applying our previously established metagenomic genome-phenome association (metaGPA) pipeline, we identified 116 protein domains significantly associated with dZ phages.

We demonstrate that these parameters, when combined to form two specific indices (the geometric mean, I_GM, and the arithmetic mean of deviations, I_AMD, provide a basis for more extensive comparisons between the different claw morphologies researched. The claw of Crotaphytus collaris is deduced as being the most suitable candidate for application as a bioinspired end effector in a robotic manipulator used for grasping objects, as it closely aligns with our optimal design criteria. To practically demonstrate gripping and grasping, we use a lightweight ping pong ball as well as larger and heavier objects such as an abalone shell, boxing mitts and a printer spool. Our robotic manipulator integrates dual grasping strategies. These include pinching for delicate objects and scooping for larger, irregular objects, thus enhancing its versatility across different environments and for different applications.

This provides a supply of nucleotides that sustains growth when de novo biosynthesis is impaired by glutamine restriction or pharmacological blockade. Mechanistically, this process is dependent on the non-redundant lysosomal equilibrative nucleoside transporter SLC29A3 (ENT3), which mediates the export of nucleosides from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol. Accordingly, genetic ablation of SLC29A3 or pharmacological disruption of lysosomal function prevents exDNA scavenging and potently sensitizes breast tumors to antimetabolite chemotherapy in vivo.

EMT also influences the tumor immune microenvironment, shaping immune cell infiltration and function. Although the immunological features of fully epithelial or fully mesenchymal tumor states have been characterized, the immune landscape associated with intermediate or partial EMT states remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we established five single-cell-derived clonal populations from the triple-negative 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cell line, representing a spectrum of EMT phenotypes, and analyzed tumors derived from these clones using single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that tumors derived from these clones retained their relative EMT states in vivo, and that EMT progression is associated with a graded reduction in tumor immunogenicity, accompanied by alterations in immune cell composition and function. Along the EMT spectrum, tumor cells exhibited progressive downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II gene expression, along with decreased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and reduced expression of key effector and trafficking genes (Gzmb, Ccr5, Cxcr6). B cell composition also shifted, with decreased frequencies of IgG1-producing plasma cells and an enrichment of regulatory-like B cells. Natural killer (NK) cells similarly demonstrated progressive functional suppression, marked by reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules and the downregulation of key effector pathways.

Here, we address these questions by conducting a multi-cohort human exercise intervention, incorporating sprint-interval exercise (SIE) and moderate-intensity exercise (MIE) to analyze intensity-dependent regulation of interorgan crosstalk. We find that exercise intensity distinctly influences the plasma proteome and metabolome in both untrained and trained participants.

While placental metabolism has been well described at term and in cell lines, changes in the placental metabolome during development remains understudied. We investigated the placental metabolome, metabolite trajectories, and altered pathways across trimesters in normal human pregnancy by integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic data. Methods: Targeted aqueous metabolomic profiling of 372 metabolites was conducted on placental biopsies from samples collected in the first (n=12), second (n=13), and third (n=11) trimesters of normal pregnancy using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Robust linear models identified differentially abundant metabolites across trimesters in models adjusted for fetal sex and total protein. We conducted pathway analysis using a human metabolic reconstruction. To further aid in biological interpretation, we leveraged publicly available transcriptomics data to conduct pathway-level multi-omic integration throughout gestation. Results: Samples clustered by trimester in principal component analysis and we identified 5 metabolite trajectories. Out of 193 detectable metabolites, 149 (77%) differed by trimester (FDR<0.05). Using pathway-level multi-omic integration, pathways involved in extracellular transport, and pyruvate, amino acid, NAD, and membrane lipid metabolism are up-regulated in the second trimester compared to the first. In the late third trimester, pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, redox balance, mitochondrial transport, and biomolecule synthesis were down-regulated compared to second trimester. Conclusions: Placental metabolite abundances change substantially across gestation and integration with metabolic gene expression provides insight into dynamic metabolic function during pregnancy. Observed pathway-level changes potentially reflect the metabolic response to invading maternal circulation in the first-to-second trimester transition, as well as changing maternal and fetal metabolic requirements. Differences observed at term may reflect placental senescence and preparation for parturition. These data can inform other molecular analyses of the placenta by providing enhanced resolution of metabolic changes across pregnancy.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Several animal model studies further support these associations. However, the impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) on sex-specific behavioural alterations and the underlying molecular mechanism in PD remains poorly studied. In the present study, we investigated the impact of HFD on PD progression in a sex-specific manner using the A53T transgenic mouse model of PD. Behavioural and pathophysiological analyses revealed a faster onset and progression of PD-like phenotype in female mice exposed to HFD compared with the male mice. Proteomics profiling of brain tissues demonstrated positive enrichment of immune system-related pathways in males, while females exhibited considerable downregulation of synapse-associated pathways under HFD conditions. The reduced estradiol level was identified as a potential factor contributing to synaptic dysfunction and the subsequent early onset of PD in female mice.

Our research group previously found that the deamidated variant A{beta}-42-N27D modified A{beta} aggregation, reduced neurotoxicity, and reduced microglial reactivity, but the impact of A{beta}-42 side chain deamidation in general on such parameters remained unclear. Here, we expanded on our prior work by investigating how two site-specific A{beta}-42 mutations (Q15E & N27D), where neutral amide side chains are replaced with negatively charged carboxylic acids, affect aggregation and microglial immune response using a mouse microglial cell line. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D exhibit distinct aggregation profiles compared to A{beta}-42 wild type (WT). Multiplexed analysis of 8 cytokines secreted into the culture medium revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MIP-1 relative to A{beta}-42-WT. Immunocytochemistry revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease CD68 expression relative to A{beta}-42-WT. These findings demonstrate that deamidation significantly alters A{beta}-42 aggregation and microglial activation, suggesting structural modifications to A{beta}-42 modulate inflammatory signaling in AD. This work provides a foundation for future studies on A{beta}-42 post-translational modifications as potential therapeutic targets in AD.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

J.; Marx, C. J.", "abstract": "The maintenance of microbial diversity depends upon fitness tradeoffs between environments. While the importance of tradeoffs is clear, it has been surprisingly difficult to predict which traits they will occur between and at how granular a level. For example, it is unclear whether performance between a constant versus a pulsed exposure of the same stress tend to be positively correlated, independent of each other, or negatively correlated. Empirically, it has been shown that a critical feature structuring environments is temperature. However, the compatibility between strategies to deal with different forms of heat stress is unclear. For instance, are strains that grow well at higher temperatures also stronger at withstanding heat shock? To understand how environmental microbes can adapt to better deal with different forms of heat stress, we performed an evolution experiment using a dominant phyllosphere microbe Methylobacterium extorquens in a regime of intermittent heat shock. We identified the genetic basis of adaptation, discovering a large number of loci capable of mediating adaptation to heat shock, most of which previously had not been linked to heat stress. Despite the genetic divergence, we discovered a general tradeoff between heat shock resistance and growth at consistently elevated temperatures. We found this tradeoff was not limited to evolved isolates, but was also represented across a sample of environmentally isolated Methylobacterium strains. These findings indicate a generic conflict between strategies to deal with heat shock recovery and growth at elevated temperatures, suggesting even variation in intensities of a stressor can drive diversity in microbial strategies.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

This approach enables high-throughput, parallel perturbation of multiple genes while providing transcriptome-wide readouts at single-cell resolution, overcoming many limitations of traditional arrayed screens. However, its broader application remains limited by technical challenges, including variable perturbation efficiency and difficulties in accurately identifying perturbed cells. In this study, we adapted and applied a modified CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) protocol using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in K562 cells to knockdown six transcription factors (TFs): LMO2, TCF3, LDB1, MYB, GATA2, and RUNX1. Our modified approach, which allows direct capture of sgRNAs from the cDNA library without a separate enrichment step, significantly improved sgRNA assignment per cell. We successfully achieved reproducible knockdown of three TFs (MYB, GATA2, and LMO2), captured the impact of these perturbations on the TF target genes, and enabled us to reconstruct their GRNs and identify key regulons and transcriptional targets. These networks revealed both previously established (such as LMO2 GATA2 interaction) and novel regulatory interactions, which we independently validated, providing new insights into hematopoietic transcriptional control. To assess the efficiency of CRISPRi based pooled perturbation, we additionally analyzed publicly available perturb-seq CRISPRi datasets and found that only ~40-50% of targeted genes led to effective knockdown, underscoring the variability in perturbation efficiency across experiments. Together, our results demonstrate both the potential and the current technical limitations of pooled CRISPRi-based single-cell screens.

This multi-omics approach revealed a comprehensive landscape of protein expression at this developmental stage; however, we observed widespread discrepancies between transcript and protein abundance, pointing to post-transcriptional and/or post-translational regulation. This cross-study minimizes experimental bias and allows the detection of phosphorylation events that may have been overlooked in single-condition studies. A search of kinase specific motifs revealed that RxxS motifs were significantly enriched among phosphorylated peptides in protein phosphatases and microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting regulation by calcium dependent protein kinases (CPKs).

Adeno-associated viral delivery of hSyn1 promoter-driven TurboID-CD9 enabled neuron-specific EV tagging, followed by in vivo biotinylation and affinity purification of labeled proteins.

However, the distribution and higher-order structure of these types of cytochrome nanowires remains largely unknown. Here, we employed cryo-electron microscopy to determine the atomic structure of a unique cytochrome nanowire from Desulfuromonas soudanensis WTL, a halophilic, iron- and electrode-reducing bacterium found in deep subsurface brine. These filaments are based on a homolog of the OmcE tetraheme cytochrome, which then assemble into highly ordered bundles of antiparallel filaments. This arrangement likely arises from the association of nanowires extending from adjacent cells. Furthermore, a similar cytochrome bundle structure was observed in Geobacter metallireducens, suggesting that this quaternary structure may be a common feature among nanowires secreted by electroactive microbes.

During embryogenesis, epigenetic regulation controls cell type specification along cellular lineages with similar transcriptional identities through the coordinated action of chromatin states. However, prevalent single-molecule variability in higher-order chromosome conformation and a lack of precise cell lineage information have previously limited our understanding of the relationship between conformation and transcriptional activity in vivo. Specifically, how the conformation-transcription relationship is inherited along cellular lineages through cell divisions is poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel algorithm for cell lineage identification (C. elegans Sinkhorn-based Cell ALignmEnt, CeSCALE) combined with single cell genomics to reveal that local conformation-transcription 'fingerprints' are associated with, and inherited along the stereotyped cellular lineages of C. elegans embryos. Inspired by Optimal Transport theory, CeSCALE provides a fully automated framework for quantifying lineage-resolved individual cell phenotypes in situ, across a wide developmental window. Combining CeSCALE with single-molecule chromosome tracing uncovered higher-order interchromosomal block associations, which surprisingly coalesce transcriptionally diverse domains and are independent of lineage identity. Instead, by integrating lineage-resolved chromosome conformations with single-cell transcriptomics, we find that local conformation-transcription spatial relationships ('fingerprints'), containing both hubs and islands of transcriptional activity, are robustly inherited along lineages. Finally, we find that the canalization of these 'fingerprints' represent the rewiring of chromatin states at key developmental stages.

Here, we show that (a continuous form of) the Breeder's equation for the evolution of quantitative traits/characters leads to a general model that explains the dynamics of genomic elements generated by indel mutations (duplications, insertions, and deletions) and selection. Our framework consists of a general exponential-linear model that predicts at least six different types of dynamical behaviors, including exponential growth and decay. The equations fit data, such as evolution experiments across generations, field observational data of genome sizes across time, and data from phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral states of genome size across millions of years of a variety of taxa, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, unicellular eukaryotes, plants, and animals, at both intra- and interspecific levels. To test the universality of the dynamics, we derived a dimensionless equation that enables the (re)scaling and subsequent collapse of all data for growth or decay onto a single universal curve.

While mitochondrial impairment has been implicated, the role of non-mitochondrial pathways is less clearly defined. To address this gap, we optimized platelet-based extracellular flux assays as a minimally invasive platform to study human bioenergetics. A seeding density of 2 10^7 platelets per well provided reliable respiratory measurements, consistent with the presence of 5 to 8 mitochondria per platelet. Platelets from both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DPN patients demonstrated a significant reduction in non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared with controls. This finding suggests impairment of oxygen-consuming processes beyond the mitochondria, likely reflecting diminished activity of oxidoreductase enzymes such as NADPH oxidases, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases, which regulate redox balance, inflammatory signaling, and vascular tone. In contrast, basal and ATP-linked OCR were only marginally reduced in T2D and not significantly altered in DPN, indicating that mitochondrial-linked dysfunction may be more subtle or heterogeneous in these patient populations. The consistent decrease in non-mitochondrial OCR across both T2D and DPN highlights its potential as an early and sensitive indicator of systemic bioenergetic dysregulation in diabetes. These findings demonstrate that platelets are a practical and repeatable resource for assessing bioenergetics in humans. Diabetes impairs both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration, with the latter showing the most robust alterations. Reduced non-mitochondrial OCR may contribute independently to the pathogenesis of DPN and holds promise as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic monitoring in diabetic complications.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Although numerous bnAbs have been isolated from infected individuals, their breadth and potency may not be sufficient to tackle global viral diversity, motivating efforts to further improve their neutralization capacity. Here, we address this challenge using a multistate antibody engineering approach integrating deep mutational scanning with combinatorial library screening across diverse Env variants. This strategy enables identification of mutation patterns that confer improved binding across antigenically distinct targets. Starting from one of the best-in-class CD4-binding site bnAbs, we performed iterative optimization to increase binding affinity across diverse Env variants. The resulting lead candidate exhibited improved breadth and up to 100-fold higher potency against pseudoviruses from large cross-clade historical and contemporary panels while maintaining biophysical and pharmacokinetic profiles conducive to clinical development. Structural and molecular dynamics analyses revealed a unique tri-tyrosine aromatic triad and reinforced electrostatic contacts that stabilized the bnAb/Env interface. These findings demonstrate that systematic in vitro engineering can generate bnAbs with enhanced breadth and potency, providing a generalizable strategy for developing therapeutic antibodies against highly diverse pathogens.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce ProSiteHunter, a unified sequence-based framework for protein binding-site prediction, which integrates a fine-tuned protein language model (SiteT5) with a multi-source feature-fusion network that incorporates evolutionary, geometric, and statistical features, while employing bidirectional semantics, local associations, and global dependencies for comprehensive binding-site characterization. The method was systematically evaluated on diverse binding sites prediction tasks, where ProSiteHunter achieved a 39.1% average improvement in PRAUC for protein-DNA/RNA/protein tasks and a 7.4% PRAUC enhancement on the particularly challenging antibody-antigen task over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ProSiteHunter is capable of identifying local flexible sites that complement AlphaFold3 predictions and improving the accuracy of antibody-antigen interaction prediction.

To this end, we have developed alpseq, an optimised, open-source software pipeline designed specifically for the efficient and accurate processing of NGS data from nanobody libraries and panning campaigns. alpseq is also paired with a PCR-free sequencing library preparation protocol to allow researchers to easily generate their own data while avoiding biases.

These results are then fed into the analysis module, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions for quality control, diversity analysis, identification of enriched sequences and clustering. alpseq also creates a user-friendly interactive report which empowers scientists to explore their data without the need for extensive bioinformatic experience. Sophisticated panning campaign designs are supported, such as replicates and comparisons between different pans to find cross-binding leads. alpseq thus generates insights into the nanobody selection process and delivers a list of lead candidates for further experimental validation and downstream applications. alspeq is available at https://github.com/kzeglinski/alpseq.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant association between FOXI3 expression, tumor pathology, and increasing tumor grade. Analysis of publicly available gene expression data from prostate cancer patients showed that that FOXI3 is markedly elevated in bone metastases and strongly correlates with FGF8, suggesting a potential bone-specific regulatory interaction between these factors. Consistent with this, treatment of bone-derived prostate cancer cells with FGF8 increased FOXI3 RNA expression, whereas no such effect was observed in a brain-metastatic cell line. Further, we demonstrated that FGF8/FOXI3 axis regulates bone-derived prostate cancer cell migration and proliferation in a FOXI3 dependent manner.

While not consistent with guidelines, opioid analgesia is commonly prescribed to older adults with osteoarthritis and other causes of chronic non-cancer pain. Long term use of opioids is associated with tolerance, addiction, loss of efficacy and adverse events. Thus, deprescribing (reducing or ceasing) opioids is often required. The effect of polypharmacy on the efficacy and safety of opioid prescribing and deprescribing in this setting is poorly understood. Here we aimed to assess the effects of chronic oxycodone, as monotherapy and in polypharmacy (oxycodone, citalopram, simvastatin, oxybutynin, and metoprolol), and of deprescribing oxycodone, on allodynia, physical and cognitive function, and daily activities in middle-aged, osteoarthritic male and female C57BL/6J mice (n=11-15/ group). Only oxycodone monotherapy reduced mechanical allodynia after 6 weeks of treatment. Chronic polypharmacy with oxycodone transiently increased mechanical allodynia in the injured limb and caused marked reductions in mobility, maximum walking speed, activities of daily living, and increased anxiety. Polypharmacy also altered daily activities detected by an automated animal behaviour recognition cage. Sex differences in treatment response were observed in frailty measurements and activity over 23 hours. Deprescribing oxycodone was well tolerated and did not alter physical or cognitive function but did reverse some of the daily activity changes and mechanical allodynia in polypharmacy treated animals only.

However, research has increasingly highlighted that for the long-duration, statistically stationary stimuli commonly studied, it is difficult to definitively establish the operation of protracted sampling or temporal integration as opposed to non-integration strategies like extremum-detection, especially when based on behaviour alone. Here, we attempted to resolve such mechanistic details in the interesting case of judging subtle feature-differences (contrast) in a long (1.6-sec), noiseless stimulus, by jointly analysing the accuracy of delayed reports and the dynamics of a centroparietal electroencephalographic signal (CPP) reflecting decision formation. Accuracy steadily increased across four covertly-manipulated evidence durations and the CPP remained elevated throughout the stimulus period, together indicating protracted sampling. Models fit to CPP dynamics as well as accuracy resolved more details than those fit to accuracy alone, such as the setting of a bound. However, a convincing joint neural-behaviour fit could be achieved not only by a temporal integration model, but also by an extremum detection model that evoked a stereotyped signal flagging the first single-sample bound crossing. This illuminates interesting, testable alternatives to integration, and the limited extent to which combining neural decision dynamics with behavioural information can uniquely identify underlying mechanisms in some behavioural scenarios.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Here, metagenomics was used to examine the taxonomic and functional features of the rhizosphere microbial communities of hazelnut trees differing in their levels of resistance to A. anomala: highly tolerant Corylus americana, and resistant and susceptible Corylus avellana. No statistically significant differences in microbial alpha diversity or beta diversity were noted between the three rhizosphere groups. Compared to bulk soil, all three rhizosphere groups were enriched for the fungal phylum Basidiomycota and bacterial phylum \"Candidatus Rokubacteriota\". At the genus level, the bacterial genera Actinospica, Occallatibacter, and \"Candidatus Sulfotelmatobacter\" were under-represented, while the genus Rhizobacter was over-represented, in the resistant and susceptible C. avellana rhizosphere samples compared to the bulk soil. A total of 45 dereplicated, high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes were generated, corresponding to 41 bacteria and 4 archaea. Many of the metagenome-assembled genomes carried multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, including MAGs corresponding to the genera Lysobacter and Actinospica. Overall, the low differentiation of the rhizosphere microbiomes of the three hazelnut rhizosphere groups suggest that differences in A. anomala disease expression are likely not associated with differences in the rhizosphere microbiome.

Genomic and mitochondrial evidence consistently identified clear genetic segregation between outer- and inner-bay populations corresponding to the two species, with L. laticarpa predominating at inner-bay and L. furcata at outer-bay sites. While individual genetic profiles showed little indication of recent hybridization, population signals in several inner-bay sites pointed to historical inputs or local co-occurrence of distinct lineages, possibly mediated by ships. Bayesian modeling of 28 years of environmental data identified nighttime light intensity, salinity, and vegetation cover as major predictors of species occurrence, highlighting ALAN as a key environmental axis distinguishing their habitats. In laboratory assays, chronic ALAN exposure reduced growth and activity in L. furcata but had limited effects on L. laticarpa.

Recombination mechanisms are poorly understood for viruses with double-stranded RNA genomes. Two strains of the double-stranded RNA virus reovirus differ in the pattern of packaged DVGs during serial passage. To determine whether the polymerase complex or gene segment sequence contributes to these differences, we exchanged polymerase complexes between the two reovirus strains. We identified DVG patterns using RT-PCR and recombination junction profiles using ClickSeq. Reoviruses synthesized DVGs that maintained the 5' and 3' termini and contained large central deletions. The polymerase complex did not detectably affect DVG pattern following reovirus serial passage or viral recombination junction profiles. Instead, recombination junction profiles correlated with the identity of viral RNA gene segments, even in the presence of a non-native polymerase complex or virus background. Reovirus recombination junction start and stop sites often occur in regions of sequence microhomology. While we observed many instances of short stretches of identical nucleotides within a viral gene segment, only a select few positions were incorporated into recombination junctions. Overall, these data suggest that recombination events that can mediate reovirus DVG formation are highly selective, and properties of viral gene segments primarily dictate where recombination occurs.

We spiked the mock community into different human sample types, including stool, saliva, oropharyngeal (OP) wash, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), then passed the samples through different virus enrichment protocols and analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Compared to direct metagenomic sequencing, VLP enrichment protocols greatly increased viral read yields from virus-rich samples such as from stool and saliva. Three VLP enrichment work flows were compared, and each was found to have strengths and weaknesses. Four methods for DNA amplification were compared, with three showing over-amplification of small circular ssDNA viruses, most notably GenomiPhi. Studies of viral particle stability in the presence of nuclease showed that most viral genomes were stable when protected in viral particles, but phage MS2 RNA was unexpectedly labile under some of the conditions tested. Comparison of Illumina 1000-cycle sequencing versus 300-cycle sequencing showed that longer reads supported generation of longer viral genome assemblies. Bacteriophage DNA can be modified by at least 12 different chemistries, raising the question of whether these modifications might block recovery in virome analytical protocols.

Without intervention, 10 million AMR-related deaths per year by 2050 are estimated by the WHO. Nonetheless, the development of novel antibiotics has almost come to a halt. In this context, naturally occurring narrow-spectrum antimicrobial proteins, known as bacteriocins, are promising alternatives to address the need for effective and selective antimicrobial treatments. However, the widespread distribution of cognate immunity proteins among bacteriocin producers vastly limits the natural antimicrobial spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria. On the example of pyocin S2 (PyoS2), an S-type HNH DNase bacteriocin targeting the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this study demonstrates for the first time that a rationally introduced single mutation and chemical protein functionalisation at PyoS2's immunity protein exosite fully eradicate immunity protein-mediated resistance to pyocins in multidrug-resistant clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. The presented findings highlight a strategy to engineer bacteriocins from pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria with an extended antimicrobial spectrum, overruling the prevalent and predominant bacteriocin resistance mechanism of immunity protein binding.

To illustrate the approach, we analyse microbiome data from marine sponges and simulate different structures of host-microbe associations, thereby bridging mechanistic models and empirical patterns.

Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we determined a dissociation constant of 1.8 nM. In vitro translation assays demonstrate that SidL inhibits mRNA translation, and this activity is completely suppressed by LegA11. Mutagenesis of key interface residues in LegA11 disrupts complex formation and abolishes its metaeffector activity, confirming that LegA11 regulates SidL through direct protein-protein interaction. These findings establish LegA11 as a bona fide metaeffector that contributes to suppression of host mRNA translation by L. pneumophila.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

S.; Balaji, K. N.", "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) increases availability of free iron resulting in ferroptosis of host macrophages to facilitate its survival and dissemination. A critical factor for elevated levels of labile iron is the overt accumulation of the protein nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), that promotes autophagic degradation of ferritin in a process termed as ferritinophagy. Here, we identify a novel post-translational modification on NCOA4 that is essential for its interaction with ferritin in iron-replete condition of Mtb-infected cells. Specifically, protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), confers a symmetric-dimethylation on NCOA4 that promotes ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis. Using loss-of-function studies, we show that PRMT5 is required for lipid peroxidation, bacterial survival, and dissemination in Mtb-infected mice. Also, overexpression of a methylation-deficient mutant of NCOA4 phenocopy depletion of PRMT5 and reduced ferroptosis in Mtb-infected cells. Furthermore, PRMT5-mediated methylation reduces the nuclear availability of NCOA4 and impairs its co-activatory role to nuclear receptors such as vitamin D3. Thus, our findings uncover the key interaction between NCOA4 and ferritin that regulates ferroptosis and mycobacterial survival during infection. Perturbation of this interaction results in reduced Mtb loads and alleviated disease pathology.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Whether population context shifts taxonomic trajectories and functional outputs similarly remains unclear. Methods We re-analyzed longitudinal infant cohorts from Poland (PL) and Japan (JP) across five time points (1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were processed uniformly. Cross-sectional alpha diversity (richness, evenness, Shannon, Simpson) was modeled with covariate adjustment (sex, antibiotics, diet). Beta diversity used Bray-Curtis distances (PCoA) and PERMANOVA (unadjusted/adjusted). Confounder-aware genus-level differential abundance identified features not reducible to covariates. Longitudinal genus trajectories and genus-SCFA (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate) associations were tested using mixed-effects models. SCFAs were z-score-normalized to harmonize units across cohorts. Sensitivity analyses restricted PL to vaginally delivered infants. Finnish (FIN) and United States (US) cohorts were included for taxonomic validation. Results Evenness, Shannon, and Simpson were similar between PL and JP at most time points; richness was higher in PL at 1 week with trends at 6 months. Beta diversity showed a significant country effect at every time point except 1 month, robust to covariate adjustment and to restriction to 74 genera shared between PL and JP. Genus-level differential abundance yielded 33 features (26 enriched in PL, 7 in JP) without consistent cross-time recurrence. Longitudinally, most genus trajectories were cohort-specific; genus-SCFA associations were largely population-specific (few overlaps for butyrate/isobutyrate, none for acetate/propionate). Despite taxonomic and association differences, SCFA trajectories did not differ between cohorts after harmonization and adjustment. FIN/US validation supported the robustness of temporal taxonomic signals with few discordances. Conclusions Taxonomic profiles and genus-SCFA relationships diverge across populations, whereas core metabolic outputs (fecal SCFAs) follow a conserved, resilient trajectory in early life. This \"divergent taxa, convergent function\" pattern suggests early-life interventions should prioritize functional maturation over targeting specific taxa.

Remarkably, these linker O-glycans are introduced exclusively by GALNT11, one out of 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferase isoenzymes.

This demonstrates that O-glycans in ligand-binding domains can differentially modulate ligand affinity and specificity of LRP1.

We present the first comprehensive molecular investigation of human Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in the state of Victoria, Australia. We analysed faecal samples collected between 2018 and 2024. Positive samples were subtyped and parasite load was estimated. Of the 2,330 samples tested, 225 were positive for Cryptosporidium and nine for Giardia. Seven Cryptosporidium species and 24 subtypes were identified, including multiple novel or regionally unique subtypes. C. hominis was the predominant species (85%), and three subtypes associated with 11 recreational water outbreaks in 2024. Based on spatiotemporal overlap and subtypes, 52 cases were inferred to represent undetected outbreak-associated infections. Several C. parvum subtypes reflected probable zoonotic transmission, two subtypes were associated with a childcare and camp outbreak.

G.; Leslie, K. A.; Russell, M. A.; Oguro-Ando, A.", "abstract": "Background: Investigating the subcellular distribution of proteins is crucial for understanding complex cell behaviours and disease mechanisms. Fluorescence microscopy is a key tool for visualising protein localisation. However, its application is often hindered by the lack of high-quality antibodies, and the common approach to overexpress recombinant fusion constructs tagged with fluorescent proteins can introduce artefacts. Endogenous protein tagging, where the sequence for a tag (typically a peptide or fluorescent protein) is integrated into the native genetic sequence encoding a protein of interest, can be used to overcome these limitations, enabling proteins to be visualised without the need for antibodies against the target protein and avoiding complications associated with recombinant protein overexpression. ORANGE (Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing) is a CRISPR-Cas9-based endogenous protein tagging technique which relies on homology-independent targeted integration (HITI)-mediated gene editing. Utilising HITI as the DNA repair pathway of choice gives ORANGE the advantage of being less error-prone than classical homology-directed repair (HDR)-based endogenous protein tagging techniques and additionally, means it can be used in post-mitotic cells. Results: We applied the ORANGE system to tag three proteins, CYFIP1, JAKMIP1, and STAT3, and confirmed that the expressed fusion proteins demonstrate expected subcellular localisations through fluorescence microscopy. Unexpectedly, the efficiency of ORANGE editing was less than 1% in HEK293 cells, despite high transfection efficiency. To improve the editing efficiency associated with ORANGE, we combined the ORANGE method with an established Sleeping Beauty transposase/CRISPR-Cas9 fusion technique, which has been shown to enhance HITI-mediated gene editing. Using this new method, which we term Sleeping ORANGE, we successfully tagged CYFIP1 with the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. Importantly, through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Sleeping ORANGE increased gene-editing efficiency by approximately 4- to 6-fold compared to the original ORANGE technique. Conclusions: We have developed a method to improve the editing efficiency associated with the ORANGE technique, and with further research to ensure that the fluorescent tags are correctly inserted into their target gene without off-target effects, the Sleeping ORANGE technique may form a valuable tool for researchers to use to better study protein subcellular localisation and dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Our understanding of PDE mechanisms, including the involvement of small RNAs and transposases, is mainly based on studies in the single-cell ciliates, whereas in metazoans, the PDE mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the parasitic nematode Ascaris, PDE removes and remodels all germline chromosome ends, splits fused chromosomes into somatic chromosomes, leading to dramatic karyotype changes. To probe the possible involvement of small RNAs in Ascaris PDE, we identified two Argonautes, AsWAGO-2 and AsWAGO-3, associated with PDE. Using cellular fractionation followed by nuclease-treated immunoprecipitation, we characterized WAGO-associated small RNAs (siRNAs) and their targets in chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We found that AsWAGO-3 is enriched on eliminated chromatin, with its associated siRNAs mostly targeting genes. However, a subset of AsWAGO-3 siRNAs targets repeats in the eliminated regions specifically located in the middle of chromosomes that originated from the ends of ancestral chromosomes. In contrast, AsWAGO-2 transiently stains the retained chromosomes during elimination mitoses, and the associated siRNAs are enriched in the retained regions only in the chromatin fraction. Overall, our data established a link between WAGOs and Ascaris PDE, demonstrating the flexibility of small RNA pathways that selectively distinguish retained and eliminated DNA. We suggest that some of the targeting may be a response to the karyotype changes associated with chromosome fusion and PDE.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

PPTD efficiently blocks ZIP14-mediated uptake of zinc, iron, manganese, and cadmium, while sparing the closely related transporter ZIP8/SLC39A8.

ZIP14-driven metal influx promotes reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, leading to cytotoxicity, which PPTD effectively reverses. In vivo, PPTD ameliorates major features of cancer cachexia in mice, including weight loss, reduced survival, muscle wasting, impaired locomotor activity, and disease progression.

Therapeutic options to prevent or treat radiation-induced fibrosis remain limited. Recent work has shown that neutrophils infiltrating healthy lung tissue after irradiation adopt an activated phenotype capable of perturbing cellular responses of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. However, the contribution of these radiation-educated neutrophils to the development of radiation-induced fibrosis remains unclear. Using targeted, image-guided lung irradiation to deliver a dose sufficient to induce fibrosis within four months, we demonstrate that neutrophils are essential for the efficient development of clinically evident fibrosis.

Phenotypic characterization revealed that D. hansenii produces lipids when grown on components of lignocellulosic and algal biomass in standard and saline media. Notably, D. hansenii produced 57.25% more lipids than Yarrowia lipolytica Po1f when grown on glucose. We designed genomic integration loci and derived gene expression elements from a resequenced D. hansenii CBS767 genome. While characterizing the integration sites, we also optimized the transformation procedure, validated selection markers, and determined fluorescent reporters. Using homology to known elements in S. cerevisiae, we derived 23 promoters and 24 terminators and made them compatible with a modular cloning standard so pathway constructs could be made with automated liquid handling. Flow cytometry measurements show that the promoters span an expression range of three orders of magnitude and the terminators span one order of magnitude.

However, methods for precisely determining encapsulation efficiency in synthetic cells at single cell resolution have been limited. To address this challenge, we developed QuantGUV, a software-driven, image-based analysis method that determines the concentrations of fluorescent molecules encapsulated within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We used QuantGUV to measure the encapsulation efficiencies of fluorescent molecules, ranging in size from 0.5 nm to 20 nm.

Wolbachia-mediated viral interference has been employed to limit the spread of arboviruses, including dengue. However, the mechanisms underpinning Wolbachia-mediated viral interference are not consistently understood. Previous studies have identified resource competition as a potential mechanism by which Wolbachia disrupts viral replication. Our study uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to characterize the bi- and tripartite host-Wolbachia-virus interactions using the model insect Drosophila melanogaster, the protective Wolbachia strain wMel and the pathogenic Drosophila C virus (DCV). The findings reveal that wMel-infected flies showed increased simple carbohydrate catabolism relative to uninfected Drosophila. DCV infection perturbed nucleotide synthesis and nucleotide abundance in Drosophila compared to uninfected Drosophila, driving metabolism to likely meet the viral replication demands imposed on the host. Notably, co-infected Drosophila exhibited a metabolic profile more similar to wMel-infected flies than DCV-infected flies, suggesting that wMel drives metabolism in a direction that at least temporarily inhibits DCV replication. The metabolic profile is indicative of a hypoxic environment that has been known to trigger immune pathways that further contribute to Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking. It is probable that Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection is a multimodal consequence of wMel's influence on host metabolism, rather than a single mechanism. These findings will guide future research and contribute to the continued success of Wolbachia-based vector control strategies against RNA arboviruses, potentially leading to novel approaches for defending against such pathogens and improving vector control strategies.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

L.; Marder, E.", "abstract": "Neurons are terminally differentiated cells that adapt to maintain stable function over years, despite encountering a wide range of environmental perturbations. Some adaptations are transient, fading once the perturbation ends. Others are persistent, continuing to influence a neuron's responses to future challenges even after baseline conditions are restored. These persistent adaptations are especially intriguing because some remain undetectable under normal conditions -- only becoming apparent upon re-exposure to a perturbation. Among the many mechanisms that may contribute to persistent adaptation, we investigate one based on the regulation of intrinsic currents. Using a computational model of activity-dependent homeostasis, we show that slow changes in channel density can encode the influence of past experience and shape future responses while rapid shifts in ion channel voltage-dependence provide immediate compensation during perturbations. Together, these dual processes tune a neuron's intrinsic excitability, enabling persistent adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

Large-scale elucidation of T- and B-cell receptors (TCRs and BCRs) through immune-repertoire sequencing promises novel diagnostics, prognostic markers, and therapeutic strategies. However, progress is hampered by small cohort sizes, a lack of real-world patient diversity, and heterogeneous sample processing, impeding cross-study comparability. To overcome these limitations, here we introduce the Human Blood Immunome Encyclopedia (HuBIE), comprising immune-repertoire data from 2,614 samples collected from 1,941 participants. The cohort includes a range of bloodstream infections, several cancer types, and control participants, with many individuals providing longitudinal samples. We employed Roche immune receptor Primer Extension Target Enrichment (immunoPETE) platform to perform simultaneous targeted sequencing of T-cell receptor{beta} chains (TRB), T-cell receptor{delta} chains (TRD), and immunoglobulin heavy chains (IGH), thereby profiling TCRs and BCRs in all participants. We provide a comprehensive description of immune-repertoire diversity in cancer and bloodstream infections and examine variations across demographic variables such as age and race. We find significant differences in TRB and IGH composition across ethnic groups, and show that the fall in repertoire diversity with age follows distinct patterns for TRB, TRD, and IGH and is accompanied by age-related differences in VJ gene usage. Finally we demonstrate that greater immunological diversity is associated with improved survival but only for elderly participants. HuBIE thus constitutes a valuable resource for the immune-repertoire community, enabling large-scale mapping of the human immunome to accelerate development of diagnostics, prognostic biomarkers, and innovative therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

A.; Gabaldon, T.", "abstract": "The opportunistic yeast pathogen Candida dubliniensis is frequently misidentified as its closest relative Candida albicans, due to their high phenotypic similarity. Although Candida dubliniensis is an important cause of fungal infections, especially in the oral cavities of immunocompromised patients, its phenotypic and genomic variability remains poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap by performing a comprehensive phenotypic and genomic characterization of 33 C. dubliniensis oral isolates from people living with HIV in Argentina. Our results uncovered significant phenotypic heterogeneity--observed both inter- and intra-patient--impacting clinically relevant traits such as drug susceptibility, stress sensitivity, filamentation, and hypoxic growth. Our isolates expanded the previously known MLST-based genetic diversity of the species. Leveraging whole-genome sequencing, we resolved intricate evolutionary relationships, proposed a more robust MLST scheme for future typing, and identified potential antifungal resistance-causing variants. Collectively, this work represents the most comprehensive population genomics characterization of C. dubliniensis to date, establishing a foundation for improved surveillance and diagnostic strategies to fully define its role in both oral and systemic infections.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16 (USP16) is a deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves ubiquitin from histone H2A, and modulates gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and various other cellular processes. The USP16 zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) binds the free C-terminal end of both ubiquitin and ISG15, two major signaling proteins that mediate many biological pathways. Because the precise function of USP16-UBD and its interactions remains unclear, a small molecule antagonist targeting the USP16-UBD could enable cellular studies to elucidate its biological role. Here we report SGC-UBD1031 (15), a chemical probe targeting USP16-UBD with similar in vitro binding profiles to HDAC6-UBD and selectivity over nine other UBDs. In cellular assays, 15 disrupts the interaction between the C-terminus of ISG15 and USP1-UBD, as well as the interaction between ISG15 and HDAC6 UBD, at a concentration of 1 M. The corresponding enantiomer SGC-UBD1031N (16), does not interfere with these interactions, even at concentrations as high as 30 M, and thus serves as a negative control.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Nguyen-Dinh, T.; Zeng, J.; Jirapanjawat, T.; Eate, V.; Wong, W. W.; Cook, P. L. M.; Greening, C.", "abstract": "Chemosynthesis, an ancient metabolism that uses chemical compounds for energy and biomass generation, occurs across the ocean. Although chemosynthesis typically plays a subsidiary role to photosynthesis in the euphotic ocean, it is unclear whether it plays a more important role in aphotic habitats within this zone. Here, we compared the composition, function, and activity of sedimentary microorganisms within a marine cave at mesophotic depth, across a transect from the entrance to the interior. Microbes thrived throughout this ecosystem, with interior communities having higher diversity than those at the entrance. Analysis of 132 species-level bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes revealed niche partitioning of habitat generalists distributed along the cave, alongside specialists enriched across its entrance and interior environments. Photosynthetic microbes and photosystem genes declined in the inner cave, concomitant with enrichment of chemosynthetic lineages capable of using inorganic compounds such as ammonium, sulfide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Biogeochemical assays confirmed that the cave communities consume these compounds and fix carbon dioxide through chemosynthesis, with inner communities mediating higher cellular rates. Together, these findings suggest that the persistent darkness and low hydrodynamic disruption in marine cave sediments create conditions for metabolically diverse communities to thrive, sustained by recycling of inorganic compounds, as well as endogenous and lateral organic matter inputs. Thus, chemosynthesis can sustain rich microbial ecosystems even within the traditionally photosynthetically dominated euphotic zone.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

N.; Dye, M.; Mendoza, I.; Moran, R. L.", "abstract": "Community persistence depends on the balance between abiotic constraints and biotic interactions. Environmental stress can either sort species by physiological limits or amplify competitive asymmetries, producing coexistence, exclusion, or collapse. We tested these alternatives in two replicate hybrid swarms between orangethroat and orangebelly darters (Etheostoma pulchellum and E. radiosum spp. complex) with contrasting outcomes: long-term coexistence in the Blue River versus collapse in the Washita River. We combined critical-thermal-maximum (CT) assays with standardized feeding experiments to evaluate physiological tolerance, competitive exclusion, and stress-amplified competition. CT varied with river, sex, and body size but not consistently between species, indicating that local history and demography outweighed intrinsic physiological differences. In contrast, competition trials revealed strong, temperature-dependent asymmetries: E. pulchellum dominated in the cooler, stable Blue River, whereas E. radiosum spp. gained a foraging advantage under high temperatures in the warmer Washita River drainage. These results support the prediction that abiotic stress amplifies competitive asymmetries, flipping dominance and explaining divergent hybrid zone outcomes. More broadly, our study links hybrid zone dynamics to coexistence theory, showing that climate extremes can shift competitive balance and determine whether secondary contact results in persistence or loss.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}

We performed DIA-based proteomics on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of sporadic ccRCC from 153 patients, comprising 142 tumor, 123 pseudocapsule (PC), and 121 non-malignant adjacent tissue (NAT) samples. The PC displayed a distinctive proteomic signature characterized by matrix accumulation, enhanced remodeling and ECM-cell signaling, consistent with a signaling-competent boundary and active growth factor sequestration rather than a passive fibrotic barrier. Within the tumor, we observed canonical metabolic reprogramming with upregulated glycolysis and hypoxia markers and suppression of aerobic metabolism, accompanied by strong cell-cycle and pro-angiogenic signatures. Immune programs included increased antigen processing and presentation, together with elevated inflammasome and pyroptosis signatures. T-cell markers were enriched in the PC, indicating an immune-active boundary. Among tumors, we identified five distinct proteomic subtypes (C1-C5) spanning proliferative/mitotic, metabolic, immune/EMT/mTOR, and ECM phenotypes. Semi-specific peptide analysis indicated elevated endogenous proteolysis in the tumor and varied across clusters, with C1 and C5 showing the greatest proteolytic burden. Mechanotransduction features showed only modest PC elevation but were dominated by inter-patient variation. The present study defines a matrix-rich, signaling-active pseudocapsule and a classification of heterogeneous tumor subtypes in sporadic ccRCC. The framework provides a compartment-resolved, cluster-informed approach, and it highlights actionable axes of potential clinical relevance.", "date": "2025-10-23", "journal": ""}
