S.", "abstract": "Sexual production in social insects marks the peak of colony development, yet the mechanisms regulating it remain unclear. We investigated the role of brood in colony development, worker reproduction, and sexual production in Bombus impatiens. While larvae are known to reduce worker egg-laying and enhance the queen's reproductive inhibition, these effects were previously tested only in small groups. We manipulated brood size in full-sized, young colonies by doubling or removing brood and monitored development. Colonies with doubled brood produced significantly more gynes, independent of the number of workers, while reduced-brood colonies exhibited a non-significant increase in male production that was driven by colony size. Worker ovary activation was lower in double-brood colonies, with no change in aggression. A follow-up experiment directly testing the effect of colony size showed that higher worker density led to higher ovary activation in workers but did not affect sexual production. These results suggest that brood strongly influences colony development and sexual production, possibly reflecting an extended phenotype of the queen, whereas worker ovary activation appears to be a more flexible process influenced by either brood presence or colony size. Understanding brood dynamics may be key to understanding the evolution of female castes in social insects.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here we show that antigen-dependent induction of the chemokine receptor, CXCR6, is a conserved adaptation to peripheral tissue infiltration that promotes TRM formation after viral infection. Deficient TRM formation in the absence of CXCR6 was not explained by canonical trafficking as CXCR6 was not required for tissue entry, was dispensable for the early accumulation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in skin, and did not restrain their exit. Further, single cell sequencing indicated that Cxcr6-/- CD8+ T cells were competent to acquire a transcriptional program of residence and TRM that formed were equally functional compared to their WT counterparts when reactivated greater than 100 days post primary infection. The reduced numbers observed at memory time points, where instead found to associate with impaired redox homeostasis and antioxidant capacity during the transition from effector to memory states. As such, Cxcr6-/- CD8+ T cells exhibited increased rates of apoptosis in the dermis relative to controls, which led to reduced numbers of TRM in the epidermis at memory. CXCR6 therefore promotes the metabolic adaptation of T cells as they engage antigen in tissue to increase the probability of memory differentiation and long-term residence.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

While large-scale and long-term datasets of environmental variables are available, reproductive phenology needs to be measured in-site, limiting the spatiotemporal scales of the data. We leveraged a unique dataset assembled by SeasonWatch, a citizen-science phenology monitoring programme in India to assess the environmental correlates of flowering in three ubiquitous and economically important tree species - jackfruit, mango and tamarind - in the south-western Indian state of Kerala. We explored (i) seasonal patterns in the flowering status of trees (ii) environmental correlates of flowering onset considering only trees with consecutive observations and (iii) spatiotemporal patterns in these environmental correlates to aid future hypotheses for changing phenology patterns. We used 165006 phenology observations spread over 19591 individual trees over 9 years. We first used bootstrapped circular statistics that accounts for observation biases in time to examine consistency in seasonality of flowering status over the whole season, and flowering onset across years and trees. Similar to results from cohort-based tree monitoring, we demonstrate seasonality in flowering status and onset across species, but also report large interannual and inter-individual variability. We then used used generalized linear mixed models with remotely sensed observations (ERA5-LAND) to show that some of the interannual variation in flowering onset across individuals was associated with environmental variables. Soil moisture, minimum temperature and solar radiation had significant associations with the onset of flowering but these effects were heterogeneous across species and habitats across Kerala. Our results become increasingly important in the face of large spatiotemporal change in the climate of this landscape and other tropical regions. We demonstrate the potential and limitations of citizen-science observations in making and testing predictions at scale for predictive climate science in tropical landscapes.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, their widespread use, especially for flexible interfaces, is limited by the lack of customizable and medical grade materials. We report a novel synthesis method for ISO 10993-11 compliant polyamic acid that enables the fabrication of biocompatible polyimide films tailored for neural implants. Using this material, we developed 4 and 32 channel depth and surface electrodes, including custom whole brain ECoG arrays.

The rs1024611 (alleles: A>G; G is the risk allele) polymorphism in the CCL2 cis-regulatory region is associated with increased CCL2 expression in vitro and ex vivo, leukocyte mobilization in vivo, and deleterious disease outcomes. However, the molecular basis for the rs1024611-associated differential CCL2 expression remains poorly characterized. It is conceivable that genetic variant(s) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1024611 could mediate such effects. Previously, we used rs13900 (alleles: C>T) in the CCL2 3 prime untranslated region that is in perfect LD with rs1024611 to demonstrate allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of CCL2 in heterozygous individuals. Here we tested the hypothesis that the rs13900 could modulate CCL2 expression by altering mRNA turnover and/or translatability. The rs13900 T allele conferred greater stability to the CCL2 transcript when compared to the rs13900 C allele. The rs13900 T allele also had increased binding to Human Antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein, in vitro and ex vivo. The rs13900 alleles imparted differential activity to reporter vectors and influenced the translatability of the reporter transcript. We further demonstrated the role of HuR in mediating allele-specific effects on CCL2 expression in overexpression and silencing studies.

Many of these sponsored programs are designed to increase research exposure for underrepresented minorities, including African American, Hispanic, Native American, and first-generation college students, among others. Recruiting trainees to post-bac programs can be challenging for reasons that include a lack of awareness about available programs. To address this gap, an Open House event was created with the goal of raising awareness and generating interest among potential students for future post-bac programs. Students were recruited from partnering Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to attend a two-day event at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) and a Research-Intensive (R1) institution. During the visit, students toured both campuses, learned about various post-bac programs and research opportunities, and interacted with faculty, current graduate students, and a former post-bac scholar. Transportation, lodging, and meals were provided. Participants completed voluntary pre- and post-event surveys. Results indicated that attendees, the majority of whom were underrepresented minorities in STEM, left with a stronger understanding of post-bac programs and how these experiences could support their future careers in STEM and that student attendance at the event made it more likely they would apply to available post-bac programs. Mentor and MSI faculty survey responses highlighted their strong support for participating in future recruitment events. These findings demonstrate that in-person Open House events, built on collaborative partnerships across institutions, are an effective strategy for increasing awareness and encouraging participation in post-bac training programs - particularly among underrepresented student populations.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing >10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of around 3,000 microbubbles/mm2, a low weight of 0.047 mg/mm2, the ability to generate a substantial force intensity of ~1.21 {micro}N/mm2, and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micro- to centimeter scale), exceptional compliance, and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation (e.g., handling zebrafish larvae), conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects, multimodal shape-shifting surfaces, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion.

To address the low yield of natural migrasomes, we engineered migrasome-like vesicles (eMigrasomes) using hypotonic shock combined with cytoskeletal disruption to enhance vesicle formation. The biogenesis of eMigrasomes relies on the core migrasome machinery, faithfully recapitulating the biophysical attributes of native migrasomes while significantly improving production efficiency. We demonstrate that eMigrasomes loaded with a model antigen elicit potent antibody responses and maintain structural integrity and immunogenic potential at room temperature.

Acidic pH disrupts the transcription condensates containing BRD4 and MED1, via histidine-enriched intrinsically disordered regions.

Here, we studied the perimovement activity of neurons in globus pallidus internus (GPi) of non-human primates before and after the induction of parkinsonism by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Neuronal responses were equally common in the parkinsonian brain as seen prior to MPTP and the distribution of different response types was largely unchanged. The slowing of behavioral reaction times and movement durations following the induction of parkinsonism was accompanied by a prolongation of the time interval between neuronal response onset and movement initiation. Neuronal responses were also reduced in magnitude and prolonged in duration after the induction of parkinsonism. Importantly, those two effects were more pronounced among decrease-type responses, and they persisted after controlling for MPTP-induced changes in the trial-by-trial timing of neuronal responses. Following MPTP The timing of neuronal responses also became uncoupled from the time of movement onset and more variable from trial-to-trial. Overall, the effects of MPTP on temporal features of neural responses correlated most consistently with the severity of parkinsonian motor impairments whereas the changes in response magnitude and duration were either anticorrelated with symptom severity or inconsistent.

Epidermal melanocytes typically interact with the collagen IV-rich basement membrane, but upon injury or in pathological conditions, they can encounter environments rich in collagen I or fibronectin. While alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and stiffness are known to impact cell behavior, the specific roles of each of these cues for melanocyte functions remain unclear. To explore the impact of these extrinsic cues, we here exposed murine melanocytes to different ECM proteins as well as varying substrate stiffnesses. This study identified MITF, a key regulator of melanocyte differentiation and function, as an ECM- and mechanosensitive transcription factor. We further revealed that distinct ECM proteins and substrate stiffness engage a FAK/MEK/ERK/MITF signaling axis to control melanocyte functions. Exposure of melanocytes to collagen I restricted FAK and ERK activation, promoting high nuclear MITF levels associated with melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, fibronectin elicited elevated FAK and ERK activation, leading to low nuclear MITF, correlating with a dedifferentiated and motile phenotype. Consistent with these observations, RNA sequencing revealed that collagen I supports a differentiated gene expression program, whereas fibronectin induces a dedifferentiated transcriptomic signature. Importantly, inhibiting MEK or ERK activity in melanocytes cultured on fibronectin led to increased MITF nuclear localization and enhanced melanogenesis. Additionally, on fibronectin FAK inhibition reduced ERK activation and enhanced melanogenesis, supporting a role for FAK upstream of ERK. Finally, we uncovered that melanocyte mechanoresponses differ depending on the specific ECM environment. Together, these findings reveal a substantial effect of extrinsic cues on melanocyte function, with a context-dependent MITF regulation downstream of ERK, offering new perspectives for our understanding of melanocyte-related pathologies.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Controllers are often constrained by their sampling rate, which is usually relatively low when using microfluidics/microscopy platforms. Current adaptive filters can lead to an inaccurate predictive model when operating with a low sampling rate, leading to sub-optimal control.

We show that Malat1 is required for appropriate cytokine expression in female but not male Th2 cells. Malat1 deficiency impairs in vitro Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells from female mice, characterised by transcriptome-wide effects and suppression of cytokine expression, particularly IL10. Upon IL10R blockade a pronounced effect is also seen on IL4 and IL13. Mechanistically, naive CD4+ T cells from Malat1-/- female mice demonstrate altered early activation kinetics and impaired early differentiation gene expression, including up-regulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) module. This is followed by suppression of IL2R and IL2R{gamma} expression and IL2-mediated differentiation. Mimicking the effect of Malat1 loss by maintaining early ISG expression in WT cells with IFN{beta} treatment partially phenocopies the effects of Malat1 deficiency. A subset of the effects of Malat1 loss in female cells is also observed in male cells. However, this does not affect endpoint Th2 differentiation. Male CD4+ T cells demonstrate stronger early activation, higher ISG expression during early differentiation, maintenance of IL2 expression independently of Malat1, and lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during late differentiation compared to female cells. In vivo, female, but not male, Malat1-/- mice demonstrate altered Th2 cytokine expression characterised by a reduction in IL10+ Th2 cells in both lung and spleen following priming and challenge with Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a model of lung type 2 inflammation.

Using RNA interference, nlg3 knockdown in the OL increased fly social space, especially in the males, while knocking down nlg3 independently in the MB or the PB did not change social spacing. However, hyperactivation and silencing of these neurons in the MB, but not the PB, controls social space in males and females, while hyperactivating and silencing of all nlg3-expressing neurons, including within the MB, PB, and OL, regulates male and female social space. Knocking down neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes, which decreases the amount of neurotransmitter release, showed that reducing acetylcholine release from the MB decreased female social space, whereas knocking down any dopamine receptor in the MB increased male social space. Lastly, to investigate the sexually dimorphic effects on social spacing previously seen in nlg3 mutants, we examined a subset of sexually dimorphic fruitless-expressing (fruP1) neurons known to regulate sexually dimorphic behaviours.

Marine organisms are surrounded by microbes and complex molecular interactions occur between bacterial symbionts, eukaryotic hosts, and their pathogens or prey. Trace metals in the ocean can be either beneficial or detrimental to marine life depending on their concentrations and bioavailability. Multiple marine tunicate species are known to bioaccumulate trace metals in their mantel, and research suggests tunicate microbiota plays an important role in this process. Botryllus schlosseri, a marine colonial tunicate, has become a model organism for cellular and developmental studies, yet its ecological interactions are still not well understood. Using an integrated multidisciplinary approach, we established a comprehensive baseline and explored correlations between members of the B. schlosseri microbiome, metabolome, and metallome to elucidate the ecological effects of trace metals in host-microbe-pathogen interactions. We identified significant correlations between metals, including manganese, nickel, cerium, zinc, and cobalt, with various metabolites and bacterial taxa. These findings offer insights into B. schlosseri biological and chemical interactions with their symbionts and their environment, contributing to bridging the knowledge gap of host-microbiome-environment interactions and establishing a foundation for continuing research on the ecological effects of trace metals in these biological systems.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

In a genealogical context, this recombination-mediated information reflects the persistence of ancestral haplotypes across local genealogical trees in which they do not represent coalescences. We show how these non-coalescing haplotypes (``locally-unary nodes'') may be inserted into ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs), a compact but information-rich data structure describing the genealogical relationships among recombinant sequences. The resulting ARGs are smaller, faster to compute with, and the additional ancestral information that is inserted is nearly always correct where the initial ARG is correct. We provide efficient algorithms to infer locally-unary nodes within existing ARGs, and explore some consequences for ARGs inferred from real data. To do this, we introduce new metrics of agreement and disagreement between ARGs that, unlike previous methods, consider ARGs as describing relationships between haplotypes rather than just a collection of trees.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Although activity dependent processes are essential for primary motor cortex (M1) to develop motor functions, the precise activity patterns that precede this transition remain unclear. To track the development of movement-related activity in M1, we recorded single unit activity in the forelimb region of M1 in unanesthetized, head fixed rats across sleep and wake at postnatal days (P)12,16,20, and24. At every age, a subset of M1 neurons showed somatotopically precise responses to spontaneous limb twitches that occur during REM sleep, along with strong responses to wake movements. From P12 to P24, the proportion of M1 neurons that showed twitch-related activity decreased, twitch-related activity became more temporally refined, and a larger fraction of spikes occurred before movement onset. To compare M1's developmentally nascent activity with that of an established motor structure, we performed simultaneous recordings in M1 and the red nucleus (RN) at P24. Compared to M1, more RN activity preceded twitches and wake movements. Further, RN activity was more diverse, with neurons firing during specific wake movements, whereas wake-movement-related activity in M1 was largely non-selective. These results suggest that through P24, movement-related activity in M1 reflects predicted and actual sensory feedback across both sleep and wake, whereas movement-related activity in RN drives limb movements across both sleep and wake.

Although H2AK119ub is associated with transcriptional repression and H2BK120ub with activation, the molecular basis for these contrasting effects has remained unclear. Here, we use microsecond all-atom and millisecond coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal how the position of ubiquitin reshapes nucleosome structure and assembly. H2AK119ub rigidifies the histone core by indirectly reinforcing the L1-L1 interface between H2A histones, strengthening both tetramer-dimer and dimer-dimer interactions, and slowing complete nucleosome assembly. In contrast, H2BK120ub disrupts these interfaces, weakens the histone core, and favors partially assembled hexasome and tetrasome states. Both modifications cause dramatic slowdowns in nucleosome folding, with H2BK120ub producing an order-of-magnitude greater effect. These simulations establish clear molecular mechanisms by which site-specific ubiquitination alters nucleosome stability and assembly kinetics. Our findings quantitatively explain how H2A and H2B ubiquitination exert opposing effects on chromatin regulation.

Most pre-erythrocytic vaccines target circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Antibodies targeting distinct epitopes within the central repeat region of CSP have the potential to provide protection from infection, but we have focused on developing vaccines that target a highly vulnerable CSP epitope that is targeted by the potent monoclonal antibody L9. In a previous study, we produced a pre-erythrocytic vaccine displaying a synthetic peptide representing the L9 epitope on Q-beta bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs). This vaccine elicited strong anti-CSP antibody responses that protected mice from malaria challenge. Here, we asked whether the structural context of the L9 epitope influences the quality of antibody responses. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Q-beta L9 VLPs to recombinant VLPs that display the L9 peptide in a structure that is hypothesized to mimic its native conformation. Recombinant MS2 bacteriophage VLPs displaying various lengths of the L9 epitope were produced and immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in mice. Our results demonstrate that MS2 L9 VLPs, particularly those displaying longer L9 peptides and in combination with a potent novel adjuvant, elicit strong and durable antibody responses that lower malaria liver burden and prevent infection. We also compared the efficacy of L9-targeted vaccines to the licensed vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E (Mosquirix, GSK). Immunization with Q-beta L9 VLPs, MS2 L9 VLPs, and RTS,S/AS01E provided significant protection from liver-stage infection in a mouse model; immunization with Q-beta L9 VLPs elicited sterilizing immunity in the highest percentage of mice.

While ML has demonstrated remarkable success in data-driven modeling across engineering, biology, and other scientific fields, MM remain essential for their interpretability and capacity to extrapolate beyond observed conditions based on established principles such as chemical kinetics and physiological processes. However, MM can be labor-intensive to construct and often rely on simplifying assumptions that may not fully capture real-world complexity. It is thus desirable to combine MM and ML approaches so as to enable more robust predictions, enhanced system insights, and improved handling of sparse or noisy data. A key challenge when doing so is ensuring that ML components do not disregard mechanistic information, potentially leading to overfitting or reduced interpretability. To address that challenge, this paper introduces the idea of Partially Uncertain Model Structures (PUMS) and investigates conditions that discourage the ML components from ignoring mechanistic constraints. This work also introduces the concept of embedded Physics-Informed Neural Networks (ePINNs), which consist of two loss-sharing neural networks that seamlessly blend ML and MM components. This work arose in the study of the context problem in synthetic biology. Engineered genetic circuits may exhibit unexpected behavior in living cells due to resource sharing. To illustrate the advantages of the ePINNs approach, this paper applies the framework to a gene network model subject to resource competition, demonstrating the effectiveness of this hybrid modeling approach in capturing complex system interactions while maintaining physical consistency.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Although the final phenotypes appeared similar, distinct and reproducible evolutionary trajectories were evident, characterized by antibiotic-specific mechanisms of resistance, persistence, and tolerance. Remarkably, sequential antibiotic use prompted evolutionary shifts from genetically divergent to convergent trajectories, highlighting strategies to refine antibiotic use, enhance clinical efficacy, and mitigate the risk of multi-drug resistance.

While performance error is fundamental for the cognitive component of motor learning, what error, either performance or movement prediction error, underlies implicit motor learning has not been resolved. These two errors are hard to disentangle as the performance outcome is an integral part of the movement. Here we used the classical visuomotor adaptation paradigm, in which people learn to counter visual perturbations by deliberately aiming off the target, to dissociate the performance error from the prediction error. Using a series of behavioral experiments and model comparisons, we revealed that movement prediction error, but not performance error, can parsimoniously explain diverse learning effects. Importantly, despite the perturbation is visual, the movement prediction error is not specified in visual terms, but determined by a perceptual estimate of the hand kinematics.

While canonical Dcrs in plants and animals contain a well-defined domain architecture, most fungal Dcrs with experimentally validated functions lack one or more identifiable canonical domains, raising questions about how RNA-binding and precise sRNA processing is retained. Here, we conducted the most extensive survey of fungal Dcr proteins, analyzing 1,593 proteomes across eight phyla. We found a diversity of Dcr domain architectures, with some of them lacking an identifiable PAZ, Helicase, and/or double-stranded RNA binding domains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that different Dcr classes are distributed across distinct clades that often align with fungal taxonomic groups. Despite the lack of canonical domain architectures, we found that fungal Dcrs fold into a characteristic L-shaped structure and show PAZ-like folds, even in proteins without detectable PAZ sequences. Molecular docking and electrostatic analyses further indicate that these divergent Dcrs maintain key RNA-binding surfaces for proper sRNA processing.

However, its application is limited by pixel-wise-correlated noise inherent in the imaging process. While the deep-learning-based framework Noise2Inverse has been proposed for tomography denoising, the lack of robust validation for newly revealed features raises concerns regarding their practical biological utility. We argue that denoising the raw tilt series, instead of on the reconstructed tomogram, offers a significant advantage by leveraging the tomographic reconstruction process to mitigate local prediction errors through averaging. Consequently, features present in the tomogram reconstructed from a denoised tilt series exhibit higher credibility, as falsely predicted details on certain tilt series slices are likely to be averaged out. Nevertheless, denoising the tilt series remains challenging due to the spatially correlated noise that occurs in bioimaging. Existing self-supervised methods relying on a single noisy image struggle with such noise, while the Noise2Noise framework necessitates paired noisy datasets for training. This study addresses these challenges by investigating practical imaging workflows in SXM and related bioimaging modalities to identify existing imaging resources as training data for tilt series denoising.

Despite the significant array of experimental and computational data, many aspects of their function and dynamics remain unclear - such as how ion permeation is halted in the closed state of the channel. Available CryoEM structures obtained in deactivating conditions capture the channel with a wide, unobstructed pore, in contrast to e.g. a helix bundle crossing observed in some K+ channels. Several hypotheses of BK closure were proposed, including selectivity filter and hydrophobic gating. In this work, we expand on the model of hydrophobic gating and focus on the role of lipids. Based on our atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we propose lipid entrance into the pore - either with lipid tails or entire lipid molecules - through the membrane-facing fenestrations to be a critical determinant of BK conductivity. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism of BK activation by negatively charged lipids, and suggest that they act by a multi-modal mechanism, which encompasses lipid entry reduction, increase of the K+ occupancy of the pore, and stabilization of the channels open-state structure - in broad agreement with experimental data.

While SRD5A2 is known to mediate stromal-epithelial interactions that influence prostate growth, the relationship between baseline SRD5A2 expression and prostate volume remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed SRD5A2 expression in human prostate tissues from two independent cohorts: the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial and an institutional biorepository. Quantitative assessments were performed using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, ELISA, and western blotting. Correlations were evaluated between SRD5A2 expression, WNT5A expression, prostate volume, and tissue signaling profiles. Functional validation was performed in a Srd5a2-null mouse model and through mechanistic studies using stromal cell SRD5A2-overexpression systems.\n\nResultsSRD5A2 expression was significantly associated with total prostate and transition zone volume in both human cohorts. Stromal-specific WNT5A expression showed a strong positive correlation with SRD5A2, while neither serum nor tissue dihydrotestosterone levels correlated with SRD5A2 expression. In Srd5a2-null mice, Wnt5a expression in the prostate stroma was dependent on Srd5a2 and showed region-specific regulation. Mechanistically, SRD5A2 overexpression in stromal cells upregulated WNT5A and Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1), activated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, increased proliferation, and reduced apoptosis. Conditioned media from these cells enhanced epithelial proliferation through paracrine IGF1 activity, independent of epithelial WNT signaling.\n\nConclusionThis study provides the first evidence that SRD5A2 promotes prostate growth through a stromal WNT5A-LEF1-IGF1 paracrine signaling axis, functioning independently of androgen levels.

Despite extensive studies, the detailed reaction scheme remains unclear. In this study, we examined the photo-induced reaction dynamics of OCP using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transient grating (TG) spectroscopy. We found that OCPO and OCPR exist in monomer-dimer equilibria, with OCPR forming more stable and elongated dimers. TG measurements revealed that upon photoexcitation, OCPO monomers undergo two structural transitions before associating into OCPR dimers. In contrast, OCPO dimers dissociate prior to the structural rearrangement, highlighting a fundamental difference in their reaction pathways. Moreover, dimerization was found to moderately reduce the photo-reactivity of OCPO compared to the monomer. We also found that apo-OCP readily forms heterodimers with OCPR, potentially altering reaction pathways and masking true kinetic behavior.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Such maps can be organized topographically or based on some computational principle. However, it is unclear how the central organization of a sensory system corresponds to the functional logic of the motor system. This problem is exemplified by insect flight, where sub-millisecond modifications in wing-steering muscle activity are necessary for stability and maneuverability. Although the muscles that control wing motion are anatomically and functionally stratified into distinct motor modules3-7, comparatively little is known about the architecture of the sensory circuits that regulate their precise firing times. Here, we leverage an existing volume of an adult female VNC of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster8,9 to reconstruct the complete population of afferents in the haltere--nature's only biological ''gyroscope''10,11--and their synaptic partners. We morphometrically classify these neurons into distinct subtypes and design split-GAL4 lines that help us determine the peripheral locations from which each subtype originates. We find that each subtype, rather than originating from the same anatomical location, is comprised of multiple regions on the haltere. We then trace the flow of rapid mechanosensory feedback from the peripheral haltere receptors to the central motor circuits that control wing kinematics. Our work demonstrates how a sensory system's connectivity patterns construct a neural map that may facilitate rapid processing by the motor system.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

MCSs play many roles in cellular homeostasis by facilitating inter-organelle lipid and ion exchange as well as organelle positioning. The late endosome/lysosome (LE/Lys) cholesterol transfer protein STARD3 (StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain containing protein 3) forms reversible contacts between the LE/Lys and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This tether protein contains a Phospho-FFAT motif (two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract (AT)) whose interaction with ER-resident VAP proteins is phosphorylation-dependent. In this study, we identify Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3 and GSK3{beta}) as the kinases responsible for phosphorylating serine 209 within the Phospho-FFAT motif of STARD3. This phosphorylation event is both necessary and sufficient to activate STARD3's tethering activity, thereby promoting ER-LE/Lys contacts. Furthermore, we show that the ER-LE/Lys tethering activity made by STARD3 regulates endosome positioning, revealing an additional function for STARD3 on endosome biology. Our findings establish a direct and critical role for GSK3 in regulating MCS dynamics via STARD3 phosphorylation.

Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Liver ischemia reperfusion injuries (LIRI) arise during transplant and contribute to allograft dysfunction. While many drivers of LIRI have been well-characterized, the relationships between LIRI and later immunological signatures remain poorly understood, possibly because of limited integrated studies examining immunological signatures across the LT process. Furthermore, the role of underlying disease in LT remains poorly understood as it is unknown if later immunological signatures are universal or etiology dependent. To better examine etiology- and LIRI-driven immunological mechanisms across the LT lifetime, we collected cytokine and liver function test (LFT) measurements from LT donors and recipients at multiple pre- and post-operative timepoints. By developing a tensor-based factorization method to integrate these longitudinal measurements, we reduced the datasets to four immunological signatures that manifested across cytokines, LFTs, and time. Correlative analyses revealed associations between these integrated immunological signatures with etiology and LIRI. Later integration of allograft survival into this factorization method reduced these four signatures to two that were predictive of five-year allograft survival. Examination of these signatures prognostic of allograft survival found that CD4+ hyperpolarization towards Th1 or Th2 subtypes impaired growth factor expression and led to increased allograft loss risk. Clinical correlates revealed that donor and recipient age alongside etiology and donor liver health modulate this balance of CD4+ polarization in LT. Collectively, these results link immunological mechanisms to etiology and LIRI offering immediately actionable clinical insights alongside etiology- and donor-specific therapeutic targets for improving LT outcomes.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Susceptibility to CDI and severity of disease varies depending on a variety of factors such as aggressive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, age, and immune status. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that female patients are more at risk for CDI than their male counterparts. C. difficile is spread by spores which can persist in the environment and in the intestines of patients. Spores do not cause disease but germinate in the antibiotic-altered gut of patients to generate toxin producing vegetative cells. The germination of C. difficile spores is mediated by the composition of bile salts in the gut with taurocholate facilitating germination and chenodeoxycholate inhibiting it. Since germination is required for CDI, we expect that anti-germination therapy will prevent CDI and its relapse. While the mechanism for germination has not been unambiguously identified, we and others have shown that C. difficile spore germination can be inhibited with bile salt analogs. We also found that cholan-24-amides containing m-sulfanilic acid (CamSA) or aniline (CaPA) prevented CDI in rodents. In this study, we show that prophylactic treatment of murine CDI also showed sexual dimorphism with females responding better to treatment than males.

Application of plasmid Fiber-seq to diverse plasmids and cell lines demonstrates that plasmids are chromatinized in a sequence-dependent organized manner and adopt a heterogeneous and incomplete chromatin architecture relative to nuclear-encoded chromatin fibers. We show that the focal occupancy of nucleosomes and transcription factors along transfected plasmids is central to their transcriptional activity within mammalian cells, and demonstrate that plasmids indeed are capable of recapitulating nuclear genome-encoded chromatin architectures, although not always.

Once licensed, origins become active and initiate DNA synthesis with varying efficiencies influenced by local chromatin environment, transcription, and 3D genome organization. ORC proteins have also been implicated in regulating chromatin state and nuclear organization. However, it is unclear if there is interplay between ORC and the chromatin architectures underlying origin activation, as we lack a systems-level understanding of how ORC proteins interact, post-licensing, with the nuclear environments conducive to genome synthesis. To infer this context-specific ORC interactome, I used data from genome-wide CRISPR fitness screens, a cell-wide proximity labeling study, and proteomic profiling of nascent DNA-associated proteins to identify 17 novel factors that genetically and proteomically interact with ORC subunits and genome replication. Unexpectedly, the candidate pool was significantly enriched for factors involved in the homeostasis of RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) transcripts, particularly 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). Follow-up protein-protein structure predictions by AlphaFold 3 (AF3) proposed direct interactions between ORC subunits and Pol III transcript biogenesis factors, as well as epigenetic regulators and a cyclin-dependent kinase. Given the prominence of 5S rRNA and tRNA biogenesis factors in my results, and prior reports of ORC subunits binding RNA, I also used protein-RNA structure prediction to identify candidate ORC3 interactions with 5S rRNA and tRNA. Altogether, my analysis integrates biological process, molecular proximity in human cells, and structural prediction to nominate novel protein and RNA interactions for involvement in the human replication program.

At 15 days post-initiation of micropropagation (dpim) from axillary buds, the explants treated with 0.5 and 1 [mu]M TDZ showed a greater number of shoots per explant and larger foliar area, compared to those treated with any concentration of BAP. However, by 30 dpim, explants treated with BAP showed an improved performance, reaching shoot numbers and foliar area values similar to those observed with TDZ. It is worth mentioning that no differences were observed in the shoot length at all concentrations analyzed for both hormones. Likewise, the explants grown in 2.5 [mu]M TDZ showed greater callus production and vitrification. The effects of supplementation with the hormone gibberellin (7 [mu]M) or exposure of the shoots to red light were also evaluated. The results indicated that combining these treatments with BAP at 0.5 and 1 [mu]M significantly enhanced shoot elongation compared to combinations with TDZ at the same concentrations. On the other hand, in vitro rooting was unsuccessful. However, direct rooting in soil was observed, and root length was further enhanced when shoots were pretreated with 2.5 [mu]M IBA. The CBD/[Delta]9-THC ratio remained stable between donor and micropropagated plants, supporting the development of standardized micropropagation protocols. Our results confirm that clonal micropropagation is a reliable method to preserve cannabinoid profiles in C. sativa.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

A wide range of wood anatomical traits was assessed to disentangle the effects of masting and drought. We used multivariate regression and developed a random forest model to evaluate the predictive power of these traits compared to tree ring width alone. 3) Results suggested a complex mechanism of carbon reallocation towards reproduction, while reflecting a compensatory strategy to maintain hydraulic function and mechanical stability under resource-constrained conditions. Number of parenchyma cells, vessel density, and lignin content estimates emerged as key predictors for masting, outperforming tree-ring width in capturing the reproductive signal. 4) Our findings establish a novel link between wood anatomy and masting events, demonstrating that quantitative wood anatomical traits offer a more accurate and ecologically relevant approach for reconstructing past masting dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The plastoglobule lipid droplets of chloroplasts, present in all photosynthetic organisms, are suggested to be a major orchestrator of adaptive responses to environmental perturbations, thus representing a potentially significant, untapped target for enhancement of crop resilience. Yet, the functions of plastoglobules are unclear and their molecular composition incompletely described. Here, we provide a thorough investigation of the protein and lipid compositions of plastoglobules and thylakoids at six time-points over the course of a water-deficit and recovery treatment in B73 inbred maize. Our results establish the prominent components of the plastoglobule polar lipid surface and neutral lipid interior in an important crop species, including the presence of mono- and di-galactosyl diacylglycerol lipids enriched in saturated acyl groups, and the prevalence of various triacylglycerols and plastoquinone-9 derivatives. Quantitative proteomics identifies prominent Fibrillins and Activity of bc1 Complex Kinases at the plastoglobule as well as many proteins with known or putative roles in prenyl-lipid and redox metabolism. A remarkably high proportion of the Fibrillin 4 on the plastoglobules coincided with a preponderance of plastoquinone-9, supporting a role for Fibrillin 4 in plastoquinone accumulation at plastoglobules.

However, in many Ethiopian schools, attitudes toward science are often overlooked, and traditional teacher-centered instruction combined with limited resources hampers their development. To address these issues this study examined the effect of guided inquiry-based laboratory experiments enriched instruction (GIBLEI) on secondary school students' attitudes toward biology, using a quasi-experimental design with pretest-treatment-posttest phases. Two classes from selected schools were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG, N=46) and a control group (CG, N=29). Over eight weeks, the EG received GIBLEI, while the CG experienced traditional laboratory experiments enriched instruction (TLEI). Attitudes were measured using a 5-point Likert scale. The results showed that GIBLEI significantly improved students' overall attitude towards biology, enthusiasm for biology, perception of biology as a course, and understanding of biology as a process, compared to TLEI. However, it did not affect their views of biology as a career. GIBLEI also promoted gender inclusivity by reducing attitude differences between male and female students. These findings highlight the benefits of GIBLEI in fostering positive attitudes, engagement, and inclusivity in biology education, enhancing both student outcomes and equity in science learning.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Although amyloidosis and aggregation of the 42-amino acid amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42) have long been considered pathogenic triggers for AD, clinical evidence linking high levels of A{beta}42 with normal cognition challenges this hypothesis. To resolve this conundrum on the role of A{beta}42 in regulating synaptic activity, we used an adeno-associated viral vector approach that triggers extracellular accumulation of A{beta}42 and spatial memory impairment. We show that A{beta}42 leads to an early increase in excitatory and proximal inhibitory synaptic transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and an increased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in these cells. A{beta}42 accumulation does not cause early cognitive deficits unless accompanied by an increased neuronal GLT-1 expression, suggesting this transporter is a critical mediator of A{beta}42 s effects.

Conserved storage organelles, acidocalcisomes, provide this buffering function. We used acidocalcisome-like yeast vacuoles to study how such organelles are set up to for this task. Our combined in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that their ATP-driven polyphosphate polymerase VTC converts cytosolic Pi into inorganic polyphosphates (polyP), which it transfers into the vacuole lumen. Luminal polyphosphatases immediately hydrolyse this polyP to establish a growing reservoir of vacuolar Pi. Product inhibition by this Pi pool silences the polyphosphatases, caps Pi accumulation, and favours vacuolar polyP storage. Upon cytosolic Pi scarcity, the declining inositol pyrophosphate levels activate the vacuolar Pi exporter Pho91 to replenish cytosolic Pi. In this way, acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-regulated buffering system for cytosolic Pi, which the cells can switch between Pi accumulation, Pi release, and high-capacity phosphate storage through polyP.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Using microscopy-based screens, we monitored NVJ remodeling in response to glucose availability. We identified Pex31, Nsg1, Nsg2, Shr5, and Tcb1 as NVJ residents. Glucose starvation typically results in an expansion of the NVJ size and proteome. Pex31 shows an atypical behavior, being specifically enriched at the NVJ at high glucose conditions. Loss of Pex31 uncouples NVJ remodeling from glucose availability, resulting in recruitment of glucose starvation-specific residents and NVJ expansion at glucose replete conditions. Moreover, PEX31 deletion results in alterations of sterol ester storage and a remodeling of vacuolar membranes that phenocopy glucose starvation responses.

In yeast, the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) expands during glucose starvation through the recruitment of stress-specific proteins, but the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance remained unclear. Here, we identify the yeast INSIG homologs Nsg1, Nsg2, along with the aspartyl protease Ypf1 as glucose starvation-specific NVJ-localized factors. Ypf1 promotes the recruitment of INSIG proteins and the HMG-CoA reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2 to the NVJ, likely in response to nuclear membrane remodeling induced by changes in very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. We further demonstrate that this membrane remodeling destabilizes Nsg1, promoting the NVJ localization and activation of Hmg1, while stabilizing Nsg2, which counteracts Hmg1 activation. These findings reveal that Nsg1 and Nsg2, previously known as regulators of Hmg2 stability, also act as negative regulators of Hmg1. Based on these results, we propose a model in which VLCFAs modulate the physical properties of the nuclear membrane, enabling cells to sense glucose starvation and regulate sterol metabolism during glucose starvation.

To evaluate the potential of secretome profiling for non-invasive embryo assessment, we applied state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to analyze the protein composition of SCM from individual successful and unsuccessful human embryo cultures, alongside corresponding controls cultured under identical conditions. Surprisingly, both untargeted (nanoLC-TIMS-TOF-MS/MS) and targeted (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) proteomic analyses consistently detected multiple human proteins in unconditioned media, indicating that these signals are not of embryonic origin. Undeclared proteins were also identified in media sampled before their first use, with considerable variability observed across production batches. Supplementation experiments demonstrated that this variability originates from the addition of plasma-derived human serum albumin, which introduces a range of contaminating proteins. In contrast, recombinant albumin did not contribute detectable serum proteins. These findings indicate that the protein background in commercial IVF media is an overlooked variable, not only compromising the reproducibility and interpretation of secretome analyses in research, but also contributing to unstandardized culture conditions in clinical IVF practice. While this study evaluated 13 production lots of monophasic media from two different manufacturers, the results underscore a broader need for transparency and standardization in IVF media composition. The adoption of fully chemically defined IVF media, free from purified serum components, would support more consistent embryo culture conditions and advance the discovery of biomarkers in SCM.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used proteomics and super-resolution microscopy to explore the role of energetics and T-tubule cellular remodelling in response to ResPHRV pacing in an ischaemic ovine model of heart failure (HF). After 2 weeks of RespHRV pacing, cardiac output improved by 1.1 {+/-} 0.2 L/min (**p=0.003). Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) was used to probe differences between three groups: HF without any intervention, HF with RespHRV pacing and a healthy control group. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) discriminant analysis demonstrated a clear separation of all three groups by T score (***p<0.001) with the HF+RespHRV pacing group placed intermediate between the HF and control groups. The top 50 proteins negatively correlated with T score (down in HF, restored after RespHRV) were dominated by mitochondrial proteins, as confirmed by Pathway Enrichment Analysis (***p<0.001). Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS) analysis confirmed this finding in selected targets (ACAA2, ACADS, CRAT, NDUFA8, and SUCLG1, *p<0.05). STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy identified a disruption of mitochondria structure in HF (*p<0.05) that was restored in the HF+R group (p=0.051). The area of mitochondria labelling was increased in the HF+RespHRV group compared to HF (**p=0.005). Many cytoskeletal proteins linked to mitochondria regulation and T-tubule remodelling were upregulated in HF and were reduced by RespHRV. MRM-MS was able to confirm these findings for selected targets (ANAXA2, CAVIN2, SPTBN1, TUBA4A). STED microscopy of collagen VI and the ryanodine receptor revealed cellular hypertrophy and remodelling of the T-tubules and cardiac junctions in HF sheep (*p<0.05), RespHRV showed a trend for reversing these structural changes.

Qualitative observations identified skewed microtubules in the twining stem of Ipomoea nil vine, suggesting parallels with Arabidopsis studies. To further investigate organ chirality in twining plants, we used common bean vine (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to examine the relationship between microtubule orientation, cell morphogenesis, and the right-handed twining phenotype via immunolabeling techniques. Here, we report a transition from mixed microtubules orientations in emergent and elongating internodes to a predominance of longitudinal microtubules in straight and twined stem segments post-elongation. Additionally, we report a distinction in epidermal cell shapes, where the straight portions of the stem consist of lobes with rectangular cells and furrows comprised of round cells, while the twined portions are comprised of cells that are relatively more rectangular and stretched. We propose that these orientations reflect dynamic microtubule responses to external stimuli and growth cues, such as tensile stresses from climbing or tissue expansion.

In this work, we developed a new model for PCP using the Cellular Potts modelling framework to investigate the conditions under which global tissue orientation can be achieved without a tissue spanning morphogen.

Fibulin-5 (Fbln5) is a multifunctional ECM protein essential for forming elastic fibers and regulating cellular functions by binding to integrins. While fibulin-5 expression decreases with age in human skin, the functional implications of this decrease, particularly in epidermal stem cell regulation, have remained largely unexplored. Here, we find that the knocking out of Fbln5 in mice results in early impairments of epidermal stem cell properties, similar to the chronological aging of the skin. The Fbln5 deficiency suppresses the expression of integrins and other cell junction proteins, leading to the inactivation of YAP signaling in epidermal stem cells. This reduction in YAP signaling results in the downregulation of the fast-cycling epidermal stem cell marker SLC1A3 in human skin and primary keratinocytes. These results suggest that, in addition to its known function in elastic fiber formation, fibulin-5 also plays a critical role in regulating the balance of epidermal stem cell populations during skin aging and coordinating the crosstalk between the extracellular environment and intracellular signaling.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

This protein is highly conserved, with versions from zebrafish and humans able to rescue yeast. All fish also have an additional eIF4E family, called eif4e1c, which is crucial for heart regeneration. Deletion of eif4e1c leads to growth defects and impaired heart regeneration, but it's unclear if similar effects occur when canonical translation mechanisms are disrupted. In this study, we deleted the two zebrafish paralogs of eIF4E, eif4ea and eif4eb. While individual deletions of these genes do not show the same phenotypes as eif4e1c deletion, compound mutants enhanced eif4e1c phenotypes, suggesting partial compensation by canonical eIF4E proteins in eif4e1c mutants. Surprisingly, unlike other eukaryotes, deleting both canonical mRNA cap-binding proteins did not result in lethality, and eif4e1c could fully compensate for eIF4E function. Although we anticipated that double mutants would regenerate hearts better since they contain eif4e1c alone, no improvement was observed in the double mutant. Interestingly, single deletions of eif4ea or eif4eb did improve heart regeneration. This supports a model where the balance between the eif4e1c and canonical pathways is crucial for stimulating heart regeneration.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Central Alberta, Canada, sees a diverse array of native and migratory species each year. A previous snail-trematode survey conducted at six lakes in central Alberta from 2013-2015 uncovered 79 trematode species. However, analyses suggested that additional species remained to be uncovered. To build on this baseline, we conducted further snail-trematode collections from 2019 to 2022 at eight reclaimed wetland sites in various stages of reclamation, along with one established lake in Alberta. Across the nine sites, we collected 22,397 snails, of which 1,981 were infected with digenean trematodes. We also documented broader biodiversity at these sites using traditional survey techniques. Through DNA barcoding, we identified 74 trematode species infecting five snail species. Among these were 23 trematode species not previously reported in central Alberta and nine putative novel species. In addition, we observed several previously unreported snail-trematode interactions. While trematode richness did not vary significantly with the wetland reclamation stage, host identity did influence richness: Physa gyrina hosted significantly more trematode species than Planorbella trivolvis. When combined with data from the earlier survey, sample completeness analyses indicate that we captured 100% of the dominant species and 99% of the typical species, but only 63% of the overall species diversity in central Alberta. These findings underscore that trematode diversity in central Alberta remains underestimated and highlight the continued value of long-term and host-inclusive sampling efforts.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, high-quality data is required for the study of degraded, chemically modified ancient proteomes. Protein contamination may hinder acquisition of such data, due to the abundance and better preservation of modern contaminating proteins. Here, we artificially contaminate a Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros tooth in order to investigate decontamination of archaeological dental enamel. We find that although the contaminating proteins are not identified, likely due to a lack of denaturation and digestion steps in archaeological dental enamel protein extraction protocols, contamination leads to significant loss of endogenous proteomic information. We thereafter compare five published decontamination methods, and find that a simple water or bleach wash prior to demineralization is most efficient at removing protein contamination. The water wash does not affect the endogenous proteome, while a bleach wash may lead to a loss of shorter intercrystalline peptides. We therefore conclude that decontamination is necessary in the study of ancient dental enamel, to ensure maximal retrieval of endogenous proteomic information, and can easily be achieved by incorporating a water or bleach wash step into the protein extraction protocol.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Sec is inserted by co-translational recoding of the UGA codon, normally a stop, so that specialized methods are required for selenoprotein bioinformatics. Here, we present a refined characterization of the composition and evolution of the vertebrate selenoproteome. Based on analyses of 19 gene families across hundreds of genomes, we show that extant selenoproteomes were shaped by extensive gene duplications (53), losses (41), and Sec-to-cysteine (Cys) conversions (19). Tetrapods including mammals encode 24-25 selenoproteins, with variations in 6 families. Notably, the same genes underwent convergent evolutionary events in multiple tetrapods, namely Sec-to-Cys substitutions (SELENOU1, GPX6) and gene losses (SELENOV). In contrast, ray-finned fish exhibit larger and more dynamic selenoproteomes, reinforcing the hypothesis that the selective advantage of Sec is stronger in aquatic environments. We detected selenoprotein duplications spread across the actinopterygian clade involving 13 families, mainly involved in antioxidant defense. The richest selenoproteomes were found in Salmoninae and Cyprinoidei fish with 55 and 45 selenoproteins, respectively, owing to whole genome duplications. Among our findings, the SELENOP family stands out in lampreys, carrying up to an unprecedented 162 UGAs putatively recoded to Sec.

Existing population genetic methods like EEMS and FEEMS summarize gene flow using effective equilibrium migration rates that are assumed to be symmetric, providing representations of underlying structure that have proven useful, but that fall short of representing signatures of asymmetric gene flow. More elaborate methods capable of inferring asymmetric gene flow exist, but are computationally intensive, restricting analyses to small sets of sub-populations (demes). Here, we introduce FRAME (Fine-Resolution Asymmetric Migration Estimation), a method that significantly reduces the computational burden of estimating asymmetric gene flow. This efficiency allows FRAME to infer asymmetric migration patterns for scenarios with a large number of demes, enabling fine-scale analyses. Under the assumed model and its equilibrium condition, FRAME's estimates can be interpreted as backward migration rates; in non-equilibrium conditions, FRAME detects and summarizes asymmetries in gene flow with effective equilibrium migration rates, which allows a richer representation of genetic structure. We assess the method using a variety of simulated histories of gene flow and apply the method to datasets from North American gray wolves, poplar trees, white-crowned manakin, and human archaeogenetic samples.

We previously used a transcriptomics-based computational drug repositioning pipeline to analyze public bulk transcriptomic data and identified several drug candidates. Fenoprofen, our top in silico candidate, was validated in a rat model. Building on this, we now evaluate two additional candidates, simvastatin (a cholesterol-lowering drug) and primaquine (an antimalarial), based on strong gene expression reversal scores and favorable safety profiles. Using a validated rat model of endometriosis and pain, we conducted behavioral testing, bulk RNA sequencing, and differential expression analysis to assess their therapeutic potential. Results: Of 299 drugs identified computationally, simvastatin and primaquine ranked highly for reversing gene expression signatures associated with endometriosis. In vivo validation using a rat model of endometriosis demonstrated that both drugs significantly reduced vaginal hyperalgesia, a surrogate marker of endometriosis-associated pain. RNA-seq of uteri and lesions confirmed reversal of disease-associated gene expression signatures following treatment. Conclusion: Simvastatin and primaquine attenuated pain behaviors and reversed endometriosis-related gene expression changes in an animal model.

Beneficial plant-microbe associations are increasingly recognized for their role in mitigating abiotic stress, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying microbially-conferred thermotolerance remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a population-based assay using Sphagnum peat mosses, a key species in peatland ecosystems that sequester 33 to 50% of the worlds soil carbon as recalcitrant peat, to perform microbiome transfers and assess microbial contributions to heat resilience. Strain based assays in Sphagnum and Arabidopsis identified Variovorax as a key thermotolerance-enhancing microbe and identified ECM29, a proteasome-associated protein, as critical for this interaction. In Arabidopsis, Variovorax sp. CF313 association led to ECM29 preferentially binding the RPT1 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle, inhibiting 20S proteasome gate opening and slightly reducing proteasomal activity. This results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and induces HSP70 transcription, priming the host for heat shock stress even in the absence of prior heat exposure. These findings establish ECM29 as a key regulator of proteasome activity in response to microbial interactions, highlighting a previously unknown mechanism by which microbes enhance plant thermotolerance.

E.; Swaminathan, K.; Marshall-Colon, A.", "abstract": "Background: Sorghum bicolor is a deep-rooted, heat- and drought-tolerant crop that thrives on marginal lands and is increasingly valued for its applications in biofuel, bioenergy, and biopolymer production. The sorghum stem, which can reach 4-5 meters in length, serves as the primary reservoir of both lignocellulosic biomass and soluble sugars, making it a promising bioenergy feedstock. Although recent advances in genetic, genomic, and transcriptomic resources have improved our understanding of sorghum biology, comprehensive genome-wide analyses of functional dynamics across diverse organ types and developmental stages remain limited. In particular, candidate genes with stem preferred expression pattern or their associated cis-regulatory elements, which may program key stem-related functions and enable organ- or tissue-specific engineering, have not yet been identified. Results: To address these gaps, we reanalyzed a published RNA-seq dataset to identify genes with organ-preferential expression and to infer representative organ functions across major developmental stages. Our analysis revealed that the sorghum stem exhibits distinct temporal functional signatures, which correlate with the developmental dynamics of stem-specific genes and their associated regulatory elements. We further identified a set of genes with ubiquitous stem-specific expression across diverse sorghum genotypes, suggesting their universal importance and broad potential for genetic engineering applications. Among them, SbTALE03 and SbTALE04 emerged as stem hub transcription factors (TF). Both genes were empirically validated for their stem specificity across stages. Gene regulatory network analysis further indicated that these TFs participate in stage-specific transcriptional programs that maintain and regulate stem development. Conclusions: This study presents a genome-wide analysis of organ-specific gene expression, functions, and regulatory networks in sorghum, with a focus on genes preferentially-expressed in stems and their promoter motifs. We identified a set of core stem-specific genes with ubiquitous expression across genotypes and developmental stages, including two experimentally validated transcription factors with potential roles in stem development.

Transient transfection with a luciferase reporter using the particle bombardment method has been used for bioluminescence observations at the single- cell level. This allows for capturing heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in cellular gene expression. We developed a novel CRISPR/Cas9-induced restoration of bioluminescence reporter system, CiRBS, to monitor cellular bioluminescence from a reporter gene in the genome of transgenic Arabidopsis. In this method, the enzymatic activity of an inactive luciferase mutant, LUC40Ins26bp, which has a 26-bp insertion at the 40th codon, was restored by introducing an indel at the insertion site using CRISPR/Cas9. We succeeded in long-term monitoring of the cellular bioluminescence of Arabidopsis plants expressing LUC40Ins26bp, which was restored by transient transfection with CRISPR/Cas9-inducible constructs using particle bombardment. Recombination events via indels were mostly complete within 24 h of CRISPR/Cas9 induction, and 7.2% of CRISPR/Cas9-transfected cells restored bioluminescence. It was estimated that 94% of the bioluminescence-restored cells carried only one chromosome having the optimal recombination construction.

Foliar temperature is further elevated when transpiration is inhibited, but NPQ is not increased. Surprisingly, during generic photosynthetic electron transport and NPQ partial inhibition, foliar temperature under EAE was reduced considerably. Our findings emphasize the importance of mutual co-regulation of photosynthetic electron transport, NPQ, and transpiration in foliar temperature regulation and suggest that overall heat emission from forest ecosystems may conditionally vary on a terawatt (TW) scale per 1,000,000 km-2.

A.; Roda, F.; Farnitano, M.; Hale, C.; Serrato-Capuchina, A.; Hopkins, R.", "abstract": "Flowering plants display extensive variation in selfing rate, a trait with significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. Many species use genetic mechanisms to recognize and reject self-pollen (termed self-incompatibility or SI), and the loss of SI is one of the most common evolutionary transitions among flowering plants. Despite the ubiquity of transitions to self-compatibility (SC), little is known about the genetic architecture through which SC evolves. Specifically, it is important to determine if SC has a polygenic or simple genetic basis and if variation in compatibility localizes to the genomic locus causing self-pollen recognition (the S-locus). Phlox drummondii (Polemoniaceae) has been a model system for exploring mating system evolution and expresses extensive range-wide variation in the SI response. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of SC variants segregating within this otherwise SI species. Using multiple independent crosses, we uncover numerous QTLs associated with intraspecific variation in SI, consistent with a polygenic genetic architecture. While some QTLs overlap across mapping experiments, other QTLs are unique, suggesting that multiple genetic routes to SC exist. Through these crossing experiments, we demonstrate that P. drummondii has a sporophytic SI system, suggesting that an independent evolution of SI occurred in the lineage containing Phlox. We map this novel S-locus and find that the genomic region containing the S-locus is associated with intraspecific variation in SI in one of the three mapping populations. Although further work is necessary to clarify the conditions under which quantitative variation in SI represents a transitional pathway to complete SC, our study reveals the underlying genetic architecture upon which selection could act to drive this frequent and evolutionarily significant transition.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used representational similarity analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) data to explore how the brain processes the perceptual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions of object knowledge over time. Using human similarity judgments of 190 naturalistic object concepts presented as either as images or words, we constructed separate behavioural models of objects' perceptual, conceptual, and contextual properties. We correlated these models with neural patterns from two EEG datasets, one publicly available and one newly collected, both recorded while participants passively viewed the same object stimuli. Across both datasets, we found that perceptual features dominated the early EEG response to object images, while conceptual features emerged later. Contextual associations were also reflected in neural patterns, but their explanatory power largely overlapped with that of conceptual models, suggesting limited unique representation of objects' contextual attributes under passive viewing conditions. These results highlight the brain's integration of perceptual and conceptual information when processing visual objects.

Sustaining such recreation requires strategies that effectively balance ecosystem conservation with tourism promotion. A crucial component of this balance involves understanding which landscapes and species attract visitors. However, identifying these charismatic sites and species has traditionally relied on costly and spatially limited questionnaire surveys. In this study, we propose a simple and scalable method to infer nature-based recreation sites and species that appeal to visitors using crowdsourced biodiversity observation data. Focusing on Inabe City, a rural Japanese municipality with high recreational visitation, we analysed 12,764 observations from iNaturalist and Biome platforms, alongside 238,625 observations from other areas in Japan. We developed an index to estimate observer residency based on the proportion of observation days within the city, which was validated through questionnaire data. Spatial analyses revealed clear differences between presumed residents and visitors: while both groups used recreational facilities, residents were more active in lowland forests, and visitors were attracted to wetlands and mountain habitats. Visitors also disproportionately recorded dragonflies and understory endangered plants compared to observations made outside the city, suggesting that these species contribute strongly to the area's recreational appeal. While the popularity of green infrastructure and rare or endemic species was expected, several unexpected parks and aquatic insects also emerged as key attractions. These insights highlight the importance of conserving highland forests and wetlands to support biodiversity and tourism.

We examined the accessibility of telomeric overhangs capable of forming one to six GQs to a short complementary peptide nucleic acid (PNA) imager probe under molecular crowding conditions. These conditions were simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules of two different molecular weights: 200 Da (PEG-200) and 6000 Da (PEG-6000). Our results reveal a systematic reduction in the overhang accessibility with increasing PEG concentration, showing approximately a 3-fold reduction at 30% (v/v) PEG-200 and an 8-fold reduction at 30% PEG-6000. We also observed a progressive compaction of the overhang as PEG concentration increased, suggesting molecular crowding promotes architectural condensation, thereby reducing probe accessibility. These findings offer new insights into how the crowded cellular environment may compact telomeric overhangs and modulate their structural and functional properties.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

L.; Scha\u0308fer, L. V.", "abstract": "Rotational diffusion is a fundamental physical process that determines the rotational motion of proteins in solution. It plays a role, for example, in molecular association processes and in theories of spectroscopic experiments in solution. In addition to experimental methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful method to investigate rotational diffusion. Thereby, diffusion models are fitted to rotational correlation functions extracted from the simulations. In this work, we conducted a time-dependent analysis of the model parameters prior to fitting, using extended all-atom MD simulations of ubiquitin as a model system. A comparison to Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations confirms whether the rotational dynamics observed in MD actually follow the theory of Brownian rigid-body diffusion. In addition, the analysis reveals correlation time intervals that are suitable for fitting anisotropic, semi-isotropic, or isotropic diffusion models. Therefore, we employ a two-step optimization scheme to combine a global and a local parameter space search. BD simulations are used to estimate uncertainties of the diffusion coefficients as well as directional uncertainties of the principal axes. We found that ubiquitin exhibits nearly semi-isotropic rotational dynamics, in good agreement with experimental NMR data. The approach is general and can be used to investigate, for example, the rotational diffusion of molecules in various biomolecular environments, or to compute NMR relaxation parameters of proteins.

Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) contribute to virulence by mediating one-step secretion of unfolded substrates directly into the extracellular space, bypassing the periplasm. A well-studied example is the hemolysin A (HlyA) system, which secretes the HlyA toxin in an unfolded state across the inner and outer membranes. T1SS typically comprise a homodimeric ABC transporter (HlyB), a membrane fusion protein (HlyD), and the outer membrane protein TolC. Some ABC transporters in T1SS also contain N-terminal C39 peptidase or peptidase-like (CLD) domains implicated in substrate interaction. Recent cryo-EM studies have resolved the inner-membrane complex as a trimer of HlyB homodimers with associated HlyD protomers. However, a full structural model including TolC remains unavailable. We present the first complete structural model of the HlyA T1SS, constructed using template- and MSA-based information and validated by SAXS. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into the function of the CLD domains, which are partially absent from existing cryo-EM structures. These domains may modulate transport by stabilizing specific conformations of the complex. Simulations with a C-terminal fragment of HlyA indicate that toxin binding occurs in the occluded conformation of HlyB, potentially initiating substrate transport through a single HlyB protomer before transitioning to an inward-facing state. HlyA binding also induces allosteric effects on HlyD, altering key residues involved in TolC recruitment. These results indicate how substrate recognition and transport are coupled and may support the development of antimicrobial strategies targeting the T1SS.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here we continue this investigation by conducting broad-spectrum proteomic profiling of circulating white blood cells to assemble an empirical protein-protein interaction network associated with frequency of infectious exacerbation. In a novel extension of conventional cross-sectional data analyses, we translate these undirected protein-protein interactions into candidate regulatory relationships with both direction and mode of action. The latter are inferred by formulating and solving a constraint satisfaction problem (SAT) whereby predicted dynamic behaviors of any valid regulatory network must support the expected persistent nature of low and high vulnerability phenotypes. Solving this SAT problem produced a set of competing candidate protein regulatory network architectures and signalling rules that unanimously highlighted several novel candidate pathway elements involved in oxidative stress response. Analysis of the overall dynamics supported by these networks, again supported the hypothesis that progression beyond an immune tipping point may confer persistent susceptibility to infection and that this may constitute a stable phenotype or regulatory trap in COPD characterized by a reactive oxygen cascade.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

EVs show promise as neurological disease biomarkers due to their molecular makeup reflecting their parent-cell composition signature and due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. To-date, the vast majority of research in this field has explored the protein profiles of EVs; however, lipids play an important role not only in the formation of EVs, but also in mediating cellular function and the pathological progression of many neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we take a critical first step in determining the potential utility of EV lipids as biomarkers in neurological disease. In vitro we exposed BV-2 microglia to either control media or media containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a known pro-inflammatory stimulus, for 24 hours then isolated both the cells and their EVs and performed LC-MS/MS. For the first time, we reveal distinct lipidomic changes can differentiate resting vs. pro-inflammatory microglia and their EVs, while distinct lipids are preserved between EVs and their parent cell. Moreover, we add to current literature by demonstrating acute pro-inflammatory activation of microglia results in the activation and suppression of distinct lipidomic pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that analysis of lipid-based relationships between parent cells and their EVs may be a useful tool to infer cellular function. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that lipidomic analysis can not only differentiate the functional state of cells in vitro but can also differentiate their EVs. We lay the first brick in a foundation to support future research into EV lipids as novel and exciting biomarker candidates in neurological disease.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Underscoring the urgent need for more effective vaccination strategies. However, clinical trials targeting the Mtb Ag85 complex proteins as nucleic acid vaccines have failed to confer protective immunity. We hypothesized that the glycosylation of Mtb immunogens expressed in mammalian hosts as a post-translational modification impairs their immunogenicity and antigenicity.

A central question in this context is whether allostery, where the binding of a molecule at one site affects the activity of a distant site, emerges as a further manifestation of the intricate interplay between structure, function, and intrinsic dynamics. This study explores how allosteric regulation is modified when intrinsic protein dynamics operate under out-of-equilibrium conditions. To this purpose, we introduce a simple nonequilibrium model of protein dynamics, inspired by active matter systems, by generalizing the widely employed Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to incorporate non-thermal effects. Our approach underscores the advantage of framing allostery as a causal process by using, as a benchmark system, the second PDZ domain of the human phosphatase hPTP1E that mediates protein-protein interactions. We employ causal indicators, such as response functions and transfer entropy, to identify the network of PDZ2 residues through which the allosteric signal propagates across the protein structure. These indicators reveal specific regions that align well with experimental observations. Furthermore, our results suggest that deviations from purely thermal fluctuations can significantly influence allosteric communication by introducing distinct timescales and memory effects. This influence is particularly relevant when the allosteric response unfolds on timescales incompatible with relaxation to equilibrium. Accordingly, non-thermal fluctuations may become essential for accurately describing protein responses to ligand binding and developing a comprehensive understanding of allosteric regulation.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG), play a critical role in modulating antibody function. This study investigates the association between IgG glycosylation profiles and the risk and severity of AMR in KT recipients. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 65 KT patients, including 26 with acute AMR (aAMR), 27 with chronic-active AMR (caAMR), and 12 controls without rejection. IgG glycosylation was quantified using lectin-based ELISA, focusing on mannose, fucose, sialic acid, and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) levels. Results: Results showed that bisecting GlcNAc levels of total IgG were significantly higher in caAMR patients than controls (p=0.019) and aAMR patients (p=0.045). Multivariable analysis revealed that higher bisecting GlcNAc levels of IgG were independently associated with glomerulitis [g-score, OR: 2.7 (95%CI: 1.2-6.7), p=0.019] and chronic glomerulopathy [cg-score, OR: 2.8 (95%CI: 1.3-7.5), p=0.021], independent of DSA presence.

More than 30% of targets, particularly antibody-antigen targets, were highly challenging, with each group correctly predicting structures for only about a quarter of such targets. Most CASP16 groups relied on AlphaFold-Multimer (AFM) or AlphaFold3 (AF3) as their core modeling engines. By optimizing input MSAs, refining modeling constructs (using partial rather than full sequences), and employing massive model sampling and selection, top-performing groups were able to significantly outperform the default AFM/AF3 predictions. CASP16 also introduced two additional challenges: Phase 0, which required predictions without stoichiometry information, and Phase 2, which provided participants with thousands of models generated by MassiveFold (MF) to enable large-scale sampling for resource-limited groups. Across all phases, the MULTICOM series and Kiharalab emerged as top performers based on the quality of their best models per target. However, these groups did not have a strong advantage in model ranking, and thus their lead over other teams, such as Yang-Multimer and kozakovvajda, was less pronounced when evaluating only the first submitted models. Compared to CASP15, CASP16 showed moderate overall improvement, likely driven by the release of AF3 and the extensive model sampling employed by top groups. Several notable trends highlight key frontiers for future development. First, the kozakovvajda group significantly outperformed others on antibody-antigen targets, achieving over a 60% success rate without relying on AFM or AF3 as their primary modeling framework, suggesting that alternative approaches may offer promising solutions for these difficult targets. Second, model ranking and selection continue to be major bottlenecks. The PEZYFoldings group demonstrated a notable advantage in selecting their best models as first models, suggesting that their pipeline for model ranking may offer important insights for the field. Finally, the Phase 0 experiment indicated reasonable success in stoichiometry prediction; however, stoichiometry prediction remains challenging for high-order assemblies and targets that differ from available homologous templates. Overall, CASP16 demonstrated steady progress in multimer prediction while emphasizing the urgent need for more effective model ranking strategies, improved stoichiometry prediction, and the development of new modeling methods that extend beyond the current AF-based paradigm.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

NOD2 signaling can be modulated by disruption of the chlamydial amidase enzyme, AmiACT, interrupting the microbe?s developmental cycle, and inducing RB lysis with inhibitors of lipooligosaccharide or peptidoglycan biosynthesis / assembly. These results mirror prior observations with Chlamydia-induced TLR9 signaling, leading us to hypothesize that Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling results from RB lytic events that occur sporadically during the RB to EB transition. Given our finding that pre-treating cells with NOD2-stimulatory ligands reduces chlamydial inclusion size, we hypothesize that the microbe preferentially degrades its PG during development to reduce the generation of NOD2 ligands, at the cost of enhancing NOD1 signaling.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Our analysis revealed multiple introductions of viral strains, which were marked by significant genomic changes over time. Algeria-specific mutations were identified, providing insights into regional adaptations and evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, a statistically significant recombination event was detected using the RDP 5 software. EPI_ISL_15920753 was recombinant, whereas EPI_ISL_15790700 and EPI_ISL_12156732 constituted the major and minor parents, respectively. Notably, haplotype analysis revealed 179 distinct haplotypes, including a highly connected node (H91) associated with a superspreading event later in the pandemic (July-September 2022), suggesting rapid transmission likely driven by mobile individuals and large gatherings.

Here, we identify ADAR1p110 as a chromatin-associated factor essential for mitotic chromosome segregation and cell viability. Depletion of ADAR1 caused metaphase arrest, DNA damage accumulation, and apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ADAR1p110 physically interacts with Structural Maintenance of Chromosome 3 (SMC3), a core component of the cohesin complex. Genome-wide DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (DIP-seq) showed that ADAR1p110 selectively binds centromeric -satellite DNA during mitosis, a finding validated by DNA immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction (DIP-qPCR). Complementary DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (DRIP-seq) revealed that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) are enriched in centromeric regions during mitosis and are further augmented by ADAR1 overexpression. We identified serine 614 (S614) as a key mitosis-specific phosphorylation site on ADAR1p110, and demonstrated that this post-translational modification is essential for its chromatin recruitment, stability, and mitotic function. Rescue experiments using phospho-mimetic mutants (S614D and 3xD) successfully restored mitotic progression in ADAR1-deficient cells, whereas non-phosphorylatable variants failed to do so. These results reveal that ADAR1p110 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and functions at the intersection of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. By coordinating R-loop recognition at centromeres with chromosome cohesion, ADAR1p110 safeguards genome integrity during mitosis. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized mechanism through which a canonical RNA-editing enzyme contributes to chromosomal dynamics independent of its deaminase activity.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

To drive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and achieve a precise deletion of most of the bantam locus, two guide RNAs targeting sites 90 base pairs apart were expressed in the germline using the UAS/GAL4 system. Thirty lethal and eight viable lines were established and analyzed. One lethal line exhibited the expected 90 bp deletion, while the others carried diverse indels at one or both cleavage sites. Among the viable lines, seven harbored a single-nucleotide deletion that did not disrupt bantam function. Notably, one viable line, band1-44, carried a hypomorphic allele that reduced organismal size without affecting viability. To generate precisely edited bantam variants, CRISPR-Cas9mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) was used using donor plasmids containing engineered mutations in the miRNA seed region, along with a scarless dsRED fluorescent marker. Approximately 40% of the resulting fluorescent lines were correctly edited, demonstrating the efficiency of this strategy for producing specific bantam variants. The remaining lines exhibited unexpected outcomes, among which partial HDR events, where the dsRED marker was integrated but not the bantam mutations, and full donor plasmid integrations, which led to duplication of the bantam locus. These findings reveal the complexity of CRISPR-Cas9 outcomes, emphasizing the need for thorough screening and characterization of individual candidates in gene-editing experiments.

Despite this, few studies have directly studied the mechanisms governing this process. To address this, we developed a tunable in vitro model of extracellular matrix microdamage in live tendon explants that enables us to track both clearance of denatured collagen microdamage and closure of a micro-sized defect in the tendon matrix. The purpose of this study was to controllably induce varying levels of localized microdamage to the tendon explants and identify (1) if thresholds for healing exist and (2) whether repair mechanisms are dependent on initial damage size. We found that within three weeks, all tendon explants were able to clear damaged matrix to some extent regardless of the damage size. Interestingly, larger 5 mJ and 10 mJ injuries resulted in a more robust rate of damaged matrix clearance in the later weeks, while smaller injuries exhibited a more consistent rate that led to full clearance in two explants. Greater than 50% clearance of denatured collagen microdamage was typically associated with an accompanying closure of the ECM defect, suggesting a strong relationship between clearance and closure. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of our laser-induced microdamage model, which enables the direct visualization of microdamage responses. This model will be a powerful asset for investigating mechanisms of damage accumulation and/or healing, as well as identifying local tendon-specific factors that can be leveraged for therapeutics.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated resistance to gentamicin, carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. Whole genome sequencing of this strain detected a 3.74 Mb genome with 32.8% GC content containing 3,780 coding genes.

Both free-stall and tie-stall housing systems were eligible. Manure samples from dry and lactating cows were obtained. Then, approximately 20g of fecal samples from each group were pooled. DNA extractions on all subsamples were performed using the Qiagen PowerMax Soil Kit and submitted for 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Operational taxonomic units were determined, and four alpha diversity indices were computed. A total of 128 and 132 manure samples from pos and prepartum cows, respectively, were analyzed. Mixed-effects random slope models were employed, incorporating herd-level random effects to estimate the correlation among individual samples and between individual and pooled samples.

While DNA sequencing have enabled the accurate diagnosis of certain disorders, such as the genetic origin of ALPS (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome), other causes of lymphadenopathy such as benign sinus histiocytosis, or Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), cannot be diagnosed with current technologies. Likewise, several modes of infection, including Toxoplasmosis gondii, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch disease) require further investigation.

M.", "abstract": "Nucleic acid-protein interactions are fundamental to many cellular processes, including genome stability and replication, and the regulation of gene expression. They rely on the formation of specific contacts between amino acid and nucleotide residues. Accurate detection and classification of these inter-residue contacts in both experimentally determined structures and computationally predicted models of nucleic acid-protein complexes are crucial for achieving a comprehensive, molecular-level understanding of nucleic acid-protein recognition mechanisms. Here, we present ClaPNAC, a classifier that annotates 3D structures of nucleic acid-protein complexes with pairwise contacts. It distinguishes stacking interactions (involving the faces of nucleobases), pseudo pairs (involving the Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen, or sugar edge of the base), and phosphate and ribose interactions on the nucleoside/nucleotide side, as well as side chain and backbone interactions on the amino acid side. ClaPNAC is based on a geometric approach, extending our previous method ClaRNA and uses a database of pre-classified doublets extracted from experimentally solved RNA-protein complex structures. Unlike other tools that focus on specific chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts, ClaPNAC relies on the geometry of the interacting residues. It is applicable to both RNA- and DNA-protein complexes, and it can also operate on isolated nucleosides/nucleotides and amino acids. It can be extended to support additional interaction types and higher-order spatial relationships. ClaPNAC constitutes a notable advancement in the characterization of amino acid-nucleotide interactions by providing a comprehensive classification framework that deepens our insight into these fundamental biological processes.

By exploiting disassembly-prone PCNA mutants, we reveal that Elg1-RLC uses its PCNA unloading activity to counter the DNA-alkylating agent methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS)-mediated slow progression of replication forks. Despite having a largely functional DNA Damage Response (DDR), the viability loss of elg1{Delta}-DDR double mutants, in the presence of MMS, matches that of mec1{Delta} and rad53{Delta} cells, deficient for the central checkpoint kinases. This suggests that elg1{Delta}-DDR double mutants experience replication fork collapse when exposed to MMS. Indeed, in response to MMS, accumulation of Rad52 foci in the replicative elg1{Delta}-DDR cells supports this possibility. However, the failure of rescuing elg1{Delta}-DDR mutants by elevating dNTP levels (by deleting the ribonucleotide reductase SML1) eliminates the possibility of a Rad53-regulated dNTP shortage-mediated fork collapse. Thus, we propose a S-phase checkpoint regulatory role of Elg1-RLC that works through a noncanonical pathway parallel to the canonical one. Collectively, our findings suggest a model in which Elg1-RLC, by timely unloading chromatin-bound PCNA from the damaged/stalled forks, coordinates the DDR pathways to safeguard the integrity of replication forks under replication stress.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The resulting assembly resembles the yeast SET3 complex (SET3C) - a transcriptional regulator. Pathogenic missense mutations in TBLR1, ANKRD11 and SETD5 disrupt this assembly, and an engineered mutation that specifically abolishes SETD5 incorporation into SET3C causes severe developmental impairments in mice. Disruptions of mammalian SET3C components cause highly correlated changes in gene expression - including upregulation of already highly transcribed genes.

In host cells, Gag multimerizes, recruits host budding factors, and buds from the plasma membrane. Additionally, it binds to viral genomic RNA (vRNA) and facilitates its packaging into viral particles. However, the mechanisms regulating Gag-vRNA interactions remain poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that Gag ubiquitination influences viral infectivity. In this study, we elucidated a new mechanism by which Gag-vRNA interactions are regulated via Gag ubiquitination. Using an HIV-1-derived lentiviral vector system, we found that ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in antiviral responses, reduced the vRNA content in virions through its catalytic activity. USP8 deubiquitinates Gag, and mutations at the Gag ubiquitination sites similarly impair vRNA packaging. We hypothesized that Gag ubiquitination enhances its interaction with RNA-binding proteins, thereby facilitating Gag-vRNA binding. We focused on ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX), which interacts with Gag, ubiquitin, and RNA. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Gag ubiquitination promotes its interaction with ALIX, which in turn binds to vRNA. In ALIX knockout (KO) cells, both Gag-vRNA binding and vRNA packaging were reduced, confirming the role of ALIX in this process. Furthermore, the deubiquitinating activity of USP8 suppressed Gag-vRNA binding, and this effect was abolished by mutation of the Gag ubiquitination site or ALIX KO.

In this study, we analyzed CTCF-binding sites and the distribution of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 around them in human K562 cells, and investigated the spreading of these modifications following CTCF depletion. Genome-wide analysis revealed that certain CTCF-binding sites are located at the boundaries of chromatin domains enriched with H3K9me2 or H3K9me3. Upon loss of CTCF binding, both modifications spread to neighboring chromatin at over half of the boundaries delimiting highly and distinctly enriched domains. Boundaries where such spreading did not occur were flanked by chromatin in a more active state compared to those where spreading occurred. Gene transcription was significantly reduced in neighboring regions where H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 had spread. Further comprehensive analysis revealed that this transcriptional reduction was specifically associated with the spread of H3K9me2.

We demonstrate that DGCR8 restricts the accumulation of endogenous dsRNA originating from protein-coding mRNAs that harbour transposable elements (TEs), primarily Alu. We propose that DGCR8 binding to TE-rich mRNAs is essential to resolve dsRNA structures, and in its absence, accumulated dsRNA signals through the RIG-I-like signalling pathway triggering the IFN response. This mechanism is relevant to conditions where DGCR8 expression levels are altered, including the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS).

Here, we investigated virological features of the XEC variant. Epidemic dynamics modeling suggested that spike substitutions in XEC mainly contribute to its increased viral fitness. Additionally, four licensed antivirals were effective against XEC. Although the fusogenicity of XEC spike is comparable to that of the JN.1 spike, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XEC in hamsters was significantly higher than that of JN.1. Notably, we found that the nucleocapsid R204P mutation of XEC enhanced inflammation through NF-{kappa}B activation.

However, variations exist across species and cell types, including architectures with fewer (e.g., 3+0, 6+0) or more than nine doublet microtubules (e.g., 9+9+0, 9+9+3), reflecting diverse structural adaptations of cilia and flagella in eukaryotes. Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, relies on its single 9+2 flagellum to navigate through environments within the mammalian host and insect vector. Central to the T. brucei flagellum's function is a canonical central apparatus (CA), composed of C1 and C2 singlet microtubules, which regulates flagellar beating and ensures efficient movement. Despite its crucial mechanoregulatory role in flagellar beating, the molecular structure and interactions governing T. brucei CA assembly and function remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to uncover structural details of the T. brucei CA. We identified conserved and stably C1/C2-associated protein densities, including the armadillo repeat protein PF16, which serves as a structural scaffold critical for CA assembly and axonemal asymmetry. Our analysis also revealed pronounced molecular flexibility of the CA and uncovered T. brucei-specific densities, suggesting lineage-specific adaptations for parasite motility. These findings provide critical insights into the structural foundations of T. brucei motility. They also highlight potential therapeutic targets to disrupt the parasite's ability to cause disease, offering new avenues for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.

Supporting this observation, we identified components of the polymerase alpha and BTR complexes as interacting with the viral replication initiation protein (Rip) during DNA replication, suggesting a recombination-dependent mechanism of replication that uses host cell machinery to mediate dissolution of replication intermediates. Furthermore, we mapped a 92-bp minimal origin of replication sequence for the Betatorquevirus genus comprised of an AT-rich stretch and a portion of the GC-rich region.

B.", "abstract": "Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can cause long-term functional impairments, and repetitive mTBIs within a window of vulnerability can exacerbate these consequences compared to a single mTBI. However, current interventions for mTBI focus on alleviating symptoms, rather than targeting underlying mechanisms. Following the initial mechanical impact, increasing evidence suggests that the brain undergoes an inflammatory cascade consisting of pro-inflammatory intracellular signaling pathways and production of cytokines, ultimately leading to chronic neuroinflammation and persistent neurological deficits. Prior work in severe traumatic brain injury has shown that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is a key regulator of microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokines, and synaptic dysfunction, but its role in the context of mTBI remains unclear. As such, this study aimed to determine if inhibition of p38 MAPK would attenuate the inflammatory response and longer-term functional deficits following a weight-drop mouse model of repetitive mTBI. Methods: C57BL/6J male and female mice were injected with a small molecule p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB239063) after each of 5 once-daily weight-drop closed head injuries (CHIs) or sham injuries. Functional outcome was assessed at 4-weeks post injury. Protein and transcriptional alterations associated with the immune response, synaptic function, microglial phenotype, and functional outcomes were assessed at both 4-hours and 4-weeks after the final CHI. Results: In females, acute inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated i) cytokine expression and microglial reactivity at 4-hours post injury and ii) antidepressive-like behavior and synaptic loss at 4-weeks post injury. In males, p38 MAPK inhibition also attenuated microglial reactivity and up-regulation of specific cytokines, although changes in functional outcomes did not reach significance. Interestingly, bulk RNAseq analysis in both sexes showed that acute p38 MAPK inhibition both normalized the effects of injury and upregulated protective genes and pathways associated with recovery and maintenance of brain homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest a role for p38 MAPK in driving the acute and longer-term consequences post repetitive mTBI in a sex-dependent manner, and they suggest therapeutic potential of p38 MAPK inhibition. To our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate the effects of small molecule inhibitor SB239063 as a potential therapeutic treatment administrated following rmTBI.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The picornavirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, employs a type 2 IRES present in its 5UTR and requires 43S ribosomal preinitiation complex (PIC), the central domain of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G, eIF4A, and an essential ITAF (IRES trans-acting factor)-polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTB1) to form 48S PIC. In this study, we have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of EMCV IRES-bound mammalian 48S PIC in a scanning-arrested closed state at the start codon. The EMCV IRES domains contacts initiator tRNA (tRNAi) and 40S head at the inter-subunit interface, which reveals an altogether unique mechanism used by viruses to capture host translational machinery for its protein synthesis. The tRNAi is held away from the 40S body in contrast to canonical cap-dependent translation while the domain I apical region of EMCV IRES mimics 28S rRNA of 60S to interact with 40S ribosomal head proteins- uS13 and uS19. The structural analysis account for numerous biochemical studies on Type 2 IRES and shows how Type 2 IRES interacts with 43S PIC to form 48S PIC.

Many of the ABPs, like the severing protein cofilins, exhibit affinities dependent on the nucleotide state of actin monomers. Experiments have shown that cofilins interact with actin filaments cooperatively in a concentration-dependent manner, where it severs less at both low and high concentrations. However, how this nucleotide state-dependent severing influences actin filament distributions is poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational model of actin filament dynamics that combines stochastic polymerization, phosphate release, hydrolysis-dependent cooperative binding of cofilins, and severing of actin monomers. This model simultaneously reproduces key experimentally observed features: The non-monotonic change of the filament length and the monotonic decay in actin cap size with the increasing cofilin concentration, as well as the linear increase of the cap size with the actin concentration. We elucidate how both these emerge from the tuning of the heterogeneity in the arrangement of cofilin decorated and undecorated monomers within a filament. We also predict that, with varying cofilin concentrations, steady-state length distributions can change from symmetric bell-shaped to long-tailed skewe d shapes. We show that, in some regimes, our model simplifies to a coarse-grained model enabling us to mathematically predict that the distribution of undecorated monomers is exponential with a decay exponent that depends on cofilin and actin concentration. This study highlights the importance of non equilibrium processes that can modulate structural heterogeneity within a filament to shape actin length variation.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

To address this, we developed a cell-free system based on giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), enabling us to study the binding and fusion of the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor in a simplified yet physiologically relevant membrane environment. We generated two distinct GPMV populations- one mimicking the viral membrane and the other mimicking the host cell membrane, with the former expressing Spike and cytoplasmic mCherry, and the latter expressing ACE2-GFP. Mixing of these two GPMV populations led to docking of Spike GPMVs onto ACE2 GPMVs. Using live confocal microscopy, we followed and quantified the docking kinetics, confirming receptor accumulation at the docking interface prior to fusion. Fusion was triggered using trypsin, a protease known to activate Spike, and was monitored and quantified using confocal fluorescence microscopy. To quantify fusion efficiency at high throughput, we used Imaging Flow Cytometry. We conclude that the GPMV-based platform offers a versatile tool for dissecting fusion mechanisms beyond viral interactions.

RNA-seq analysis revealed widespread downregulation of myogenesis-related genes following cold exposure, which suggests suppression of the myogenic program. Consistently, SCs exposed to cold stress exhibited reduced activation and differentiation capacities upon subsequent rewarming, with an increased number of quiescent Pax7-positive/MyoD-negative cells. Muscle regeneration was markedly delayed during hibernation, accompanied by decreased SC activation and macrophage infiltration, suggesting that cold-induced suppression of SC function underlies limited regenerative capacity in hibernating hamsters.

Our prior work showed that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases pathological pain sensitivity (allodynia) following peripheral sciatic nerve injury. While the immune mechanism(s) of PAE-induced immune dysfunction are poorly understood, prior studies implicated the involvement of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. Interestingly, emerging data suggest a surprising overlap of spinal glial proinflammatory activation via the TLR4-NLRP3-interleukin (IL)-1{beta} axis due to opioid treatment in nerve-injured non-PAE rodents. Considering this preclinical evidence, we explored whether PAE poses a risk factor in creating proinflammatory immune bias consequent to opioid (morphine) exposure. We hypothesized that under nerve injury conditions, PAE may interact with morphine, promoting peripheral and CNS proinflammatory factors in a NLRP3-dependent manner. Using a minor nerve injury model in adult mice, we demonstrate that PAE prolongs the chronicity of ongoing allodynia in both sexes, with a more pronounced effect observed in male mice. Our study shows that PAE amplifies proinflammatory responses at the injury site and the spinal cord, driving morphine-prolonged allodynia through NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a well-established pain-promoting TLR4 agonist, is elevated in allodynic PAE mice. NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, effectively reverses morphine-induced allodynia and reduces Caspase-1 activity, IL-1{beta}, and related proinflammatory factors. Although few sex-specific effects were observed, our data convincingly support that PAE and morphine interactions ultimately converge on NLRP3-driven mechanisms in both sexes. Together, this study suggests that PAE modulates later-life neuroimmune function and provides critical insights into immune regulators underlying PAE-induced biological vulnerability to pathological pain processing and adverse effects of opioids.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, the physiological role of the majority of the respective small proteins remains unknown. Here, we report on the functional characterization of the small ORF16 encoded small protein MtrR (49 amino acids). We demonstrate that MtrR is forming oligomers localized at the cytoplasmic membrane. There, it interacts with the tetrahydrosarcinapterin S-methyltransferase (Mtr), a key membrane-bound complex of the energy metabolism, and impacts its activity. In vitro interaction and in vivo copurification assays showed MtrR interaction with the Mtr-complex, which was further validated by microscale thermophoresis analysis demonstrating a specific strong interaction with the MtrA subunit. Analyzing growth under varying molecular hydrogen (H2) availability demonstrated that the small ORF16 deletion mutant showed significantly impaired growth in the presence of H2, independent of the carbon source.

While GO has been widely reported to modify lysine to form the highly studied AGE carboxymethyllysine (CML), here we demonstrate that GO alone leads to highly chemoselective arginine glycation, yielding a stable glyoxal-derived hydroimidazolidine (GH-DH) product. This near-exclusively formed AGE has the same mass change as carboxymethylarginine (CMA), which implies that it may have been overlooked or misattributed in prior studies. In contrast, lysine modification by GO is highly dependent on the presence of hydride-based reducing agents, suggesting that prior reports may have artifactually generated CML through pervasive use of reductive amination protocols during sample preparation. These findings challenge the standing assumptions about the landscape of GO-derived glycation, emphasizing the importance of carefully considering the impact of experimental conditions in glycation studies. By redefining the complement of GO-derived AGEs, this study provides essential new information that is greatly needed for uncovering their biology, creating new tools for their study, and discovering therapies that ameliorate or mitigate their glycation-related damage.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we profiled the activity of cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which are key players in antiviral immunity. Using RNA interactome capture (RIC), we identified hundreds of RBPs whose association with RNA is regulated by IFN-I (IR-RBPs). Among these IR-RBPs are both known antiviral proteins and novel candidates identified in this study through a knockdown screen. By modifying RIC to study IR-RBPs' phosphorylation states, we identified several putative instances of IFN-I-driven phospho-regulation of RNA binding.

Given that Hsp90 recognizes and preferentially interacts with partially unfolded client states, it is well-poised to promote the degradation of misfolded clients and clients past the point of re-foldability3,4,5. Long-standing phenomenological data suggest that Hsp90 could directly present a client protein to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in this way mediating degradative ubiquitylation of the client. However, this has yet to be directly demonstrated for any client. To assess this mechanism for the model Hsp90 client the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, we reconstituted in vitro the Hsp90-dependent folding cycle for GR6, in the presence of the E3 ligase CHIP. Remarkably, we discovered that CHIP binds to and efficiently ubiquitylates GR as presented by a previously characterized Hsp90-dependent pro-folding state called the GR-maturation state (Hsp90-p23-GR), in which GR has been visualized via cryo-EM to be folded in the native state and ligand-bound7. We determined a low-resolution (~14 [A]) cryo-EM reconstruction of the four-component Hsp90-p23-GR-CHIP complex, and furthermore resolved from the same dataset a 3.53 [A] reconstruction of a Hsp90-p23-GR complex in which, surprisingly, GR is partially disordered and ligand-free--in contrast with what we previously observed7, presumably as a consequence of interaction with CHIP. Our results suggest a mechanism by which Hsp90 can simultaneously partition a client between both folding and degradation outcomes and in this way directly mediate protein-triage decisions through its interactions with E3 ligases.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The outputs showed Ser295 phosphorylation to induce topologic distention of subdomains that comprise the NACHT domain. The relative orientation of important residues within the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) were altered. Notable structural changes were observed for important residues within the Walker B motif that immediately follow pSer295. A favorable electrostatic environment was created for two residues (Lys232 and His522) that interact with ADP. Several other basic residues could establish favourable charge-charge interactions with the dianionic phosphate of pSer295. Arg296 and Glu343 underwent a functional change from negative/stabilizing to positive/destabilizing interaction upon phosphorylation of Ser295.

This unique tool requires the introduction of just a single point mutation that modulates the glycation susceptibility of a nearby arginine. As proof-of-concept, extensive mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm that dialAGE can modulate site-specific glycation levels at multiple arginine residues in ubiquitin in vitro, enabling both enhanced and diminished glycation. Introduction of dialAGE point mutations and/or glycation with the biologically relevant glycating agent methylglyoxal did not affect polyubiquitin chain formation using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Furthermore, we show that dialAGE can be used to modulate ubiquitin glycation levels in living mammalian cells.

In this study, we investigate a photoswitchable covalent inhibitor for the MAP kinase JNK3, a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The inhibitor, which is based on a diazocine photoswitch, can undergo reversible photoisomerization of a double bond, switching between two (meta-)stable isomers. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, comprising over 35 s of total simulation time, reveal how the distinct conformational spaces of the two isomers modulate their interactions with JNK3 within the ATP-binding pocket. We show that only the metastable trans isomer can form a covalent bond with JNK3, thereby permanently inhibiting its function. In contrast, for the cis state the distance between the inhibitor and the targeted cysteine residue is too large to allow covalent bond formation. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that the covalent bond, in combination with the environment of the protein pocket, hinders the full back-relaxation of the trans isomer to the stable cis isomer. Finally, our data shows that the covalently bound stable cis isomer modulates the conformations of JNK3, mainly of its activation loop.

They photoswitch between red light absorbing (Pr) and far-red light absorbing (Pfr) states, however, thermal reversion in the dark is an equally important factor in controlling their signaling levels. Phytochromes are generally dimeric proteins, and mixed PrPfr states are therefore possible. These states have been implied in the dark reversion studies of plant phytochromes, but not in bacterial phytochromes. Here, we investigate the dark reversion kinetics of the bathy phytochrome from P. aeruginosa (PaBphP) using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. A single set of time-resolved spectra does not conclusively reveal the presence of a mixed PrPfr state, as both a direct Pr [-&gt;] Pfr model or a sequential Pr [-&gt;] PrPfr [-&gt;] Pfr model fit the spectral kinetics. However, a systematic analysis of dark reversion kinetics with varying Pr/Pfr ratios can only be satisfactorily fit by the sequential model, which indicates the presence of an intermediate PrPfr state. A newly designed monomeric variant of PaBphP provides strong support for this interpretation. Temperature-dependent kinetics revealed similarly low activation energies for the dark reversion processes of both proteins, consistent with a previously proposed keto-enol tautomerization preceding dark reversion. Interestingly, our results suggest allosteric regulation of dark reversion across the dimer, which we propose to be a contributing factor in phytochrome signaling.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that efficient folding and assembly of the model five-domain homotetramer {beta}-galactosidase is obligatorily coupled to its synthesis on the ribosome, and define the underlying mechanisms. During refolding of full-length protein from denaturant, maturation of the catalytic domain is frustrated. Assembly outpaces monomer folding, and non-native oligomers accumulate. The ribosome directs the order of folding events and specifies the pathway of oligomer assembly. Efficient de novo folding is characterised by segmental domain folding, shaped by binding of a nascent amphipathic helix to a cryptic pocket on the ribosome surface. Homomer assembly initiates cotranslationally via recruitment of a full-length subunit to the nascent polypeptide, and the failure to do so results in misassembly.

Here, we utilize the O2 sensing mycobacterial DosS protein as a model system to explore the role of tertiary coordination sphere of heme iron in controlling its O2 affinity. By rationally and systematically modifying the tertiary coordination sphere to promote the formation of a Trp-Tyr-Asn H-bond triad within the heme distal pocket, we have enhanced the O2 affinity of WT DosS by over 150-fold.

Employing a combination of structural, biochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies, our analysis of WT and designed DosS variants highlights how the interplay between distal H-bond networks and heme-pocket electrostatics drives large differences in their O2 sensing capabilities.

These AFM experiments require DNA to be adhered to a solid and preferably flat support. For high-resolution, in-liquid AFM studies so far, such adhesion has commonly been achieved using Ni2+ ions to electrostatically bridge between the negatively charged DNA and a negatively charged, atomically flat mica surface, yet Ni2+ ions tend to cause precipitation of salts on the surface, increasing the risk of AFM tip contamination and increasing the corrugation of the support surface, making it harder to distinguish secondary DNA structure. Here, we report on a sample preparation protocol that, instead, relies on Co2+ ions to adhere DNA to mica.

Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) typically plays a role in elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Molecular recognition of the CAU anticodon of tRNA by MetRS in the two processes is a crucial step. Until now, no known experimental structures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) show this binding. We therefore modeled the Mtb MetRS complexes with initiator and elongator tRNAs to find their differential binding mechanism during molecular dynamics simulations of 6 microseconds. We found that the elongator tRNA binding was stable with the protein, while the initiator tRNA binds transiently, with major intra-tRNA interactions maintained in both. This could be due to fast initiator tRNA charging in contrast to the elongator tRNA, which could take more time to charge. tRNA interacts with the MetRS active site and anticodon domain. The electrostatic attractions between tRNA and the catalytic domain of protein possibly caused its charging with methionine. The repulsive and attractive forces between tRNA and the connective peptide domain and KMSKS loop of protein triggered the opening of the binding pocket, causing the reaction and the product release. At the same time, strong binding of tRNA to the anticodon domain of protein facilitated this reaction. These events show the possible pathway of tRNA charging. tRNA formed salt-bridges with the positively charged Arg and Lys, whereas the negatively charged Asp and Glu caused repulsive binding.

Further, high affinity designs potently modulate receptor function, with most acting as antagonists (inhibitors) and, strikingly, a subset functioning as agonists (activators) of CXCR7 - the first antibody agonists reported for this receptor, and the first computationally designed antibody GPCR agonists of any kind. Using a single experimentally validated agonist to further prompt JAM, we generate over 300 additional diverse agonists with superior properties, including a design with agonism EC50 rivaling that of CXCR7s natural ligand, SDF1.

G.; Perreard, L.; Kolling, F. W.; Pioli, P. A.; Goods, B. A.", "abstract": "Macrophages serve both as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and mediate tissue homeostasis. These cells are inherently responsive and heterogeneous and lie on a spectrum of activation states book-ended by M1-like (inflammatory) and M2-like (anti-inflammatory) extremes. The study of human macrophages is necessary to unravel the complex signals and environmental cues that these cells integrate to create their varied phenotypes. In vitro protocols to differentiate human monocytes into macrophages use many distinct activation stimuli at variable concentrations and for differing durations of treatment that can impact macrophage fate. These variations can make it challenging to reproduce findings and compare datasets across research environments. Additionally, few protocols to date have performed rigorous characterization with input material from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This is important since the availability of fresh blood can often be limiting and can lead to a loss of standardized procedures, particularly for cell therapy applications. Here, we have developed a comprehensive protocol to generate human macrophages from monocytes where we rigorously characterize the impact of differentiation conditions and polarization conditions on human macrophages. We provide a detailed protocol for their characterization using several omics readouts, including their cytokine production and transcriptomes. We also perform depolarization experiments to determine durability of macrophage immunophenotype post-removal of polarizing stimuli. Finally, we demonstrate that nuclei can be isolated and profiled by snRNA-seq directly from macrophages in culture, alleviating the need to detach these adherent cells for downstream multi-ome analyses. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, detailed and streamlined procedure for the differentiation and characterization of human macrophages from monocytes isolated from frozen PBMCs. This is important for enabling the study of macrophages in a more systematic way from biobanked material.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the clearance of HBV-infected cells, but their efficacy is often compromised during chronic infection. Adaptive NK cells, characterised by NKG2C expression and enhanced functional responses, represent a promising therapeutic avenue for enhancing anti-HBV immunity and responses to HBV-driven cancers. Methods: We applied an established protocol, involving K562-HLA-E expressing feeder cells and cytokines (IL-2), for the expansion of adaptive NK cells from cryopreserved T- and B cell depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from donors with chronic HBV infection alone or with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection. We evaluated the adaptive profile of expanded NK cells, their antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) capacity and functional responses against hepatoma cell lines in the presence or absence of HBV infection. Results: Expanded NK cells achieved >97% purity, with the NKG2C positive population exhibiting a mean 100-fold expansion. These cells demonstrated a predominantly adaptive phenotype with high surface expression of NKG2C and cytotoxic potential (Granzyme B). They maintained high levels of CD16 surface expression and upregulated CD2, essential for ADCC. Functionally, expanded adaptive NK cells showed enhanced ADCC capacity and functional responses to K562 targets, naive, HBV integrant-expressing, and de novo infected hepatoma cell lines. TGF-b; preconditioning induced tissue-resident features (CD103, CD49a) in expanded adaptive NK cells, while preserving their adaptive phenotype and functionality, enhancing their potential for liver targeted immunotherapy. Further, expanded adaptive NK cells demonstrated minimal reactivity against autologous activated T cells, suggesting limited off-target effects. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the first successful expansion of adaptive NK cells with robust functional responses from donors with chronic viral infection. This approach creates opportunities for NK cell-based therapies alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies contributing to HBV functional cure strategies and the treatment of HBV-driven cancers.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide the first high-resolution epigenetic map of MDSCs following sepsis using the MAPit-FENGC method, which enables simultaneous single-molecule profiling of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility across ~100 immune-related promoters. We employed a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with daily chronic stress in both young and old, male and female mice, and isolated splenic MDSCs for MAPit-FENGC analysis. Unsupervised clustering revealed nine distinct promoter classes based on chromatin state dynamics, including classes that gain accessibility after sepsis (Classes 1-4), remain persistently closed (Class 5), or undergo age-dependent repression post-sepsis (Classes 6-8). Notably, Class 1 and 3 promoters (e.g., S100a9, Mmp8) showed robust sepsis-induced nucleosome-free region (NFR) formation across all groups, with heightened accessibility in older females. Class 2 promoters such as Nos2 and Cxcr2 required advanced age for activation in females, while Class 4 promoters were uniquely induced in females regardless of age. Conversely, Classes 6-8, including key regulatory genes such as Cd274, Il10, and Nfkbiz, lost accessibility exclusively in older septic mice, despite paradoxical DNA demethylation suggesting chromatin remodeling rather than methylation governs repression in aged hosts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of MDSC subsets corroborated promoter class distinctions, linking accessibility with transcriptional activity. These findings provide a foundation for understanding how epigenetic reprogramming, indicative of innate immune training or tolerance, of MDSCs might contribute to the divergent immune outcomes observed in different sepsis survivor populations. The resolution of select sepsis-responsive epigenetic \"classes\" and their members suggests these could be utilized as age or sex-specific candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Given the ability of children living with HIV to develop bnAbs earlier and at a higher frequency than adults, we compared the immunogenicity of a CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAb germline-targeting SOSIP trimer immunization strategy in infant (n = 5) and juvenile (n = 4) rhesus macaques (RMs). Animals received 3 doses of the germline-targeting BG505 GT1.1 immunogen, followed by 3 boosts of wild-type BG505 SOSIP, each adjuvanted with the TLR7/8 agonist, 3M-052-SE. After 1.5 years, the RMs were further boosted with a mixed clade B Env trimer nanoparticle to enhance heterologous virus neutralization responses. This germline-targeting strategy induced equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies in both groups of RMs, yet the infants exhibited a higher magnitude of vaccine-specific IgG binding. Notably, after 3 doses of BG505 GT1.1 SOSIP, infants had higher BG505 GT1.1-specific IgD- B cells. Upon completion of the vaccine regimen, 4 of 5 infants developed a CD4bs bnAb precursor response detectable in serum compared to only 1 of 4 juveniles. Finally, administration of the mixed clade B nanoparticle was able to increase the breadth of antibody responses in 3 of 5 infants and 2 of 4 juveniles.

Surface immunophenotyping alone is often insufficient, as interrogating functional capacity is required to determine cellular mechanisms and effectively inform diagnostic biomarker discovery, therapeutics and vaccine development. However, large panels with intracellular markers are subject to numerous challenges, including spectral overlap and background cellular autofluorescence, reducing resolving power for rare subsets or populations defined by low-abundance expression. We posited that mass cytometry may overcome such limitations; to address this, 3 small (11 or 12-plex) clone-matched antibody panels were evaluated by spectral flow and mass cytometry. Panels were comprised of surface and intracellular targets (phospho-epitopes, transcription factors or cytokines) and designed to minimize fluorescence spectral overlap. CyTOF technology offered superior signal resolution across the range of intracellular targets. Improved signal-to-noise provided better resolution of phospho-events and transcription factor expression, in particular TOX and T-bet. Most strikingly, stimulation-specific IL-10+ and IL-13+ cells were only detected by CyTOF. Superior resolution of these cytokines enabled accurate population clustering, permitting more unique immune cell signatures to be found, including Tr1 and Tc2 populations, thus providing a more comprehensive picture of the immuno-diversity present.

We explore how these three factors influence the persistence of empirical mutualistic communities. By employing spatially explicit metacommunity models, we find that landscapes with a heterogeneous distribution of connections between habitat patches exhibit high persistence under spatially-uncorrelated habitat loss but are highly vulnerable to spatially-correlated loss, where adjacent habitat patches are destroyed sequentially. Homogeneous landscapes with regularly arranged patches have lower persistence than heterogeneous landscapes but are more resilient to correlated habitat loss. The metacommunity nested structure of species interactions enhances persistence, with varying magnitude depending on landscape configuration and the patterns of habitat loss.

Owing to the mitochondrion s central metabolic task of oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen availability has long been a hypothesized driver of eukaryogenesis. However, this hypothesis is challenged by a temporal disconnect, spanning several hundred million years, between the earliest geochemical evidence for oxygen in the environment (~3.2-2.5 Ga) and the oldest widely accepted eukaryotic fossils (~1.7 Ga). Notably, the earliest candidate eukaryotes appear contemporaneous with the cessation of major iron deposits and rise of sulfide- and sulfate-rich marine sediments in coastal environments. Here, we integrate Proterozoic surface geochemical records with the microbial biochemistry of iron to examine potential environmental constraints on early eukaryotic evolution. Iron bioavailability exerts complex and often antagonistic effects on both aerobic and anaerobic microbial lineages that contributed to LECA. Elevated iron levels likely disrupted cellular homeostasis, particularly by destabilizing labile iron pools and promoting oxidative damage to bacterial lipids. The programmed cell death pathways known as ferroptosis, which is widespread among eukaryotic lineages, may trace its origins to iron-rich conditions in Archaean and Paleoproterozoic seawater and LECA.

Here, we combine high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations, harmonic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA), and parallel-tempering metadynamics (PT-MetaD) to dissect the earliest conformational transitions of the disease-relevant SAA1-76 fragment. By constructing an optimized one-dimensional collective variable (sHLDA) from inter-helix contacts and helical root-mean-square deviations, we perform nearly 4 s of enhanced sampling across 79 replicas (300-450 K). Free-energy surfaces projected onto sHLDA and radius of gyration reveal a possible misfolding trajectory comprising thirteen metastable intermediates. We identify that helix III destabilizes first, preceding loss of helix II and helix I, while global compactness is retained. This stepwise mechanism underscores the key role of helix III in the establishment of the native fold of SAA. Solvent-accessible surface-area analyses pinpoint a transient surge in exposure of the aggregation-prone core (residues 42-48) within specific misfolded intermediates, implicating localized core exposure rather than wholesale unfolding as the trigger for misfolding. Temperature-dependent secondary-structure profiling further confirms that SAA1-76 behaves as a folded bundle with disordered loops, rather than a fully disordered protein. These insights identify helix III stabilization and masking of the amyloidogenic segment as strategic avenues for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, if and how growth-induced tumor compressive forces (i.e., solid stresses) influence the breast pTME remains unclear. Here we show using instant fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)--a frequency-domain FLIM system capable of simultaneous image acquisition and instantaneous data processing--that breast tumor-mimicking in vitro compression promotes metabolic changes in stromal cells found in the breast pTME. Namely, compression shifts NIH3T3 fibroblasts and differentiated 3T3-L1 (d3T3-L1) adipocytes toward a more glycolytic state, while it promotes increased oxidative phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 undifferentiated adipocytes. The gold-standard Seahorse extracellular flux assay fails to capture these changes, underscoring the superior sensitivity of instant FLIM in detecting metabolic shifts. We validate these phenotypic findings at the transcriptomic level via RNA sequencing, confirming that compressed fibroblasts downregulate oxidative phosphorylation and upregulate glycolysis compared to uncompressed controls. We further demonstrate that compression induces mitochondrial dysregulation in undifferentiated adipocytes, driven in part by upregulated mitophagy and disrupted fusion dynamics. Finally, we confirm that these stromal cell types recapitulate these distinct metabolic states in human breast cancer patient samples, consistent with our in vitro findings. By elucidating mechano-metabolic interactions occurring at the tumor-host interface, these results will inform the development of innovative mechano-metabolic reprogramming treatment strategies to improve breast cancer patient survival.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Elevated caffeine levels were reproducible across multiple donations from 643 recalled donors, selected based on their extremes in hemolytic propensity. Both in the screening and recalled cohorts, higher caffeine levels were associated with disrupted RBC metabolism, characterized by reduced glycolysis, depletion of adenylate pools or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and increased markers of oxidative stress and osmotic fragility, including kynurenine accumulation. These observations were recapitulated in plasma and RBCs of eight volunteers upon consumption of a cup of coffee independently of brewing method (Chemex vs espresso). Clinically, elevated caffeine correlated with increased hemolysis and lower post-transfusion hemoglobin increments, especially pronounced in recipients transfused with RBCs from donors carrying common polymorphisms in the ADORA2b gene, a key regulator of RBC metabolism in hypoxia. These human findings were mechanistically validated using a murine model deficient in ADORA2b, which demonstrated impaired glycolytic flux, compromised antioxidant defenses - including caffeine-dependent direct inhibition of recombinantly-expressed glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and decreased transfusion efficacy (lower hemoglobin increments, higher bilirubin post-transfusion), effects further exacerbated by caffeine exposure during storage.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of naturally occurring defense molecules found across diverse species, are promising candidates. Despite their potent membrane-disrupting activity, the atomic details of the pore formation process remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the pore formation process of melittin under different initial configurations. Simulations were conducted using three different membrane systems: a pure POPC bilayer, a mammalian membrane model (DOPC:Cholesterol, 9:1), and a bacterial membrane model (DOPE:DOPG, 3:1). For each system, we examined four different starting configurations, in which six melittin peptides were arranged in a star-like pattern. Our results demonstrated that the pore formation process strongly depends on the initial peptide configuration. In one specific initial arrangement (termed as Conf.I), pore formation consistently occurred within 100 nanoseconds, regardless of membrane composition. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that pore formation was more challenging in the mammalian membrane model and even more so in the bacterial membrane model, in comparison with the pure POPC bilayer. These findings are in line with previously reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the 50% hemolysis concentration (HC50) of melittin in the literature. Additionally, we identified lysine-7 (K7) as the key residue in determining whether a stable pore can form. In configurations where the K7 side chain formed electrostatic interactions with the phosphate group of a lipid, melittin were anchored to the membrane surface, thereby preventing pore formation. In contrast, simulations of melittin mutants K7A and K7Q showed no such anchoring effect, and thus pore formation was possible in multiple initial configurations. Notably, the K7Q mutation showed a preference for pore formation in bacterial membranes over mammalian membranes, suggesting that reducing toxicity while maintaining antimicrobial efficacy is possible.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The short half-life of this isotope imposes time-sensitive constraints on experiments, and stringent radiation safety and compliance requirements significantly increase operational costs and hinder scalability. Several alternative methods, including fluorescent phosphate-binding probes and fluorescence- or luminescence-based antibodies, have been developed for HKs that overcome these challenges.

This minimally invasive approach is still debated when performing direct pulp capping (DPC), a treatment in which a protective biocompatible material is directly placed over the dental pulp, due to microbial risks inherent with pulp exposure and difficulties in sealing the exposure to protect the pulp from subsequent bacterial ingress. Several limitations associated with Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) such as long setting time and discoloration have promoted the development of next-generation MTA derivatives with enhanced physical, chemical, and biological properties. As these materials are relatively new, existing studies are limited in scope, lacking a comprehensive assessment of both reparative dentin formation and the sealing ability, which are critical parameters for determining long-term clinical success. These assessments require preclinical models, and while the mouse model offers the opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms guiding reparative dentinogenesis, the materials and techniques optimized for human dentition present technical challenges in mice due to their small size. Aim: We aimed to optimize a DPC technique to use in mice by comparing the tissue responses and the sealing ability of three calcium silicate capping agents: Bioceramic putty (BC), Biodentine (BD), and Theracal-LC (TLC) to a control material known to seal well but cause desiccation that would lead to tissue damage; Cavit-G (CG). Material and methods: DPC was performed on the maxillary first molar of C57BL/6 female mice. Reparative dentin was assessed with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological assessment of dentin bridge formation at 21 days. The sealing ability of the capping materials was evaluated using micro-CT. Results: All three calcium silicate materials showed good biocompatibility and the ability to form a dentin bridge.

This study examines the use of acoustic levitation to trap and manipulate the filamentous cyanobacterium Limnospira indica PCC 8005 during parabolic flight experiments. We demonstrate that this helicoidal microorganism can be rapidly assembled into thin layers with a standing ultrasonic wave within a millimeter-scale fluidic chamber. Our findings indicate that significantly lower acoustic power is required under microgravity (0.79 mW) compared to terrestrial conditions (1.48 mW) to achieve stable trapping, suggesting energy-efficient bioprocessing in weightless environments. Monte Carlo simulations and light attenuation modelling reveal that structuring cyanobacteria into layered formations enhances light penetration, potentially overcoming the \"compensation point\" limitation observed in bulk cultures.

New strategies to combat fungal infections are urgently needed to overcome rising rates of resistance and the emergence of new pathogens. To promote invasion within a host, fungi use highly adapted and regulated virulence factors, and, in turn, the host adopts an active and dynamic immune response to suppress infection. Understanding the interplay between these processes is crucial to move fungal disease management and treatment forward and improve global health outcomes. Within the present study, we tackle these challenges using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry instrumentation to explore proteome remodeling during active infection of Cryptococcus neoformans at an unprecedented depth with spatiotemporal resolution. Our prioritization of three host organs (i.e., lungs, brain, spleen) critical to initiation, progression, and response of disease discovers tissue-specific remodeling across time. Within the lungs, we revealed early and sustained activation of the host immune response integrated with characterization of a promising new antifungal target, and we propose the discovery of a competitive inhibitor for functional target disruption. Within the brain, proteome remodeling aligns with disease progression, and we define a new mechanistic role for haptoglobin in fungal cell modulation, as well as showcasing an adaptive survival response of C. neoformans within an hypoxic environment.

In this study, 34 participants (17 diabetics, 17 non-diabetic controls) self-collected DBS samples using advanced microsampling devices (10 uL, Capitainer(R)B). Lipid extracts were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography-trapped ion mobility-time-of-flight mass spectrometry method optimised for semi-quantitative DBS lipidomics. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in lipidomic profiles (n = 432 lipids) between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals (R2Y = 0.82, Q2Y = 0.50, p = 0.05). Key discriminatory lipids (all VIP > 1.44), including HexCer(18:1;O2/24:0), HexCer(18:1;O2/22:0), LPC(16:0), PC(O-34:3), TG(18:0-18:1-20:3), and TG(18:1-18:1-22:6), were consistent with matched venous and capillary plasma samples.

Here, we determine the lipid-binding, enzymatic and membrane remodeling activities of the Bacterial Dynamin-Like Protein (BDLP) from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. We find that BDLP binds phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-containing membranes, but unlike other soluble dynamins, shows little stimulation in GTPase activity. This enzymatic feature is like that seen among the fusion dynamins to which BDLP shows structural similarities. FRET-based bulk vesicle fusion assays however reveal that BDLP is incapable of membrane fusion. To further understand BDLP functions, we turned to microscopic analysis of BDLP on membranes templates. We find that the GTP-bound BDLP forms a rigid scaffold that is capable of bending and imposing a defined curvature. In contrast, the GDP-bound state is loosely organized and unable to remodel membrane shape.

Although preliminary studies with senolytic drug combinations have shown promising outcomes, the predictive capabilities of the research in this field remain limited by the extensive experimental data requirements. In this study, we employed differential gene expression analysis and machine learning techniques to investigate the combinatorial effects of senolytic drugs.

Using colloidal -Traps to confine single cells within spherical volumes accessible through a narrow aperture, we reveal that cells engage backward motility to enter pores, explore boundaries, and escape confinement. This directional switching is gated by mechanical load: moderate forces on the flagellum promote backward motion, while excessive load suppresses it, preventing futile effort. This tunable, load-sensitive control offers direct evidence for a mechanical logic that governs motility: backward movement is activated when advantageous and disengaged when not.

It is expressed in virtually all tissues and its dysfunction is associated with various diseases such as skin blistering. There is evidence that plectin regulates the mechanical integrity of the cytoskeleton in diverse cell and tissue types. However, it is unknown how plectin modulates the mechanical response of cells depending on the frequency and amplitude of mechanical loading. Here we demonstrate the role of plectin in the viscoelastic properties of fibroblasts at small and large deformations by quantitative single-cell compression measurements. To identify the importance of plectin, we compared the mechanical properties of wild type (Plec+/+) fibroblasts and plectin knockout (Plec-/- ) fibroblasts. We show that plectin knockout cells are nearly 2-fold softer than wild type cells, but their strain-stiffening behaviour is similar. Plectin deficiency also caused faster viscoelastic stress relaxation at long times. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments indicated that this was due to 3-fold faster actin turnover. Short-time poroelastic relaxation was also faster in Plec-/- cells as compared to Plec+/+ cells, suggesting a more sparse cytoskeletal network. Confocal imaging indicated that this was due to a marked change in the architecture of the vimentin network, from a fine meshwork in wild type cells to a bundled network in the plectin knockout cells. Our findings therefore indicate that plectin is an important regulator of the organization and viscoelastic properties of the cytoskeleton in fibroblasts. Our findings emphasize that mechanical integration of the different cytoskeletal networks present in cells is important for regulating the versatile mechanical properties of cells.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class.

These adaptations include genome sequence optimizations, such as increased GC content in rRNA and tRNA, shifts in codon and amino acids usage, and the acquisition of functional genes conferring adaptation for specific temperatures. Since the experimental determination of optimal growth temperatures (OGT) is only possible for cultured species, predicting OGT from genomic information has become increasingly important given the exponential increase in genomic data. Although previous studies developed prediction models integrating multiple features based on genome composition using machine learning, the accuracy was variable depending on the target species, with models performing well for thermophiles but less accurately for psychrophiles. In this study, we curated the OGT and genomic data of 2,869 bacterial species to develop a novel prediction model incorporating features reflecting genomic adaptation toward lower temperatures. We found that species with rapid OGT shifts from their ancestors, including psychrophiles, showed less accuracy in genome composition-based models. Incorporating the gene presence/absence information associated with the rapid changes in OGT improved the prediction accuracy for psychrophiles. We also observed that OGT in archaea is phylogenetically more conserved than in bacteria, which may lead to the long-term optimization of the genome composition and explain high predictability of OGT in archaea.

Prior studies suggest HIF/HRE complexes are augmented by the binding of additional factors nearby, but those interactions are not well understood. Here, we integrated structural and biochemical approaches to investigate several functionally relevant HIF assemblies with other protein, small molecule, and DNA partners. First, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to establish HIF-1 and HIF-2 form novel dimer-of-heterodimers (DoHD) complexes on extended human EPO enhancer sequences, showing that one heterodimer bound at a canonical HRE site with the second binding in an inverted fashion to an HRE-adjacent sequence (HAS) 8 bp away. Consistent with ARNT PAS-B domains predominating interactions within a DoHD, we found HIF-1 and HIF-2 assemble mixed DoHD complexes on the same DNA. Second, we saw substantial variability among ligands for isolated ARNT or HIF-2 PAS-B domains to bind larger complexes: for example, the ARNT PAS-B binding KG-548 and KG-279 ligands both bound the simpler HIF-2 heterodimer but exhibited differential binding to a HIF-2 DoHD. Finally, we combined cryo-EM and hydrogen-deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to show how HIF-1 and HIF-2 heterodimers engage the transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3) coactivator via both ARNT and HIF- subunits, though this was unseen in the larger DoHD.

As APY formation occurs without an enzyme, it remains exceptionally difficult to pinpoint where APY is likely to be found, both on individual proteins and in cells. In this study, we used a peptide model system and mass spectrometry analysis to investigate the chemical mechanism through which APY forms from methylglyoxal (MGO), a biologically relevant glycating agent. Consistent with other proposed APY formation mechanisms, our results show that that another AGE, tetrahydropyrimidine (THP) is a direct precursor to APY. However, our results rule out previously proposed reductone or oxidative decarboxylation mechanisms. Instead, we show that a formal oxidation step is not required, and that formate, not CO2 is released. We further show the potential for a nearby residue such as Tyr to assist in the APY formation mechanism by acting as a general base. These experiments revealed that phosphorylated Tyr or Ser residues could also promote equivalent levels of APY formation, despite introducing additional negative charges that we previously showed to impede glycation. Guided by these mechanistic insights and newly defined role for phosphorylated residues on glycation substrates, we performed quantitative bottom-up proteomics analysis for MGO-treated cells. Gene ontology analysis for AGE-modified proteins revealed significant enrichment of phosphorylation-related terms (e.g. kinase activity or protein phosphorylation) for APY, while other Arg post-translational modifications did not.

We previously showed that these enzymes evolve by grafting and pruning of cytochrome c modules. Here, we extended our analysis and found that grafting can also involve the incorporation of domains of other protein families and of small peptide sequences that affect the heme coordination environment. We show that the addition of hemes to multiheme cytochromes c occurs exclusively by integrating heme-binding peptides and that gain of hemes is equally probable along the protein sequence. By contrast, heme loss occurs by the loss of heme-binding peptides and the accumulation of point mutations. Notably, heme-binding motif loss is disproportionately more prevalent at the position nearer to the N-terminus. This observation contrasts with the general trend observed in proteins, which are usually more conserved at the N-terminus, and likely reflects the way in which multiheme cytochromes c are assembled. Overall, this work completes the picture of how multiheme cytochromes c evolved to achieve the diversity of structures and functions found in nature, and sets them apart from other proteins with respect to the drivers for their evolution.

Online delivery showed higher attrition rates (51.0%) compared to in-person delivery (25.6%, p = 0.002, R^2 = 17.1%). Individually delivered MBIs were also linked to higher attrition compared to group formats (beta = 0.216, p = 0.039, R^2 = 5.5%). Conclusions: Attrition rates for MBIs in chronic pain management vary widely. Higher attrition is associated with stricter completion criteria, online delivery, and individual formats. These findings highlight the need to optimise MBI programme structure to reduce attrition in MBIs for chronic pain management.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

M.; Pierre, C. J.; Azeez, T. A.; La Favor, J. D.", "abstract": "Aims: Androgen deprivation therapy is a common treatment strategy for prostate cancer, although erectile dysfunction (ED) often coincides as an undesirable side-effect. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant-like properties. H2S therapies are being developed for cardiovascular disease management, although the properties of H2S may also protect the erectile system. Materials and methods: 14-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to sham surgery or castration, with castrated mice remaining untreated or treated orally with low- or high-doses of the H2S prodrug SG1002 over the five-week intervention. Erectile function was assessed by intracavernous pressure and mean arterial pressure during cavernous nerve stimulation. Vascular reactivity of the corpus cavernosum (CC), internal pudendal artery (IPA), and internal iliac artery (IIA) were assessed by dose-dependent responses to vasodilatory, vasocontractile, and neurogenic stimuli in myograph systems. CC contents of proteins related to cellular autophagy, antioxidant defense, and mitochondrial dynamics were assessed by immunoblotting. Fibrotic remodeling was assessed by Massons trichrome staining. Key findings: Both doses of SG1002 provided an equivalent and moderate protection on erectile function against long-term androgen deprivation. Castration-induced alterations of several mechanisms of vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the CC and IPA were substantial, while alterations of the IIA modest, with subtle effects of SG1002 treatment across the vascular beds. SG1002 partially protected against castration-induced fibrotic remodeling of the IPA. Significance: H2S therapy provides a modest but potentially clinically relevant protection of erectile function and health of the erectile structures against the harshly damaging effects of chronic androgen deprivation.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

We evaluated associations between established aging-related risk factors and brain-predicted age difference (brainPAD) in a cross-sectional cognitively-intact oldest-old sample. Additionally, we evaluated brainPAD-cognition associations to characterize brain maintenance vs. cognitive reserve in our sample. Oldest-old adults (N = 206; 85-99 years; MoCA > 22 or neurologist evaluation) underwent T1-weighted MRI; brainPAD was generated with brainageR, such that more-positive brainPAD reflected relatively advanced brain aging. Sex, educational attainment, alcohol and smoking history, exercise history, BMI, cardiovascular and metabolic disease history, and anticholinergic medication burden were self-reported. Global cognitive z-score and coefficient of variation were derived from the NACC UDS 3.0 cognitive battery; crystallized-fluid discrepancy was derived from the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery. Mean brainPAD was -7.99 (SD: 5.37; range: -24.50, 6.03). Women showed more-delayed brain aging than men (B = -2.35, 95% CI = -4.28, -0.41, p = 0.018). No other exposures were associated with brainPAD. BrainPAD was not associated with any cognitive variable. These findings suggest that cognitively-intact oldest-old adults may be atypically-resistant to risk factors associated with aging in younger samples, consistent with survivorship effects in aging. Furthermore, brainPAD may have limited explanatory value for cognitive performance in cognitively-intact oldest-old adults, potentially due to high cognitive reserve.

Various advanced techniques exist within the diffusion weighted imaging space that each provide valuable insights into different aspects of microstructure. In the following study, we sought to examine whether the combination of derived diffusion metrics (tensors, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI) in grey-matter regions could reliably predict cognitive performance in older adults, and whether these findings were replicable across datasets. First, we demonstrated that all combinations of diffusion metrics could reliably determine participant characteristics and were significant predictors of age. Second, we found that a combination of Tensor, NODDI, and MAP-MRI metrics within the hippocampus could predict RAVLT performance in older adults above and beyond any combination of two metrics alone. We also found these diffusion metrics were able to reliably predict RAVLT performance, but not Trails B or Digit Symbol Substitution Task performance. We also found that these same combinations of metrics could predict working memory performance, but not memory performance within a region associated with working memory (Brodmann Areas 9 and 46). Taken together, these findings indicate that these diffusion metrics provide valuable information on grey-matter microstructure independent of one another, and that the ability to obtain both NODDI and MAP-MRI based information from multi-shell diffusion scans more than justifies the added length.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

These pathogens include enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, which transit the intestinal tract, efface microvilli, and attach firmly to intestinal epithelial cells predominantly in the colon. Investigation of these human-adapted pathogens has been greatly aided by mouse models of infection. The mouse-adapted attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium utilizes many similar mechanisms of pathogenesis, including the use of a type III secretion system, and virulence factors encoded in a locus of enterocyte effacement. Although this model has allowed for assessing the complexity of the host response, the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems in response to infection remains incomplete. Methods: We assessed the role of sensory neurotransmitters encoded by the Tac1 gene in the host response to C. rodentium. Results: Tac1-deficient mice had significantly reduced pathogen shedding and colonic bacterial burden, accompanied by decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In accordance with reduced chemokine production, we observed reduced colonic recruitment of specific immune cell populations in Tac1-/- compared to WT mice. Conclusions: Sensory neuropeptides regulate key aspects of enteric bacterial infection and may serve as unique targets in the treatment of enteric disease.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

In Chlamydia, which lacks a dedicated heat shock sigma factor, repressor HrcA limits chaperone gene expression under non-stressed conditions.

We show that HrcA represses hagF, but heat shock induces hagF expression, leading to HagF accumulation and binding to HrcA. Structural modeling and pulldown assays indicate that HagF blocks HrcA dimerization, impairing DNA binding. This relieves repression of the hrcA-grpE-dnaK operon and promotes secondary differentiation in the developmental cycle, enabling infectious elementary bodies to form under heat stress.

We identified Pseudomonas isolates that antagonise Z. tritici through the production of secreted secondary metabolites, using a novel in vitro Z. tritici antagonism assay. In addition to high-throughput qualitative assessment of Pseudomonas antagonism of Z. tritici, a quantitative assessment identified variation in the sensitivity of Z. tritici isolates to antagonism by a subset of Pseudomonas isolates. Genome assemblies of 3 strongly antagonistic Pseudomonas isolates were found to contain a predicted Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (BGC) with high sequence similarity to a reference BGC encoding the biosynthesis of the known antifungal compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG). Mutagenesis of the core biosynthetic gene phlD resulted in a loss of 2,4-DAPG production in Pseudomonas isolate Roth82, and a loss of Z. tritici inhibition in the antagonism assay. These results demonstrate that the described in vitro antagonism assay can be used to identify, quantify and mechanistically characterise bacterial antagonism of Z. tritici through the production of secondary metabolites. This is the first study to find significant differences in the response of genetically diverse isolates of Z. tritici isolates to bacterial antagonists, suggesting sensitivity to bacterial antagonism exists as a quantitative trait within natural Z. tritici populations.

Metal-based compounds (metalloantibiotics) have emerged as a promising class of potential antibiotics exhibiting high hit rates against critical bacterial pathogens while not displaying higher toxicity than organic compounds. Here, we describe the exploration of a novel class of non-toxic, Gram-positive acting platinum-based antibacterial agents with micro to nanomolar activity against a range of methicillin and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that modifications of the core scaffold result in reduced antibacterial activity. Mode of action studies investigations showed that lead compound Pt1 did not impair cell division, RNA, protein, or cell wall synthesis, nor did it affect membrane integrity or potential. Instead, akin to the structurally similar anticancer drug cisplatin (CisPt), Pt1 treatment resulted in reduced DNA staining, visible nucleoid compaction, and activation of DNA damage repair responses. Importantly, we could show that Pt1 is able to interact with and damage DNA directly, resulting in DNA strand breaks and fragmentation. Pt1 activity can be reduced significantly by high amounts of a hydroxyl radical scavenger. Derivative Pt8, which retained DNA-damaging activity but was less potent in terms of antibacterial activity, was not affected by the presence of radical scavengers, suggesting that Pt1 possesses a multimodal mechanism. In line with this observation, no resistance development to Pt1 was observed over the course of 36 passages. Finally, we could demonstrate the in vivo activity of Pt1, which significantly reduced the bacterial load in a murine S. aureus skin infection model. Altogether, these findings shed light on the SAR and antibacterial mode of action of a novel class of platinum metalloantibiotics, validate its in vivo efficacy, and pave the way for further exploration of platinum compounds as novel drug candidates with a highly attractive activity profile.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, visualizing these interactions in vivo remains technically challenging. Here, we established fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) as a robust, spatially resolved technique to visualize protein interactions in living Staphylococcus aureus using fluorescent proteins. After systematically optimizing growth conditions and the analysis pipeline, we validated the method with cytosolic and membrane-anchored control proteins, achieving FRET efficiencies of up to 40%. Using FLIM-FRET, we mapped the protein interactions of the critical glycosyltransferase FtsW within the septal PG synthesizing complex. We confirmed its interaction with the cognate transpeptidase PBP1 and the regulatory protein DivIB. Notably, we found that FtsW also self-interacts, an observation corroborated by an alternative FLIM-FRET method employing Halo-Tag labelled with Janelia Fluor dyes. These findings support the hypothesis that septal PG synthesis may be carried out by a complex of multimers, capable of simultaneously synthesizing more than one glycan strand. Inhibition of PG synthesis by directly targeting PBP1 with the beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem weakened the interaction between PBP1 and FtsW, whereas the FtsW self-interaction was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, inhibition of PG synthesis by targeting the lipid II flippase, therefore depleting the FtsW-PBP1 substrate from the outer surface of the cell membrane, had little effect on these interactions. This suggests that alterations in FtsW interactions result primarily from antibiotic-induced conformational changes or from uncoupling the activities of FtsW and PBP1, resulting in the presence of uncrosslinked glycans, rather than merely from a loss of PG synthesis activity.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

However, gene delivery to renal tubule epithelial cells mediated by viral vectors via the blood is inefficient due to the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier. We hypothesized that effacement of podocyte foot processes would disrupt typical glomerular limitations on filtration and make renal tubule epithelial cells susceptible to transduction from viral vectors delivered intravenously. We determined that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) transduced significantly more epithelial cells in the kidney under the conditions of LPS-induced proteinuria. Use of AAV1 in tandem with LPS-induced proteinuria yielded an ideal two-pronged effect of both partially detargeting the liver and transducing the kidney with a higher bioluminescent signal than AAV8 did, and at half of the dose. Using adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) in conjunction with LPS-induced proteinuria showed that kidney transduction was enhanced, but only in glomerular cells.

While many efforts were made to understand their stability in annual crops, their long-term persistence in clonally propagated plants remains poorly understood. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) provides a unique model, with cultivars vegetatively propagated for centuries. Here, we assembled the phased genomes of Cabernet Sauvignon and its parental lineages, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, using HiFi long-reads and a gene map tenfold denser than existing maps. Using three clones per cultivar, we quantifyied methylation with very consistent short- and long-read sequencing and ensured both varietal representativeness and assessment of clonal variability. We leveraged the parent-progeny sequence graph to highlight allele-specific methylation and conserved transcriptomic patterns for genes and small RNA. Such a format was essential to integrate multi-omics data and revealed that despite less clonal conservation than genetic polymorphisms, methylation marks were remarkably inherited. By further demonstrating the linear-reference limitations, we determined the correct representation of genetic variants by the sequence graph is crucial for the accurate allelic quantification of the methylome. These findings reveal the remarkable stability of epigenetic marks in a model propagated by asexual reproduction. Using a phased sequence graph, we introduce a scalable framework that accounts for genomic variation, accurately quantifies allele-specific methylation, and supports multi-omics integration such as our evaluation of the transcriptional impact of epigenetic inheritance.

The range of separation exceeds that seen in published P-gp structures that appear to be conformationally restricted. This global open-and-close motion is coupled with individual helix movement, resulting in a highly fluid substrate-binding pocket.

Its function depends not only on ligand binding and signaling efficacy, but also on the dynamic control of receptor localization at the cell surface. Neuronal Calcium Sensor 1 (NCS-1) is a calcium binding protein which directly interacts with D2R in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of NCS-1 in D2R localization and function. We found that NCS-1 promotes the trafficking of D2R to the plasma membrane through a mechanism dependent on active exocytosis. Functional signaling assays confirmed that NCS-1 does not alter the canonical receptor pharmacology. Using a library of FDA-approved drugs, a structure-based drug-repurposing strategy was designed to find protein-protein interaction modulators that allowed the exploration of the NCS-1/D2R interface as a new pharmacological target. Azilsartan medoxomil, atorvastatin, and vilazodone disrupted its interaction with D2R, reducing receptor surface expression in cells. Crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations revealed their mechanism of action. These compounds target the NCS-1 hydrophobic crevice and overlap the D2R binding site, perturbing the dynamics of the regulatory helix H10 in NCS-1.

Under two-photon excitation, MD-FSS precisely measures the aberrated point spread function in approximately 0.1 s per measurement, effectively compensating for both aberrations and scattering to achieve subcellular resolution in deep tissue.

Here, using Ninj2 knockout (Ninj2-/-) and smooth muscle-specific overexpressing (Ninj2smcTG) mice subjected to carotid artery ligation, we demonstrate that Ninjurin2 deficiency exacerbates injury-induced intimal hyperplasia, whereas its overexpression attenuates this pathological remodeling. Mechanistically, Ninjurin2 knockdown pro-moted PDGF-BB-mediated VSMC phenotypic switching, proliferation, and migration, while biochemical studies revealed that Ninjurin2 interacts with PDGFR{beta} to suppress FAK signaling.

It is unclear how the olfactory system habituates to such stochastic backgrounds to detect behaviorally important odors. Here, we explicitly consider the high-dimensional nature of odor coding, the natural statistics of odor fluctuations and the architecture of the early olfactory pathway. We show that their combination favors a manifold learning mechanism for olfactory habituation over alternatives based on predictive filtering. Manifold learning is implemented in our model by a biologically plausible network of inhibitory interneurons in the early olfactory pathway. We demonstrate that plasticity rules based on IBCM or online PCA are effective at implementing this mechanism in turbulent conditions and outperform previous models relying on mean background subtraction. Interneurons with an IBCM plasticity rule acquire selectivity to independently varying odors. This manifold learning mechanism offers a path towards distinguishing plasticity rules in experiments and could be leveraged by other biological circuits facing fluctuating environments.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

R.; Rivera, A.; Ghanem, E. N. B.", "abstract": "The decline in neutrophil antimicrobial function renders vaccinated aged hosts less protected against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. In vaccinated hosts, activation of neutrophils via phagocytic receptors, like complement and Fc{gamma} receptors, mediates bacterial uptake and killing. However, the mechanisms behind changes in signaling downstream of these receptors with age is not known. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are signaling cascades activated in response to cell surface receptors. Using bone marrow neutrophils isolated from young and aged mice, and MAPK phosphorylation array, we found differences in MAPK activation in an opsonin dependent manner (complement vs antibody). Neutrophils from aged mice failed to increase MAPK phosphorylation upon infection with pneumococci opsonized with heat-inactivated (HI) sera from hosts immunized with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), indicating an age-related defect in Fc{gamma}R signaling. Neutrophils from aged mice had higher basal levels of MAPK phosphorylation when compared to young controls, including a 15-fold increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling blunted pneumococcal killing by PMNs from young mice, but improved killing by neutrophils from aged mice, only when the bacteria were opsonized with HI immune but not naive sera. In young human participants, in vitro inhibition of ERK1/2 in neutrophils resulted in decreased pneumococcal killing, but only following PCV vaccination, suggesting that the effects of ERK1/2 inhibition are clinically relevant in vaccinated hosts. This study identifies age-related changes in ERK1/2 activation and demonstrates that balanced activation of this pathway is crucial for neutrophil antimicrobial activity against antibody opsonized bacteria following vaccination in both mice and humans.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing effective proteome-wide strategies to identify protease cleavage products to enhance our understanding of proteolytic pathways and their perturbation in diseases. Here, we present a streamlined N-termini proteome analysis leveraging N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester chemistry. At the protein level, N-terminal amines (naturally occurring protein N-termini, lysines, or protease-generated N-termini) are blocked directly in the cell lysate, and tryptic digestion is performed straight after, without the need for any buffer exchange. The internal tryptic peptides are tagged with a phosphonate moiety and subsequently depleted via metal-based coordination, keeping exclusively N-blocked terminal peptides for analysis by LC-MS/MS. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach by monitoring proteolytic events induced by intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our approach identified more than 690 cleaved proteins in response to Staurosporine-induced apoptosis, including many previously unknown substrates and cleavage sites. The presented approach is, therefore, a straightforward and robust method for mass spectrometry-based identification of caspase-generated cleavage products and extendible to a wide range of other proteolytic cleavage events.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Despite many studies on pro-apoptotic genes, few reports have directly compared the lethality-inducing potential between them under identical conditions. In this study, we evaluated the lethality-inducing potential of three representative pro-apoptotic genes, Bax, Casp3, and Casp9, in mouse early embryos under defined conditions using the doxycycline (Dox)-inducible tetracycline-regulated gene expression system (Tet-On system) in combination with the PiggyBac transposon system. All genes were transcriptionally induced by Dox, and Bax showed the strongest lethal effect, followed by Casp9, while Casp3 did not show any effect. Notably, Bax expression severely impaired blastocyst formation and led to the intense accumulation of the DNA damage marker {gamma}H2AX. These findings suggest that introducing upstream apoptotic regulators leads to the more efficient and widespread activation of the apoptotic cascade. Additionally, an unexpected Dox-dependent increase in the expression of reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator, which is typically driven by a constitutive promoter, was observed, raising the possibility of unanticipated regulatory mechanisms within the Tet-On system.

Ui2i removes feature-based normalization layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional spectral normalization - a parameter-based alternative that enhances training stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical tasks - domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images - demonstrates Ui2i's ability to preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural preservation than typical translation tasks.

Through quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of K562, a commonly used CML cell line, and ImR, an imatinib-resistant derivative we developed, global changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome were identified. LIN28A, a multi-functional RNA-binding protein, emerged as a central player in driving imatinib resistance. Several key observations underscore the critical role of LIN28A in imatinib resistance. LIN28A is both overexpressed and over-phosphorylated in ImR cells. ShRNA-mediated depletion of LIN28A in ImR cells re-sensitized them to imatinib, whereas ectopic expression of LIN28A in K562 cells promoted imatinib resistance. We show that LIN28A regulates a robust kinase-phosphorylation signalling network governing cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism to confer resistance. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of LIN28A-regulated kinases, including PKC, AKT, SGK1, and RPS6K, significantly suppressed ImR cell proliferation. Midostaurin, a kinase inhibitor for PKC and FLT3 used in the clinic to treat AML characterized with FLT3-ITD, exhibited a remarkable effect in re-sensitizing ImR cells to imatinib.

We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor's transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a 'kinetic trap' during G-protein activation.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

Our study investigates real-time EEG responses to pulsed tPBM in 46 healthy young adults across a wide range of skin tones, quantified using individual topography angle (ITA) metrics. Participants received stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex using varied combinations of wavelength (808 vs. 1064 nm), frequency (10 Hz vs. 40 Hz), and irradiance (100, 150, and 200 mW/cm2). EEG spectral power and sample entropy were assessed across five canonical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and low gamma) during and after stimulation. Our findings revealed frequency- and region-specific neuromodulation, with 1064 nm and 40 Hz parameters consistently enhancing widespread beta and gamma power, and 808 nm at 40 Hz yielding the most robust alpha power increases, contrary to the initial hypothesis that 10 Hz stimulation would elicit greater alpha enhancement. Entropy changes were more transient and stimulus-bound, while power effects, particularly in alpha and gamma bands, showed sustained post-stimulation persistence. Notably, lighter skin tones and higher irradiance were consistently associated with greater EEG modulation, highlighting the significant impact of melanin-related light attenuation on PBM efficacy.

The majority of NRPSs remain silent potentially attributed to factors such as the low activity of the initiation unit or insufficient precursor supply. Exchanging the starter condensation (Cs) domains within initiation unit can change the length of acyl chains of NRPs, hinting at a promising strategy through swapping of a well-studied Cs domain to activate the initiation unit and harness primary metabolites as precursors, which may offer a new option to access silent BGCs. Here, we first pinpointed two highly efficient fusion sites for initiation unit exchanges. Subsequently, they were validated by replacing the initiation region of endopyrrole pathway with a Cs-containing initiation unit for generation of a lipo-endopyrrole derivate. We promptly leveraged this strategy of changing initiation unit to target six previously silent NRPS BGCs, three BGCs were successfully activated and five novel lipopeptides were identified, demonstrating its application to recover silent BGCs. Furthermore, we extended this strategy in more BGCs from different bacteria. Utilizing a heterologous Cs-containing unit to replace the initiation region of chitinimide biosynthetic pathway led to successful incorporation of N-terminal fatty acid chains into chitinimide to create artificial lipo-chitinimides.

It has been proposed that in order to perform motor adaptation, the brain continuously updates an error sensitivity signal that controls how much is learned from a past error. Such error sensitivity reflects the speed of learning, and understanding its dynamics is crucial to promoting efficient learning. In our experiment, healthy participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task requiring reaching multiple targets using a joystick. They experienced two periods of stable perturbations and two periods of random perturbations. In agreement with past research, we found that error sensitivity is lower in unstable environments. Moreover, error sensitivity is higher in a stable environment without perturbation than in a stable environment with perturbations.

In this study, we investigate the role of N4-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the sole enzyme responsible for catalyzing the ac4C modification, in uterine function. Our findings revealed that knockdown of NAT10 in cultured human endometrial stromal cells leads to decreased progesterone receptor (PGR) expression and compromised decidualization. Mechanistically, NAT10 is found to enhance the stability of PGR mRNA through its ac4C modification in the coding sequence (CDS). Furthermore, conditional deletion of Nat10 in the mouse uterus using Pgr-Cre resulted in defective pubertal uterine development, characterized by a thinner stroma and reduced endometrial gland number. These mice were infertile in adulthood, experiencing failures in both implantation and decidualization. However, heterozygous Nat10 conditional knockout mice showed reduced NAT10 expression in the uterus without affecting uterine development or fertility. To bridge the gap between heterozygous and homozygous knockout conditions, we employed Remodelin, an inhibitor of NAT10, in adult female mice, to mimic an intermediate gene dosage. Our results demonstrated that inhibiting NAT10 with Remodelin preserved uterine structures but disrupted the PGR signaling pathway, leading to impaired uterine function during pregnancy. In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that NAT10 safeguards uterine function and fertility by regulating the ac4C modification of PGR mRNA.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

J.; Berkowitz, B.; Berkowitz, B.; Storm, J. A.; Lu, J.; Lehri, D.; Wijenayake, S.; Marrocco, J.; Kentner, A. C.", "abstract": "Parental communication signals are transmitted through nursing and critically shape neurodevelopmental trajectories. Mirroring some well characterized effects of gestational challenges in rodents, maternal immune activation (MIA) during the lactational period disrupts maternal physiology, decreases milk quality, and is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. This occurs without MIA significantly affecting maternal care. While gestational MIA models are responsive to environmental interventions, which beneficially alter maternal milk composition and associated offspring outcomes, the milk-borne mediators underlying resilience remain poorly understood. Given their ability to transport and deposit biologically active cargos, we propose that milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) are vehicles that deliver environmental programming signals (e.g., miRNAs) from nursing mothers to their offspring. Using a rat model, we show that lactational MIA altered MEV miRNA cargo and expression of hippocampal miRNAs in offspring. Several miRNAs in MEVs were also found in the hippocampus of matching offspring. Remarkably, the miRNA dysregulation observed in MEVs and hippocampus was rescued when dams were raised in an enriched environment, suggesting environmental enrichment protected from the effects of MIA, as also observed in the behavioral phenotype. RNA-seq of adult offspring hippocampus showed long-term transcriptional changes associated with the gene targets of early-life regulated miRNAs. Our results position MEV miRNA cargos as dynamic programming signals by which maternal experience is communicated to offspring, encoding both stress-induced and protective cues that influence development. This suggests that breastfeeding interventions can regulate the genetic cargo of the milk, programming the life of developing infants.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss is a ubiquitous malady in the geriatric population, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We compared onset and offset responses of single neurons in the primary (A1), rostral (R), and caudolateral (CL) areas of the auditory cortex using spectral, spatial, and temporal stimuli in a young macaque monkey with normal-hearing and an aged macaque monkey with high frequency hearing loss. In the young monkey, core areas exhibited a significantly higher proportion of neurons responsive to both the onset and the offset of stimuli compared to the belt area CL, indicating functional differentiation. However, this distinction diminished with age, with the proportion of neurons with both onset and offset responses becoming more uniform across cortical areas. Onset firing rates were generally higher in the aged monkey, but with a lower signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting increased neural excitability but reduced response fidelity. Notably, CL neurons in the aged monkey exhibited a significantly greater disparity between the best frequencies for onset and offset responses, suggesting reduced spectral precision. Additionally, spectral tuning bandwidths (BW) were broader in the CL neurons in the aged monkey, while in the young monkey, A1 neurons exhibited significantly narrower onset BWs compared to offset BWs, a distinction that was lost in the aged monkey. These findings highlight a fundamental asymmetry in auditory cortical processing and suggest that belt area CL is particularly susceptible to age-related changes. Understanding these neural mechanisms provides insights into auditory aging and potential strategies for mitigating hearing deficits.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

J.; Moll, C. K. E.; Gulberti, A.; Poetter-Nerger, M.; Engel, A. K.", "abstract": "Background Accurate temporal prediction is essential for adaptive behavior and relies on coordinated neural activity within cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Parkinson's disease (PD) with the main hallmark of dopaminergic depletion and abnormal neural synchrony, impairs this ability. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a widely used treatment for reducing motor symptoms in PD, but its effects on temporal prediction remain not fully understood. Objective This study aimed to investigate how STN-DBS influences temporal prediction performance and its underlying oscillatory dynamics in PD patients, with a particular focus on beta band power and delta band inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC). Methods 13 PD patients (5 female, age: 64 {+/-} 5.7 years; disease duration: 11.8 {+/-} 1.8 years) with STN-DBS performed a temporal prediction task with (DBS ON) and without (DBS OFF) stimulation, while EEG (64 channels) was recorded. 20 age-matched healthy controls completed the same task. Behavioral performance was assessed using psychometric function slopes. Time-frequency analyses and source-level EEG measures examined beta power and delta ITPC. Results PD patients showed impaired temporal prediction performance compared to controls, reflected in shallower psychometric slopes. DBS significantly improved performance to a level comparable to those of controls. EEG revealed reduced beta suppression in PD patients during DBS OFF, while beta suppression in DBS ON was comparable to controls. Both DBS OFF and ON exhibited reduced delta ITPC compared to controls. In DBS ON, source-level delta ITPC was positively correlated with temporal prediction accuracy. Conclusion STN-DBS improves temporal prediction performance in PD, likely through modulation of beta and delta oscillatory activity. While beta power suppression is partially restored, deficits in delta phase alignment persist, suggesting frequency-specific DBS effects on temporal prediction processes.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

T.; Marlin, S.; Doetzlhofer, A.", "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein TRIM71 is essential for brain development, and recent genetic studies in humans have identified TRIM71 as a risk gene for congenital hydrocephaly (CH). Here, we show that mono-allelic missense mutations in TRIM71 are associated with hearing loss (HL) and inner ear aplasia in humans. Utilizing conditional Trim71 knockout mice carrying a CH and HL-associated mutation, we demonstrate that loss of TRIM71 function during early otic development (embryonic day 9-10) causes severe hearing loss. While inner ear morphogenesis occurs normally in Trim71 knockout mice, we find that early otic loss of TRIM71 function disrupts the highly stereotyped timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation within the inner ear auditory sensory organ (cochlea), resulting in the premature formation and innervation of mechano-sensory hair cells. Transcriptomic profiling of Trim71 deficient cochlear progenitor cells identifies Inhba and Tgfbr2 as targets of TRIM71 repression, and our analysis of InhbaTgfbr1 double knockout mice indicates that TRIM71 maintains hair cell progenitors in a proliferative and undifferentiated state by restricting TGF-{beta}-type signaling. Characterization of hair cells and their associated neurons in adult Trim71 knockout mice revealed abnormally short inner hair cell stereocilia, reduced pre-synaptic terminals, and neuronal degeneration in the outer hair cell region, providing a basis for the observed hearing deficits in Trim71 knockout mice.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Many African great ape chromosomes possess large subterminal heterochromatic caps at their telomeres that are conspicuously absent from the human lineage. Leveraging the complete sequences of great ape genomes, we characterize the organization of subterminal caps and reconstruct the evolutionary history of these regions in chimpanzees and gorillas. Detailed analyses of the pCht satellite composition and associated segmental duplication (SD) spacers confirm two independent origins in the Pan and gorilla lineages. In chimpanzee and bonobo, we estimate these structures emerged ~7.5 million years ago (MYA) in contrast to gorilla where they expanded more recently ~5.1 MYA and now make up 8.5% of the total gorilla genome. In both lineages, the SD spacers punctuating the pCht heterochromatic satellite arrays correspond to pockets of hypomethylation, although in gorilla such regions are significantly more hypomethylated (p<2.2e-16) than chimpanzee or bonobo. Allelic pairs of subterminal caps show a high degree of sequence divergence (9-11%) with bonobo showing less divergent haplotypes and less hypomethylated spacers. In contrast, we identify virtually identical subterminal caps mapping to nonhomologous chromosomes within a species, suggesting ectopic recombination potentially mediated by SD spacers. We find that the transition regions from heterochromatic subterminal caps to euchromatin are enriched for structural variant insertions and lineage-specific duplicated genes. We suggest these regions are hotspots for accelerating ape genome evolution.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The vast majority of GPCR drugs bind the conserved orthosteric pocket, which can lead to non-specificity and toxicity. Precision modalities such as biased signaling and allosteric modulation could lead to GPCR therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The rational design of precision therapies is, however, limited by the lack of high-resolution functional understanding of GPCRs. Here we present a general approach to chart high-resolution functional maps of GPCRs and apply the approach to the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor. Across ~150,000 measurements of five different phenotypes, we construct an unprecedented picture of signaling properties of this model receptor. A contiguous core activation network of residues required for signaling links the ligand binding site to the transducer binding site. Residues controlling signaling parameters connect to this core network, with determinants of signaling bias located more peripherally. Dose-response curves for nearly all possible amino acid substitutions, a total of >7,500 different proteins, reveal the relationship between expression level and potency; and the spatial distribution of potency changing residues. The multi-modal maps rationalize previous serendipitously discovered allosteric sites and prospectively annotate novel sites to target. Application of this approach across the superfamily of GPCRs will unlock deep understanding of these critical molecules and enable rational design of precision GPCR therapeutics.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

A.; Zuke, J. T.", "abstract": "Early life pain and stress have lasting consequences on nervous system development that can interact with later stress or trauma to create a susceptibility to fear, anxiety, depression and chronic pain among other psychological disorders. Recent work has identified changes in corticotropin releasing factor signaling in limbic system structures, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, as a key mechanism behind these changes - albeit in a sex-dependent manner. CRF has two major receptors, CRHR1 and CRHR2 which have also been shown to play key roles in fear and pain expression. The current work examines the effects of early life pain designed to mimic the neonatal medical trauma that occurs in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), paired with a juvenile trauma in the form of fear conditioning, on expression of crhr1 and crhr2 mRNA in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala as well as the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamus. While prior work has demonstrated that early life pain significantly impacts expression of the CRF ligand, the current data demonstrate that early life pain and fear conditioning largely fail to affect CRH receptor expression in the amygdala. Modest changes in expression to crhr2 in a sex and region-specific manner were observed in the hypothalamus.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

G.; Froese, T.", "abstract": "Neuronal rhythms coordinate cognitive and physiological processes across multiple timescales, with slower frequencies potentially forming the basis for meaningful contextual transitions. However, investigating these slower aspects requires methodological innovation beyond standard EEG approaches. Using a minimalist virtual environment paradigm, we found that infra-slow EEG oscillations (ISOs) in the 0.016-0.2 Hz frequency range tracked meaningful contextual transitions during social interaction. Furthermore, participants who successfully engaged in a perceptual crossing task exhibited increased alignment in the spectral power of ISOs when measured in the temporal vicinity of the task response (before-after button press), compared to those who failed. This task-locked alignment was accompanied by similar dynamics in respiratory pressure and electrodermal activity, suggesting that ISOs reflect the integration of physiological, cognitive, and social processes, with their alignment facilitating shared understanding and joint action. These findings highlight the role of ISOs in mediating the temporal dynamics of social cognition and show that inter-participant alignment in ISOs can serve as a proxy for the complex interplay between body physiology, cognition, and social behavior.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The choice of perturbation sites must satisfy two key criteria: efficacy in evoking significant responses and selectivity for the desired target effects. This choice is currently based on laborious trial-and-error procedures, unfeasible for sequences of multi-site stimulations. Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are urgently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity. Second, we provide an efficient method to design multi-site stimulation patterns by combining approaches from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory and data-driven methods.

D.; Carlson, E. L.; Vento, P. J.", "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making requires the ability to weigh the relative costs versus the benefits of our actions and to flexibly respond to changing environmental contingencies. While midbrain dopamine (DA) has been a major focus of study for its role in associative learning, motivation, and reward seeking, far less is known regarding the contribution of inhibitory dopamine inputs in promoting behavioral inhibition and avoidance learning. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) sends dense GABAergic projections to DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mounting evidence suggests the RMTg to VTA circuit is required to suppress reward seeking under punishment, but it remains unclear whether stimulation of this pathway is sufficient to drive learning and promote shifts in cost-benefit decisions. To test this, we developed two separate tasks of passive and active avoidance in rats where lever pressing for food reward was associated with repeated contingent optogenetic stimulation of the RMTg to VTA pathway. In a one-lever fixed ratio 5 food-seeking task, we found that pairing RMTg to VTA stimulation with reward delivery caused a robust, yet transient suppression of reward seeking that quickly returned to baseline after contingent stimulation ceased. When given an alternative reward choice, however, RMTg to VTA stimulation caused a rapid and enduring shift in subjective choice leading to persistent and selective avoidance of the stimulation-paired reward. These findings support a multifaceted role for the RMTg to VTA pathway in learning and decision-making and provide key insights into the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral avoidance and maladaptive reward seeking.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

The {gamma}-Pcdhs (expressed from the Pcdhg gene cluster) are particularly important for neuronal self-avoidance in starburst amacrine cells in the mouse retina. Here, we used mouse mutants to test two of the C-type isoforms - {gamma}C4 and {gamma}C5 - and found that neither was required for normal self-avoidance. Conversely, when we analyzed a mutant with only {gamma}C4 intact, we found significant failures in self-avoidance that could not be completely rescued by overexpression of this isoform from a transgene. We have recently found that this isoform is essential for normal neuronal survival during development, and our new findings here support the hypothesis that {gamma}C4 is specialized for the survival function at the expense of a significant role in self-avoidance.", "date": "2025-05-30", "journal": ""}

While short-read sequencing (SRS) remains dominant due to its high accuracy and affordability, its limitations in complex genomic regions have spurred the adoption of long-read sequencing (LRS) platforms, such as those from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Despite these advances, there is still a lack of systematic, large-scale benchmarking of variant calling performance across diverse platforms, variant types, sequencing depths, and genomic contexts. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of sequencing technologies and variant calling algorithms, evaluating their performance in detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs). We show that while SRS combined with DeepVariant or DRAGEN offers excellent small variant detection in well-mapped regions, LRS technologies significantly outperform SRS in complex regions and SV detection. PacBio achieves high SNP and smaller SV accuracy even at moderate coverage, while ONT excels in detecting large SVs. The SV callers Dysgu and SVIM emerged as top performers across LRS datasets. Our results highlight that no single platform is optimal for all variant types or regions: SRS remains optimal for high-throughput small variant detection in accessible regions, whereas LRS is critical for capturing SVs and resolving difficult-to-map loci.
