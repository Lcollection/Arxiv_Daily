However, prospective tracing approaches inevitably encounter outstanding challenges including barcoding precision, barcode diversity, and detection efficiency, which can skew inferred lineage relationships. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) even face risks of DNA-damage-induced toxicity-related cell death. We explored the use of naturally occurring somatic mutations in mitochondrial transcripts detected in single-cell RNA-seq as genetic lineage barcodes in hPSCs. In this study, we used an enrichment of scRNA-seq mitochondrial reads and a robust computational method to identify clonally relevant mitochondrial variants as endogenous genetic barcodes for clonal tracking of early embryonic hematopoiesis from hPSC. We modeled the development of embryonic tissues from hPSCs and delineated cell fate specification by integrating synthetic barcoding with mitochondrial lineage tracing. Using a biophysical model, we reconstructed the sequential transcriptional logic of fate specification and its underlying regulatory network. We further applied mitochondrial lineage tracing to spatial transcriptomics, which enabled us to identify the spatial clonal architecture of human embryonic organoids. Our analysis revealed that this spatial zonation was orchestrated by NOTCH-mediated crosstalk between stromal cells and hematopoietic progenitors. Our multi-modal framework links clonal dynamics with niche-specific fate decisions, providing a generalizable approach to dissecting tissue organization in development and disease. This study underscores the utility of mitochondrial variants as endogenous markers for high-resolution spatial clonal tracking in stem cell-derived organoid models of human development.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

While some evidence suggests that there is a shared system in the human brain for processing semantic information from native and non-native languages, other evidence suggests that semantic processing is language-specific. We conducted a study to determine how semantic representations in the brains of bilinguals can support both shared and language-specific processing for different languages. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to record brain responses while participants read several hours of natural narratives in their native (Chinese) and non-native (English) languages. These data were then used to specifically and comprehensively compare semantic representations between the two languages. First, we show that semantic representations are largely shared between languages. Second, we show that there are finer-grained differences that systematically alter how the same meaning is represented between different languages. Our results suggest that for bilinguals, semantic representations in the brain are shared across languages but modulated by each language. These results reconcile current competing theories of bilingual language processing.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The activation of transcription factor Max-Like Protein x (MLX) is modulated by competition between active dimerization and inactive association with cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs). However, LD association has been shown to depend on the neutral lipid composition. This work explores the mechanism by which MLX specifically targets LDs rich in triacylglycerol (TG) over those with abundant sterol esters (SE). We compare the association ensembles for a potential minimal targeting sequence, an amphipathic helix-loop-helix hairpin, and the full dimerization and cytoplasmic localization domain (DCD), finding the latter requires larger packing defects and quantifiably alters LD membrane properties. Surprisingly, direct interactions with TG neutral lipids are not observed for either sequence. Instead, targeting to SE-rich LDs is blocked for both sequences by insufficient packing defects. We additionally explore the full mechanism of hairpin association, aiming to understand sequence-specific features that enable strong membrane association. We find that there are multiple association pathways, but that each involves a catch, dive, snorkeling, and embedding phase. The combination of multiple catch and dive residues placed on opposing ends of amphipathic helices lengthens the catch phase, greatly enhancing association in a manner that resembles kinetic selection. Once bound, locking interhelical interactions block dissociation. Collectively, our findings suggest that in addition to relative binding affinities, both kinetics and altered surface properties due to protein association could influence competition within the LD proteome.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we critically examine two commonly discussed ideas in the field: that TCR specificity prediction can be separated from functional activation modeling, and that unsupervised sequence-based approaches can generalize across diverse antigen contexts. We introduce a cell-based assay for directly quantifying TCR-pMHC binding kinetics using monomeric ligands, while simultaneously assessing early activation via CD3{zeta} phosphorylation. These kinetic parameters provide a mechanistic basis for specificity that avoids the artifacts of equilibrium-based measurements. We propose a predictive modeling framework that integrates biophysical measurements with machine learning, and outline strategies for generating high-throughput training data to support this approach.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing this connection remain unclear. Here, we identified MISO (Mitochondrial Inner membrane Subdomain Organizer), a novel protein that regulates mitochondrial dynamics and drives SMEM formation in response to inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) stresses. We demonstrate that MISO regulates mitochondrial dynamics in both Drosophila stem cells in vivo and mammalian cells in vitro. Mechanistic study showed that MISO promotes mitochondrial fission while inhibiting fusion. Notably, MISO induces SMEM formation and facilitates their peripheral fission, which regulates the lysosomal degradation of mtDNA. Meanwhile, MISO knock-out completely abolishes SMEM generation, indicating that MISO is both necessary and sufficient for SMEM biogenesis. Furthermore, SMEM functionality requires MISO-dependent recruitment of MTFP1 and subsequent engagement of downstream effectors, including the FIS1-DRP1 fission machinery. IMM stresses, including damages in mtDNA, OXPHOS complexes, and cristae, stabilize the normally short-lived MISO protein, thereby triggering SMEM assembly. Furthermore, MISO-orchestrated SMEM formation depends on its C-terminal domain, likely mediated by oligomerization. Together, our work elucidates a molecular mechanism by which IMM stresses affect mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Although digestibility and fermentation differ by protein type, a systematic evaluation of how these differences shape microbial diversity and metabolic capacity is lacking. This Meta-analysis integrates conventional and machine learning approaches to identify microbial biomarkers and predicted functions associated with dietary protein sources in murine models. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 10 murine studies (n = 187) comparing animal and plant protein diets. Alpha diversity was assessed using Shannon, Inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices. Beta diversity was evaluated using Aitchison distances. LEfSe and class-weighted Random Forest models were applied to identify differentially abundant taxa and predictive microbial features. Functional profiles were inferred using PICRUSt2, and taxon, pathway associations were examined via correlation and network analysis. Results: Plant-protein diets significantly increased microbial richness and evenness across all alpha diversity metrics. Thirty-three genera were enriched, including Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, and Allobaculum, associated with SCFA production, nitrogen recycling, and bile acid metabolism. Animal-protein diets favored Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Colidextribacter, linked to proteolytic fermentation and sulfur metabolism. Aitchison PCA revealed distinct community structures (ANOSIM R = 0.663, p < 0.001). Random Forest models achieved >88% accuracy (AUC = 0.995) in predicting diet groups. Functional prediction showed plant diets enriched SCFA and aromatic amino acid degradation pathways, while animal diets favored sulfur and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Network analysis identified Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillus as central taxa in plant- and animal-associated subnetworks, respectively. However, variation in fat and fiber across studies may confound these patterns, as these covariates were not consistently reported. Conclusion: Dietary protein source shapes gut microbial composition and predicted function in murine models, reflecting distinct shifts in microbial nitrogen and sulfur metabolism.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

We also considered an alternate hypothesis: cationic electrostatic interactions between histones and negatively charged phospholipids, deforming endothelial cell membranes and thereby allowing extracellular Ca2+ entry. A role for SOCE in histone responses was ruled out by genetic ablation of the ORAI1/2/3 channel trio; histone effects were blocked by application of the multivalent cation gadolinium Gd3+. Using live cell video microscopy of endothelial cell labeled with membrane dye FM1-43, we recorded fast plasma membrane movements including vesiculation, blebbing, and ruffling of lamellipodia over 60 minutes following histone exposure. These cell membrane theatrics were markedly different from the uniform pattern of rapid exocytosis and subsequent blebbing produced by calcium overload with ionomycin. The membrane permeabilization produced by histones, and not ionomycin, was transient and a subset of cells recovered membrane integrity within 1 hour. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented histone-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload while surprisingly exacerbating plasma membrane deformation. Conversely, decreasing the density of the negative charge surface by adding calcium or or increasing extracellular Ca2+ levels effectively screened common membrane phospholipids from interactions with labeled histones and prevented endothelial damage in cells exposed to histones. Collectively these results indicate that low extracellular Ca2+ levels enhance interactions between histones and endothelial cell membrane phospholipids to increase cytotoxicity. Importantly, this supports the concept of aggressive Ca2+ repletion during resuscitation to prevent hypocalcemia, stabilize endothelial cell membranes and improve cardiovascular recovery from shock.\n\nSignificanceIn acute critical illness, the rapid collapse of vascular endothelial functions drives aberrant blood clotting and organ failure through mechanisms that are not understood. Emerging evidence that early administration of donor plasma improves survival of trauma patients has transformed the massive transfusion protocols used in surgical settings, but the sodium citrate included in transfused blood products to prevent coagulation often produces significant and severe hypocalcemia. Here, we demonstrate that cytotoxic trauma factors that are elevated in the blood during resuscitation interact electrostatically with endothelial cell phospholipids, and that low Ca2+ exacerbates toxicity by increasing this interaction. Using high speed video imaging, we demonstrate fast endothelial cell membrane movements in response to injury, including protrusion and ruffling of lamellipodia, release and reuptake of extracellular vesicles, and blebbing. These findings provide important insights into the nature of shock-induced endotheliopathy and highlight the potential cardiovascular risk associated with chelation-induced hypocalcemia during resuscitation.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

The changes in the numerical measurements or scores over time can be readily plotted using computer software to show an equation for the line of best fit for either linear or log equations, together with the coefficient of determination (R2). Despite the ease of generating this type of graphical representations caution is required in interpreting the R2 value with reference to medical case reports. To understand why this is so, at a basic level, four scenarios using hypothetical patient scores were used to generate scatter plots showing the equation for the line of best fit and R2 values with comparison to the average and standard deviation (SD) values. The graphical examples are used to supplement the more complex mathematical and statistical explanations and choice for effect measures that are available. It was found R2 values for log equations for the line of best fit did not follow a trend with increasing treatment days. For linear equations, higher R2 value may not necessarily correspond to a lower standard deviation (SD) value for the averaged scores. The R2 value can be influenced by the day on which the scores were recorded, despite the equivalence of the average scores and SD values. R2 values may not indicate the strength of a treatment benefit or the magnitude of scatter between data sets. Score averaging can increase R2 values, while average values remain the same but with the SD value decreasing.

These markers recognize polysialic acid (polySia), which is a highly conserved glycosylation modification in humans and vertebrates. In the retina, polySia is present on Muller glia predominantly in the form of polySia-NCAM. We used GFP-EndoNDM and mAb735 to investigate polySia distribution in Muller glia of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, rodents, retinal organoids, and humans. In adult retinas of most species, polySia was localized to the Muller glia and spanned outer to inner retina, with inner plexiform layer (IPL) sublaminae ramifications. Gliosis was also detectable in degenerating murine retinas. Notable species differences were that only outer retinal regions of Muller glia were labelled in adult zebrafish, whereas the outer Muller glia body up to the first IPL sublamina was labelled in adult turquoise killifish. There was no significant retinal polySia labeling in larval zebrafish, but it was present in the brain. Larval turquoise killifish have polySia throughout the retina, similar to other adult vertebrates.

Despite successful preservation efforts, their immense biodiversity is still severely underrepresented in germplasm biobanks throughout the world. These culture libraries can preserve genetic diversity and provide inoculum for marine forest restoration and mariculture ventures, and potentially accelerate the selection and breeding of climate-resilient and high-yielding strains. However, the complex life cycles and body plans of seaweeds pose a huge challenge for the development of standardized phenotyping and isolating protocols for microscopic stages, especially with the efficiency necessary to deal with the current pace of global climatic changes. Here, we present SAMMBA (Seaweed Automatable Microplate Microscopy for Breeding Approaches), an end-to-end pipeline for the high-throughput isolation, phenotyping and storage of macroalgal cells in 384-well plates (384WP). By optimizing fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis, along with a novel fragmentation method and dilution-to-extinction isolation, different unialgal seaweed tissues could be regrown after thousand-fold dilutions. In a single plate, we successfully isolated 68 singlet gametophyte fragments of Laminaria ochroleuca (39 males, 29 females; 17.7% efficiency) and 60 spores of Phyllariopsis purpurascens (12.1% efficiency). Furthermore, the taxonomic versatility of SAMMBA was demonstrated through the successful isolation of 60 unialgal cultures of red algae (Halymenia sp., Hydrolithon sp., Erythrotrichia sp.) and 10 strains of the green alga Ulva sp, without cross-contamination. The viability and unialgal nature of the isolated strains were verified by distributing a single L. ochroleuca strain across an entire 384-well plate and imaging each well over 30 days. We found that the average specific daily growth rates (daily SGR) per well were 0.130 {+/-} 0.006 and 0.117 {+/-} 0.01 day-1 for males and females, respectively, showing a significant difference between sexes (n = 768; p = 1.27e-53), while edge effects significantly reduced daily SGR in males but not in females. This approach dramatically increases experimental reproducibility and statistical power compared to conventional methods. Due to its modular design and cost-effectiveness, SAMMBA is readily adaptable to macroalgal repositories globally. It supports high-throughput, selective recovery of unialgal strains without reliance on robotic platforms, while remaining fully compatible with automation. This system significantly expands the experimental and operational capacity in macroalgal hatcheries, providing a scalable foundation for phenomics, domestication programs, and standardized, verifiable biobanking of unialgal strains.

Using simulation models of mate choice where female preferences are socially transmitted and male traits are genetically inherited, we show that the interaction between cultural and genetic transmission creates novel evolutionary dynamics. In a first model (hereafter the 'Cultural Model') representing classical cultural evolution scenarios, we show that traditions emerge only when conformity disproportionately amplifies majority behaviours. In a second model (hereafter the 'Gene-Culture Model'), we show that when mate choice depends on both preference and male trait availability -- distinguishing preference and choice --, even simple social learning strategies can establish persistent traditions. This occurs because of positive frequency-dependent interactions between preferences and traits dynamics that stabilize majority behaviours independently of majority exaggeration. Our findings have broader implications for cultural evolution theory, suggesting that many behaviours depending on resource availability may exhibit tradition-like patterns under less stringent social learning conditions than previously assumed. By distinguishing between preference and choice, and demonstrating the importance of gene-culture interactions, this study advocates for more integrated approaches to understanding cultural evolution that consider the interplay between multiple inheritance systems.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here we further develop this useful assay towards scalable drug discovery applications. We show the importance of defined neuron-to-astrocyte ratios for optimal cellular distribution and surface adherence in HTS-compatible cell culture vessels and how the cell type ratios determine network firing patterns. We identify DAPT, a molecule previously shown to promote neuronal maturation and synapse formation, as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability. Addition of GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons increases the network spike frequency while reducing network spike amplitudes. We develop a pixel-based analysis for plate reader data to access local field activity in an automated and scalable calcium imaging environment.

Among these, RNA stability emerges as a previously underappreciated regulator of gene expression, exerting a stronger influence than transcription on total RNA levels for ~10% of activity-dependent genes. We go on to profile 3'UTR mRNA motifs that are sufficient to modulate activity-dependent mRNA stability and employ machine learning to identify the neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein HuD as a key regulator of activity-dependent mRNA stabilization. We demonstrate that HuD shapes activity-dependent mRNA abundance of hundreds of transcripts in both soma and distal neuronal processes and that neuronal activity drives the reorganization of HuD-interacting proteins, thereby stabilizing HuD-bound mRNAs and directing them into translationally active granules. Finally, we find that many variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt or promote aberrant activity-dependent changes in mRNA stability.

We show that neural population dynamics in monkey primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex exhibit a compositional structure with three components that enable posture-dependent control: first, a posture subspace containing fixed points visited whenever the arm is in a specific posture; second, rotational dynamics that transition between these fixed points, systematically organized so that similar rotations produce similar movements while continuously updating the posture representation; third, a condition-independent shift dimension that tracks trial progression across all movements.

In a sample of 57 children aged 5-9, musical training was linked to enhanced reading and phonological awareness (PA). EEG during story listening revealed that higher left-hemispheric and lower right-hemispheric CTS were also associated with higher reading scores. However, children with higher musicality exhibited stronger reading skills at lower levels of left-hemispheric CTS, suggesting more adult-like speech analysis. Critically, PA mediated the relationship between musicality and reading: greater musicality was associated with stronger PA, which in turn predicted higher reading performance, independent of demographic and cognitive factors. These findings indicate that musical training supports literacy by enhancing PA and shaping left-lateralized speech processing.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

This process often involves organizing actions into stereotyped \"chunks''. Intriguingly, brain regions that are critical for action chunking, such as the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), also exhibit neural dynamics that encode the passage of time. How such brain regions support both task-specific motor habits and task-invariant internal timing, two seemingly distinct functions, remains a fundamental question. Here we show, using recurrent neural network models, that these two functions emerge from a single computational principle: sensory compression, the functional compression of high-dimensional sensory information into a low-dimensional representation. We find that a sensory bottleneck forces the network to develop stable internal dynamics that implicitly encode time, which in turn serve as a scaffold upon which the brain learns action chunks in response to predictable environmental regularities. This mechanism unifies task-invariant time coding and sensory-guided motor timing as two outcomes of the same process of sensory compression, providing a general principle for how the brain mirrors environmental regularities in both internal stable neural trajectories and external consistent motor habits.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether alpha-rhythmic temporal integration is a factor in visual crowding and whether this relationship is mediated by spatial grouping mechanisms. 47 participants performed a Vernier discrimination task, in which we manipulated both the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between flankers and targets, and the spatial configuration of the flankers. Specifically, flankers were arranged to either induce crowding or \"uncrowding\", through the manipulation of good-Gestalt properties. Our results show that crowding has a temporal integration period of around 170 ms but this varies substantially across individuals. Importantly, resting-state IAF predicted individual variance in temporal integration windows: individuals with faster endogenous alpha rhythms could begin to segregate targets from distractors at shorter SOAs. Crucially, this effect was specific for crowding-inducing flankers and disappeared when flankers led to uncrowding. These results suggest that top-down spatial grouping can overwrite the temporal integration constraint imposed by alpha oscillations, highlighting both the relevance of alpha for understanding limits on peripheral visual processing as well as the flexible and context-dependent role of alpha in temporal integration.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

While previous studies suggest that pyramidal-interneuron network gamma (PING) and interneuron network gamma (ING) mechanisms contribute to these oscillations, the precise role of inhibitory circuits remains unclear. Using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices, we examined synaptic input and spike timing in neurons across layer II/III mEC. We found that fast-spiking interneurons exhibited robust gamma-frequency firing, while excitatory neurons engaged in gamma cycle skipping. Stellate and pyramidal cells received minimal recurrent excitation, whereas fast-spiking interneurons received strong excitatory input. Both excitatory neurons and fast-spiking interneurons received gamma frequency inhibition, emphasizing the role of recurrent inhibition in gamma rhythm generation. Notably, gamma activity persisted after AMPA/kainate receptor blockade, indicating that interneurons can sustain gamma oscillations independently through an ING mechanism. Selective activation of PV+ interneurons confirmed their ability to sustain fast gamma inhibition autonomously. To further assess the interplay of excitation and inhibition, we developed computational network models constrained by our experimental data. Simulations revealed that weak excitatory input to interneurons supports fast ING-dominated rhythms (~100-140 Hz), while strengthening excitatory drive induces a transition to slower PING-dominated oscillations (60-80 Hz). These findings highlight the dominant role of inhibitory circuits in sustaining gamma rhythms, demonstrate how excitation strength tunes the oscillatory regime, and refine models of entorhinal gamma oscillations critical for spatial memory processing.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

O.; Johnson, L. A.", "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are emerging as critical regulators of cellular metabolism and inflammation, with their accumulation in microglia linked to aging and neurodegeneration. Perilipin 2 (Plin2) is a ubiquitously expressed LD associated protein that stabilizes lipid stores, and in peripheral tissues, its upregulation promotes lipid retention, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. However, the role of Plin2 in brain-resident microglia remains undefined. Here, we used CRISPR engineered Plin2 knockout (KO) BV2 microglia to investigate the contribution of Plin2 to lipid accumulation, bioenergetics, and immune function. Compared to wild-type (WT) cells, Plin2 KO microglia exhibited markedly reduced LD burden under both basal and oleic acid loaded conditions. Functionally, this was associated with enhanced phagocytosis of zymosan particles, even after lipid loading, indicating improved clearance capacity in the absence of Plin2. Transcriptomic analyses revealed genotype specific responses to amyloid beta (AB), particularly in pathways related to mitochondrial metabolism. Seahorse assays confirmed that Plin2 KO cells exhibit a distinct bioenergetic profile, characterized by reduced basal respiration and glycolysis, yet preserved mitochondrial capacity, increased spare respiratory reserve, and a blunted glycolytic response to AB. Together, these findings identify Plin2 as a regulator of microglial lipid storage and metabolic state, with its loss alleviating lipid accumulation, improving phagocytic function, and altering AB induced metabolic reprogramming. Targeting Plin2 may therefore represent a potential strategy to modulate microglial metabolism and function in aging and neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Small molecule inhibitors such as bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitors developed to target epigenetic dependencies have demonstrated significant promise in preclinical models. However, clinical success with epigenetic drugs as single agents has been limited by emergence of tumor cell tolerance and escape, which often occurs due to transcriptional rewiring. Ewing sarcoma (EwS), a bone and soft tissue tumor driven by the EWS::FLI1 fusion oncoprotein, is characterized by profound oncogene-dependent enhancer reprogramming. Thus, epigenetic modifying therapies are of high therapeutic interest. In this study, we sought to elucidate how EwS cells escape BET inhibition to identify biologically informed drug combinations that could be advanced to clinical trials. As expected, EwS cells and xenografts initially responded to BMS-986158, a pharmaceutical grade BET inhibitor, but proliferation was rapidly restored. A kinase inhibitor screen showed that BMS-986158 drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells were sensitive to inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a critical signaling node downstream of extracellular matrix (ECM) engagement. RNA sequencing revealed that DTP cells had been transcriptionally rewired and that mesenchymal signature and ECM remodeling genes were specifically upregulated. Combining BMS-986158 with the FAK inhibitor Defactinib had synergistic effects, reducing EwS cell proliferation, survival, and invasion in vitro, and significantly inhibited tumor outgrowth in vivo.

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism.

Using the Drosophila early embryo as a model system to understand NASP function in vivo, we show that NASP does not directly affect H3 nuclear import or export rates. Rather, reduced H3 levels in NASP-deficient embryos indirectly affect nuclear import and the amount of H3 deposited into chromatin.

While Gad1 is transcribed specifically in GABAergic neurons, VGAT mRNA is transcribed broadly across the nervous system, but is selectively translated in GABAergic neurons. We show that this specificity depends on CG14989, a putative long non-coding RNA located adjacent to the Gad1 gene locus that shares its GABAergic expression pattern. CG14989 RNA contains sequences complementary to three predicted miR-7 sites in the VGAT 3'UTR, and ectopic expression experiments revealed that it is sufficient for VGAT translation in non-GABAergic neurons, consistent with antagonism of miR-7-mediated repression. Furthermore, complementary regions to CG14989 are present in multiple other genes related to metabolism and signaling of GABA, suggesting a broader role for this mechanism.

In bacteria, the superfamily 2 Mfd translocase mediates TCR by displacing stalled ECs and recruiting Uvr(A)B. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we previously visualized seven Mfd-EC complexes spanning the ATP-dependent Mfd loading and EC displacement pathway [L1 -> L2(ADP) -> C1(ATP) -> C2(ATP) -> C3(ADP) -> C4(ADP) -> C5(ATP)]. The first intermediate (L1) was poorly resolved (4.1 [A] nominal resolution) due to low particle occupancy. The pathway is characterized by very large Mfd structural transitions, notably the L1 -> L2 transition. Here, we pre-loaded Mfd with ATP in the presence of the {gamma}-phosphate mimic, BeF3-, limiting rounds of ATP hydrolysis. The resulting accumulation of early intermediates allowed us to resolve the L1 intermediate to 3.5 [A] nominal resolution, revealing bound ADP-BeF3-. We also identified a new intermediate between L1 and L2, L1.5, providing further insight into Mfd conformational changes during loading.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Importing aggregation-prone proteins into yeast and human mitochondria triggered a chain of detrimental events involving extensive co-aggregation of newly-imported mitoribosome subunits and other RNA-binding proteins, as well as local disruption of mitochondrial cristae morphology.

In addition to binding DNA, C2H2 domains can mediate protein-protein interactions, facilitating oligomerization of C2H2 proteins. In this study, we identified eight C2H2 proteins in the Drosophila genome that feature a unique single C2H2 domain containing a conserved 'CGEx' motif. Yeast two-hybrid assays, SEC-MALS, and chemical cross-linking experiments revealed a strong propensity of these domains to form dimers. Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the solution structure of the dimeric C2H2 domain from IMZF (Immune-mediated Zinc Finger) protein, providing structural evidence towards the dimerization of C2H2 domains. The structure revealed that dimerization is mediated by the interface between the core C2H2 fold and the adjacent beta-strand containing 'CGEx' motif, which was further validated by structure-guided mutagenesis. A bioinformatic survey showed that 'CGEx'-type C2H2 domains are specific to Diptera. Finally, we demonstrate that putatively dimerizing C2H2 domains containing additional structural elements beyond the canonical fold are widespread among diverse eukaryotic taxa, with the highest prevalence observed in insects.

Cells were pretreated with 100nM melatonin or vehicle for 2 hours, then exposed to vehicle, IL-6 (20ng/ml), dopamine (5{micro}M or 500{micro}M), or dopamine (500{micro}M) with ascorbic acid (1mM) for 12 or 24 hours. Dopaminergic markers were assessed via real-time PCR and HPLC; metabolic outcomes were measured using Seahorse assay, central carbon metabolomics, in-cell Western assay, and glucose uptake assay; and oxidative stress was evaluated via reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide (SOX), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays. IL-6 increased dopamine levels, p-Erk1/2/Erk1/2, p-AMPK/AMPK, nucleotide pools, and TAC, while reducing dopamine turnover, SV2C expression, and spare respiratory capacity. Melatonin alone increased nucleotides and NADH, while reducing dopamine turnover, ROS, and glucose-1-phosphate. In IL-6 conditions, melatonin pretreatment enhanced spare respiratory capacity, glucose uptake, and NADH, while reducing dopamine, TAC, p-AMPK/AMPK, p-GSK3{beta}/GSK3{beta}, and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. High-dose dopamine (500{micro}M) elevated SOX, p-Erk1/2/Erk1/2, insulin receptor-, GLUT1, glycolytic ATP (glycoATP), and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption.

Although advances in clinical management have improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis and effective immunomodulatory therapies remain limited. Methods: In this study, we integrated multiple transcriptomic datasets and applied machine learning approaches, including LASSO regression, to identify a robust 13 key genes significantly associated with MI. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were subsequently performed to explore their potential biological functions. The immunological relevance of these genes was evaluated by analyzing their correlations with inflammation-related genes and those involved in immune cell migration. In addition, transcription factor (Johnson, Law et al.) and microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks were constructed to elucidate upstream regulatory mechanisms. The expression levels of the 13 key genes were validated in MI mouse model. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to identify candidate small molecules targeting core genes. Results: Among 11 cardiac cell populations identified, myeloid cells contributed most prominently to MI pathogenesis. A robust 13 gene predictive signature was established, with RNF144B and C5AR1 showing strong associations with immune modulation and disease severity. GSEA and GSVA further revealed that RNF144B was enriched in the neutrophil degranulation pathway, while C5AR1 was associated with the complement cascade. Correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship of RNF144B and C5AR1 with immunological roles. Both genes were also positively correlated with classical MI marker genes SERPINE1 and RUNX1. TF gene and miRNA mRNA regulatory networks supported the post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. In the MI mouse model, expression of the 13 genes was consistent with the risk-prediction model. Molecular docking identified CCX168 as a promising small molecule candidate targeting RNF144B and C5AR1. Conclusion: This study reveals immune-related transcriptional signatures and signaling pathways that drive MI progression. The identified 13-gene signature, particularly RNF144B and C5AR1, holds promise as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, providing new insights for immunomodulatory and precision medicine strategies in MI.

Beyond intrinsic adaptations and plastic dynamic switches between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, recent work has shown that tumors actively remodel their microenvironment by acquiring functional mitochondria from surrounding stromal or immune cells. This process of mitochondrial transfer enhances tumor bioenergetics while simultaneously depleting immune cells of metabolic competence, thereby reinforcing both tumor growth and immune evasion. Despite the role of these mitochondrial exchanges, quantitative frameworks to measure their energetic consequences remain underdeveloped. Conventional assays describe oxygen consumption or glycolytic flux but lack the resolution to capture mitochondrial function in terms of throughput, efficiency and stored energy. To address this limitation, we propose a simulation-based framework that translates engineering-style energy metrics into mitochondrial biology. Specifically, we calculate three parameters that may capture distinct yet complementary aspects of mitochondrial bioenergetics: power density, defined as ATP production per unit mitochondrial volume; surface power density, reflecting ATP production per unit inner membrane area; and energy density, quantifying stored chemical free energy per unit volume. By simulating tumor and immune cell populations before and after mitochondrial transfer, we generate numerical values for each parameter that demonstrate how transfer enhances tumor energetics while diminishing immune function. This provisional quantification establishes a pathway toward standardized bioenergetic biomarkers in cancer, potentially enhancing diagnostic methods and supporting the development of strategies aimed at disrupting pathogenic mitochondrial transfer while restoring metabolic competence to immune cells.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

This information is critical for any putative translation. Here, in Drosophila, we test for genetic variation in lifespan response to a dominant-negative form of the insulin receptor, along with a metric of fecundity to evaluate corollary fitness costs/benefits. We also partition genetic variation between DNA variants in the nucleus (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in a fully-factorial design that allows us to assess \"mito-nuclear\" epistasis. We show that reduced IIS can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on lifespan, depending on the combination of mtDNA and nDNA.

O.", "abstract": "Background: Benzene exposure is a well-known cause of toxicity in several tissues, primarily through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disruption of redox homeostasis in the bone marrow. The resulting oxidative stress impairs hematopoiesis, weakens antioxidant defenses, and increases cellular damage. The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a central role in counteracting oxidative stress by regulating the synthesis of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, however, its activity is tightly controlled through Keap1-mediated degradation. Antioxidant therapy, particularly with the use of phytochemicals like gallic acid, has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate these effects. Although the antioxidant potential of gallic acid is well documented, there is still limited integrative evidence regarding its molecular mechanism in counteracting oxidative stress. Objective: This study aims to examine the protective effects of gallic acid on antioxidant defenses, oxidative stress biomarkers, and hematological parameters in mice with benzene induced toxicity, while also evaluating its potential to modulate Nrf2 signaling through molecular docking. Methods: Thirty-six mice were randomized into six groups of six animals each. Group A served as the normal control, while the remaining groups were orally administered benzene (150 mg/kg body weight) for fourteen days. Groups D, E, and F received simultaneous oral administration of gallic acid at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Group C received ascorbic acid (50 mg/kg body weight) as a reference, while Group B was not treated and served as a negative control. Biochemical analyses of tissues (erythrocyte, heart, liver, kidney, femur, and spleen) were performed to assess antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST), the non-enzymatic antioxidant GSH, and oxidative stress biomarkers (MDA, PCO, NO, PC). Hematological parameters were determined from whole blood, while molecular docking was used to evaluate the binding affinity and interactions of gallic acid with the Kelch domain of Keap1. Results: Exposure to benzene significantly reduced antioxidant enzyme activities, depleted GSH and PC, increased MDA, PCO, and NO levels, and altered hematological parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT, LYM) in untreated mice, which was consistent with oxidative and nitrosative stress. In contrast, treatment with gallic acid significantly restored antioxidant enzyme activities, increased GSH and PC levels, reduced the concentrations of MDA, PCO, and NO, and improved hematological parameters in a manner comparable to ascorbic acid. Molecular docking also revealed strong binding affinity and promising interactions within the Keap1 Kelch domain, suggesting a potential mechanism for Nrf2 stabilization and nuclear translocation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that gallic acid improves the cellular antioxidant defense system and provides protection against benzene-induced oxidative stress in mice.

Studies on the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that produces ammosamides previously revealed that they are made by a series of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). The BGC includes genes encoding a precursor peptide AmmA and four enzymes known as PEptide Aminoacyl-tRNA Ligases (PEARLs). Initial studies into the ammosamide biosynthetic pathway demonstrated Trp addition to a precursor peptide by the PEARL AmmB2. Thereafter, sequential modifications by several enzymes including two other PEARLs lead to the formation of a peptide intermediate bearing a C-terminal diaminoquinone. In the present work, we present the biosynthetic steps that convert this intermediate to ammosamide C. The PEARL AmmB4 unexpectedly appends an arginine to the C-terminus of the aforementioned intermediate. Then, C-terminal proteolysis by the heterodimeric TldD/E-like protease Amm12/13 releases a dipeptide, which is subsequently cleaved by the dipeptidase Amm19 to produce a Trp-derived diaminoquinone. Amm3 next catalyzes the conversion of this Trp derivative to the corresponding chlorinated ammosamaic acid. Finally, Amm23 methylates this intermediate and a putative aminotransferase Amm20 performs an amidation to arrive at ammosamide C; the order of these last two steps could not be determined. This study reveals an unexpectedly lengthy route to ammosamide that illustrates the opportunistic nature of natural product biosynthesis, demonstrates a role for a PEARL that is unlike previous roles, identifies steps that are not PTMs, and adds Arg-tRNA to the growing repertoire of amino acyl tRNAs that are used by PEARLs.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

We employed time-resolved crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) to capture the conformational dynamics of {beta}2AR bound to photoazolol-1, a beta-blocker derivative developed for photopharmacological applications. Structural snapshots of the receptor bound to trans-photoazolol-1 (pre-photoconversion), a strained intermediate, and the fully photoisomerized cis-photoazolol-1 reveal an intricate interplay between ligand chemistry and receptor plasticity. Isomerization of the azobenzene moiety induces distinct conformational changes within the orthosteric pocket, altering interactions with the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5 and 6. Supported by functional assays, these structural shifts suggest that photoazolol-1 transitions from an inverse agonist to a neutral antagonist upon photoactivation. Our findings uncover a mechanism of GPCR modulation reminiscent of rhodopsin activation and offer a framework for designing ligands that harness light-driven transitions to achieve spatiotemporal control of receptor function.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

E.; Starkov, D.", "abstract": "Loop extrusion by cohesin complexes is central to genome organization, yet the stoichiometry of extrusion in vivo remains unresolved. Resolving this requires a quantitative link between microscopic loop density and macroscopic Hi-C contact statistics. We develop a perturbation theory for polymers decorated with quenched loops and measured under a finite Hi-C capture radius. The theory predicts a universal scaling law for the contact probability P(s): its logarithmic derivative displays a distinct minimum at genomic distance ~(Tv0)1/2, determined solely by the loop-gap period T (inverse loop density) and the effective fragment length v0. This two-parameter reduction is validated by molecular-dynamics simulations of active loop extrusion and recapitulates short-scale features of Hi-C data. Applying the framework to mammalian datasets, we infer a conserved density of ~6 cohesin-mediated loops per megabase. Comparison with independent cohesin counts reveals near one-to-one correspondence between loops and complexes, providing quantitative evidence for monomeric loop extrusion. Our results establish a universal physical principle for short-scale chromatin folding and show how polymer theory bridges genome architecture with the molecular mechanisms that shape it.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

While collective migration at low-density regimes has been extensively studied, the microscopic dynamics within such jammed epithelia remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that contrary to expectations from thermal systems with glassy dynamics, jammed epithelial monolayers do not exhibit cage effects that reflect the temporary spatial trapping of the particles. Instead, cells display sub-diffusive creep and Fickian yet non-Gaussian dynamics, accompanied by compressed exponential relaxation, features that reveal stress-driven fluidity. We show that cell divisions and extrusions transiently do enhance local motion, they are insufficient to fluidize the tissue globally. Fast-moving cells form collective, anisotropic clusters, and these dynamic heterogeneities correlate with local structural entropy and low-frequency vibrational modes. These findings challenge the conventional view that jammed tissues are static and inert structures, uncovering a hidden fluidity that can be expected to play a critical role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and early tumor progression.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling (HBM) can address this limitation, but has only been demonstrated for simple models. We previously derived an HBM approach for an arbitrary microstructure model with flexible parameter constraints, utilising a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for parameter estimation; here the method is demonstrated and evaluated using simulated and human data for two previously unexplored diffusion MRI techniques, namely diffusion kurtosis imaging and blood-brain barrier filter exchange imaging. When compared with LSQ minimisation, HBM increased the accuracy, precision, contrast-to-noise ratio, and parameter map quality in both simulated and human data. HBM was also able to resolve local parameter variations associated with white matter lesions in a small sample of cerebral small vessel disease subjects, which were obscured by high noise levels in the LSQ-derived parameter maps. Finally, a noise sensitivity assessment in simulations showed that HBM improved the contrast-to-noise ratio and parameter map quality even at low signal-to-noise ratios. This generalised HBM framework can improve parameter estimation for more complex diffusion MRI microstructural models that extend beyond linear combinations of exponentials.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Previously, we showed that Kv7.1 inactivation could strikingly be prevented by Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM). Thus, how can Ca2+-CaM, localized at the channel inner boundaries, prevent inactivation that occurs distantly at the outer pore region and converges to the selectivity filter?

Although previous studies have explored the influence of homogeneous polymer stiffness in crowded conditions, biomolecules such as DNA can exhibit sequence-dependent stiffness, and DNA origami nanoparticles can be designed with alternating stiff and flexible domains. In this work, we use Langevin dynamics simulations to characterize how nonuniform bending stiffness modulates the conformations and adsorption of polymers in crowded environments. By systematically varying the relative length and arrangement of flexible and semiflexible domains along a linear chain, we show that increasing osmotic pressure leads to a pattern-dependent collapse of the polymer, as revealed by a decrease in the radius of gyration. In general, large flexible regions promote polymer collapse, although flexible domains separating extended semiflexible regions can facilitate their contact, leading to stable folded conformations. When a surface is present, large semiflexible domains promote adsorption, and the pattern of stiffness can be used to control the adsorption threshold. Our findings provide insight into the impact of spatially varying stiffness on the behavior of polymers in crowded environments, highlighting mechanisms relevant to biopolymers and deformable nanoparticles in both cellular and cell-free contexts.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

We investigated how different stress conditions influence aggregation of a murine monoclonal antibody, mAb 4713, and the resulting potential to induce ADA in mice. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that stirring, freeze-thaw, and heat stress each generated subvisible aggregates (30-700 nm), whereas non-stressed mAb 4713 remained predominantly monomeric. Stirring- and freeze-thaw-induced aggregates retained native-like secondary and tertiary structures, thermal and biochemical stability, and anti-tumor cytotoxicity, as shown by circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, thermal shift assay, limited proteolysis, and cell death assay. In contrast, heat-induced aggregates displayed complete structural denaturation and loss of cytotoxic activity. Immunization of Jcl: ICR mice demonstrated that heat-induced aggregates were only mildly immunogenic, while freeze-thawed and non-stressed mAb 4713 elicited no detectable immune response, and ADA generated under these conditions did not affect anti-tumor activity. Strikingly, stirred aggregates triggered a strong anti-mAb antibody response, as measured by ELISA, and the resulting antisera completely abolished mAb 4713 cytotoxicity against Raji cells, a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, indicating induction of neutralizing ADA.

Using bead-spring and agent-based cell models, we explore the biomechanical contributions of the nucleus, uropod, septin-templated cortical rings, actomyosin cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix obstacles to lymphocyte migration. Our results support a migration model in which, following cell-matrix collisions, septins mediate the formation of cortical rings that hydraulically seal cytoplasmic compartments on each side of the passing nucleus, generating a pressure difference that propels the nucleus forward. This hydraulically driven nuclear piston actively enhances migration through confined spaces. Concurrently, the uropod emerging from the peristaltic collapse of rear compartments stabilizes directional persistence and prevents T cell repolarization. We show that such polarity stabilization boosts immune surveillance efficiency. Together, these models redefine the nucleus as an active component of the migratory engine and the uropod as a locomotion stabilizer. Furthermore, the models offer a predictive framework towards engineering of immune cell motility in complex tissue microenvironments with broad implications for cancer immunotherapy, aging, and regenerative medicine.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Widespread liver softening began two weeks after HCC inoculation, followed by a decrease in tissue viscosity and fluidity two weeks later, preceding any macroscopic evidence of local tumor growth. In contrast, local lesions with stiff-rigid biomechanical properties were not detectable by standard MRI and MRE until five to six weeks post-injection. Furthermore, tumor viscoelasticity correlated with that of the host liver, also suggesting a possible widespread adaptation of the biomechanical properties beyond the tumor margins and its local niche during early liver colonization.

It is also controversial that whether dyneins separate the centrosomes by pulling the centrosomal microtubules from two opposite directions. Therefore, the active drivers involved in the early centrosome separation are still elusive. Interactions of the centrosomal microtubules with cellular objects (e.g. cortex, cell wall and nucleus) generate forces on the centrosome, thereby promotes centrosomal movements.

Identification of the amyloidogenic protein leading to the correct subtyping is challenging but crucial for treatment decisions. Imaging parallel reaction monitoring (iprm)-parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) is a novel method for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) that enables the fast, spatially resolved, multiplexed, and antibody-independent identification of peptides and proteins in situ. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the applicability of iprm-PASEF for the in situ characterization of amyloidosis. Methods A multiplexed iprm-PASEF panel (comprising trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and m/z values) for characterizing amyloid plaques by MALDI-MSI was compiled. The panel included nine peptide entries of amyloidosis-associated proteins (vitronectin, apolipoprotein E, serum amyloid P component) and the prevalent amyloidosis-subtype proteins serum amyloid A, transthyretin, and immunoglobulin light chain 2. The multiplexed iprm-PASEF panel was applied to a tissue microarray (TMA) assembled from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, comprising biopsies of amyloidosis-positive tissues from 18 patients, including six different tissue types, and representing the following amyloidosis subtypes: ATTR (transthyretin amyloidosis), AL (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis), and AA (secondary amyloidosis). For comparison and co-localization, Congo red staining was performed on adjacent slides. Results MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging was acquired from the amyloidosis TMA, providing an m/z feature list containing 1,390 entries that was subsequently refined to only include m/z features likely stemming from amyloidosis-related peptides. Further, we focused on optimal usage of the m/z and ion mobility range to increase the number of targeted peptides. The final iprm-PASEF panel comprised 10 entries ranging from m/z 887.51 - 1,986.85 and 1/K0 1.4 - 2.1 V*s/cm^2; targeting nine peptides from six different amyloidosis-related proteins. Apolipoprotein E, serum amyloid P component, and immunoglobulin light chain 1/2 were included with two entries. Transthyretin, vitronectin, and serum amyloid A were covered by one peptide. One entry was included as a positive control targeting actin A. We applied the iprm-PASEF (MS2 mode) panel to the amyloidosis TMA and fragment (MS2) spectra were analyzed by the search engine MASCOT. Eight out of ten peptides derived from vitronectin, apolipoprotein E, serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P component, and transthyretin were successfully identified with MASCOT scores above 18. Comparison to Congo red staining indicated a more localized and heterogeneous pattern of amyloid-associated proteins (vitronectin, apolipoprotein E, serum amyloid P component) by iprm-PASEF. Compared to the clinical annotation, transthyretin and serum amyloid A were only found in their respective subtypes. In total, it was possible to describe the spatial distribution of five different amyloid-associated proteins, thereby further characterizing Congo red-positive amyloid plaques in one single iprm-PASEF measurement. Conclusion and perspective This proof-of-concept study demonstrates feasibility for in situ, antibody-independent, and multiplexed proteomic typing of amyloidosis plaques. Future enlargement of the multiplex panel is likely to increase the number of targetable amyloid proteins and to probe for the presence of post-translational modifications.

However, the economic viability of large-scale algal cultivation in open raceway ponds is challenged by biocontamination and environmental stressors, necessitating deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin resilience and productivity in these systems. We hypothesized that the molecular signature associated with the cellular responses of M. minutum to environmental stressors will reveal critical information for the timely prediction of resilience and productivity in algal cultures within open pond systems. To test this hypothesis, we performed a pilot study involving a multi-omic time-course approach, integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, to monitor the acclimation, growth dynamics, and pathogen responses of algal cultures in two 1000L raceway ponds, before and after the introduction of a pathogen as a stressor. We identified a number of molecular patterns that correlate with changes in the algal environment, and we can track these changes longitudinally across the ponds. Furthermore, we propose a way to focus on transition-specific molecular pathways through integrated multi-omics, showing that most patterns are unique to each studies stressor and growth transition.

In eukaryotes, Fe-S cluster biogenesis is initiated in mitochondria by the ISC machinery, which assembles iron and sulfur, delivered by a cysteine desulfurase, onto the scaffold protein ISCU. Frataxin (FXN), a key regulator of this pathway, enhances Fe-S production by accelerating persulfide transfer to ISCU. FXN is essential in eukaryotes, and its loss results in petite phenotype in yeast, senescence in dividing mammalian cells and embryonic lethality in mice. Interestingly, in yeast, a methionine to isoleucine substitution at position 141 of the scaffold protein Isu1 can bypass the requirement of FXN. To test whether this bypass mechanism is conserved in mammals, we introduced the equivalent M141I substitution into the endogenous Iscu gene in murine fibroblasts carrying a conditional Fxn allele using CRISPR-Cas9. We show that the ISCU M141I variant enables cell survival in the absence of FXN, preventing cell cycle arrest and decreasing baseline DNA damage. However, these FXN-null survivor clones exhibit slower proliferation, persistent mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins. In contrast, nuclear and cytosolic Fe-S proteins are preserved, as is cellular iron homeostasis. Importantly, the ISCU M141I variant delays, but does not fully rescue, embryonic lethality in Fxn-deficient mice. Altogether, our results reveal a previously unrecognized compartment-specific rescue of Fe-S cluster dependent processes by the ISCU M141I variant in mammalian cells, raising for the first time the possibility of compartmental regulation of Fe-S cluster biogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the RNA helicase Ddx21 as a critical determinant of fetal hematopoiesis through its epigenetic role in maintaining active ribosomal transcription. Conditional knockout of Ddx21 in murine fetal hematopoietic cells resulted in severe anemia, fetal liver hypoplasia, and depletion of HSPCs, accompanied by erythroid maturation arrest. Mechanistically, Ddx21 deficiency disrupted ribosomal and hematopoietic gene expressions, impaired translational capacity, and activated p53 pathway, triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. While p53 inhibition partially rescued proliferation defects, it failed to restore rRNA transcription, pointing to p53-independent mechanisms. Multi-omics profiling revealed that Ddx21 interacts with the histone demethylase Kdm5a, co-occupying active promoters marked by H3K4me3. Loss of Ddx21 diminished H3K4me3 levels at ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and hematopoietic genes such as cKit and Gata1, downregulating their transcription. Strikingly, Kdm5a inhibition restored rRNA expression and protein translation in Ddx21-deficient cells, and combined inhibition of Kdm5a and p53 cooperatively rescued HSPC function. These findings demonstrate a paradigm wherein Ddx21 couples ribosome biogenesis to epigenetic regulation by sequestering Kdm5a at active chromatin, thereby preserving transcriptional output essential for fetal hematopoietic expansion.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

These genes were classified into four distinct groups based on phase and amplitude differences between transcription and translation. Circadian mRNAs with high oscillation amplitudes tended to undergo co-translational RNA decay (CTRD), whereas intronless genes displayed the lowest amplitudes, likely due to their mRNA instability and short half-lives. While CTRD and NAD+ capping modulate amplitude differences, intronless and circadian translational efficiency (TE) influence both phase and amplitude variations. Additionally, CTRD, NAD+ capping and circadian TE facilitate fast recovery of heat-induced genes to normal hemostasias.

Optogenetic rapid depletion of SPT5 from the nucleus uncovered different sensitivities at different developmental stages. In early embryogenesis, SPT5 depletion caused a downstream shift in Pol II pausing to the +1 nucleosome, resulting in defective elongation and early termination. In late embryogenesis, it led to both up and down regulation of expression, depending on the genes transcriptional and pausing state.

Most importantly, this new method allows for quantitation of cell target engagement in programmable temperature series format, consistent with conventional thermal shift assays, rather than at a single melting temperature. We demonstrate the sensitivity and versatility of this approach for drug discovery using targets MAPK1, KRAS, and UBE2N.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Beta-lactoglobulin, a milk protein, transports hydrophobic and amphiphilic compounds to different organs, including the brain. Biochemical and biophysical studies of beta-lactoglobulin-PFAS interaction have been promising. The present study reports the complex crystal structures of beta-lactoglobulin with PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) at 2.0 Angstrom, PFOS (Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) at 2.5 Angstrom, and PFDA (Perfluorodecanoic acid) at 2.0 Angstrom, disclosing the high affinity of the three PFAS compounds for the central calyx of beta-lactoglobulin. Significant hydrophobic interactions stabilized the binding of the PFAS hydrophobic tail inside the calyx, while polar interactions with residues Lys60 and Lys69 stabilized the polar head group. Comparative structural analysis revealed the presence of an open conformation of the EF loop containing the Glu89 latch residue in the complex structures compared to the apo-form. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis revealed high stability of the PFAS binding and attainment of global minima in all complexes. The average binding energy of PFDA in beta-lactoglobulin calyx was -25.04 kcal/mol, which was higher than PFOS (-21.47 kcal/mol) and PFOA (-22.89 kcal/mol) due to increased van der Waals interactions of the longer hydrophobic chain of PFDA with beta-lactoglobulin. Henceforth, this work presents the structural mechanism of PFAS-beta-lactoglobulin binding, disclosing beta-lactoglobulin as an effective PFAS transporter mediating neurotoxicity in neonates.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

E.; Haliloglu, T.", "abstract": "Understanding the conformational dynamics of proteins, particularly small GTPases like Rac1, is vital for elucidating their functional mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Rac1, pivotal in cellular processes, toggles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Mutations, such as Rac1's spontaneously activating oncogenic gain-of-function mutation P29S, associated with cancer, disrupt this equilibrium, leading to aberrant signaling. Traditional drug targeting of Rac1 is challenging due to its biological complexity and the lack of accessible active sites on its surface, necessitating alternative strategies. We propose a computational framework integrating Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Elastic Network Models (ENM) to explore conformational dynamics. Our findings highlight the interplay between Mg2+ binding and conformational ensembles, revealing enhanced conformational heterogeneity in both inactive and active states upon P29S mutation. The critical location of P29S, Mg2+ coordination site, and GDP/GTP binding pocket with respect to global hinges provides mechanistic insight into how this mutation disrupts normal protein function through altered metal coordination dynamics. Furthermore, we identified strategic positions as potential rescue mutation sites, with T75A showing particular promise in mitigating the destabilizing conformational effects of P29S.

In this article we use membrane nanotubes pulled out of axonal shaft to investigate actin dynamics and force generation. We report cyclic growth and retraction dynamics of actin within the tube and correlated contraction events giving rise to sustained load and fail cycles. The contraction mechanism operate independent of myosin II motor proteins. Furthermore, we analyzed the dynamics of actin within the tube, including under various biochemical or genetic perturbations. By combining these results with physical modeling, we argue that stresses generated in the actin filaments by the binding of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF/cofilin) proteins can explain the cyclic load-fail behavior.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

DNA-based approaches afford ease of manufacturing at a relatively low cost and exhibit improved therapeutic durability and safety as compared to viral vector- or RNA-based approaches.

Quantifying the space requirements of a population is a fundamental problem in spatial ecology, particularly as it relates to the identification of important utilization areas and the designation of protected areas for conservation and wildlife management. 2. Traditionally, population space use estimation techniques scale up from the individual to the population level by aggregating individual animal tracks and then using a single pooled distribution estimator like minimum convex polygons (MCP) or kernel density estimation (KDE). These techniques fail to account for the high levels of temporal autocorrelation in modern tracking datasets, and estimates are often sensitive to the number of individuals sampled. 3. We introduce a new population kernel density estimator (PKDE) that accounts for temporal autocorrelation in tracking data, propagates uncertainty from the individual to the population level, accounts for inter-individual variation when scaling up to the population level, and is not highly sensitive to the number of individuals tracked. Through a combination of simulated data and empirical GPS tracking datasets from three species: (a) grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis); (b) lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris); and (c) bobcat (Lynx rufus), we demonstrate that PKDE produces minimally biased estimates of population-level space use compared to conventional methods like MCP and KDE. 4. The use of conventional estimators can lead to substantial underestimation of population space usage, making them unsuitable for area-based conservation planning. The statistically efficient PKDE estimator provides relatively unbiased estimates of space use with fewer individuals sampled.

However, whether intracellular ion concentration changes directly regulate signaling molecules, independent of these conventional pathways, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that even in the absence of cellular membranes, an increase in Na+ or K+ concentration rapidly reduces activation-loop phosphorylation of multiple AGC kinases, including PKN, PKC{zeta}/{lambda}, and p70 S6 kinase. When ion concentrations were reduced, the activation-loop phosphorylation, which had initially decreased, recovered within a short period. Notably, this recovery occurred in the absence of PDK1, a known kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of these activation loops, and did not require ATP or Mg2+ in lysate assays. 32P tracing experiments revealed a novel 'reacquisition of phosphate group' mechanism, in which phosphate groups transiently dissociate from the activation loops under high Na+ or K+ conditions and are subsequently re-incorporated into the activation loops when ion concentrations are reduced. These findings indicate that elevated Na+ or K+ concentrations directly and rapidly reduce the activity of multiple AGC kinases, and that the activity rapidly recovers upon reduction in ion concentrations, through an unconventional phosphate transfer mechanism distinct from canonical protein phosphorylation reactions. Our study suggests the existence of a robust phosphorylation homeostasis mechanism independent of conventional kinase-phosphatase systems, providing new insights into signaling pathways regulated by intracellular Na+/K+ ion dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Neutrophil depletion and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that JSP1-expressing neutrophils mediate this injury. JSP1 was not required for neutrophil development or surface receptor abundance but was essential for integrin activation and adhesion.

We here present microsecond-resolved single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer studies of the initial steps of gp32 assembly on short oligo-deoxythymidine lattices of varying lattice length and polarity near model ss-dsDNA junctions. These data are analyzed to define the molecular steps and related free energy surfaces involved in initiating gp32 cluster formation, which show that the nucleation mechanisms and regulatory interactions driven by gp32 proteins at ss-dsDNA junctions are significantly directed by lattice polarity. We propose a model for the role of the CTDs in orienting gp32 monomers at lattice positions close to ss-dsDNA junctions that suggests how intrinsically disordered CTD domains might facilitate and control non-base-sequence-specific binding in both the nucleation and the dissociation of the gp32-ssDNA filaments involved in phage DNA replication and related processes.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce an automated, plate-based copolymer screening platform that accelerates this process from days to hours, using only milliliter-scale volumes. The system integrates lyophilized copolymer libraries with magnetic-bead affinity purification, enabling parallel testing of dozens of copolymers against multiple MPs in a single run. Applied to 14 diverse, full-length wildtype human MPs, including GPCRs, solute carriers, ion channels, and claudins, we find that next-generation copolymers (AASTY, CyclAPol (UltrasoluteTM Amphipol), and Cubipol) systematically outperform classical copolymers.

NanoDSF confirmed that the native lipid belt conferred significant thermostabilization without engineered mutations.

The fact that the proteins constitute a small portion of mRNAs and the ability of RNA to form highly specific three-dimensional binding pockets for small molecules have generated considerable interest in developing therapeutic agents that target RNAs as an alternative target for small-molecule drugs. Thus, like proteins, precise prediction of small-molecule binding sites across different classes of RNA targets could act as an starting point for drug discovery. In this study, we present a lightweight deep learning framework called Compound Binding Site Prediction for Ribonucleic Acid (CoBRA). This framework can predict ligand-binding nucleotides without requiring any explicit structural information. Our approach uses residue-level embeddings obtained from a pre-trained RNA language model. These embeddings encapsulate the contextual and statistical properties of each nucleotide and are used in a frozen state as the input for a multi-layer perceptron classifier performing binary classification of binding versus non-binding residues. The model was trained using combinations of ten distinct RNA language models and six different loss functions, using the TR60 and HARIBOSS datasets, and tested on four independent benchmark sets (RB9, JL10, TL12, and TE18). The performance of CoBRA demonstrates a relative improvement of 22.1% in Matthew correlation coefficient and an increase in sensitivity of 45.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art RNA-ligand binding site prediction methods with structural information. These results show that sequence-based language model embeddings alone, which do not require any explicit coordinate or distance information, can match or outperform structure-based methods.

To address this gap, we developed an in silico pipeline integrating host single-cell transcriptomic analysis, parasite antigen screening, and structure-based modeling. Single-cell RNA-seq of liver tissues from SSLF and controls identified three fibrosis-related hub proteins: FYN, BCL2, and AKT3. In parallel, parasite antigens curated from public databases were evaluated for immunogenicity and safety using reverse vaccinology principles. Among these, DRE2_SCHJA, an Anamorsin homolog involved in Fe-S cluster assembly, was prioritized as the top candidate. Docking analysis predicted the strongest interaction between DRE2_SCHJA and FYN ({Delta}G = -14.9 kcal/mol), linking the antigen to a central regulator of fibrosis.

Understanding protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) between viruses and hosts is essential for elucidating infection mechanisms. However, manual curation of these interactions from biomedical literature is inefficient, creating a pressing need for automated and scalable extraction methods. Large language models (LLMs), such as the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), offer promising solutions. Yet, most existing datasets focus on abstracts, overlooking other information-rich sections. We aim to develop a data-efficient approach to extract virus-host interaction (VHI) entities from full-text biomedical articles, including Results, Methods and tables. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply instruction tuning to full-text VHI extraction. Results: We curated a dataset containing 3, 395 PPI and 674 RPI entities from the Results, Materials and Methods sections, along with 566 PPIs and 793 RPIs from tables. Under low-resource conditions (<500 training examples), our instruction-tuned ChatMed-VHI model achieves the best overall performance (F1: 89.7%, Precision: 95.3%), outperforming PubMedBERT (F1: 74.6%, Precision: 75.1%). When scaled to the full dataset (>4, 000 training examples), ChatMed-VHI maintained the highest overall performance, while PubMedBERT achieved slightly higher precision (92.3% vs. 91.3%). Notably, ChatMed-VHI improved F1 and recall by 2.79% but precision dropped by 4.20% with more training data, whereas PubMedBERT improved consistently across all metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of instruction-tuned LLMs for full-text biomedical extraction tasks, and position ChatMed-VHI as a scalable, domain-adaptable solution for VHI mining.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

The challenge in building such tools is the lack of good quality and correctly labeled data from multiple reference databases, which are necessary to select sequences to create cocktails that should contain complete and replication-capable phages. Current published models also do not support chronic phages, which constitute a small but significant group of phages. Another problem is explainability, current models are black-box models where we cannot observe what actually influences the model's predictions, this may result in the model overlooking features that are truly associated with the phage life cycle.

Here, we characterize the molecular, cellular, and physiological consequences of the K53N mutation in both long and short isoform of Gs. Biochemical analyses reveal that K53N disrupts nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis, rendering both the short (GsS) and long (GsL) isoforms unresponsive to activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or cholera toxin. Both isoforms display a loss-of-function phenotype, failing to trigger cAMP production in response to {beta}2-adrenergic, parathyroid hormone, or vasopressin receptor stimulation. Notably, only the long isoform (Gs-L K53N) displays constitutive, receptor-independent cAMP generation. The mutation also reduces protein stability, weakens G{beta}{gamma} subunit interaction, and reduces plasma membrane localization. In neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, K53N impairs cAMP signaling and exerts dominant-negative effects on isoproterenol-induced responses. Strikingly, only Gs-L K53N abolishes isoproterenol-stimulated calcium release, directly implicating this isoform in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy. Collectively, these findings identify K53N as a unique Gs mutation that confers both loss- and gain-of-function properties in an isoform-specific manner, providing mechanistic insight into its complex pathogenicity in endocrine and cardiac tissues.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

P.; DeJong, E. N.; Dufresne, K.; McCormick, J. K.", "abstract": "Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is a life-threatening disease caused by the Staphylococcus aureus superantigen TSST-1. At menstruation, the typical acidic vaginal environment rises to near neutral pH, which allows for optimal TSST-1 production. However, the regulation network which alters toxin production in response to pH is largely unknown, despite the importance of this cue in the vaginal environment. To mimic the vaginal environment, we used Vaginally Defined Medium to assess TSST-1 promoter (tst) activity in the mTSS strain S. aureus MN8 and discovered a significant upregulation of tst expression occurring at pH 4.5 in low glucose environment, referred to as the acidic virulence surge. This increase was also observed in all the regulatory mutant backgrounds tested, including in the absence of saeS, which has previously been thought to be required for TSST-1 production. Recent studies in non-mTSS S. aureus strains have identified GraXRS as a pH sensor, in addition to its function in cationic antimicrobial peptide sensing. We therefore hypothesized that GraXRS alters TSST-1 expression at low pH. Deletion of the sensor-kinase graS resulted in the loss of TSST-1 surge at pH 4.5, indicating that GraXRS is required for the acidic virulence surge. We also found expression from the SaeRS P1 and SarA promoters to be significantly attenuated in the {triangleup}graS background. At low pH, the absence of GraS resulted in the least amount of T cell activation from S. aureus supernatants when compared to other regulatory mutants, suggesting that GraXRS is the dominant activator at pH 4.5. Finally, we developed an in vivo murine model to measure tst expression using luciferase expression. Our results demonstrate a complex sequence of events that occur in response to changes in pH and further suggests that GraXRS is the main activator of TSST-1 at low pH in S. aureus.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

LONP1 processes a vast array of substrates, ranging from damaged or unfolded proteins to specific subunits stably integrated into respiratory complexes. Previous cryo-EM studies of LONP1 uncovered two distinct conformational states corresponding to inactive or active forms of the enzyme. While these states have shed light on the intricacies of LONP1 substrate translocation and proteolytic processing, little is known about the decision-making involved in LONP1 substrate engagement and subsequent initiation of its unfoldase activity. Here, we use cryo-EM to determine a novel ADP-bound, C3-symmetric intermediate state of LONP1 (LONP1C3) with putative substrate \"fold-sensing\" capabilities. Our biochemical and structural data indicate that LONP1C3 is an on-pathway intermediate and that is stabilized by interaction with folded substrates. Moreover, we identify additional symmetric and asymmetric conformational states, including a two-fold symmetric split-hexamer conformation, that we associate with the transition from LONP1C3 to LONP1ENZ. We propose that the C3-state regulates substrate selection and enables LONP1 to efficiently surveil the matrix proteome to ensure selective removal of damaged and dysfunctional proteins as well as privileged LONP1 substrates. These findings collectively provide further mechanistic insights into LONP1 substrate recruitment and engagement and inform on its diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis within the mitochondria.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Ecosystems are rapidly degrading. Widely used approaches to monitor ecosystems to manage them effectively are both expensive and time consuming. The recent proliferation of publicly available imagery from satellites, Google Earth, and citizen-science platforms holds the promise to revolutionising ecological monitoring and optimising their efficiency. However, the potential of these platforms to detect species and track their population dynamics remains under-explored. 2. We introduce a fast, inexpensive method for retrospective image analysis combining current ground-truth data with historical RGB imagery from Google Earth to extract long-term demographic data. We apply this method to three case studies involving two major Mediterranean invasive plant taxa with contrasting growth forms. Specifically, we: (1) utilise deep learning to automatically detect individuals of prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) across various Mediterranean habitats and image resolutions; (2) reconstruct 10 years of spatially explicit recruitment rates for Opuntia along a climatic gradient; and (3) quantify nearly 20 years of growth dynamics for the clonal invader Carpobrotus sp. in two contrasting environments. 3. Our object detection model, trained with Google Earth imagery, achieves 60-80% success in identifying individuals of Opuntia, regardless of habitat type. Model performance increases with target species colour consistency and contrast, as well with the usage of basic data augmentation techniques. Detection is constrained by individual area (<4 m2) but captures 80% of the examined population. 4. Beyond detection, our time-series analysis of publicly available imagery enables detailed population monitoring. With 10-year image series available for Spain, Greece, and the UK, and 20 years for Portugal, we successfully estimate annual recruitment and growth rates and their climatic sensitivity, identify productive and unproductive years, estimate individual age, characterise population structure, model size-age relationships, and identify recruitment hotspots for targeted management. 5. Our pipeline opens new avenues for cost-effective, large-scale demographic monitoring by retrospectively harnessing open-access imagery. While demonstrated here with invasive plants, we discuss the broad applicability of our approach across taxa and ecosystems.

We propose a patient-specific finite element model (FEM) to predict the topographic alterations resulting from CXL. Methods: To calibrate the model, we performed nanoindentation and ex vivo OCE inflation tests before and after CXL on five human donor corneas. Nanoindentation results tuned the visco-hyperelastic parameters, while ex vivo OCE axial strains were used for validation. Personalized corneal models were generated from the topographies of three keratoconus patients, with regional stiffness in the affected areas adjusted based on axial strain measured by in vivo pressure-modulated OCE. Simulated CXL outcomes were then compared to 6-month clinical results. Results: CXL induces a 16-fold increase in the fiber-related mechanical parameters and reduces the viscoelasticity time constant by three. In vivo OCE measurements showed an average mechanical weakening of 57% in the KC regions. When compared to the clinical topography at the 6-month follow-up, the CXL-induced curvature changes predicted by the model were -1.5 D vs. -1.76 D, -1.65 D vs. -1.91 D, and -1.76 D vs. -1.57 D, for the three patients, respectively.

This coincides with the expectation that faster growth under warming would lead to larger sizes early in life but smaller sizes later in life. Here, we use > 99,000 observations of weight-at-age of four commercially-important fishes over 25 years to ask whether changes in size and growth can be explained by temperature. We also examine whether oxygen, a key part of a proposed mechanism behind the temperature size-rule, explains patterns of weight-at-age better than temperature. Changes in weight-at-age over time were more related to temperature than oxygen but the effect of temperature on weight was small and did not vary by age, counter to the temperature size-rule. Importantly, these results were sensitive to how the relationship between weight-at-age and temperature was modeled. While the functional form (linear or polynomial) mattered little, how space was included in the model led to different conclusions regarding how temperature affects size and growth. Assuming that spatial and spatiotemporal random effects - those that account for the higher degree of similarity between observations collected closer in space and time - are shared across ages led to different results compared to allowing these effects to vary by age. Models with shared effects suggested weight for younger ages had positive relationships with temperature and negative relationships for older ages. However, these models provided spurious support for the temperature size-rule as they had less statistical support than models that allowed spatial effects to vary by age. Overall, our work highlights that relationships among size, growth, temperature, and oxygen may not be as straightforward as theory suggests and illustrates that modeling decisions can have a large effect on tests of ecological theory, and more broadly, our ability to understand biological responses to climate change.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Asn are more likely to be glycosylated in the context of a glycosylation sequon, N-x-S/T (x=P), but not every sequon is glycosylated. Tight positive and negative regulation of site-specific N-glycosylation across the glycoproteome is essential because some Asn require glycosylation for productive protein folding or function, while others must remain unglycosylated. Despite its importance, the underlying bases for this regulation are illdefined. Here we characterise the molecular determinants regulating OST catalytic efficiency. We identify preferred substrates of OST, and show that the local sequence determines glycosylation efficiency by fine-tuning binding to an extended groove in OST along an eight residue stretch centered at the Asn acceptor. Tight control of OST activity is achieved through a 'switch', set 'ON' when a peptide binds with high complementarity to the groove, triggering release of the assisting base Glu350 for catalysis. Based on analysis of buried sequons, we identify sequence characteristics associated with inherently non-preferred acceptor substrates for OST, and show these have a high propensity for local secondary structure incompatible with the optimal conformation of a peptide bound to OST. Finally, we validate these mechanisms by examining the determinants of efficient glycosylation at a variably glycosylated Asn in a set of human Fabs. These mechanistic and functional insights show how local protein sequence controls glycosylation occupancy with immediate implications in secretory protein function and evolution, pathogen immunity and epistasis, and in engineering protein sequences for the desired degree of site-specific glycosylation.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR Cas9-generated rsd-6 null mutants, we show that both primary and secondary vsiRNAs accumulate normally in the absence of RSD-6, indicating that it functions downstream of secondary vsiRNA biogenesis. We further showed that secondary vsiRNAs generated in rrf-1-independent manner remained detected in the absence of RSD-6 and viral replication is further enhanced in rrf-1;rsd-6 double mutants compared to rrf-1 single mutants, suggesting a role of rsd-6 in mediating antiviral guided by all secondary vsiRNAs. Consistently, rsd-6 mutants exhibited more severe pathogenesis upon Orsay virus infection compared to rrf-1 mutants, underscoring its role as a major determinant of viral disease outcome. Domain characterization established that the N-terminal tandem domains of RSD-6 are required for antiviral activity, while the C-terminal Tudor domains are dispensable. Functional conservation was confirmed in C. briggsae, where silencing of the rsd-6 homolog enhanced viral replication. Together, our findings identify RSD-6 as a key effector acting downstream of secondary vsiRNA production and highlight its conserved role in modulating viral replication and pathogenesis across Caenorhabditis species.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) is expressed in multiple malignancies and is critical for B-cell immortalization. LMP1 constitutively activates NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways, which are essential for EBV-mediated B cell transformation and for transformed B cell survival. Reverse genetic analysis revealed two LMP1 regions critical for primary human B cell immortalization, termed transformation effector site (TES) 1 and 2, which activate multiple host growth and survival pathways, in particular NF-{kappa}B. Of these, only TES1 signaling is required for B-cell transformation within the first several weeks of infection. TES1 signaling is also critical for EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell survival. However, precisely how TES1 initiates NF-{kappa}B signaling has remained incompletely understood. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence that TES1 associates with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) in a tumor necrosis factor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) dependent manner. TES1 signaling drives cIAP1 autoubiquitination and targets TRAF2, cIAP1 and 2 for proteasomal degradation in a TRAF3 dependent manner. Overexpression of either cIAP1 or 2 impaired LMP1 TES1-mediated non-canonical NF-{kappa}B activation. Collectively, these studies suggest that LMP1 TES1 initiates non-canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling distinctly from CD40 and other host immunoreceptors, thereby highlighting a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

The mechanisms of virus disassembly and transport are particularly enigmatic. Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to provide direct visualization of high-risk HPV16 during its infection cycle. We demonstrate that, when HPV reaches the lysosome, it remains intact and infection competent, contrary to the prevailing view of viral inactivation within lysosomes. We challenge the current model of HPV trafficking, which predicts progressive disassembly of the L1 capsid during retrograde transport, by showing that HPV remains intact when it reaches the Golgi en route to the nucleus for infection. Finally, we provide snapshots of the HPV containing transport vesicles budding from the Golgi lumen in a COPI coat-dependent fashion and show that HPV is connected to the overlying membrane by proteinaceous structural bridges, possibly formed by the L2 capsid, to guide virus trafficking. Our results redefine the dominant models of HPV entry, revealing the virus capsid's resilience to disassembly during retrograde trafficking, a coat-dependent budding mechanism for transport, and demonstrate that the lysosome serves as a reservoir for infectious HPV.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

C.; Mamais, A.; Farrer, M. J.", "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that involves a complex interaction between genetic background, environmental exposures and ageing. Increased leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) activity confers substantial risk for PD albeit with age-associated and incomplete penetrance that suggests other factors are required to manifest disease. We recently linked and associated RAB32 Ser71Arg as a Mendelian gene for PD. Here, we aimed to determine how Rab32 influences LRRK2 kinase activity and whether inflammatory stressors modulate this interaction in vivo. In vitro we show that the expression of Rab32 and Rab38 are modestly, but inversely, associated with their homologue Rab29. Both wild type RAB32 and to a greater extent, RAB32 Ser71Arg, promote the phosphorylation of Rab10, a bonafide LRRK2 kinase substrate. In vivo, we demonstrate murine Rab32 expression increases in brain in response to inflammation induced by peripherally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Further profiling of LPS-induced Rab32 expression in micro-dissected brain tissue reveals regional specificity which is consistently elevated in the midbrain. In contrast, Rab29 and Rab38 expression are not immunoresponsive. Confocal microscopy analysis of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and Iba1+ microglia shows LPS-increased expression of Rab32 is largely restricted to Iba1+ microglia and localized to a Lamp1+ compartment. Most notably, LPS-induced Rab32 expression in midbrain correlates with Lrrk2 kinase activity. Further, Rab32 expression is also induced by LPS in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia from healthy control donors, demonstrating a unified biological response to inflammation across species. These data suggest that the penetrance of LRRK2 PD is a function of peripheral inflammation, with important consequences for LRRK2 clinical trials aimed at neuroprotection. RAB32 is a physiologic and molecular rheostat of LRRK2 kinase activation.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that phosphorylation of a conserved threonine (T495), previously shown to be exploited by a Legionella pneumophila kinase to inhibit Hsp70, occurs endogenously in human cells in response to DNA damage, particularly when base excision repair is overburdened. This modification is cell cycle dependent, and in yeast, phosphomimetic or phosphonull Hsp70 variants disrupt G1/S progression under normal and DNA-damaging conditions. Biochemically, the phosphomimetic T495E mutation locks Hsp70 in an open-like conformation without blocking substrate engagement. Together, our results reveal a conserved mechanism by which dynamic Hsp70 phosphorylation regulates the G1/S transition, and delays cell cycle progression during DNA damage, highlighting how pathogen-derived insights can uncover fundamental cell biology principles.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we study the progression of fold shape and the underlying mechanics in the development of the Drosophila wing disc. We present a 3D segmentation of the apical surface of the wing disc proper from larval stages, when folds grow, to early pupariation, when the tissue unfolds and remodels into a bilayer. We establish morphological metrics to quantify and resolve fold shape in this dataset, introducing a definition of fold depth and width that can be used to characterize folds on a curved surface. Furthermore, we identify fibrous extracellular matrix on the apical side (aECM) that physically connects the two opposing sides of the folds. By modeling a tissue fold with a lateral vertex model endowed by an adhesive layer representing the aECM, we predict that unfolding in the wing disc is preceded by the removal of aECM. Using genetic perturbations, we confirm that aECM adhesion affects fold stability and mechanics: loss of aECM leads to abnormal fold shape and unfolding dynamics, whereas failure to remove aECM at pupariation inhibits unfolding. Finally, we show that these aECM perturbations in larval stages cause morphological phenotypes in the adult wing, demonstrating that the fold morphology of the wing disc helps to define adult wing shape. In total, our work establishes a key mechanical role for aECM in wing disc growth and morphogenesis and advances our general understanding of how epithelial tissue folds can be mechanically stabilized during development.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we elucidate the role of mitochondrial fission in Drosophila gastrulation. We find that fragmented mitochondria migrate apically in constricting ventral cells in a microtubule and Dorsal/NFkb dependent manner. Reduced mitochondrial fission in Drp1 mutant embryos leads to accumulation of larger mitochondria basally and fewer apical mitochondria. Drp1 mutants show decreased Myosin II, resulting in defective ventral furrow formation. Transcriptomic analysis from Drp1 mutants shows no changes in the Dorsal signaling pathway. Proteomic analysis reveals increased levels of antioxidant enzymes and decreased respiratory complexes, resulting in low ROS levels. Depleting SOD2 in Drp1 mutants restores ROS levels, allowing apical mitochondrial migration, Myosin II increase and proper ventral furrow formation. Our study reveals a significant role for mitochondrial dynamics and activity for apical constriction during gastrulation.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

Previously, we described Unblur, which is part of our cisTEM software to correct for beam-induced motion based on the alignment of full frames in a movie collected during the beam exposure (Grant et al., 2015). However, Unblur cannot accommodate motion due to more localized sample bending and distortions. Here, we present Unbend, extending Unblur by incorporating local motion correction using a three-dimensional cubic spline model. The 3D spline model is constructed using cubic B-splines along the exposure time axis, and bicubic B-splines within movie frames. Unbend is integrated into our cisTEM software with a new local motion visualization panel within the cisTEM graphical user interface. We processed movie frames from various in-situ sample types, including whole cells, lamellae, and cell lysates, to analyze motion behavior across different specimen types. To quantify the improvement in high-resolution signal, we utilized the 2D template matching method, which operates independently of the motion correction process, to search large ribosomal subunits from the motion-corrected micrographs. Overall, the signal-to-noise ratio of detected particles improved by 3 ~ 8% across different samples compared with full-frame aligned micrographs, while the number of detected target particles increased by up to ~ 300%. The total and Von Mises equivalent strain shows a deformation scale of less than 1% in most of the samples, confirming that our model induces minimal additional distortion. Furthermore, we processed micrograph montages to study motion patterns across an entire sample, revealing considerable variance in distortion scale within the same sample, suggesting a complex underlying mechanism.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

A.; Daume, J.; Rutishauser, U.; Halgren, E.", "abstract": "High-frequency (~90Hz) ripple oscillations may promote integrative processing in mammalian brains. Previous work has demonstrated that the co-occurrence of these ripple oscillations is associated with enhanced temporal binding of neural activity between human cortical neurons separated by up to 12mm. However, it remains unclear whether co-ripple facilitation of neuronal coupling supports cognitive processing, or if it occurs at greater distances. Here, we analyze intracranial recordings from patients implanted with microwire electrodes in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area, bilaterally, during a working memory task. We demonstrate that ripple oscillations significantly increase in all recorded regions, during encoding, maintenance and retrieval. Furthermore, co-occurrence of ripples increases between brain regions, associated with ~30% increases in cross-region co-firing, both without decrement over distances up to 220 mm. These increases in cross-regional co-rippling and associated co-firing scale with memory load during maintenance and retrieval. Critically, during retrieval, co-ripples promote the reinstatement of the stimulus-specific long-distance co-firing patterns observed during encoding, especially during rapid recognition. Our findings reveal that ripple oscillations orchestrate long-range neural communication that supports distributed neural representations during human cognition.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

We have previously shown that the retrograde axonal transport of pro-survival, neurotrophic signalling endosomes relies on Rab7 in motor neurons, and that their trafficking is impaired in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. Here, we report the effect of Rab7 phosphorylation on the transport of these signalling endosomes. We show that the ALS-linked kinase TBK1 phosphorylates Rab7 at S72 in neurons, altering its binding to cytoplasmic dynein adaptors. Accordingly, both TBK1 knockdown and the expression of a loss-of-function Rab7 mutant (S72E) induce aberrant bidirectional movement of signalling endosomes without modifying neuronal polarity or endosomal sorting. This alteration is specific for signalling endosomes, as axonal transport of lysosomes and mitochondria remain unaffected. We have therefore discovered a new TBK1 function that ensures the unidirectional transport of signalling endosomes, suggesting that reduced TBK1 activity determines retrograde transport dysfunctions and long-range signalling impairments.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}

However, information on the molecular mechanism underlying their roles and on their relevance remains scarce. Here we show that PI3K/Rab18-GDP signaling facilitates the secretion of lEVs from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and fibroblasts. These EVs contain a large amount of sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein and promote angiogenesis. Rab18 serves as the master facilitator of this secretion only in its GDP-bound form, which can be enriched by the Rab inhibitor CID1067700 or by the PI3K agonist SF1670. Rab18-GDP accumulates in the cell center and develops SHH-lEV precursors from perinuclear endosomes. Rab18-GDP recruits heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and facilitates vertical secretion of SHH-lEVs with an Hsp90 corona from the cell center. This secretory machinery may play an important role in developmental and regenerative PI3K-mediated angiogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-06", "journal": ""}
