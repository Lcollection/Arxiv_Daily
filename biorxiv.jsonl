Its cavities represent an essential microhabitat for many other forest species and the knowledge on landscape factors linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker is needed to support the conservation of this species and associated species. Such relationships should thus be quantified at different scales ranging from the stand to the extended home range. We used cavity maps established by foresters and naturalists to build a large (2689 cavity bearing trees) database distributed over several sites in France. Based on this and on a set of background points, i.e. randomly selected points devoid of cavity in the vicinity, we analysed the effects of stand composition and landscape features (forest cover, forest connectivity and fragmentation) at three different scales around each cavity and background point corresponding to a forest management unit (10ha), the core (100ha) and extended (250ha) home range scales. We showed that indices describing forest continuity (cohesion, landscape shape index) and forest tree species composition (especially the presence of mixed forests) had significant positive effects but that the magnitude varied across the three scales. We notably observed the strongest effects at the core home range scale (100ha), indicating that Black Woodpecker requirements for cavity excavation are more pronounced at this scale. The Black Woodpecker tends to avoid pure conifer-dominated stands to excavate cavities, but benefits from mixed forests, that couple favourable foraging and cavity excavation sites. The bird also prefers continuous forest landscapes with high cohesion and low edge densities. We also showed that the positive effects of forest landscape were generally at higher elevation, indicating context-dependence. Forest planning rarely integrates the landscape patterns. A better understanding of the features linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker may hence help to better integrate their conservation in forest management planning. Our results also show the importance to maintain mixed broadleaf-conifer forests as well as continuous and well-connected forest landscapes to favour features that benefit primary and secondary cavity nesters.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

A.; Simons, M.", "abstract": "Morphogenesis of the postnatal developing vasculature involves two essential processes: angiogenesis, which is responsible for the formation and expansion of the capillary bed, and arteriogenesis, which remodels a part of the capillary bed into the arterial vasculature. A rich pool of studies over the past two decades suggested that the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A, VEGF hereafter unless otherwise specified), the primary inducer of angiogenesis, also promotes arteriogenesis. However, this fails to explain the spatiotemporal segregation of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis during postnatal vascular morphogenesis. It is also unclear how the same molecule, a proliferation-inducing growth factor, can be responsible for two very different processes, one of which (angiogenesis) requires active cell proliferation and the other (arteriogenesis) requires growth arrest. Interestingly, arterial specification in VEGF loss-of-function (LOF) animal models has not been examined. Here, we report that physiological doses of VEGF do not induce arterial fate in capillary endothelial cells, instead serving as a physiological brake to slow down fluid shear stress (FSS)-driven capillary-to-arterial fate transition. Studies in four different mouse models with fully or partially disrupted VEGF signaling show impaired angiogenesis but preservation of arteriogenesis, accompanied by ectopic arterialization particularly in the artery-associated capillary bed. The interplay of VEGF and FSS, two essential environmental cues guiding vascular morphogenesis, converges on the mechanosensitive transcription factor Sox17 that regulates expression of key arterial fate genes. We conclude that while angiogenic signaling promotes vascular expansion and protects the capillary bed from premature and ectopic arterialization driven by blood flow, cessation of angiogenic signaling is required to permit FSS-driven arteriogenesis. These findings establish a new paradigm of VEGF-FSS crosstalk coordinating angiogenesis, arteriogenesis and capillary maintenance during vascular morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Using a Drosophila model for chronic kidney disease, we show that a high-fat diet (HFD) disrupts the slit diaphragm filtration structure in nephrocytes, the fly functional equivalent of mammalian podocytes. The structural disruption resulted in reduced filtration function in the affected nephrocytes. We demonstrate that HFD activates the JAK-STAT pathway in nephrocytes, which has previously been linked to diabetic kidney disease. JAK-STAT activation was initiated by increased expression and release of the adipokine, Upd2, from the fat body. This leptin-like hormone is a known ligand of JAK-STAT. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of JAK-STAT restored nephrocyte HFD-associated dysfunction. Altogether, our study reveals the importance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the adipose tissue-nephrocyte axis and its contribution to HFD-associated nephropathy. These findings open new avenues for intervention in treating diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

As marked by differential gradient expression genes, distinct spatially and molecularly defined hair cell (HC) subtypes along the apical-basal axis were identified: such as the apical Myo7a+++/Calb1+++ outer hair cell (OHC) subtype, the basal Myo7a+/Calb1{square} OHC subtype, the apical vGlut3+++/Calb2+ inner hair cell (IHC) subtype, and the basal vGlut3+/Calb2+++ IHC subtype. In addition, the spatial data also demonstrate the developmental reversal of Myo7a/Calb2Nefh gradient patterns in HCs and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), revealing dynamic plasticity and complexity in frequency coding during development. Spatial analyses further demonstrate regional heterogeneity in cell communication intensity between HCs and SGNs, and also reveal core signaling hubs coordinating tonotopic organization, such as Fgf10-Fgfr2 pathway in the basal region and Ptn-Sdc pathway in the apical region HC or SGNs at P8 stage.

Using elongating plant cells as a model, we developed quantitative methods to move beyond coarse correlation and reveal the precise spatial relationship between cortical microtubules and secretion. We identify KEULE, an essential SEC/MUNC protein, as a dynamic exocytosis marker that forms clusters with stereotyped assembly and disassembly kinetics at discrete secretion sites. Combining confocal microscopy with super-resolution analysis and Bayesian inference, we quantified microtubule-exocytosis positioning at nanometer precision. This analysis revealed that microtubules create [~]180 nm enrichment zones flanked by [~]520 nm depletion zones, generating a spatial pattern that replicates the cortical array structure. Unexpectedly, Bayesian inference showed strong evidence for a flat enrichment profile within these zones rather than peaked distributions. This flat profile, combined with enrichment zone widths exceeding the [~]50 nm reach of known tethering proteins, challenges a direct vesicle capture mechanism.

Even after a decade of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), reasonable cell type annotations almost always include manual non-automated steps. The identification of orthologous cell types across species complicates matters even more, but at the same time strengthens the confidence in the assignment. Here, we generate and analyze a dataset consisting of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of four primate species: humans, orangutans, cynomolgus, and rhesus macaques. This kind of data includes a continuum of developmental cell types, multiple batch effects (i.e. species and individuals) and uneven cell type compositions and hence poses many challenges. We developed a semi-automated computational pipeline combining classification and marker based cluster annotation to identify orthologous cell types across primates. This approach enabled the investigation of cross-species conservation of gene expression. Consistent with previous studies, our data confirm that broadly expressed genes are more conserved than cell type-specific genes, raising the question how conserved - inherently cell type-specific - marker genes are. Our analyses reveal that human marker genes are less effective in macaques and vice versa, highlighting the limited transferability of markers across species. Overall, our study advances the identification of orthologous cell types across species, provides a well-curated cell type reference for future in vitro studies and informs the transferability of marker genes across species.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Using an eleven-year dataset, encompassing more than 1,800 individuals, we studied the association between the size of a melanin-based plumage trait (a black patch under the beak or 'bib'), individual attributes (age and sex) and dominance. Our study model, the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), is a small passerine, which lives year-round in colonies of varying size. Bib sizes were obtained from pictures and automatically pre-processed with an object segmentation deep learning network. We recorded 36,346 dominance-related interactions to estimate dominance hierarchies. We then investigated the effect of sex and age on bib size, and the overall and between-year association of bib size and age with dominance for each sex. We found that bib size increased with age within individuals of both sexes. Age was a strong and consistent predictor of dominance in males, but not in females. Nevertheless, dominance was not correlated with bib size in males and in females. Finally, these relationships did not strongly vary between years. Our results suggest that males and females may use different factors to regulate dominance interactions. Furthermore, our longitudinal dataset allowed us to show that bib size is not a badge of status in our population even though its growth encodes information on age. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple traits over time when studying morphological signalling of dominance hierarchy.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Calcium imaging is such a key method, but it records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of calcium indicators, but also from the methods used for signal analysis. Here, we evaluate how methods for spike inference can be optimized to interpret data with the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8. We find that the indicator linearity of GCaMP8 enables more accurate recovery of high-frequency spiking events and the detection of single action potentials. Ground truth recordings from mouse neocortex show that the most linear calcium variants, GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f, or GCaMP8f - robustly detect isolated spikes in pyramidal neurons under realistic noise conditions. In addition, we fine-tune and benchmark existing algorithms for spike inference (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) with GCaMP8 data, investigate spike inference for interneurons, and demonstrate how the fast rise time of GCaMP8 enables low-latency real-time detection of neuronal activity.

Here, we map UFM1 conjugation to lysines K50 and K215 on 14-3-3{epsilon} and demonstrate how these UFMylation events control RIG-I signaling.

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis.

We analyzed the TL distribution in 100 S. cerevisiae strains, representing the genetic and ecological diversity of the species. Our analysis revealed a large diversity in TL distributions within the species, largely driven by inter-extremity differences, ploidy level, and subtelomere structure. Polyploid strains displayed significantly longer telomeres than diploid and haploid strains, and experiments with artificially generated polyploids in two independent genetic backgrounds confirmed that higher ploidy levels lead to telomere elongation. Furthermore, we found that the subtelomeric Y' element exerts two distinct and opposing effects: (i) the presence of Y' elements at a chromosome extremity is associated with shorter telomeres in cis, but (ii) the overall Y' element content in a strain correlates with longer telomeres. Interestingly, the length of the shortest telomeres remained relatively constant across strains, suggesting a selective constraint at the species level.

Unaccounted exchange may even blur micro-structural or other characteristics of multi compartmental systems studied by MR methods. Despite the growing interest in diffusion-exchange studies of complex systems, comparative studies remain scarce. Most existing investigations have applied different diffusion MR methods to different biological samples under varying experimental conditions, making direct comparisons difficult. Moreover, the lack of a gold standard for exchange rate measurements further complicates efforts to validate and interpret results. To address these challenges, we employed two diffusion NMR-based methods -- the constant-gradient pulsed field gradient (CG-PFG) and the recently introduced filter-exchange NMR spectroscopy (FEXSY) -- to investigate apparent water exchange in yeast cells and optic nerves, both before and after fixation. We first evaluated the effect of the q-values on the extracted indices and then evaluated the repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements. The CG-PFG and FEXSY experiments were collected on the same sample to allow comparison of the results. The intracellular mean residence times (MRTs) ({tau}i) extracted from the log-linear fit of the CG-PFG NMR experiments were found to be 554 {+/-} 6 ms and 337 {+/-} 10 ms for yeast cells before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 368 {+/-} 14 ms and 146 {+/-} 24 ms, respectively. Despite the difference in absolute values of MRTs, the same qualitative behavior is observed in the two methodologies, and both could be analyzed using the bi-compartmental Karger model. The same methodologies were then used to study exchange in the more complex porcine optic nerves. There, the bi-compartmental Karger model analysis is shown to be inadequate. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are used to narrow down on the most possible explanation, suggesting that optic nerves are multi-compartmental systems where not all spins are free to undergo exchange. Supporting theoretical calculations point to the existence of at least one additional non-exchanging restricted compartment. Thus, a tri-compartmental model is derived and used to analyze the data. The new model fits the data significantly better and results in dramatically different exchange rates when used on white matter (WM) data: CG-PFG experiments were found to be 730 {+/-} 40 ms and 803 {+/-} 16 ms for optic nerves before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 530 {+/-} 125 ms and 387 {+/-} 104 ms, respectively. These values are considerably lower than the values previously reported. Finally, we use simulations to show that the quantitative discrepancy between CG-PFG and FEXSY can be attributed, at least partially, to the difference in T2 values between the intra- and extracellular compartments. We thus encourage the pairing of exchange and spin-spin relaxation measurements in future studies. We end with a discussion on the current state of the diffusion-exchange, and in an attempt to put a spotlight on essential corner stones that are still missing despite the great advance of recent years -- experimental standardization, method comparison, and adequate modeling.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affect intracellular function via multiple signaling cascades. However, the mechanisms of GPCR intercellular signaling through EV miRNA activity are unknown. Human U2 osteosarcoma cells expressing native GPCRs were used to selectively stimulate distinct G protein signaling cascades (Gai, Gaq, Ga12/13, and b-arrestin) by members of specific receptor subclasses including the adenosine receptor A1 (ADORA1), the histamine receptor H1 (HRH1), the frizzled class receptor 4 (FZD4), and the atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), respectively. We hypothesized that stimulation of specific classes of GPCRs would cause the release of EVs containing miRNAs with receptor-specific up- or down-regulated expression, affecting unique pathological downstream signaling cascades. Receptor-specific agonists dose-dependently increased respective signaling cascade intermediates. We found no change in the quantity of EVs (~200nm diameter), but there were distinct EV miRNA signatures following stimulation of GPCRs.

In skeletal muscle, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that orchestrate this coordination remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify adult Drosophila immune cells, hemocytes, as central organizers of post injury muscle repair. Muscle damage triggers rapid recruitment of hemocytes to affected fibers. Hemocyte-derived FGF like ligand Branchless (Bnl) activates FGF/FGFR signalling on vascular-like tracheal cells, guiding their localized expansion toward injured regions. In parallel, hemocytes deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including Collagen IV, which accumulate around damaged fibers to confine Bnl distribution and facilitate tracheal recruitment. Disruption of hemocyte-mediated Bnl or ECM delivery impairs tracheal remodelling and compromises muscle recovery after injury. Together, these findings reveal an immune muscle vascular communication module that integrates signalling and matrix remodelling to preserve muscle function following acute damage.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Notwithstanding their utility, circuit models do not provide a unified framework encompassing the variety of effects observed experimentally. We develop a novel, alternative framework that recasts sensory operators in the language of intrinsic geometry. We start from a plausible representation of perceptual processes that is akin to measuring distances over a sensory manifold. We show that this representation is sufficiently expressive to capture a wide range of empirical effects associated with elementary sensory computations. The resulting geometrical framework offers a new perspective on state-of-the-art empirical descriptors of sensory behavior, such as first-order and second-order perceptual kernels. For example, it relates these descriptors to notions of flatness and curvature in perceptual space.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

While this representation is widely used to study biological function, it fails to capture the full structure of metabolic reactions, many of which involve more than two compounds. Hypergraphs offer a more natural representation, where nodes represent metabolites and hyperedges represent reactions involving multiple participants. Clustering such metabolic hypergraphs can reveal systematic differences among evolutionarily distinct organisms, providing insight into ecological constraints and evolutionary pressures. Methods: In this study, we investigate how different graphs and hypergraphs embedding methods influence their unsupervised clustering, with the goal of capturing taxonomy-based classes. We apply 14 distinct embedding strategies to a large-scale dataset of 8,467 metabolic hypergraphs. Each embedding was followed by hierarchical clustering using a fixed linkage method. To assess performance, we compared the resulting clusters against known taxonomic groupings. Results: Our findings show that the choice of hypergraph embedding has a significant effect on clustering outcomes. Among the tested methods, Bag of Hyperedges with Jaccard distance, Histogram Cosine Kernel, and a Hypergraph Auto-Encoder consistently performed best.

Despite this prevalence there are no widely approved vaccine for DENV naive individuals or therapeutics. DENV consists of four distinct serotypes, DENV 1-4, that share 60-70% homology. Development of a safe and efficacious pan-Dengue vaccine has been complicated by the potential of antibody-dependent enhancement, in which cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection and disease. We previously demonstrated that a mRNA-LNP encoding for DENV-1 prM and Envelope proteins generates homotypic neutralizing immune responses and protects against a lethal challenge. The DENV-1 vaccine avoided ADE by eliminating the fusion loop (FL), one of the dominant ADE epitopes. Using a similar design methodology, here we present mRNA-LNP prM-E vaccines for DENV 2, 3, and 4. These vaccines maintained the {Delta}FL modifications, but encode a chimeric E protein to improve VLP expression and stability. All three vaccines elicited neutralizing titers of serotype specific antibodies mice and protected against a lethal homotypic DENV challenge. Mutation of the FL lowered ADE in vaccinated mouse sera. We formulated monotypic vaccines into a tetravalent vaccine and evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in mice. The tetravalent vaccine elicited neutralizing humoral responses against all DENV serotypes and protected against lethal challenges. Cumulatively, our monovalent DENV mRNA-LNP vaccines against all DENV serotypes generate protective immunity and lower the potential for ADE, leading to the development of a first-generation ADE-altered tetravalent DENV vaccine.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, prolonged insecurity in the region has made wildlife monitoring and conservation challenging. This is particularly true of the northeastern limits of the range of Grauers gorillas, where wide stretches of unprotected forest could harbor behaviorally and genetically unique peripheral populations of great apes and other species. Here, we developed a rapid wildlife survey method to map population distributions and monitor the impact of various human activities in the Tayna Nature Reserve in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite a lack of surveys since the early 2000s, we find that Grauers gorillas and eastern chimpanzees, as well as a number of smaller-bodied species, have persisted in Tayna. Observations of gorilla and chimpanzee signs were highly heterogeneous. They were less dense near human settlements and artisanal mines and peaked in areas with rugged terrain. The association with rugged terrain may be a result of historical anthropogenic pressure, behavioral avoidance of human activities, and/or ecological preference. Maintaining connectivity between patches of suitable great ape habitat will be critical for long-term great ape conservation in the Albertine Rift region.

Passage of macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm depends on the dynamics of the FG-repeat domains and their interactions with nuclear transport receptors. Yet FG-repeat domains are highly aggregation-prone in free solution, forming amyloid-like fibrils at relatively low concentrations. Here we describe an approach to studying the properties of FG-repeat domains (or other polypeptides) when tethered to the walls of pores with diameters similar to those of NPC channels. By attaching alkyl phosphonate groups to the N-termini of 30-residue FG30 peptides that contain four FG repeats, we tether FG30 chains to walls of 20-nm-diameter pores in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) wafers through phosphonate-surface bonds. Quantitative 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements indicate 90 mM peptide concentrations (300 mg/ml) within the pores. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra and nuclear spin relaxation measurements show that FG30 chains are dynamically disordered and random-coil-like in buffer-filled pores over a broad temperature range, with no sign of aggregation over many weeks despite the high intrapore concentrations. In contrast, the same FG30 peptide aggregates in free solution at 24 C at concentrations above 2 mM, forming structurally ordered fibrils according to electron microscopy and NMR measurements. These results demonstrate the utility of AAO as a scaffold for studying the properties of FG-repeat domains under conditions that mimic those within NPC channels, show that NMR measurements can elucidate these properties, and suggest that tethering to nanopore walls dramatically alters the self-assembly properties of FG-repeat domains, with potentially important implications for NPC function.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the detailed wing kinematic changes during free-flight roll motion and probed the neuromuscular basis for such changes. Consistent with previous work, we observed that flies manipulated the stroke amplitude difference between their wings to control their roll angle. Here, we show that flies are capable of achieving such changes by altering the stroke amplitude of either or both of their wings. Further we found that during corrections flies can also take advantage of an aerodynamically significant change in the angle of attack of their uppermost wing. Curiously, these corrective wing changes cannot be eliminated when motor neurons hypothesized to be used during roll maneuvers (i1, i2, b1, b2, and b3) are individually inhibited. However, free-flight optogenetic manipulations and quasi-steady aerodynamic calculations show that each of these motor neurons individually can effect kinematic changes consistent with a roll correction. Combining this evidence with an analysis of haltere inputs found in the BANC connectome, we propose that the observed robustness could be the result of two sets of muscular redundancies that receive shared inputs from haltere sensory afferents: one set, containing b1 and b2, is able to increase the stroke amplitude of the lower wing; while the other set, containing i1, i2, and b3, is able to decrease the stroke amplitude and wing pitch angle of the upper wing. Because of the redundancy in the input sensory information and output wing motion in the muscles in each cluster, the fly is able to perform roll stability maneuvers even when one of the constituent motor neurons is inhibited. This framework proposes new ways fast aerial maneuverability can be implemented when dealing with the fly's most unstable rotational degree of freedom.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Implants targeting V1 typically evoke isolated phosphenes that do not support coherent object recognition. We asked whether mid-level visual features, specifically curve segments associated with area V4, could provide a more efficient substrate for artificial vision. Using fMRI, 24 participants performed an object recognition task with stimuli fragmented into either phosphene-like dots or curve segments at varying densities. Behaviorally, curve segments enabled recognition at lower density thresholds and produced steeper psychometric slopes. Neurally, both fragment types engaged V1, but only curve segments recruited V4, and correct recognition of segments relative to phosphenes evoked broader occipito-temporo-parietal responses. Multivariate decoding showed that successful recognition of phosphenes was predicted by early visual and cingulate activity, whereas recognition of segments was predicted only by V4, indicating a shift toward mid-level representational support. Mediation analyses further showed that phosphene-based recognition relied on anterior cingulate cortex under conditions of higher uncertainty, while segment-based recognition depended primarily on visual cortex. Together, these results show that mid-level fragments confer perceptual and neural advantages, reducing reliance on both dense stimulation and downstream uncertainty resolution, and identify V4 as a promising target for next-generation cortical prostheses.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Here we present a systems-level analysis of the ECS that integrates protein-protein and protein-chemical interactions into a unified network framework. Interaction data were obtained from multiple public databases, and networks constructed using NetworkX captured the molecular landscape of ECS signaling. Centrality analyses identified the primary cannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2), as major hubs with extensive connectivity to endogenous and exogenous ligands. In addition to these canonical receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) emerged as highly ranked nodes across multiple centrality measures, underscoring their integrative roles within the ECS. Community analyses revealed that key nodes, including the primary cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2, along with major ligands such as the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and various phytocannabinoids, sustain network connectivity and organize into biologically coherent receptor-centered and metabolic communities. Perturbation analyses showed that removal of highly connected hubs, particularly CNR1, disrupted network integrity and signaling relationships among synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids. This disruption simultaneously increased the influence of other receptors, including CNR2 and GPR55, revealing compensatory mechanisms that preserve network resilience.

Disruption of this process leads to holoprosencephaly (HPE), a severe congenital brain malformation. Although mutations in several genes have been linked to HPE and studies using the chick embryo have implicated certain signaling pathways, yet the mechanisms by which mechanical signals are translated into tissue morphological changes remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we employed atomic force microscopy to map spatiotemporal stiffness gradients across the dorsal forebrain in the chick embryo during roof plate invagination. Our analysis revealed that the initial uniformly elevated levels of stiffness across the roof plate are dramatically altered during morphogenesis. A pronounced stiffness gradient emerges, whereby the roof plate midline becomes markedly more compliant than dorsolateral regions. Through expression screening, we identified Cdh-2 as a candidate mechanical regulator whose spatiotemporal expression pattern precisely mirrors the observed stiffness gradient. Both loss- and gain-of-function perturbations of Cdh-2 disrupted the normal stiffness gradient and caused significant architectural alterations, such as evagination or a V-shaped invagination of the roof plate. Mechanistically, Cdh-2 modulates tissue stiffness by regulating adherens junction stability and cortical F-actin distribution along the apicobasal axis of neuroepithelial cells.

Current sequence-based models, such as Enformer and Borzoi, trained exclusively on the reference genome, cannot capture the effects of individual-specific regulatory variants. Moreover, the acquisition of paired whole-genome and transcriptome data required for personalized modeling is hindered by privacy and data-sharing constraints. To address this limitation, we integrate genomic data synthesis with established statistical frameworks. Our approach generates thousands of synthetic training samples by simulating genetic variation from the 1000 Genomes Project and assigning pseudo-expression labels using PrediXcan, a validated eQTL-based predictor. Because simulated and real expression values differ in scale and distribution, we introduce a preference-based objective that models relative rather than absolute expression patterns. Fine-tuning Enformer through alternating cycles of real-data regression and synthetic-data preference optimization enables efficient learning from both real and synthesized data. Using the GEUVADIS dataset, our framework outperforms AlphaGenome, PrediXcan, and Enformer fine-tuned without synthesized data, demonstrating that simulation-based integration of population-level regulatory knowledge can effectively mitigate data scarcity and improve cross-individual generalization in sequence-based gene expression prediction.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation.

N.; Harvey, H.; Lahane, T. S.; Burrows, L. L.", "abstract": "P. aeruginosa type IV pili (T4P) are complex surface-exposed nanomachines used for twitching motility and biofilm formation. Exposure to bacteriophages that use T4P as their primary receptor can select for resistance mutations that reduce or abolish pilus expression. Since T4P are important virulence factors, such loss can affect pathogenicity and fitness, desirable outcomes for phage therapy. Here, we evaluated the repertoire of mutations in P. aeruginosa PAO1 exposed to the pilus-specific lytic phage PO4 and their ability to revert after removal of phage. Resistant isolates ranged from hyperpiliated to bald, but none retained twitching motility. We focused on isolates that still expressed surface pili, including one with an internal 4-amino acid duplication in the essential prepilin peptidase/methyltransferase, PilD. This duplication, distal to the predicted active sites, delayed prepilin processing. Accumulation of unprocessed subunits suppressed expression of new prepilins via inhibition of PilSR two-component system activity, restricting availability of functional subunits and conferring phage resistance. Introduction of a PilS point mutation that makes cells insensitive to accumulation of unprocessed pilins restored motility and phage susceptibility. Of the mutants tested, only those with a duplication in pilD recovered wild-type motility following removal of phage pressure, likely through slip-strand mispairing as a codon-modified variant did not revert. This work shows that resistance to pilus-specific phages does not require loss of pilus expression, and certain mutations can allow bacteria to regain pilus function. Characterizing spontaeous mutations selected by phages can help to define the function and vulnerabilities of the type IV pilus system.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

To investigate the cellular and molecular underpinnings of muscle wasting, we analyzed skeletal muscle biopsies from NSCLC patients and healthy matched controls using quantitative proteomics, histology, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, gene expression profiling, and high-resolution respirometry. Skeletal muscle from patients was characterized by type II muscle fiber atrophy, greater collagen deposition, and redistribution of lipids to the extracellular matrix. This coincided with a shift in fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), favouring the CD90- subtype, and experiments using conditioned media indicated a catabolic secretory phenotype from patient- derived FAPs. Proteomic and functional analyses revealed dysregulated calcium handling, downregulation of key mitochondrial proteins, and altered respiratory capacity in muscle samples from patients with NSCLC. These alterations, along with fiber type specific mitochondrial remodelling, were accompanied by STAT3 activation and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and local inflammation. These results provide the first human evidence that altered FAP composition, mitochondrial homeostasis, calcium handling, and immune cell landscape coincide with muscle wasting in NSCLC, highlighting potential therapeutic targets to treat patients with cancer-associated cachexia.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Saturation of primate genomes with Alu sequences occurred at the prosimian/new-world monkey evolutionary juncture. Alu elements have clearly driven unique aspects of higher primate evolution, but their presence can be detrimental to genomic stability. The expansion of Alu sequences in the genomes of higher primates precisely coincides with a substantial increase in the ubiquitous expression of the three polypeptides of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the Ku70/80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs. Previous work suggests that the elevated levels of Ku70/80 are required to prevent the activation of innate immune signaling pathways triggered by RNA molecules derived from Alu elements. Here we demonstrate that Ku ablation dramatically alters mRNA splicing, by allowing the use of alternative splice sites contained in intronic antisense Alu elements, which are known to directly associate with Ku70/80 5. Dysregulation of mRNA splicing precedes cell death and preferentially impacts genes involved in essential RNA metabolism processes, including splicing and ribosome biogenesis, likely impacting cell viability. In addition, we demonstrate that cell death after Ku70 depletion cannot be rescued by expression of its prosimian homologue, which suggests that primate Ku70 has evolved specific molecular features to suppress deleterious effects of an Alu element rich genome. We propose a model in which Ku binding of antisense Alu elements in introns of nascent RNAs modulates the use of alternative splice sites to balance beneficial and detrimental contributions of Alu repeats within primate genomes.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Cattle can hinder or promote recruitment, depending on the spatial, temporal, and intensity patterns of grazing. Herbivory theory predicts that repeated defoliation and trampling deplete seedling reserves, whereas resprouting can extend survival; yet field studies rarely separate intensity from recency or pair long-run grazing records with individual fates and microhabitat/climate context. We test how management-driven heterogeneity shapes cork-oak (Quercus suber) seedling survival and resprouting, combining 12 years of paddock-level grazing records with individual tracking of 8431 seedlings across 24 rotational paddocks. We fitted Bayesian mixed-effects survival models relating oak seedling lifespan to grazing pressure x history (moderate [&le;] 150; high >150 LSU ha-1 days yr-1), with covariates (initial height, resprouting status, shrub distance, cattle dung counts as a proxy of very recent grazing, and 1-month SPEI as recent water balance), and Bayesian logistic mixed models relating resprouting probability to grazing treatments. Survival was consistently lower in grazed than ungrazed paddocks and declined along management gradients: median lifespan fell from 460 (moderate grazing) to 256 days (high), and from 460 (old grazing; two-year exclusion) to 199 days (recent). A two-year exclusion raised survival under moderate pressure but was insufficient where pressure remained high, indicating legacy effects and that recovery windows must scale with pressure. Resprouting was the dominant axis of persistence: resprouters lived >5x longer than non-resprouters (2351 vs 460 days). Taller seedlings lived longer, shrub proximity conferred a modest benefit. Drought exacerbates mortality, whereas wetter recent periods (higher SPEI) markedly boosted survival. Cattle reduced the odds of resprouting, with the strongest penalty under recent use. Synthesis: By disentangling grazing intensity from recency and linking both to seedling survival and resprouting, we show why recruitment falters under continuous, heavy grazing and when it can recover. Crucially, cattle effects are exacerbated by drought periods. Management that couples moderate stocking with multi-year rest periods (long enough to rebuild bud banks and below-ground reserves) should improve regeneration in working Mediterranean woodlands.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

By inserting a theophylline-responsive riboswitch upstream of essential genes in Escherichia coli, we created strains whose viability depends on the presence of theophylline. We systematically applied this approach to 29 essential genes, obtained ligand-dependent growth phenotypes for 19 targets, and found that 18 of these essential genes yielded stringent live-die synthetic auxotrophs. These strains exhibited robust theophylline dependence with escape frequencies ranging from 1 x 10-5 to 1 x 10-6 (most below limit of detection).

To determine whether thalamic drive is sufficient to evoke cortical responses, we quantified the current threshold required to evoke action potentials in vivo using whole-cell recordings in mouse V1. We then isolated thalamic input via optogenetic cortical silencing and compared its strength to the measured spiking threshold. We find that although average thalamic input is below the threshold for action potential generation, trial-by-trial fluctuations in thalamic drive are sufficient to evoke visually driven action potentials.

The conditional Bsn gene knock out resulted in a reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced synaptic efficacy of affected inhibitory synapses as well as diminished GABAergic inhibition in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Bsn mutants further displayed a reconfiguration of the hippocampal synaptic network in vivo, as seen in subfield-specific changes of inhibitory synaptic markers and reduced numbers of parvalbumin interneurons, culminating in disturbance of hippocampal network activity patterns and profound mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation. Importantly, the mutant mice developed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of ASD including widespread social behavioral deficits and novelty-induced hyperarousal with altered motor behavior, increased anxiety and epileptiform activity.

Here, we use long-term data from a well-studied population of wild baboons in Amboseli, Kenya, to examine how group-level social traits (group size and social network density) and climate variables (rainfall and temperature) are linked to two types of foraging outcomes for adult female baboons: (i) foraging-related time budgets and (ii) diet composition (time spent on fallback foods, such as grass corms, versus high-energy foods). We find that rainfall and temperature interact to predict multiple foraging outcomes: more rainfall is associated with more time spent feeding, less time spent walking without feeding, and more feeding time spent on grass corms, but this influence is more pronounced in hotter years than in cooler years. Females in intermediate-sized groups spend more time walking without feeding than those in other groups, but group size does not significantly predict other foraging-related outcomes (i.e., time spent feeding or diet composition). We also find that females in groups with denser social networks spend less time feeding, and less time feeding on grass corms, than those in sparser networks. However, in a preliminary causal analysis meant to further explore this result, we find support for the hypothesis that this relationship is driven by effects of foraging on social behavior, as opposed to effects of network density on foraging: more time spent eating grass corms leads to lower social network density and more time spent feeding. Our results show how the social and the physical environments are linked to foraging outcomes, and highlight the importance of future studies of their pattern and mechanism.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

However, due to its emerging nature, there are very few foundation models that can utilize ST data to generate embeddings generalizable across multiple tasks. Meanwhile, well-documented foundational models trained on large-scale single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) data have demonstrated generalizable performance across scRNA-seq assays, tissues, and tasks; however, they do not incorporate the spatial information in ST data. We use heat kernel diffusion to propagate embeddings across spatial neighborhoods, incorporating local tissue structure into ST data while preserving the transcriptomic representations learned by state-of-the-art single-cell foundation models. We systematically benchmark five foundational models (both scRNA-seq and ST-based) across key ST tasks such as annotation, alignment, and clustering, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework.

Models based solely on climatic variables produced unrealistic and overly extensive predictions, overestimating suitability in northern Europe and confirming that climate alone poorly explains CCHFV range. Approaches using only tick species distributions underperformed in many parts of Africa, reflecting the complexity of vector-host interactions and the absence of a strict tick-virus association. The integration of human-biting tick distributions, livestock density, and chorotypes yielded the most robust results, accurately capturing over 90% of known occurrences, by identifying vertebrate assemblages most likely to amplify the virus while reducing dimensionality. Chorotypes, representing clusters of co-occurring hosts, enhanced model performance and improved the delineation of both the northern and African ranges limits of the virus. Our results support a generalist epidemiological model in which multiple tick species, together with a broad range of vertebrate hosts, sustain CCHFV circulation. This ecological flexibility, rather than strict vector specificity, likely explains the CCHFV wide biogeographical range and occasional lineage expansions across continents.

We show that different evolutionary regimes imprint distinct statistical signatures on the MLD: single episodic gene transfer events yield exponential distributions, while continuous sustained HGT processes lead to power-law tails. The power-law exponent is analytically linked to the topology of the transfer network, distinguishing between intra-clade transfers and hub-mediated dissemination.

Using a signal detection theory (SDT) framework, we investigated how bumble bee decisions respond to experimental manipulations of costs and benefits within an intersexual floral mimicry system in which unrewarding female flowers imperfectly mimic pollen-rewarding male flowers (models). Using a fully factorial design, we increased the cost of visiting mimics (by adding quinine), increased the benefit of visiting models (by adding pollen), increased both simultaneously, and made no changes (control). As predicted by SDT, increasing mimic costs led to a conservative bias: bees made more correct rejections, but fewer correct detections. Contradicting SDT predictions, enhancing model reward did not elicit a liberal bias and decision performance remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that bees prioritize avoiding costly errors under uncertainty, even when this limits potential gains.

Here, we introduce SpaTRACE, a transformer-based Granger-style recurrent autoencoder for de novo reconstruction of signaling and gene-regulatory interactions directly from developmental spatiotemporal transcriptomics data. SpaTRACE jointly embeds LR pairs, transcription factors (TFs), and target genes (TGs) into a unified latent space that integrates spatial neighborhoods with temporal causality. Trained to predict future TG expression along pseudotimesampled trajectories, the model learns biologically meaningful embeddings that capture LR;TG signaling and TF;TG regulatory influence without relying on pathway priors. Across synthetic datasets, SpaTRACE accurately reconstructs LR to TG interactions, TF to TG regulation, and correct LR pairings, outperforming existing CCC tools, especially under pathway-agnostic settings. Applied to mouse midbrain development and axolotl brain regeneration, SpaTRACE recovers canonical signaling modules, identifies stage-specific transitions, and uncovers previously under-characterized interactions, producing CCC signals with high co-expression fractions and bivariate Morans I comparable to leading spatial methods.

The aligned archetypes define a shared coordinate system that anchors a pair of dual variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained with cross-modal geometric regularization, preserving archetype structure and spatial neighborhood information while enabling bidirectional translation between modalities. On a semi-synthetic benchmark derived from paired CITE-seq and synthetic spatial grids, ARCADIA accurately recapitulates cell-type correspondences and spatially dependent subpopulation structures, outperforming existing weak-linkage methods. Applied to independent human tonsil scRNA-seq and CODEX data, ARCADIA reconstructs known tissue architecture and reveals spatially dependent transcriptional programs linking B-cell maturation and T-cell activation or exhaustion to their microenvironmental niches.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

There are now many tools to reconstruct such networks, but no clearly established metric to compare them, unlike trees for which the Robinson-Foulds distance has become a standard. However, to assess the quality of reconstruction methods, one needs a way to compare networks quantitatively, for example, to evaluate predictions against a simulated ground truth. Despite years of effort in developing metrics, known dissimilarity measures are either incapable of distinguishing all pairs of different networks, or are extremely difficult to compute. Since it appears challenging, if not impossible, to create the ideal metric for all classes of networks, it may be relevant to design them for specialized applications. In this article, we introduce a metric on LGT networks. These consist of trees with additional arcs that represent transfer events and are useful for scenarios involving genetic exchanges between co-existing species. Our metric is based on edit operations, namely the addition/removal of transfer arcs, and the contraction/expansion of arcs of the base tree, allowing it to connect the space of all LGT networks. We study its computational complexity and show that it is linear-time computable if the order of transfers along a branch is unconstrained but NP-hard otherwise, in which case we provide a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm. We implemented our algorithms and demonstrate their applicability on three numerical experiments. The first one shows the scalability of the computation of the metric on random simulated networks. The other two are proof-of-concepts of concrete applications, respectively in the context of the evaluation of predicted \"transfer highways\" on bacterial data, and to the tuning of cost values in gene-tree reconciliations.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

This discordance complicates cross-study integration of proteomic data. Improving the integration of such datasets would enable more powerful meta-analyses, improve statistical power for biomarker discovery, and provide a more complete understanding of proteome-phenotype relationships. Here we present cross-platform proteomics imputation variational autoencoder (cpiVAE), a deep generative model for bidirectional imputation of protein abundances between two widely used platforms: Olink and SomaScan. Using a training cohort of paired measurements from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), cpiVAE learns a joint latent representation that enables translation of protein profiles. We evaluate cpiVAE relative to benchmarks provided by established methods, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and the Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) algorithm from Seurat v4. The cpiVAE method achieves up to 30% higher correlation between imputed and true values than the benchmark. The model also generalizes well to an independent cohort from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). Without retraining, cpiVAE maintains high performance compared to benchmarks. Associations of imputed protein levels with clinical phenotypes closely mirror results using the actual measurements. We demonstrate the additional value of an interpretable AI model using a post-hoc feature importance matrix. The cpiVAE-derived network shows significant overlap with known associations in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database, highlighting its ability to capture underlying biology. In summary, cpiVAE offers an accurate, generalizable, and interpretable solution for cross-platform proteomic imputation, enabling integrated analyses across studies with proteomics measured on different platforms.

To address these limitations, we introduce PertAdapt, a framework that unlocks FMs to accurately predict genetic perturbation effects via integrating a plug-in perturbation adapter and an adaptive loss. The adapter employs a gene-similarity-masked attention mechanism to jointly encode perturbation conditions and contextualized representations of unperturbed cells, enabling more effective knowledge transfer. To better capture differential expression patterns, the adaptive loss dynamically reweights perturbation-sensitive genes relative to global transcriptomic signals. Extensive experiments across seven perturbation datasets, including both single- and double-gene settings, demonstrate that PertAdapt consistently outperforms non-pretrained and FM baselines. Moreover, PertAdapt demonstrates strong capacity for modeling multiplexed gene interactions, generalizing in limited-data regimes, and maintaining robustness across backbone sizes.

We use QuickSpotter and StomEdit to quantify how stomatal morphology evolves at the population level during cotyledon development and demonstrate how the programs can be used to extract subtle differences in stomatal development following pharmacological treatments. Finally, we describe PairCaller, a pair-calling classifier that accompanies QuickSpotter and can be used to identify stomatal clusters, a physiologically relevant and widely studied developmental phenotype.

However, it is difficult to study these processes on a genome-wide scale using traditional low-throughput experiments. Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), especially high definition SRT, have offered opportunities in deciphering the determinants of cellular localization at unprecedented scale and resolution. But it is challenging to digest the abundance of transcriptomics and positional information of the numerous cells in SRT data. To address this gap, we developed a fully interpretable multi-instance deep learner, spacer. We deployed spacer to a panel of 17 high definition and 20 low definition SRT datasets, for studying how stromal and immune cells were recruited into tumors and heart during myocarditis. We coupled spacer with orthogonal immuno-peptidomics, spatial T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and single cell sequencing experiments. We discovered genes that encode more immunogenic peptides and that are involved in developmental pathways are more potent in recruiting T cells to local tumor sites. We also found, however, that tumor cells tend to down-regulate such genes to avoid T cell recognition. On the other hand, expression of mucins in the tumor cells was found to repel T cell localization. For the engaging cell side, we uncovered a tumor-engaging gene signature for T cells, validated by spatial-TCR-seq data. Spacer also revealed that CD4+ T cells, though fewer in numbers, are more responsive than CD8+ T cells in the heart during myocarditis. Collectively, this study establishes a spatially resolved paradigm for studying cellular localization mechanisms in situ and paves the way for the construction of a comprehensive cellular recruiting-engaging interaction atlas in solid tissues.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

In dendritic cells (DCs), IMQ promotes formation of ER-mitochondria contact sites (MAMs), inducing ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). These pathways act independently of, yet converge with, TLR7/MyD88 signaling to enhance IL-23 expression. IMQ also increases cytosolic Ca{superscript 2}+, facilitating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In parallel, keratinocytes exposed to IMQ activate UPR-dependent genes, including Defb14 (mBD14), a psoriasis-associated antimicrobial peptide. Extracellular mtDNA and mBD14 then cooperatively stimulate plasmacytoid DCs through TLR9, establishing a feed-forward inflammatory loop. We further identify Gelsolin as a direct IMQ-binding protein that mitigates IMQ-induced ER stress; its loss amplifies ER stress, UPR activation, and oxidative stress, and its expression is reduced in human psoriatic lesions. Thus, MAM-UPR signaling links intracellular organelle stress to the intercellular networks that drive psoriatic inflammation, with Gelsolin acting as a critical intrinsic safeguard.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Hence, the variation of S (sequence conservation) among genes may have two resources: one is the variation of gene pleiotropy among genes (K-mode), and the other is the variation of baseline intensity among genes (B-mode). While K can be effectively estimated (denoted by Ke) based on the phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences, the correlation between Ke and empirical pleiotropy measures remains uninvestigated. In this paper, we show positive correlations of effective gene pleiotropy with protein-protein interactions, expression broadness, enzyme connections, and involved biological processes.

The precise mechanisms that orchestrate CTR activation, modulate its downstream signaling dynamics, and give rise to structural anomalies in mutant variants remain incompletely defined and warrant comprehensive investigation. Here, we found that salmon CT treatment suppressed the growth of patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) by activating the Hippo pathway through the CTR/cAMP/PKA/LATS1 signaling cascade, while simultaneously inhibiting the oncogenic YAP/TAZ transcription factors. However, GSCs expressing a phosphorylation-resistant YAP mutant were refractory to growth inhibition by CT in vitro. GSCs, unlike differentiated glioma cells (DGCs), expressed high levels of CTR thus making them suitable for CT-based therapy. Furthermore, the intranasal delivery of salmon CT inhibited glioma growth initiated by GSCs in an intracranial orthotopic mouse model, resulting in increased survival in the mice. In addition, unlike the WT, the CTR mutants failed to activate the Hippo pathway. A large-scale, microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulation study of mutant CTR systems revealed remarkable changes in CTR interactions with the CT and G-GTPase domains. Packing and conformational dynamics data from simulation studies of the WT and mutant CTR systems could explain the perturbed cAMP/PKA signaling that may compromise downstream signaling.

Experimental studies have identified specialized leader and follower cells that work together during this process, but the biophysical rules governing their interaction remain unclear. We present a mechanistic, cell-based computational model using the Cellular Potts framework to investigate how heterotypic adhesion, leader motility, and follower proliferation jointly shape invasion. Leader-follower tumors were simulated across 13,310 parameter sets, and invasion was quantified by invasive and infiltrative areas, finger-like protrusions, solitary defectors, and detached clusters. From these simulations, we identified four distinct invasion phenotypes: non-invasive, bulk collective, single-cell, and multimodal. Multimodal invasion--the coexistence of cohesive strands, solitary cells, and small clusters--emerged as the most prevalent phenotype, particularly under moderate adhesion, high motility, and intermediate proliferation. Proliferation exhibited nonlinear effects: moderate division reinforced cohesive invasion, whereas excessive growth destabilized tumor architecture. Mapping outcomes across the parameter space revealed sharp transitions between invasion modes, underscoring trade-offs between adhesion and motility in shaping invasion complexity. Our results show that hybrid invasion behaviors, previously considered rare, arise robustly from simple mechanical rules and are favored in a broad region of the parameter space. This framework reconciles binary models of invasion with experimental observations of heterogeneity, providing predictive insights into how modulating adhesion, motility, or proliferation can restrict metastatic spread.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

To overcome these limitations, this study establishes a structured, stepwise protocol for developing cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer cell lines using HeLa (HPV18) and SiHa (HPV16) models. We hypothesised that a predefined dosing and monitoring scheme would shorten induction time while improving the reproducibility of resistance generation.

Here, we use ex vivo infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), rather than routinely used B cell enriched culture systems, to study immune and viral dynamics during primary EBV infection. We combined bulk RNA sequencing, EBV transcript enrichment, and flow cytometry to characterize cellular responses across Days 1, 7-8, and 14 post-infection. Early infection triggered a monocyte-specific antiviral response marked by changes in the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism (LIPA, lysosomal acid lipase) and chemotaxis (CCR1 and CCR2). Inhibitors of LIPA increased EBV titers during primary infection, indicating that LIPA is part of an early monocyte-driven antiviral response. At later timepoints post-infection, donor-dependent variability in lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) outgrowth was associated with divergent immune states. Donors that failed to generate LCLs demonstrated increased frequencies of CD8+ T cells and reduced numbers of regulatory T cells (CD4?CD25?FOXP3?). EBV transcriptomics revealed that LCL-failed donors exhibited elevated early lytic gene expression but did not establish a type III latency program. Our findings suggest that individual variations in immune cell composition and gene expression may account for differences in the immune response to EBV. These findings define temporal immune and viral signatures that predict transformation outcome and highlight intact PBMCs as a tractable model to study EBV pathogenesis in a genetically diverse, human-specific context.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

As economies grow, S. sonnei replaces S. flexneri as the dominant cause of shigellosis, however the basis of this epidemiological shift remains unclear. Here we investigated whether S. sonnei is better equipped to survive nutrient starvation, a crucial condition for persistence both outside the host and within the colonic lumen. S. sonnei exhibited greater survival under long-term nutrient starvation (LTNS) than S. flexneri, rapidly activating survival mechanisms. We interrogated the genome of S. sonnei using Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS) revealing that metabolic pathways (ATP, nucleotide, and amino acid synthesis), and envelope homeostasis complexes (e.g., Tol-Pal, Bam) are conditionally essential for LTNS. TraDIS findings were validated by non-competitive and competitive survival of wild-type and deletion mutant strains. We compared the homology of conditionally essential genes between S. sonnei and S. flexneri to identify putative genetic markers of differential interspecies LTNS survival. Analysis of ldcA (a peptidoglycan carboxypeptidase) and rseA (the anti-sigma factor regulator) indicated a major role in sustaining survival in LTNS in S. sonnei; however, allele-swap with S. flexneri alleles restored wild-type survival in S. sonnei suggesting that monogenic changes may not explain the divergent survival of these two species. Together, these data define the molecular adaptations of starvation resistance in S. sonnei and provide insights into its epidemiological dominance in high-income countries.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

We investigated the function of the enlarged male hindlegs in the New Guinean thorny devil stick insects, Eurycantha calcarata in male-male and male-female interactions. Field and lab experiments showed that larger males with proportionally larger hindlegs were more likely to win fights over access to females and subsequently mate. Behavioral sequence analyses and contest cost predictors indicated that males likely use a mutual assessment strategy. Surprisingly, males did not appear to use their hindlegs as signals of fighting ability, relying instead on tactile and chemical cues to assess opponents. Hindlegs were employed only to deliver powerful squeezes in rare, escalated fights. During copulation, males also used hindlegs to stabilize their position, but as females did not appear to resist, we found no evidence for a coercive function. These findings suggest that enlarged male hindlegs in E. calcarata serve purely as force-delivering combat tools rather than signaling structures, even though males assess rivals during contests. These result highlight how understanding the specific functions and contexts of weapon use provides critical insight into the diversification of sexually selected traits.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

We found that SMARCB1-deficient tumors have a defect in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway, and SMARCB1 is essential for maintaining the protein level of the core MMEJ protein Polymerase Q (POLQ). Mechanistically, SMARCB1 facilitates the nuclear export of the POLQ mRNA through its interaction with the nuclear pore complex. Interestingly, loss of MMEJ in RT cells leads to a compensatory activation of, and a hyper-dependence on, the Fanconi Anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway. Knockout or inhibition of this pathway selectively kills RT cells. Notably, RBM39 degraders, novel splicing modulators, effectively inhibit the FA/BRCA pathway and kill RT cells.

Loss of TOM70 disrupts the sequestration of nuclear pore complexes, but not senescence-associated aggregates and nucleolar components, into the GUNC. Tom70's role appears independent of its canonical function in mitochondrial import and instead reflects a meiosis-specific requirement for mitochondria-nuclear envelope tethering. During meiosis II, Tom70 concentrates around the GUNC, where it recruits the nuclear envelope tethering protein Cnm1. Loss of CNM1 partially phenocopies tom70{triangleup}, consistent with parallel tethering interactions.

Neurovascular dysfunction and blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown are recognized as early events in AD, often preceding amyloid{beta} deposition. Primary human brain micro endothelial cells (HBMECs) from a 38 year-old male were treated with exosomes from young (18 to 25 years) and old (65 to 72 years) donors. Whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing analysis identified 5,432 differentially expressed genes, which were organized into five transcriptional clusters. Two principal clusters demonstrated reciprocal patterns: 1) exosomes derived from serum of older adult donors (65 to 72 years) downregulated genes essential for mitochondrial function (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) and protein synthesis (e.g., ribosomal biogenesis) and 2) upregulating genes linked to inflammation, junctional remodeling, and proliferative signaling. Crucially, subsequent treatment with exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors (18 to 25 years) reversed these detrimental transcriptomic profiles via restoration of the expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal machinery toward baseline and suppressed the inflammatory and maladaptive proliferative signaling induced by exosomes derived from serum of older adult donors. These findings demonstrate that exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors can counteract detrimental signals of aging at the transcriptional level, reinforcing the cellular architecture underlying BBB integrity. This supports the therapeutic potential of using exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors to reverse endothelial aging and interrupt the early neurovascular dysfunction that contributes to the progression of AD.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

RV adaptation in PH is sexually dimorphic and more preserved in females, mediated by protective estrogen receptor  (ER) signaling in cardiomyocytes. However, the effects of ER on RV endothelial cells (RVECs), a critical mediator of RV homeostasis and adaptation, are unknown. We hypothesized that ER exerts sexually dimorphic pro-angiogenic effects on RVECs in vitro and promotes RV vascularization in vivo. Compared to cells isolated from wild-type animals, RVECs from male and female rats with an ER loss-of-function mutation (ERMut) showed reduced ability to form pseudo-vascular networks and migrate. RVECs from female ERMut rats demonstrated increased apoptosis. In a PH model induced by monocrotaline (MCT), female ERMut rats exhibited increased RV hypertrophy and reduced RV capillary density before (10 days) and at the time of established PH (28 days). Capillary rarefaction was associated with increased RVEC apoptosis, and, as identified by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, by a net loss of the endocardial RVEC sub-population. Differentially expressed gene analysis and pathway analysis identified that capillary and endocardial RVECs from female MCT-PH ERMut rats demonstrated decreased expression of migration pathways and increased expression of apoptosis pathways. These findings reveal a sex-specific endothelial-intrinsic role of ER that is essential for angiogenesis in the RV under both homeostatic and pathological conditions. This effect appears to stem from the enhanced survival and migration capacity of capillary and endocardial RVEC.

These capacities, tool use and physical reasoning, are often assumed to rely on shared cognitive and neural mechanisms. At some level, this correspondence is expected: using an object typically requires understanding its physical properties. However, both capacities are complex and multicomponential, so the relationship between them may vary across levels of representation and task demands. Here, we asked whether third-person physical reasoning about object dynamics can dissociate from tool use (i.e., performing a tool's typical action, such as using a hammer to drive a nail) in individuals with left-hemisphere stroke. We tested 11 patients, five of whom showed impairments in tool use. Physical reasoning was assessed using a novel collection of tasks probing judgments about mass, velocity, and timing across static and dynamic scenes. Tool use was evaluated using a classic gesture-to-sight task, a pantomime-based measure in which participants are shown pictures of familiar tools and asked to demonstrate how each would be used. We identified an individual-level dissociation: patient I.A. showed impairment in gesturing the use of objects despite preserved physical reasoning, often outperforming neurotypical controls. This pattern was complemented by patient N.P., who showed the reverse profile, with intact tool use gestures but difficulties in some physical reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that the ability to reason about the physical world and tool use can dissociate behaviorally and be independently disrupted by brain damage. This challenges the view that physical reasoning and tool use draw on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms and suggests that at least some of their components are distinct.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

In the brain, this function is performed by microglia, which must clear diverse debris substrates, including that caused by cell death. Although the subsequent fate of these phagocytic microglia is a critical regulatory point that impacts whether the brain resolves a debris environment, the genetic mechanisms that control microglia fate after debris clearance remain mostly unknown. To address this, we conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen in zebrafish using a custom-built robotic confocal microscope. We selected candidate genes from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of embryonic mouse microglia. This screen identified several modulators of microglial lifespan and cannibalism that are enriched in mouse and zebrafish microglia, including interleukin-10 receptor beta (il10rb), a receptor subunit for the cytokine IL10. Perturbation of il10, il10rb, and downstream signaling molecules JAK/STAT in zebrafish reduced microglial death. Expression analysis in mouse and zebrafish confirmed that microglia express both il10 and il10rb. Given the established role of IL10 in lysosomal remodeling, we hypothesized that it regulates microglial survival through lysosomal acidification. While il10rb perturbation did not alter lysosome number or size, it caused a significant reduction in LysoTracker-positive lysosomes, indicating decreased lysosomal acidification. Inhibiting v-ATPase also reduced microglial death, reinforcing the link between lysosomal pH and cell fate. Our findings reveal a cytokine-regulated mechanism where lysosomal dynamics determine the survival of phagocytic microglia. We propose that a necroptosis-cannibalism process functions as a quality control mechanism for microglial turnover, which is critical for refining neuroimmune cell function in the brain.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

In our context, classical bottleneck analyses frameworks showed to be poorly accurate. By investigating data with novel bottleneck models, we conclude that the overlooked time dimension is crucial to understand root colonisation but also allows the resolution of previously inaccessible infection metrics. We define a new type of ``time-resolved'' bottlenecks describing infection scenarios where entry of pathogen occurs continuously with growth of pathogen in the host. Application of the ``time-resolved'' bottleneck framework to two published animal infection datasets confirms that it is not host-specific but may provide new conceptual understanding to many experimental studies that assumed bottlenecks to be instantaneous.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Reduced LPL activity contributes to hypertriglyceridemia, a major cardiovascular risk factor. LPL activity is thought to depend on the conformation of the lid domain, the lipid pore, N- and C-terminal domains (NTD, CTD), and stabilization of these domains by endogenous activators such as apolipoprotein C-II (ApoC-II). Despite major clinical significance, the structure-function relationship of LPL's functional domains and cofactors remain incompletely understood. To address this, we performed the longest known (1-s) molecular dynamics simulations of LPL independently and in complex with an ApoC-II mimetic peptide (ApoC-II-P). For the first time, we show that LPL's flexible lid can adopt multiple orientations, transitioning between open and closed states that regulate lipid pore access and catalytic activity. We also observed 'flipping' of ~180{degrees} by the CTD, a unique characteristic that dictates LPL activity when not in a closed lid state. Furthermore, ApoC-II-P stabilizes LPL by bridging its NTD and CTD, while maintaining an optimal lid orientation. Biochemical and cellular assays corroborate these findings, demonstrating that ApoC-II-P enhances LPL hydrolysis and supports noncanonical LPL functions. Together, these insights reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms governing LPL regulation and activity dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

By combining cell-based assays with primary endothelial cells and genome-wide expression and methylation measurements, we found that ZONAB depletion results in mitochondrial deregulation, increased reactive oxygen species and a defective oxidative stress response, as well as increased promoter methylation of cell cycle genes. Consequently, ZONAB depletion triggered cellular senescence via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent pathway, which was attenuated by an antioxidant or by drugs targeting mitochondrial function or fragmentation. Thus, our results reveal how ZONAB controls changes in gene expression and DNA methylation to regulate endothelial proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis, indicating a central role of ZONAB in vascular health.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

While this phenomenon has been well-studied in insects, limited knowledge exists for other taxa, including crustaceans. Among crustaceans, achelatan lobsters, such as Palinuridae and Scyllaridae, exhibit a unique metamorphic transition from a flattened phyllosoma larva to a three-dimensional puerulus or nisto larva in a single molt. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying this transformation, focusing on carapace deformation through histological analysis, live imaging, and computational modeling. Three-dimensional micro-computed tomography revealed a significant reduction in body length during metamorphosis. Live imaging captured dynamic morphological changes, including epithelial contraction and subsequent reshaping. Scanning electron microscopy identified a distinctive furrow structure on the carapace surface, absent in post-molt puerulus larvae, suggesting a role in the transformation process. To explore the formation of this furrow pattern, a computational model was developed based on differential shrinkage rates in vertical and horizontal directions. The model successfully reproduced similar patterns observed in natural specimens, implying that controlled anisotropic contraction could contribute to morphogenesis. Furthermore, three-dimensional shrinkage simulations demonstrated that local contraction with constrained out-of-plane deformation can generate folds, which later expand to form curved structures. This study provides novel insights into the biomechanics of arthropod molting, highlighting a previously unrecognized mechanism of two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional transformation. The findings enhance our understanding of achelatan lobster development and offer broader implications for exoskeletal morphogenesis across arthropods.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Current best-practices rely heavily on the application of toxic oral baits and have led to successful eradications and remarkable recoveries of native flora and fauna. Yet this single method is not universally applicable. Reliance on a single method limits further eradication success in situations where toxicants cannot be used or remnant populations persist after application. Genetic biocontrol offers a suite of new solutions to potentially improve outcomes in the critical \"last mile\" of eradication. These approaches involve the release of genetically modified individuals of the target species to reduce population fitness over time. These include self-limiting approaches which require multiple releases and self-sustaining mechanisms (i.e., select gene-drive systems) which could theoretically collapse populations after a single release. While gene drive systems have received significant attention, their development in vertebrates remains technically challenging, and their ecological and regulatory implications are still in active debate. In contrast, some non-drive genetic biocontrol approaches, such as Y-linked editors, fsRIDL, and Gravid Lethal, offer self-limiting alternatives that may be more immediately deployable. These approaches could be used to supplement toxicant-based methods and may also have reduced environmental risks and regulatory barriers. To evaluate the potential of these tools, we developed an individual-based model simulating the eradication of house mice (Mus musculus) on a 125ha island with an initial population of 11,000 individuals. We tested various combinations of genetic biocontrol release and effort strategies to understand tradeoffs between required effort and uncertainty for achieving successful eradication. Under certain effort strategies, we found that the Gravid Lethal approach performed the best, achieving eradication in less than 2.3 years with intensive release effort and monitoring. Our findings suggest that integrating non-drive genetic biocontrol into adaptive management frameworks could enhance the effectiveness and feasibility of rodent eradication programs. These tools are not replacements for toxicants but may serve as critical supplements--particularly in the \"last mile\" of eradication. Further stakeholder engagement is needed to assess the ecological, ethical, and logistical dimensions of deploying these technologies in real-world settings.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

One example is the reported service provisioning by males in primate societies, which is difficult to explain by traditional reciprocity-based models. In this study, we investigated group progressions and sex roles in wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) to test two hypotheses for the observed male bias in cooperative and protective behaviours: paternal care versus reputation-based partner choice. Over more than two years, we recorded the order and timing of individual progressions in five neighbouring groups of vervet monkeys across two terrain types differing in risk (rivers and roads). Males, particularly dominant males, were more likely to lead than females or juveniles, and their probability of leading increased in high-risk terrain. When leading, males often crossed alone, thereby assuming higher predation risk, whereas when not leading, males usually crossed within subgroups. Dominant males who had no offspring yet were most likely to lead during risky progressions. Males who did not lead did not preferentially cross with infants based on their paternal status, refuting the paternal care hypothesis. Instead, male leadership in risky contexts appears to represent a cooperative service. While some of these findings are consistent with the reputation-based partner choice model, we found no clear evidence that such services translated into direct mating advantages. Overall, our results highlight the role of dominance and reproductive status in shaping male service provisioning and underscore its potential adaptable function in primate social organisation.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

R.; Singh, R.", "abstract": "Foundation models pre-trained on certain biological data modalities exhibit systematic representational biases when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new assays. The embedding drift largely arises from instrumentation and protocol-related artifacts rather than true biological variation in cell states or tissue morphology. These drifts are distinct from conventional batch effects and cannot be remedied by retraining as sample sizes are often insufficient, and modifying existing embeddings breaks downstream tools that depend on stable representations. We introduce USHER, an adaptable framework to learn simple transforms that return OOD embeddings to a foundation model's reference space. USHER enables embedding transformation via an expectation maximization-style procedure. Given a reference in-distribution sample, USHER first estimates a Fused Gromov-Wasserstein coupling that aligns unpaired OOD (source) and reference (target) embeddings by minimizing transport distance while preserving local structure. To make optimal transport couplings more useful for downstream tasks, we introduce the concept of entropic filtering to retain only high-confidence correspondences. In the second step, USHER learns a low-complexity transformation that reliably restores the model's representation space for OOD data. We demonstrate this learned transformation generalizes to other OOD data from similar experimental conditions. We applied USHER to correct platform-specific biases seen when running scGPT on Xenium transcript counts: USHER maps Xenium embeddings back to the native scRNA-seq representation space, improving cell type clustering and cross-platform integration. Histopathology foundation models trained on H&E images fail on MALDI metabolite-profiled tissue images due to data-acquisition artifacts. USHER corrects these, enabling cell-type classification and protein abundance imputation.

Several authors have suggested considering the complete Nx curve rather than just the N50 value, but while using N90 values or considering the area under the Nx curve with auN statistics provide more complete measures of contiguity, they share the limitation of being unsuited to direct comparison across a range of genome sizes. We introduced snail plots to provide a genome-size independent way to summarise a range of commonly used assembly metrics. Here we demonstrate that easily-learnt visual differences between snail plots allow simultaneous consideration of metrics across several key areas of assembly quality to rapidly identify high- and low-quality assemblies. We show that prominent features in snail plots of high-quality assemblies effectively highlight N50, N90 and auN contiguity statistics, but since the presentation is scaled to the longest scaffold, plots can be compared effectively across a wide range of taxa and assembly sizes. We use the core features of a snail plot to derive a proportional measure of assembly quality based on auN, adjusted for ambiguous, N, bases and scaled to the length of the longest scaffold. We show that this snail score value corresponds closely to a qualitative assessment of overall assembly quality from visual interpretation of a snail plot.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

One obstacle is the generation of giant vesicles (GVs) large and rigid enough to contain potentially mobile micron-size organisms in a way that results in efficient cell encapsulation. To address this challenge we developed a modified version of the previously described gel-assisted swelling method, in which immobilized GVs are formed by hydrating a lipid film deposited on agar with a heated solution. We used solutions containing Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 cells to test for bacterial entrapment. Systematically exploring POPC:DOPS:cholesterol ternary mixtures to vary the surface charge and rigidity of the GVs' membrane allowed the determination of specific conditions leading to the efficient entrapment of these highly mobile cells. Lipid order measurements with the fluorescent membrane probe Laurdan show that entrapment is associated with a significant decrease in membrane rigidity between the swelling and entrapment steps. The high sensitivity of successful entrapment on DOPS concentration further suggests that membrane fluctuations play a major role in allowing the micron-size bacteria to push through the membrane and break in and out of the GVs.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

This divergence is exemplified in nitrate and nitrite transport across bacterial membranes, which supports anaerobic respiration and involves the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters NarK and NarU. NarK operates as a nitrate/nitrite antiporter, whereas NarU's mechanism remains unresolved, with evidence suggesting potential symport activity. Using extensive adaptive molecular dynamics simulations and Markov State Modeling, we mapped NarU's conformational free-energy landscape and assessed how its behavior contrasts with mechanistic principles established for NarK. NarU follows a similar gating pathway but displays pronounced asymmetry favoring the outward-facing state and stabilizes an apo-occluded intermediate inaccessible to antiporters. This state arises from rotation of an arginine gating pair and a hinge glycine substitution that enhances gate flexibility. These sequence-dependent adaptations alter gating energetics and reprogram the scaffold to permit coupled co-transport.

This can be driven by acquired mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1), such as Y537S or D538G, that primarily emerge in patients with prior aromatase inhibitor therapy and results in constitutive estrogen-independent ER activity. Progesterone receptors (PR) are important modifiers of ER activity, in part via direct binding. We previously showed that PR mediates expansion of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) populations and promotes tamoxifen resistance in nuclear ER/PR transcriptional complexes. In this study, we sought to define whether PR function changes in the context of ESR1 mutations. PR readily interacted with wild type (WT), but not Y537S or D538G ERs. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies demonstrated that ER+ breast cancer models expressing Y537S ER exhibited a distinct response to progesterone. CSC populations were enhanced in Y537S ER+ cells compared to WT ER+ cells. PR knockdown demonstrated that this property required PR expression but was unresponsive to antiprogestins. Moreover, we identified PR-dependent transcriptional programs such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) that can be leveraged to target CSC populations in Y537S ESR1-mutant breast cancer. The UPR activator ErSO, but not UPR inhibitors, blocked expansion of CSCs in WT as well as Y537S ER+ models.

Previous studies have demonstrated that 1AR activation can inhibit {beta}-adrenergic regulation of electrical and mechanical activity of cardiac myocytes, although the signaling mechanisms involved were not previously known. In the present study, we used FRET-based biosensors in adult rat ventricular myocytes to demonstrate that this crosstalk effect involves inhibition of cAMP production by nuclear 1AARs acting on {beta}ARs found on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we established that this inside-out signaling mechanism involves a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that uncouples {beta}ARs from downstream signaling in a G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK)/arrestin-dependent manner. These results reveal a novel, non-canonical signaling mechanism contributing to 1AR responses in the heart, and that this effect limits {beta}AR production of cAMP by NE. This mechanism may contribute to the cardioprotective effect previously ascribed to 1AAR activation. These findings also clearly demonstrate the importance of considering the contributions of 1 and {beta}ARs together when studying the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

However, seasonal plasticity in symbiosis and holobiont metabolism, along with the presence of cryptic species, can complicate data interpretation. Therefore, quantifying seasonal plasticity in coral physiology and incorporating genetic identification are essential for accurately interpreting and drawing conclusions from trait-based and fitness-based analyses. To test the effect of seasonal and site variation on physiological plasticity we sampled three ecologically dominant genera, Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites across three lagoon sites (n=15 tagged colonies genus-1 site-1) on the north shore of Mo'orea French Polynesia in January, March, September, and December of 2020. We identified coral host and intracellular symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and quantified 13 physiological variables within the holobiont. Genetic analyses identified A. pulchra along with cryptic lineages in Pocillopora (P. meandrina, P. tuahiniensis) and Porites (P. evermanni, P. lobata/lutea). A. pulchra was dominated by Durusdinium trenchii and also contained Symbiodinium microadriaticum. Symbiont communities differed between cryptic congeners, with P. meandrina hosting Cladocopium latusorum and P. tuahiniensis hosting Cladocopium pacificum, whereas P. evermanni and P. lobata/lutea both hosted Cladocopium (C15), but each with unique C15 profiles. Weedy taxa such as Acropora and Pocillopora displayed a cycle of symbiont boom and bust in response to seasonally variable light and temperature, likely contributing to the high stress sensitivity of these taxa. In contrast, despite seasonal environmental variability, Porites displayed greater symbiont stability, with temperature, rather than light, serving as the stronger explanatory variable of seasonal variation in host physiology. Increased host biomass under cooler conditions, which provides energy reserves, may serve as an important stabilizing factor in massive Porites well-documented stress resilience. Collectively, our data provide essential evidence of the need for integrative analyses considering baseline physiological states across seasons along with host and symbiont genetics, particularly in light of the plethora of climate change related stress test assays taking place throughout the year across coral taxa with cryptic lineages.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an important role in heavy metal detoxification, their epigenetic regulation under heavy metal stress remains poorly understood. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (5mC) and N6-methyladenine (6mA), are emerging as important regulators of stress-responsive genes. We studied the epigenetic regulation of ABC transporter genes in three Oryza species Oryza sativa indica, Oryza rufipogon, and Oryza glaberrima by analysing promoter methylation patterns. Our data show that 5mC is abundant in CHG motifs, whereas 6mA is mostly found at AHCA motifs, indicating sequence-specific methylation preferences across different rice species. Notably, indica rice exhibited higher promoter methylation levels compared to O. rufipogon and O. glaberrima, suggesting a potential link between increased DNA methylation and reduced ABC transporter expression, which may contribute to heightened HM sensitivity in cultivated rice. Phylogenetic analysis further highlighted species-specific variations in methylation patterns, supporting the role of epigenetics in shaping HM stress adaptation. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing heavy metal tolerance in rice and open avenues for epigenetic-based crop improvement strategies.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Resistance grades were determined by the leaf chlorosis index, and three comparison groups were established. Secondary metabolome profiling revealed that resistant varieties showed greater metabolic changes under infestation than susceptible ones. In total, 713 total metabolites and 275 metabolites with significantly differential accumulation among germplasms were identified across the comparisons. KEGG enrichment highlighted 246 metabolites and 75 differential metabolites involved in flavonoid, flavonol, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

For non-science majors, an introductory biology course may be their sole exposure to college-level science and only opportunity to learn about enzymes and metabolism. Framing these topics within issues that are personally relevant can make the material more meaningful and impactful for non-majors. There is a need to develop curricula that instructors of large-enrollment introductory biology courses can use to teach non-biology majors about enzymes and metabolism. Here, we designed and implemented a lesson that integrates enzyme function and metabolism within the context of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are a widely prescribed class of antidepressants whose efficacy can be influenced by enzymes. Genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes can result in individual differences in metabolic responses and lead to medication-induced weight gain. Framing the content in this way allows non-major students to connect enzyme function to genetics, energy balance, and metabolic processes through a health-related, societally relevant issue. In our lesson, students engaged in collaborative learning activities that emphasized interpreting biological data, graphing, and scientific reasoning. Pre- and post-assessment data from a conceptual inventory showed learning gains that exceeded baseline data and were greater than those observed with the traditional curriculum. Students also reported a more coherent understanding of enzyme function and a greater appreciation of the contents relevance to their own lives. This lesson provides an example of embedding biochemical concepts in real-world contexts for students who are non-science majors.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

To circumvent manual curation, we introduce 'Thermo-Flux', a semi-automated Python package,which converts stoichiometric metabolic network models into comprehensive thermodynamic-stoichiometric models for improved predictions. 'Thermo-Flux' enables (i) automated mass and charge balancing while considering physical and biochemical parameters, (ii) definition of transporter variants and Gibbs energies for membrane transport, (iii) robust handling of metabolites with unknown structures or Gibbs energies, and integrates (iv) recent advances in determining Gibbs energies and their respective uncertainties. To guide users in the conversion of stoichiometric models into comprehensive thermodynamic-stoichiometric models, we provide detailed instructions on how to use the 'Thermo-Flux' pipeline and include background information to enable appropriate modeling assumptions. By converting 87 stoichiometric models from the BiGG database and demonstrating improved flux predictions for a genome-scale yeast model (iMM904) converted into a thermodynamic-stoichiometric model, we showcase the applicability of 'Thermo-Flux'.

C.; Bridges, Z.; O'Connell, K. M.

Their activity is closely linked to metabolic state and their output is sensitive to diet-induced plasticity, which may influence the development of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. However, most studies use young male mice, even though obesity and its comorbidities are sensitive to both biological sex and aging, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the role of these neurons in females and in older animals. Our goal was to begin to address this gap by investigating the effects of diet and age on AgRP/NPY neuronal activity in female mice in both early adulthood and midlife. Methods: Female transgenic NPY-GFP mice aged 8-32 weeks were fed either a standard control chow diet or a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFD) for 8-24 weeks and brain slice patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the response of AgRP/NPY neurons. Results: We found that in young, lean female mice, the baseline firing rate of AgRP/NPY neurons is significantly elevated compared to age-matched males, thus the impact of HFD on the output of these neurons is blunted relative to control. However, in the baseline firing rate of neurons from lean middle-aged female mice is significantly lower, resulting in a greater relative impact of HFD on AgRP/NPY neuronal output, the development of neuronal leptin resistance, and significant weight gain. Conclusions: Both sex and age significantly impact the function and modulation of AgRP/NPY neurons, emphasizing the need to include these biological variables in experimental design.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

However, the persistence of long-term neural impacts after alcohol and stress are less understood. This study investigated midlife cognition and neuropathological changes following a history of alcohol and stress exposure. Methods: C57BL/6J mice acclimated to ethanol drinking (15% v/v) before exposure to four cycles of alternating chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure and repeated forced swim stress (FSS), with control groups exposed to air and no stress (AIR/NS). After three months of abstinence, mice were evaluated at midlife (11 months old) on volitional drinking and a final CIE/FSS challenge for stress induced drinking. Spatial learning and cognitive flexibility were assessed using the Barnes maze before brains were collected to evaluate locus coeruleus integrity at 12 months old. Results: CIE/FSS increased volitional alcohol intake, and this drinking phenotype persisted through to midlife despite extended abstinence. CIE/FSS mice showed intact spatial learning but impaired flexibility in the Barnes maze reversal phase. Flexibility impairments were driven by decreased time in the target quadrant and increased errors during the reversal test compared to AIR/NS. Furthermore, CIE/FSS mice showed pathological measures of reduced locus coeruleus integrity common to dementia related disorders, including elevated markers of oxidative stress, apoptosis and reduced autoinhibitory function. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the long-lasting impact of alcohol and stress exposure on cognition, with flexibility impairments persisting into midlife. In addition to cognitive changes, alcohol and stress history produced pathological changes in the locus coeruleus, an area known to mediate cognitive flexibility via its forebrain projections. Together, these results give an insight into the long-lasting impacts of chronic alcohol and stress and how they may accelerate age-related cognitive decline.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

While the chromatin engagement mechanisms of cBAF and PBAF have been structurally resolved, the molecular architecture governing ncBAF interaction with chromatin remains elusive. In this study, by integrating cryo-electron microscopy, biochemical assays and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we resolved the conformational transition of ncBAF-nucleosome complexes from nucleotide-free to nucleotide-bound states. Our analyses establish BCL7 proteins as dynamic molecular tethers connecting the ARP module to the nucleosomal acidic patch and demonstrate that BCL7B promotes ncBAF-mediated nucleosome remodeling, with BRG1-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis triggering conformational changes that modulate BCL7-mediated histone association. Structurally and biochemically, we further demonstrate that {beta}-actin within the BCL7-containing ARP module retains ATP hydrolysis activity, rendering its exposed pointed end structurally compatible with incorporation into the barbed end of nuclear actin filaments, which provides a potential molecular basis for coordinating nuclear actin networks with chromatin remodeling.

In addition to this early-stage function, it was recently shown that activation of the spliceosome depends on the phosphorylation of threonine-proline (TP) motifs in SF3B1's N-terminal domain (NTD) by cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11). This breakthrough result was made possible by the discovery of the CDK11-specific inhibitor OTS964. Trypanosomes are protistan parasites whose proteomes are highly divergent in sequence from those of model organisms, and thus their CDKs were generically named CDC2-related kinases (CRKs). We previously characterized the trimeric CRK9 complex of Trypanosoma brucei and showed that it is essential for spliced leader trans splicing, the predominant splicing mode in the parasite. Although CRK9 and CDK11 deviate from each other substantially, we show that CRK9 activity is required to maintain SF3B1 phosphorylation in vivo, CRK9 directly phosphorylates TP motifs in the SF3B1 NTD in vitro, and the TP motifs themselves are crucial for spliceosome activation, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this essential splicing step.

We define key phosphosites in each region and uncover autoinhibition mediated by interactions within and between them. PRGB2 is dimeric and requires {gamma}TuCs containing the Mozart family microprotein MZT-1 for binding, whereas PRGB1 is monomeric and binds independently of MZT-1.

Leveraging this assay, we quantified the prevalence of phospholipidosis-inducers across several cell-based antiviral repurposing screens. We selected 40 drugs reported to have micromolar antiviral activities and found that 26 of them (65%) induced phospholipidosis within the same concentration range as their reported antiviral activities. Intriguingly, we identified four non-CADs that also induce phospholipidosis, revealing a new group of drugs that can lead to this toxic event and highlighting the importance of facile experimental assays to detect it.

Here, we analyze invasion criteria for threshold-dependent gene drives in continuous-space populations using deterministic reaction-diffusion models and individual-based simulations that better capture the stochasticity of real-world populations. We find substantial variability in invasion outcomes in the individual-based models. Low-threshold modification drives with small fitness costs frequently spread across a wide range of release sizes, including introductions far below those required to succeed in diffusion models. In contrast, threshold-dependent suppression drives exhibit qualitatively different behavior: stochastic effects at low density can often disrupt wavefronts or produce persistent chasing cycles, generally reducing invasion success relative to diffusion-model expectations.

However, these findings are the result of reducing DAF-2 receptor function rather than modulating ligand-receptor interactions. In the current study, we aimed to dissect ligand-receptor interactions that may regulate associative behaviors apart from canonical IIS lifespan phenotypes in C. elegans. To this end, we performed targeted genetic screening of Insulin-like Peptides (ILPs) previously identified as DAF-2 antagonists to test their role in learning and memory phenotypes. We discovered that only a single uncharacterized ILP, INS-17, is required for learning and memory. We also demonstrate that INS-17 is sufficient to confer extended memory ability and can promote the maintenance of learning and memory with age. Additionally, we observe that ins-17 regulates learning and memory ability independent of lifespan, uncoupling IIS-mutant phenotypes. We find that regulation of the ins-17 genetic locus explains its unique requirement among ILP for learning and memory behaviors. Finally, we found that INS-17 may act to signal a state of nutrient deprivation that is required to properly process stimulus valence to promote advantageous behaviors.

The current study examined whether a single acute stress exposure in female rats can induce anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, and whether the timing of the stress, early (postnatal day 28) versus mid-adolescence (postnatal day 36), influences these outcomes. We used a PTSD-relevant stress paradigm that paired acute immobilization with fox-urine predator odor. Female Sprague-Dawley rats completed a battery of behavioral assays to characterize anxiety-like (elevated plus maze, open field test) and depression-like behaviors (sucrose preference test, forced swim test) between 12-16 days post exposure. Acute stress in either early or mid-adolescence caused an increase in anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze 15 days post-exposure. No increase in depression-like behaviors was observed at either age. Our findings suggest that a single exposure to a predator odor when paired with immobilization is sufficient to increase anxiety-like but not depression-like behaviors in female adolescent rats.

Second, human experts are unable to accurately describe their expertise using natural language, nor can they precisely specify what kind of molecule is needed before seeing the generated molecules. To address these problems, we propose a new platform, called HIL-DD, for experts to infuse their experience by selecting molecules generated by AI that meet their criteria, or discarding those that do not. The core generative technology utilizes an Equivariant Rectified Flow Model (ERFM), which offers faster generation speeds than conventional diffusion models, enabling efficient human-AI collaboration. More importantly, we provide a user-friendly interface to ensure smooth and effective collaboration between human experts and AI systems. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our system can produce 3D molecules that align with expert expectations in minimal interactive sessions. These generated molecules maintain drug-like qualities comparable to those created by current state-of-the-art models.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

X.; Eyler, L.", "abstract": "Advances in computational methods have accelerated the application of machine learning to analyze large complex biological data. By applying machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data, researchers have estimated the \"biological age of the brain\" i.e., brain age, and used it as a composite metric for indexing brain health, as opposed to using individual features of the brain extracted from neuroimaging data. These machine learning algorithms/models, often known as \"brain age\" algorithms/models, may take supervised or unsupervised approaches and may utilize one or many imaging modalities during training. We applied 3 regression-based algorithm and 1 neural network-based algorithm trained on varying sample sizes of healthy comparison (HC) participants to estimate the brain age of 73 HC and 44 individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) in our neuroimaging study. Out of the four, 3 were pre-trained off-the-shelf algorithms and 1 was developed and trained on multimodal neuroimaging data from a local cohort. The multimodal algorithm was trained on 51 age-matched HCs and tested on the remaining 22 HCs and 44 BDs. The brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD) score was calculated by subtracting the chronological age from the predicted age. Across four brain age prediction algorithms evaluated in HC, BrainageR and DenseNet demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (r = 0.83; 0.89) and lowest mean absolute errors (MAE = 5.94; 7.26). However, PHOTON (r = 0.65, MAE = 7.71) showed greatest sensitivity to BD as demonstrated by our logistic regression model where the PHOTON brain-PAD was a significant predictor (beta = 0.064, p < 0.05) of BD. Analyses using ICC revealed that agreement levels varied, with PHOTON achieving the highest ICC with DenseNet (0.78) and BrainageR (0.73), which suggests they may pick up similar brain features as opposed to the multimodal algorithm (0.17- 0.43) These results suggest that regularized linear models trained on large samples that explicitly exclude individuals with psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., PHOTON in this case) may be most sensitive to case-control differences despite having lower predictive accuracy. Our findings can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts for researchers working with datasets that are similarly constrained by sample size but include unique combinations of imaging modalities.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

X.; Sutherland, A.; Eyler, L.", "abstract": "Neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) is a promising marker of advanced brain aging, but its link to cognitive function in bipolar disorder (BD) is not well understood, especially when comparing across publicly available algorithms trained on diverse, large sample datasets and to algorithms trained on local cohorts with rich multimodal imaging data. Our study compares algorithms used to estimate brain-PAD in terms of their clinical relevance to cognition in BD. We included 44 euthymic BD I individuals and 73 HCs who completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and we selected nine scores from this battery for further analyses. Raw scores were log-transformed, scaled, and subjected to PCA; PC1 indexed overall executive function. Four brain-PAD algorithms (PHOTON, BrainageR, DenseNet, Multimodal) were applied to T1-weighted MRI data; the multimodal algorithm also included Diffussion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state Magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI) data. For each algorithm, we regressed brain-PAD on age, sex, and their interaction to obtain residuals, then used those residualized brain-PADs (which we refer to subsequently as brain-PADs throughout the text) to predict PC1. We then directly assessed if there were group differences in the relationship of brain-PAD to cognitive function by including an interaction term between group x brain-PAD. We found no significant group x brain-PAD interaction across all four algorithms. Given that, we then combined BD and HC and explored whether brain-PAD was a meaningful predictor of cognitive performance. Multimodal brain-PAD emerged as a strong negative predictor of cognitive performance (Beta Estimate = -0.084, SE = 0.024, t = -3.50, p < 0.001), indicating that those with older-appearing brains, as indexed by the brain-PAD, scored lower on PC1. BrainageR brain-PAD also significantly predicted PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.031, SE = 0.0116, t = -2.71, p < 0.01), and DenseNet brain-PAD showed a modest effect (Beta Estimate = -0.0355, SE = 0.0177, t = -2.00, p < 0.05). PHOTON brain-PAD demonstrated a negative trend with PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.0127, t = -1.92, p = 0.06). Residualized brain-PAD, after accounting for age and sex, was inversely associated with a composite metric of executive functioning, particularly for an algorithm integrating a range of imaging modalities.

However, nutritional interventions show inconsistent cognitive effects, partly due to limited knowledge of the neural pathways linking DHA status to human cognition during sensitive periods of white-matter maturation, such as adolescence. We addressed this gap by studying 99 adolescents drawn from both extremes of performance on a national scholastic examination. Participants completed assessments of scholastic achievement (SA) and intellectual ability (IA), provided erythrocyte DHA samples, and underwent multimodal MRI, including diffusion, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging. Independent component analysis and Bayesian multivariate LASSO models identified brain components jointly associated with DHA and cognition. Across four MRI modalities, a single deep white-matter component consistently emerged as the strongest shared pathway linking DHA with cognition. Tract-resolved analyses highlighted predominant contributions from the fornix and thalamus - temporal fasciculus, with additional subcortical and cortical involvement. In joint models, these components predicted SA and IA after accounting for DHA and other fatty acids, consistent with an indirect, mediation-like pathway. These findings move beyond DHA - behavior correlations by identifying specific neuroanatomical pathways through which a modifiable dietary factor relates to adolescent learning and intellectual performance, offering mechanistic insight relevant to neuroscience, nutrition, and education.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Using this reverse phenotyping strategy, complemented by DNA-barcoded peptide-HLA (pHLA) class II multimers, we here tracked SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive CD4+ T cells longitudinally after repeated mRNA vaccination. Without stimulation, reactive clones showed more Th-neutral features and less of an activated Th1-like state than would be assessed after antigen restimulation.

A.; Schwartz, R.", "abstract": "Phylogenetics, like many subdisciplines of computational biology, faces a growing challenge of dealing with increasingly large and complicated data sets that have been enabled by ever-improving technologies for sequencing. The issue is particularly acute for studies of somatic evolution, such as of single-cell populations in cancers, where vast single-cell data sets may now identify hundreds of thousands of genetically distinct cells with similar scales of mutations distinguishing them. At the same time, the complexity of the biology of somatic evolution has led to complex phylogeny methods that struggle to scale to even modest data sizes. In this paper, we explore the theoretical and empirical basis for one strategy for managing these large data sets: subsampling mutations to solve the computationally challenging phylogeny problem followed by faster solutions for placement of mutations on a putatively known guide tree. We specifically focus on the fundamental question of determining the number of mutations sufficient to recover the true phylogenetic tree at some level of resolution with high probability. We theoretically analyze variants of several common models that underlie popular tools for building clonal lineage trees. We further evaluate the robustness of these theoretical bounds through simulations of these models, extensions of them, and real biological datasets. The results suggest that modest numbers of mutations suffice to reconstruct clonal trees for typical numbers of clones, supporting the subsampling approach as a general strategy for managing the challenges of ever-growing data sets.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Oral glutamine (Gln) supplementation previously showed beneficial effects on gut barrier function in a sex-dependent manner and reduced abdominal pain in IBS patients. Thus, we assessed the sex-dependent response to an oral Gln supplementation in mice with diet-induced obesity and subjected to a chronic restraint stress to mimic IBS. Methods: Male (M) and female (F) C57BL/6 mice received a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) during 14 weeks (W14) and were subjected or not to a restraint stress (S) for the 4 last days. From W12, mice received or not Gln in drinking water (2g/kg/day; n=12/group). Plasma corticosterone, body composition, glucose tolerance (OGTT), intestinal permeability, inflammatory markers in colonic and white adipose tissues, cecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition have been assessed. Within each sex, groups were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test or a 1-way ANOVA test. Results: In M-HFD mice, chronic restraint stress was associated with a better glucose tolerance (-15,46% AUC) and a reduced fasting glycemia that was not observed in F-HFD mice. Gln partially prevented body weight loss, reduced plasma resistin, plasma corticosterone and colonic permeability in female stressed obese mice. In male stressed obese mice, Gln limited lean mass loss, reduced colonic permeability and Ccl2 mRNA level in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Chronic restraint stress and Gln modified cecal microbiota in both sexes but cecal SCFA composition only in male mice. In particular, stress induced an increased abundance of Pseudomonadota in male mice that was partially restored after Gln supplementation. In addition, cecal total SCFA were reduced in Gln-supplemented stressed HFD male mice compared to unstressed HFD mice. In female HFD mice, stress associated to Gln supplementation increased the abundance of Thermodesulfobacteriota and reduced colonic expression of Cxcr3 mRNA. Conclusions: Chronic restraint stress has beneficial effects on glycemia control in male HFD mice without additive effects of Gln supplementation. By contrast, Gln reduces stress-induced corticosterone level and body weight loss only in females. These data, as well as the differential impact of Gln on intestinal permeability and gut microbiota according to the sex, deserves further investigations to decipher the underlying mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

These responses are absent in the glabrous gl1-1 mutant and are not elicited by brushing epidermal pavement cells, indicating a trichome-specific mechanosensory pathway. Mechanistically, this pathway requires MPK3/MPK6 activity and employs malic acid as a key regulator of stomatal aperture, functioning independently of canonical ABA signaling.

Growing evidence points towards a role of aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation in the dysregulation of Syn and sequence of events that lead to the formation of Lewy bodies. However, the triggers leading to aberrant phase separation are unknown, as is the relevance of this phenomenon to the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we showed that Syn spontaneously phase separates into condensates in the presence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplet-rich condensates represent a toxic species of Syn that prevents the turnover of the entrapped lipid droplets; they are also toxic to neighboring mitochondria which are depolarized and undergo increased mitophagy. These findings underscore the increasing importance of lipid droplets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson's disease in particular. The lipid droplets are significantly enriched within the neuromelanin in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and could therefore uniquely facilitate the early Syn-associated neurodegeneration of this region in PD.

E. faecium, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains, are an understudied, clinically important cause of chronic diabetic wound infections. Using a low-dose streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model, we characterized E. faecium wound infection dynamics and identified differences in colonization and clearance compared to non-diabetic animals. At eight hours post infection (hpi), control mice exhibited higher E. faecium wound colony forming units (CFU) than diabetic mice, but cleared the infection more efficiently, resulting in similar CFU by 24 hpi. By contrast, diabetic mice showed impaired clearance, with elevated CFU persisting through 72 hpi. In mixed species infection with S. epidermidis, S. epidermidis CFU increased at 72 hpi while E. faecium CFU remained comparable to single species infection.

Sustained neutrophil recruitment at 72 hpi occurred only in diabetic mice, whereas macrophage accumulation increased from 24 to 72 hpi in all wounds, including sterile controls.

To uncover the genetic basis of this specificity, we analyzed 26 Hamiltonella genomes and their toxin-encoding APSE bacteriophages with distinct protective phenotypes. Our analyses revealed that Hamiltonella strains share a conserved core genome but differ significantly in accessory gene content, reflecting their distinct evolutionary origins. Strikingly, we show that variation in toxin types is the key distinguishing feature of APSE phages in Hamiltonella strains that protect against different parasitoid species. These toxin repertoires include several novel candidates, such as variants with MAC/perforin domains and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins previously unreported in insect defensive symbionts.

TRIM28 directly binds ALKBH2 and mediates its K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas ALKBH2 reciprocally enhances TRIM28 transcription, establishing a homeostatic equilibrium. Upon alkylation stress, acute MMS exposure enhances assembly of the TRIM28-ALKBH2 complex, a process facilitated by MAGEA6, and promotes ALKBH2 degradation. In contrast, prolonged MMS exposure induces K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRIM28, leading to ALKBH2 stabilization and transcriptional upregulation.

B.; Popov, M. A.; Dergunov, A. D.", "abstract": "The significance of cholesterol efflux as a predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) remains controversial. The major pathway of the export of intracellular cholesterol by the ABCA1 transporter includes the acceptance of effluxed cholesterol by lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I and/or high-density lipoproteins (HDL). To separate the contribution of lipid-free and lipid-bound apoA-I with different efficiencies in the total cholesterol efflux and underlying mechanism, we measured apoA-I dissociation concomitant with HDL denaturation, the expression of preselected genes, and the efficiency of cholesterol efflux. HDL preparations from plasma of 63 control and 76 CAD male patients were denatured by 4.25 M urea at the transition midpoint. ApoA-I partitioned 1.5-fold higher into the water phase for HDL from CAD patients relative to controls. The dissociation parameter D was reciprocally correlated with phospholipid and cholesterol levels and PL:apoA-I ratio in HDL from CAD patients. For control patients, the D parameter was positively correlated with CETP and ABCA1 expression level. For CAD patients, the D parameter was negatively correlated with CUBN and ALB expression levels that may be associated with the increased catabolism of lipid-free apoA-I. The apoA-I functionality in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from RAW 264.7 macrophages to urea-pretreated HDL revealed by Vm, Km, and Vm/Km values was similar for HDL from both cohorts. The enrichment of HDL with phospholipid and cholesterol could be involved in the increased apolipoprotein dissociation in CAD. The estimates of the contribution of both lipid-free and lipid-bound apoA-I to total cholesterol efflux are required to accurately describe them as CAD predictors.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

J.; de Jonge, R.", "abstract": "Amplicon sequencing of the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene is one of the most common techniques in microbiome research. A crucial step in analysing this data is to cluster raw sequences into biologically interpretable groups that approximate the actual organisms in a community, which reduces data complexity, facilitates diversity analyses, and enables clearer ecological and functional interpretations. Most approaches rely on fixed sequence similarity thresholds, typically operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at 99-100%. However, finding the correct correspondence between amplicons and the original organisms in a complex community remains challenging, primarily due to the presence of varying copy numbers within genomes and the high similarity of amplicon sequences among species. While the stringent threshold in ASVs prevents merging sequences from different species, it often splits sequences from the same genome into multiple ASVs, inflating species counts. Conversely, the 97% similarity threshold in OTUs tends to frequently collapse multiple distinct organisms into a single unit regardless of their functional or ecological (dis)similarity, and thereby underestimating true diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce ASVNet, an algorithmic framework that leverages amplicon sequence similarity and co-abundance networks to better reflect the underlying organisms in a community. ASVNet builds on the principle that amplicon counts from the same organism co-vary across samples and it thus attempts to cluster these co-occurring, similar sequences as empirical OTUs (eOTUs). Comparative analyses in synthetic and natural root-associated microbial communities with genome-sequenced isolates show that ASVNet-derived eOTUs more accurately represent the original microbes and possess greater biological relevance than OTUs defined at any fixed threshold. By providing a biologically grounded framework to amplicon sequence data interpretation, ASVNet extends our ability to extract meaningful insights from complex microbiome datasets.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

State-of-the-art tools such as Mash, Dashing2, and Bindash2 provide compact sketches and accurate similarity estimates for large collections, yet ultimately rely on forward indexes that materialize sketches as explicit fingerprint vectors. As a result, large-scale similarity search and exhaustive collection-versus-collection comparison still incur quadratic resource usage. In this work, we revisit the architecture of sketch-based indexes and provide a novel framework for scalable similarity search over massive sketch collections. Our first contribution is a formal cost model for sketch comparison, within which we prove that inverted indexes on sketch fingerprints, equipped with suitably compressed posting lists, achieve the same asymptotic space complexity as standard forward indexes, thereby eliminating the perceived memory penalty traditionally associated with inverted indexes. Building on this model, we design algorithms for all-vs-all comparison between two inverted indexes whose running times are proportional to the total number of matching sketch positions, leading to output-sensitive optimality and enabling efficient large-scale similarity comparisons. Our second contribution leverages the prevalence of similarity thresholds in downstream applications such as clustering, redundancy filtering, and database search. We introduce two early-pruning schemes: an exact criterion that safely eliminates pairs guaranteed not to reach a target Jaccard similarity, and a probabilistic strategy that exploits partial match statistics to discard pairs unlikely to exceed this threshold. Together, these schemes address both time and memory bottlenecks while maintaining rigorous guarantees on retained high-similarity pairs and providing explicit control of the false-rejection probability for the probabilistic variant. Finally, we instantiate these ideas in Onika, an open-source Rust implementation based on compressed inverted posting lists available at github.com/Malfoy/Onika. Onika incorporates a similarity-aware document reordering strategy that restructures sketch identifiers to further shrink index size and improve locality, particularly for redundant collections. Experiments on large bacterial genome repositories, synthetic low-redundancy benchmarks, and long-read HiFi sequencing datasets demonstrate that Onika matches or improves upon the sketch sizes of leading tools while accelerating large-scale search and collection-versus-collection comparisons by up to several orders of magnitude in low-redundancy regimes, without compromising sensitivity at practically relevant similarity thresholds.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Phenotypic analysis indicated that PFDA and PFOS significantly delayed development of worms, and reduced the number of fertilized eggs in the uterus. RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed strong impacts of PFDA and PFOS on physiological age. A core set of xenobiotic detoxification genes (e.g., cyp-13A4, cyp-13A6, and cyp-13A7), which were found to be primarily regulated by nuclear hormone receptors (NHR-102, NHR-85, NHR-28), showed consistent up-regulation upon PFAS exposure. Gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) further linked this detoxification gene signature to developmental impairment. Cross-species comparison using public databases identified several evolutionarily conserved detoxification genes that are associated with PFAS-induced developmental toxicity, among which CYP3A4 and its orthologs appear to be emerging biomarkers of PFAS exposure.

We characterized 67 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to 12 Actinobacteriota families from Chesapeake and Delaware Bay water samples across different seasons, salinities, and size fractions. MAGs from four dominant families, Ilumatobacteraceae, Nanopelagicaceae, Microbacteriaceae, and S36-B12, were examined in depth for their abundance, functional potential, estimated growth rates, and gene expression among samples. Actinobacteriota were most abundant in low- to medium-salinity samples during spring and summer. Their abundance patterns were strongly influenced by combinations of salinity, temperature, and phosphate, nitrate and silicate concentrations. Notably, many exhibited high estimated growth rates under low and medium salinities in summer. Members of the four major families showed a range of metabolic capacities from generalist to specialist, and all encoded biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, particularly terpenes and betalactones, that were differentially expressed across conditions. Bay, salinity and size fraction were the primary drivers of gene expression differences. Distinct secondary metabolite genes were expressed between bays, with higher expression generally observed in medium compared to low salinities.

Whereas -synuclein phosphorylation has been much studied, comparatively less work has been devoted to other post-translational modifications such as acetylation, especially given that N-terminally acetylated -synuclein is the most abundant endogenous form of the protein in the brain. In this study, using multiple in vitro and in vivo models, we sought to better understand the role of N-terminal acetylation in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. We found that N-terminal acetylation slowed aggregation of both -synuclein monomers and pre-formed fibrils in vitro. Uptake of acetylated -synuclein pre-formed fibrils into both immortalized cell lines and iPSC-derived dopamine neurons was also slowed compared non-acetylated fibrils. In addition, exposure to acetylated pre-formed fibrils induced less seeding of endogenous -synuclein, as measured by the accumulation of Serine129-phosphorylated -synuclein inclusions in both iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and mouse brain. Finally, mice injected with N-terminally acetylated -synuclein pre-formed fibrils survived significantly longer than mice injected with non-acetylated fibrils. Taken together, our study indicates that N-terminal acetylation reduces -synuclein aggregation, uptake into cells, seeding of endogenous -synuclein, and toxicity in vivo, suggesting that this prevalent post-translational modification represents a potent, physiologically relevant protective mechanism, which has thus far largely not been taken into consideration in most experimental paradigms of Parkinson's disease and synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Proteomic analysis identified alterations in several molecules related to metabolism and showed elevated levels of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) proportionate with an infection-regulated lipid load in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. The role of TGM2 as a reliable predictor of hepatic steatosis was validated using deworming experiments which revealed a decrease in the liver tissue levels of Tgm2 following removal of H. p. bakeri. Further validation showing increase in Tgm2 levels in IL-4c treated mice confirmed its relevance as a general response indicator of type 2 immune response induced by helminth infection. Assessment of circulating TGM2 levels in matched obese patients before and after bariatric surgery revealed no change, indicating that differential expression of TGM2 is a unique functional response to regulation of hepatic steatosis by H. p. bakeri infection. Together, our data show that TGM2 is a unique predictive marker of improvement in hepatic lipid profile and provides additional evidence that parasitic worm infection protects against hepatic steatosis in DIO mice.

Large (100-500 nm) and small (40-200 nm) EVs were isolated from plasma of participants in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 and analyzed by nanoparticle flow cytometry to measure concentration and glycan characteristics.

There are good theoretical reasons to expect stably coexisting communities to deliver higher ecosystem functioning, as niche differences should promote coexistence and complementarity, however, there is still little empirical evidence to demonstrate this relationship. We present a novel experimental approach to tackle this question, in which we first measured interaction coefficients and intrinsic growth rates for 12 grassland species and used population models to estimate coexistence. We then assembled 48 three-species communities, predicted to differ in their degree of coexistence and measured seven above and belowground functions. Here we extend findings demonstrating that biodiversity increases multifunctionality to show that amongst communities with the same initial diversity, multifunctionality is higher when all the species are predicted to coexist. Decomposing coexistence into the influence of niche and fitness differences showed that multifunctionality was high in niche differentiated communities but also in those with a single highly competitive species. We further examined the effect of indirect interactions, which provide an alternative mechanism of coexistence in multispecies communities, and found that they also provided an alternative route to high multifunctionality. Our results point the way to a unification of coexistence and biodiversity theory and to a more mechanistic understanding of the functional effects of biodiversity change.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

This mix and match approach, however, cannot account for those reactions that have not been reported to occur in nature, which heavily limits the possible solution space. Here, we use a bioretrosynthetic approach coupled with expert biochemical knowledge to identify eight novel pathways that leverage enzyme promiscuity and the latent biochemical reaction space. We analyze the thermodynamic, stoichiometric, and kinetic parameters of these pathways and compare them to the ubiquitous Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and previously proposed synthetic CO2 fixation cycles, highlighting advantages and disadvantages. This work highlights the need for enzyme engineering and design in the quest for efficient biological carbon fixation.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the impact of such perturbations on the general stress response in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using scale-down bioreactor experiments, we evaluate the performance of the Segregostat, a real-time control system that leverages automated flow cytometry to induce dynamic nutrient shifts. The Segregostat achieves robust stress response control, even under severe perturbations such as extended residence times in a two compartment reactor. We hypothesize that this robustness arises from the system ability to amplify host compatible fluctuations beyond bioreactor induced perturbations.

These k-mer-based pipelines can employ a sampling step, which in turn allows grouping consecutive k-mers into larger strings to improve data locality. Although other sampling strategies exist, local schemes have become standard: such schemes map each k-mer to the position of one of its characters. A key performance measure of these schemes is their density, defined as the expected fraction of selected positions. The most widely used local scheme is the minimizer scheme: given an integer m [&le;] k, a minimizer scheme associates each k-mer to the starting position of one of its m-mers, called its minimizer. Being a local scheme, the minimizer scheme guarantees covering all k-mers of a sequence, with a maximal gap between selected positions of w = k - m + 1. Recent works have established near-tight lower bounds on achievable density under standard assumptions for local schemes, and state-of-the-art schemes now operate close to these limits, suggesting that further improvements under the classical notion of density will face diminishing returns. Hence, in this work, we aim to revisit the notion of density and broaden its scope. As a first contribution, we draw a link between density and the gap between consecutive selected positions. We propose a probabilistic model allowing us to establish that the density of a local scheme is exactly the inverse of the expected gap between the positions it selects, under the minimal and only assumption that said gaps are somehow equally distributed. We emphasize here that our model makes no assumptions about how positions are selected, unlike the classical models in the literature. Our result introduces a novel method for computing the density of a local scheme, extending beyond classical settings. Based on this analysis, we introduce a novel technique, named multiminizers, by associating each k-mer with a bounded set of candidate minimizers rather than a single one. The candidate furthest away (in a precise sense defined in the article) is selected. Since the decision is made by taking advantage of a context beyond a single k-mer, this technique is not a local scheme - as a result, we propose the concept of semi-local schemes, which provide a broader framework within which our method fits. Using the multiminimizer trick on a local scheme reduces its density at the expense of a controlled increase in computation time. We show that this method, when applied to random (hash-based) minimizers and to open-closed mod-minimizers, achieves asymptotically optimal density representing, to our knowledge, the first construction converging to this limit. Our third contribution is the introduction of the deduplicated density, which measures the fraction of distinct minimizers used to cover all k-mers of a set of sequences. While this problem has gained traction in applications such as assembly, filtering, and pattern matching, standard minimizer schemes are often used as a proxy, blurring the distinction between the two objectives (minimizing the number of selected positions or the number of selected minimizers). Although related to the classical notion of density, deduplicated density differs in both definition and suitable constructions, and must be analyzed in its own right, together with its precise connections to standard density. We show that multiminimizers can also improve this metric, but that globally minimizing deduplicated density in this setting is NP-complete, and we instead propose a local heuristic with strong empirical behavior. Finally, we show that multiminimizers can be computed efficiently, and provide a SIMD-accelerated Rust implementation together with proofs of concept demonstrating reduced memory footprints on core sequence-analysis tasks. We conclude with open theoretical and practical questions that remain to be addressed in the area of density.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

This will only be possible if it becomes feasible to routinely observe proteins on the fast timescales on which they perform their tasks. Recently, laser flash melting and revitrification experiments have improved the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to microseconds, rendering it fast enough to observe the domain motions of proteins that are frequently linked to function. However, observations have been limited to a time window of just a few hundred microseconds. Here, we introduce time-resolved cryo-EM experiments based on jet vitrification that combine microsecond resolution with an observation window of up to seconds. We use a short laser pulse to initiate protein dynamics, and as they unfold, vitrify the sample with a jet of a liquid cryogen to arrest the dynamics at that point in time. We demonstrate that our approach affords near-atomic spatial resolution and a time resolution of 21 s. This allows us to observe the photoinduced dynamics of the light-driven sodium pump ErNaR on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. Our experiments significantly expand the ability of cryo-EM to observe protein dynamics across multiple timescales.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Thick filaments contain distinct regulatory zones defined by the presence of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) and titin super-repeats, but the control of myosin OFF/ON states within these zones has not been directly resolved. Here we do so, by fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM). Using orientation-specific probes on myosin we show that folded-OFF motors are enriched in the MyBP-C-containing C zone in relaxed myofibrils. Under titin-based passive tension or partial calcium activation, active motors are enriched in the D zone at the filament tips, which lacks MyBP-C. Troponin probes further reveal that myosin enhances thin-filament activation in the region of filament overlap and drives activation into adjacent non-overlap regions. These findings uncover zone-specific control of myofilament activation within the sarcomere and establish FPM as a powerful tool for investigating disease-linked myofilament protein variants and therapeutic modulation.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

E.; Hassall, C.; Brown, L.", "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems face intense anthropogenic pressures, with global indicators showing steep biodiversity declines in many regions. Yet in parts of Europe, including the UK, several recent analyses of long-term monitoring datasets have documented widespread improvements in macroinvertebrate communities following major water-quality investments. These gains are often interpreted as being nationally uniform, based on spatially aggregated data or simplified effect sizes, despite substantial site-level heterogeneity in temporal dynamics. Consequently, the prevalence, distribution, and causes of local biodiversity dynamics remain poorly resolved. We address this gap using macroinvertebrate time-series data from 803 river sites in Englands Environment Agency monitoring network. We applied an unsupervised, shape-explicit time-series clustering framework to classify sites into distinct shape-based clusters for three complementary metrics: pollution sensitivity of communities (Whalley, Hawkes, Paisley & Trigg (WHPT) Index), total abundance, and Simpson diversity index. We then characterized taxonomic and environmental differences among clusters using Linear Discriminant Analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Finally, we quantified how temporal trajectories are structured across increasingly aggregated spatial scales (site, water body, catchment, typology, region) using a Bayesian variance-partitioning model, providing the first multi-metric, multi-scale assessment of macroinvertebrate trends in UK rivers. Overall, our analyses reveal substantial heterogeneity in ecological trajectories: although many sites showed improving trends, more than half (~53%) were in decline or lacked clear directional change. Sites with consistent increases or declines were strongly differentiated by longitudinal position, channel morphology, and water chemistry, indicating that network placement and local environmental context mediate river biodiversity changes. Variance partitioning showed that most explainable variation lies at the site and typology levels, demonstrating that broader regional or national summaries can obscure a mosaic of non-linear, site-level trajectories and persistent local declines. Collectively, these findings affirm that freshwater biodiversity change in UK rivers cannot be summarized by a national or even regional narratives of recovery, but represents a mosaic of asynchronous, site-specific trajectories. These results illustrate the need for a renewed investment in dense, long-term river monitoring networks capable of resolving biodiversity change across hierarchical spatial scales.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Similarities and differences in the way actin from different species self-assembles into filaments inform our understanding of its evolution. However, this basic knowledge is largely incomplete. Here, we address this issue by systematically characterizing assembly kinetics for actin from two yeast species that are five hundred million years apart in evolution, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and compare them to the well-studied actin from rabbit skeletal muscle from which they diverged a billion years ago. By monitoring individual actin filaments under controlled conditions, we accurately quantified their barbed end elongation from ATP-actin monomers, their disassembly in the ADP-Pi and ADP states, as well as the release of inorganic phosphate, which marks their aging. We find that, in the ATP state, both yeast actins behave strikingly like mammalian actin at filament barbed ends. In contrast, yeast actin filaments in both the ADP-Pi and the ADP states depolymerize several-fold faster than their mammalian counterparts, and they release inorganic phosphate over 20-fold faster. We show that the absence of methylation on histidine 73 largely accounts for this faster aging of yeast actin filaments. We also reveal differences between the actins of the two yeasts. In particular, ADP-actin filaments depolymerize faster and are mechanically more flexible in Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our findings suggest that actins expressed across species possess more diverse and specialized biochemical characteristics than previously recognized.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Using neutral DOPC and cationic DOTAP bilayers, we show that lipid-RNA interactions depend strongly on RNA secondary structure, with single-stranded regions exhibiting higher interfacial affinity than double-stranded segments. We validate the CG lipid simulations, showing that while they reproduce experimental X-ray scattering data only qualitatively, the agreement improves markedly after backmapping to atomistic resolution followed by energy minimization and short all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We further simulated distinct tRNA conformations and analyzed the influence of RNA secondary structure, concentration, solvent contrast, and lipid deuteration on NR and XRR signals identifying the conditions under which such experiments probe RNA adsorption and discriminate between different RNA conformations. Together, these results demonstrate that CG simulations combined with reflectivity data provide a powerful approach to probe RNA adsorption and structure at lipid/water interfaces and support the design and interpretation of scattering experiments.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins. Furthermore, OGT deletion accelerated inhibitory postsynaptic current decay kinetics and induced subunit-specific shifts in GABAA receptor surface expression: {beta}3 subunits decreased, whereas {gamma}2 subunit total and surface levels increased.

It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}

The present study aimed to examine how morphological complexity and lexical frequency jointly influence neural representations during visual word recognition. We addressed this question using rapid event-related fMRI with both univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-five native Korean speakers performed lexical decisions on simple and inflected nouns that varied parametrically in surface frequency (token frequency of the full word form) and base frequency (cumulative stem frequency). Korean's transparent agglutinative morphology enabled a principled dissociation of these frequency measures. MVPA failed to decode morphological condition from activation patterns in any region, suggesting that simple and inflected forms are not represented as discrete neural categories. Crucially, RSA demonstrated robust encoding of surface frequency-but not base frequency-in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), with significantly stronger correlations for inflected than simple nouns. Univariate analyses confirmed this pattern: surface frequency interacted with morphological condition in inferior parietal lobule (IPL), such that higher surface frequency increased activation selectively for inflected forms, while base frequency showed no reliable effects. These results challenge obligatory decomposition and support a distributional framework in which lexical statistics guide the processing of morphologically complex words. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological complexity modulates neural sensitivity to whole-word rather than stem-level statistics, underscoring how structural and statistical factors interact to support morphological processing.", "date": "2025-11-21", "journal": ""}
