However, understanding the molecular mechanisms that produce these structures is a challenging problem due to the gap in size scales between molecular interactions and cellular structures. The giant ciliate Stentor coeruleus is a unicellular model organism whose large size, reproducible structure, and ability to heal wounds and regenerate have historically allowed the formation of structure in a single cell to be addressed using methods of experimental embryology. Such studies have shown that specific cellular structures, such as the oral apparatus, always form in particular regions of the cell, which raises the question: what is the source of positional information within this organism? By analogy with embryonic development, in which regionalized mRNA is often used to mark position, we asked whether specific regionalized mRNAs might mark position along the anterior-posterior axis of Stentor. By physically bisecting cells and conducting bulk RNA sequencing, we were able to identify sets of messages enriched in either the anterior or posterior half and show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of posterior-enriched transcripts corresponding to MYB genes results in a cells inability to regenerate the posterior portion of the cell body. We then conducted half-cell RNA-sequencing in paired anteriors and posteriors of cells in which the microtubule cytoskeleton was disrupted by RNAi of beta-tubulin or dynein intermediate chains. We found that many messages either lost their regionalized distribution or switched to an opposite distribution, such that anterior-enriched messages in control became posterior-enriched in the RNAi cells, or vice versa. This study indicates that mRNA can be regionalized within a single giant cell and that microtubules may play a role, possibly by serving as tracks for the movement of the messages.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

We found that active alleles of monoallelic genes are preferentially localized at Sun1-enriched domains at the nuclear periphery. These peripherally localized euchromatic DNA loci harboring monoalleleic genes are enriched with adenine-thymidine-rich tandem repeats, which are bound by Hnrnpd, the molecular wrench, to localize these loci in a Hi-C-defined A compartment within the B compartment. Our results demonstrate the biological significance of T1A3 tandem repeat sequences in genome organization and how the regulation of gene expression, at the level of individual alleles, relates to their spatial arrangement.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Previous studies examined species-specific protein-coding genes and related regulatory sequences, revealing that birth, loss, and changes in these genes and sequences can drive speciation and evolution. However, investigations of species-specific lncRNA genes and related regulatory sequences, which regulate substantial genes, remain limited. We identified human-specific (HS) lncRNAs from GENCODE-annotated human lncRNAs, predicted their DNA binding domains (DBDs) and binding sites (DBSs), analyzed DBS sequences in modern humans (CEU, CHB, and YRI), archaic humans (Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals), and chimpanzees, and investigated how HS lncRNAs and their DBSs have influenced gene expression in archaic and modern humans. Our results suggest that these lncRNAs and DBSs have substantially reshaped gene expression. This reshaping has evolved continuously from archaic to modern humans, enabling humans to adapt to new environments and lifestyles, promoting brain evolution, and resulting in cross-population differences. The parallel analysis of gene expression in GTEx tissues by HS TFs and their DBSs indicates that HS lncRNAs have reshaped gene expression in the brain more significantly than HS TFs.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Alternative nitrogenases using iron (Fe) or vanadium (V) cofactors evolved only after the GOE. This history is puzzling because environmental Fe availability decreased after the GOE, while Mo availability increased, due to the contrasting environmental redox behaviors of these elements. Why, then, did the alternatives emerge only after the GOE? Using a model constrained by known microbial Mo quotas, we demonstrate that a strong selection pressure for the use of metals in nitrogenase other than Mo is a plausible consequence of competition between nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and nitrate-reducing microbes, which require Mo for nitrate reduction and assimilation. This competition would have intensified after the GOE due to increasing availability of nitrate, explaining the evolutionary timing of nitrogenase isozymes. Ecological resource competition therefore emerges as a third driver of metallome evolution in deep-time, alongside the relative environmental availabilities and adaptive advantages of particular metals.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

However, awake infant fMRI poses significant methodological challenges that have hampered wider adoption. The present work takes stock after the collection of a substantial amount of awake infant fMRI data across multiple studies from two labs at different institutions. These data were leveraged to glean insights on participant recruitment, experimental design, and data acquisition that could be useful to consider for future studies. Across 766 fMRI sessions with awake infants aged 1-36 months, the authors explored the factors that influenced how much usable data were obtained per session. The age of an infant predicted whether they would successfully enter the scanner (younger more likely) and, if they did enter, the number of minutes of functional data collected (linear, younger more) and retained after preprocessing with lab-specific protocols or harmonized motion exclusion thresholds (quadratic, 12-24 months more than younger and older). The amount of functional data retained was also influenced by assigned sex (female more), experimental paradigm (movies better than blocks and events), and stimulus content (social better than abstract). There were many differences in the research approach between labs making head-to-head comparisons difficult, but Lab A was more likely to get infants into the scanner, Lab B collected more data from infants who entered, and the amount of data retained after preprocessing did not differ statistically between labs (9 minutes). In addition, the authors assessed the value of attempting to collect multiple experiments per session, an approach that yielded more than one usable experiment averaging across all sessions.

Suppression of axis proteins is associated with cis-encoded signals, including reduced coding density and the subtelomeric Y elements, which are present at many chromosome ends, but also requires chromatin modifiers, including the histone methyltransferase Dot1 and the Sir silencing complex. We show that Dot1 suppresses Sir complex activity at least in part independently of its canonical target, H3K79, to downmodulate axis protein deposition near chromosome ends. In parallel, the Sir complex, but not Dot1, suppresses the induction of DSBs by limiting the openness of promoters, the preferred sites of meiotic DSB formation. The separable downmodulation of axis protein deposition and DSB induction likely contributes to the robust reduction of meiotic recombination effectors near chromosome ends.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

These factors are critical in disorders where neural activity is exaggerated and slowed. In healthy adults, networks compensate for mismatched processing speeds to maintain proportionate activity, but this process is poorly understood in schizophrenia. We developed a timescale-aligned, time-resolved framework that separates temporal distortions from genuine amplitude differences, enabling measurement of amplitude balance between networks across timescales. This approach was applied to large-scale fMRI datasets, including the Human Connectome Project and a multi-site schizophrenia cohort. Patients with schizophrenia showed greater amplitude imbalance, especially during fast fluctuations, along with more frequent re-entry into unbalanced states and slower recovery to stable coordination. We further identified a flexible intermediate state that patients occupied more often, and that predicted better working-memory performance. Across cohorts, amplitude imbalance was associated with greater symptom severity and poorer reasoning ability. These findings provide a new mechanistic view of dyscoordination in schizophrenia grounded in timescale-normalized amplitude dynamics, highlight aberrant recovery of amplitude balance as a core feature of the illness, and suggest that timescale-aligned amplitude imbalance may serve as a promising target for biomarker development.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes are treated as configurations in R^3 x T, and each residue or nucleotide p is mapped to an environment vector E_p that encodes a coarse-grained, DFT-inspired density surrogate together with metal- and phosphate-like fields, solvent exposure, and local geometry. A block-streamed, GPU-optional Python pipeline maps arbitrary PDB/mmCIF structures to fixed-dimensional environment vectors without any stochastic training and scales to supramolecular assemblies: for example, the 6Q97 tmRNA--SmpB--ribosome rescue complex (11,618 residues) can be processed in a single pass on commodity cloud hardware, demonstrating practical feasibility at ribosome scale. To quantify the functional signal exposed by this representation, we use untuned random forests as probes under site-grouped cross-validation that prevents symmetry-related copies of the same site from leaking across folds. Across GroEL/GroES, p53--DNA, Rubisco, and SecA, the environment vectors alone yield ROC--AUC values in the 0.8--0.9 range for catalytic, metal-binding, tight interface, and hinge cores, while more diffuse regulatory labels are substantially harder to separate. For 6Q97, a Tier 1 / Tier 2 labeling scheme over tmRNA and SmpB pockets, decoding-center rRNA, the 23S peptidyl transferase center, and helicase-like uS3/uS4/uS5 pockets, together with a curated hard-negative panel of 323 buried hydrophobic, electrostatic, and stacking decoys, yields global AUCs of about 0.94 (Tier 1+2 vs all) and about 0.99 (Tier 1+2 vs hard negatives).

Research into L-CMD mechanisms and therapies is hindered by lack of humanised, tissue-specific models that accurately recapitulate disease phenotypes. We previously reported that LMNA-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived skeletal muscle cells have nuclear shape abnormalities and Lamin A/C protein mislocalisation.

Results showed no overt defects in developmental myogenesis, but recapitulation of pathological nuclear shape abnormalities in 2D and 3D cultures, nuclear envelope protein mislocalisation and transcriptomic alterations across multiple pathogenic LMNA variants. We then utilised this platform to assess LMNA gene editing strategies. CRISPR-based exon removal generated stable RNA and protein Lamin A/C species, without significant normalisation of nuclear morphological phenotypes or transcriptomic profile.

A key mechanism modulating signal transduction relies on the formation of multimolecular complexes optimized for specificity, modularity and signal amplification. The scavenger receptor CD36, which binds diverse ligands in different cellular contexts, illustrates this principle. To uncover the nature of CD36 multimolecular complexes, we employed a proximity biotinylation labeling approach on human endothelial cells, where CD36 binds to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) to initiate a signaling cascade promoting programmed cell death. Using biotin capture and mass spectrometry protein identification, we uncovered a list of proteins in the vicinity of CD36. This list of candidates was refined by proximity ligation assays. The relationship between key CD36 interacting molecules, in particular active integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) and CD9, was further decoded by conditional colocalization analysis, providing support for their association within a tri-molecular complex. The implication of selected candidates in the signaling function of CD36 was further evaluated using shRNA knockdown, revealing that active ITGB1 is essential for Fyn activation downstream of CD36, with the tetraspanin playing a connecting role between CD36 and active ITGB1.

Simulations restrained to the respective cryo-EM structures produced only modest ion flux for all models, inconsistent with experiment, whereas fully unrestrained simulations revealed marked differences in their ability to relax into physiologically conductive ensembles. Two structures, 7KOX and ligand-bound 8V82, consistently stabilized into conductive states whose permeation properties matched our measured inward single channel conductance.

However, clinical manufacturing of engineered T cells is resource-intensive and often yields highly differentiated, exhausted effector T cells. To circumvent this, we have developed an antigen-scaffold (Ag-scaffold) technology to preferentially expand genetically engineered T cells. Such Ag-scaffolds present cognate antigen together with stimulatory factors such as cytokines. By providing a specific and receptor-engaging stimulation to CAR/TCR T cells, the expanded product is highly enriched for engineered T cells with a favourable proliferative and efficacious phenotype. We expanded TCR T cells with Ag-scaffolds presenting peptide MHC (pMHC), and anti-CD19 CAR T cells with Ag-scaffolds presenting CD19 antigen. By applying cognate pMHC Ag-scaffolds, we achieved >80% antigen-specific T cells (83.62%+/-9.2%) after 14 days of culture with a distinct cytotoxic, proliferative phenotypical profile. Ag-scaffold expansion enhanced initial TCR and CAR cytotoxicity; sustained control was observed after repeated rechallenges of CAR T cells. In vivo, Ag-scaffold-expanded CRISPR/Cas9-engineered anti-CD19 CAR T also showed complete tumour eradication in a B-cell lymphoma xenograft model with a low dose of CAR T cells, which was not achieved using IL2/7/15 expansion.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Recent technological advances enable detailed time-resolved measurements of such responses. However, a unifying model for the quantitative characterisation of dynamic response curves is lacking, thus limiting biological insights and comparisons. We developed an unbiased mathematical modelling approach that allows for the quantitative characterisation of biological response curves without a priori knowledge of underlying biochemical mechanisms. Using stress-induced plant volatile emissions, we show that the model performs well across a wide range of datasets, including incomplete induction curves, curves with low sampling resolution and complex multi-modal responses that result from overlapping stimuli. Using the model, we uncover a range of previously unrecognised patterns in volatile induction curves, including i) a strong light-independent impact of the time of day of wounding on the onset, duration and shape of the volatile induction responses, ii) an accentuation of volatile-specific induction curve shapes by herbivory-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and iii) independent regulation of the strength and duration of volatile induction across genotypes. We conclude that our model allows for the quantitative analysis of dynamic response curves and can identify new biological response patterns.

The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

H3K79me promotes chromatin activation and recruits TET family DNA demethylases to key regulatory loci. Treg-restricted deletion of Dot1L disrupts locus-specific DNA demethylation, diminishes expression of core Treg genes, and precipitates a fatal, early-onset autoimmune syndrome. Conversely, pharmacologic enhancement of TET activity during differentiation rescues DNA demethylation, restores Treg-gene expression, and reinstates suppressive function even in the presence of Dot1L inhibition. Together, these findings identify a critical epigenetic axis--Dot1L-mediated H3K79 methylation driving TET-dependent DNA demethylation--that safeguards Treg cellular identity, function, and immune homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

While the role of these genes in the early specification of organ identity is well established, their late function throughout floral organ development and in specific cell types is much less characterized. In particular, since plant organs are structured in clonally-independent cell layers, whether and how homeotic identity interacts with cell layer identity is unknown. We have previously identified cell layer-specific mutants for the petal identity gene PhDEF, resulting in drastically different petal phenotypes whether PhDEF is expressed in the petal epidermis or in the mesophyll. In this study, using a combination of single-cell RNA-Seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation on phdef cell layer-specific mutants, we find that PhDEF regulates a different set of target genes in the petal epidermis and mesophyll, and that most of its regulatory action takes place in the epidermis, although PhDEF is expressed evenly in the two petal cell layers. We uncover a high diversity of binding profiles in PhDEF target genes, with a complex combination of layer-specific or -aspecific binding sites driving their expression. Strikingly, binding profiles are not correlated with expression profiles in either cell layer.

Here, inspired by the \"use it or lose it\" principle, we present a novel game-theoretic model of self-organizing neural units and show that the brain is, in fact, sub-optimal in both regards: First, we demonstrate that regional competition for connectivity under propagative communication dynamics naturally gives rise to network configurations similar to those derived from the human cortex while being even more efficient and economical. Next, we use a reservoir computing framework to compare the information processing capacity of these networks against those of the brain. Although comparable in performance, the more optimal trade-off comes with a tax on computational reliability. Through synthetic lesions, we show that these networks are fragile because, to optimize for communication, they funnel information through a spatially clustered \"oligarchy\" comprising a tight set of transmodal hubs. In contrast, the human brain uses a more distributed \"rich club\" backbone that better resists breakdown following targeted attacks, even when it means higher wiring costs and less efficient communication. This reveals a previously overlooked principle: cortical networks trade both cost and efficiency for reliable computation.

We combined behavior, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling to test how latent cause inference guides neural replay, enabling fast generalization. Over two days, fifty-two participants performed a sequential decision task in which multiple visual sequences either shared a latent reward source or were associated with an independent reward. On day 1, participants learned this correlation structure and exploited it to achieve 1-shot value generalization after reversals. Multivariate decoding and sequentiality analyses revealed backward replay in visual cortex during rest intervals that was selective to unobserved reward-linked sequences, consistent with non-local value updating. In parallel, the representation of the abstract reward structure in medial temporal lobe (MTL) increased from early to late blocks on day 1. On day 2, we covertly changed which sequences shared rewards. Participants flexibly reorganized generalization, and replay patterns adapted, parallel to a reorganization of MTL representations. A LCI model captured the initial learning trajectory and adaptation upon changes in latent structure. The model captured individual differences in structure learning, and its value updating of unobserved states predicted trial-wise fluctuations in replay strength. These results provide a mechanistic account in which latent structure discovery and replay interact to propagate value and enable rapid, flexible generalization.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

CACNA1C is a risk gene for psychiatric conditions involving disruption of neuronal connectivity such as schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorders. While genomic studies are consistently reinforcing the notion of CACNA1C as an important locus related to these diseases, the role of CaV1.2 channels in determining neuronal architecture is incompletely understood. Several studies pinpoint the L-type current (ICaL) as regulator of dendritic arborization development. ICaL lays upstream of competing cellular mechanisms leading to both inhibition and promotion of dendritic growth. How signal selectivity is achieved remains an open question. Here, we report that ICaL -dependent dendritic development of murine cultured hippocampal neurons relies on CaV1.2 and is determined by an equilibrium between the level of CaV1.2 protein expression and ICaL activity. Indeed, increasing ICaL enhances dendritic complexity only when CaV1.2 expression level is reduced. In contrast, when channel levels are at baseline, the CaV1.2-dependent growing signal is overcome by the elevation of the dendritic growth inhibiting CaMKII signaling beyond basal conditions. These findings suggest that CaV1.2 expression level acts as a molecular switch between dendritic growing and inhibiting signals. Consequently, altered CaV1.2 expression during early development may alter neuronal structure, potentially impairing neural network formation and increasing susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Genetic ablation of {beta}-1,3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1) or its chaperone COSMC in human chondrocytes reduced cell surface HSPGs and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) binding, leading to impaired MAPK/ERK signaling, which was recapitulated in hypomorphic COSMC-CDG patient cells.

The quasi-static, constraint-based model reverses folding to generate an unfolded, fetal-like configuration and then refolds to map the resulting volumetric deformation onto fiber organization. Validation with longitudinal fetal MRI shows that simulated folds follow biologically plausible developmental paths. Applied to adult data, deformation of simple radial fibers reproduces diffusion-derived orientation patterns across the white matter and achieves high regional correspondence. The deformation model also generates characteristic short-range U-fibers as well as long-range association and commissural pathways, all without any diffusion input or machine learning.

Such complex-yet-structured dynamical strategies may reflect computational needs of neural systems, shaped by optimal feedback and autonomous mechanisms, in addition to biological constraints. Are there overarching computational principles that govern complex dynamical strategies exhibited by the neural population response? Here, we explore the hypothesis that computational strategies underlying neural population response represent optimal feedback solutions to the control of musculoskeletal dynamics through space for a goal. To validate this hypothesis, we develop a procedure called neural optimization using dynamical systems (NODS) learning to modify synaptic strengths within a recurrent network for locally-optimal feedback control of anatomically accurate musculoskeletal models during complex sensorimotor tasks. NODS learning works even when the objective function to be minimized is highly non-linear or the muscle model is very complex. The dynamical strategies underlying the neural network response constructed using NODS learning recapitulate key features of recorded population response. Importantly, optimal feedback solutions using NODS learning suggest that feedback mechanisms are essential for neural populations to flexibly transit between complex-yet-structured strategies. We further show that this framework provides theoretical foundations for why the solutions obtained using deep reinforcement learning algorithms extensively used to model sensorimotor tasks may explain the dynamical strategies underlying recorded population response. In summary, we develop novel methods and approaches suggesting that neural dynamics may be more strongly modulated by optimal feedback mechanisms, in addition to autonomous mechanisms, than previously appreciated.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

A key regulatory mechanism is autoinhibition of GABA release during repetitive activity via presynaptic Gi/o-coupled GABAB receptors, supporting synaptic tuning and memory formation, and limiting neurotransmitter spillover. Exogenous GABAB receptor agonists reduce presynaptic Ca2+ entry by inhibiting calcium channels. However, using transgenic mice expressing a mutant SNAP25 with diminished ability to bind G{beta}{gamma} (SNAP25{delta}3), we show that suppression by GABAB autoreceptors requires intact G{beta}{gamma}-SNARE interactions. Imaging of presynaptic Ca2+ transients in GABAergic axons showed no GABA-mediated autoreceptor suppression of Ca2+ entry during stimulus trains. In contrast, application of the exogenous GABAB receptor agonist baclofen profoundly inhibited Ca2+ entry, which could be partially reversed by exogenously elevating cAMP, indicating a complementary role of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Baclofen reduced spontaneous IPSC frequency and amplitude and both effects were diminished in SNAP25{delta}3 mice, consistent with inhibition at Ca2+ channels and SNARE complexes. Physiological GABA-mediated and exogenous GABAB receptor activation thus produce distinct outcomes on GABAergic neurotransmission, indicating that synthetic drug application to neurons does not faithfully recapitulate endogenous signaling pathways.

Stereoscopic disparity and border ownership have long been treated as distinct processes, yet both arise with similar timing in area V2 and exhibit strikingly parallel properties. Here we propose a unified mechanism that integrates both within a single hierarchical framework. Building upon the layered disparity representation introduced in our prior work, we show that border ownership, serving as the key component of figure ground organization, emerges intrinsically from thresholded relative disparity differencing, providing a unified basis for contour-based segmentation and depth perception. Using biologically constrained network models (TcNet), we demonstrate that this mechanism generalizes across binocular and illusory depth domains, bridging physical and nonepipolar disparity cues. At the systems level, we identify complementary dual feedback pathways from area V4: V4->V1, which refines and re-weights layered disparity maps, and V4->V2, which integrates global contextual priors such as shape continuity and category consistency. Together, these recurrent loops balance fine-scale depth precision with large-scale figure ground coherence, offering a unified explanation for perceptual alternations such as the Rubin Face Vase and Kanizsa illusions.

Using fiber photometry with a genetically encoded ACh sensor, we found that ACh release robustly increased during threat prediction but decreased in anticipation of rewarding outcomes, revealing a bidirectional and valence-specific signature. Optogenetically stimulating ACh release at cue onset accelerated threat learning, impaired extinction, and shifted behavioral responding toward persistent threat expectancy. Concurrent single-cell calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation revealed that elevated ACh release dynamically reorganized DLS ensemble activity, increasing both excited and inhibited neurons and producing large-scale state-space divergence during threat cues. During extinction, optogenetically sustained ACh release preserved the organization of threat-predictive DLS ensemble activity despite the absence of shock.

Alternative splicing therefore allows AnkG to modulate neuron type-specific excitability in addition to its ubiquitous pan-neuronal role in organizing the AIS.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Prior work has shown that depression is associated with hippocampal atrophy and that antidepressants can increase neurotrophin levels to increase hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal pyramidal cell (PC) spine density and arbor. These effects likely contribute to amelioration of symptoms. A less well-explored possibility is that antidepressants concomitantly disinhibit hippocampal PC activity, which could also facilitate increased PC arbor, spinogenesis and/or activity. In accordance, previous studies have shown antidepressants can attenuate stress-induced upregulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are predominantly localized to parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons and increase PV expression and neuronal activity. Though specific antidepressants have been explored for effects on regional PNN expression, the question of whether hippocampal PNN/ECM remodeling is a shared feature of varied antidepressant drugs and more importantly, of whether it is associated with significant hippocampal PV inhibition, has not been well-addressed. Herein we examine three monoamine reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, venlafaxine and viloxazine, in animal models for effects on PNN remodeling and PV expression, a proxy for PV activity. We observe shared effects of these therapeutics including the ability to increase PNN degrading effectors that can downregulate PV activity. Consistent with this, we observe shared effects of these drugs in terms of their ability to significantly reduce PV levels. These findings highlight the possibility that ECM remodeling and associated hippocampal PC disinhibition represent a shared feature of varied antidepressant medications.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

M.; Tsukiyama, T.; Malik, H. S.", "abstract": "The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is an ancient, conserved chromatin-interacting complex that controls gene expression, facilitating differentiation and cellular identity during development. Its regulation is critical in most eukaryotes. EZHIP was recently characterized as a PRC2 inhibitor and oncohistone mimic in mammals. Although Ezhip expression is typically restricted to the germline, its aberrant expression in pediatric brain tumors inhibits PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation and drives disease progression. To gain a deeper understanding of its normal functions, we systematically examined Ezhip evolution across 70 mammals using comparative genomics, synteny analysis, and motif discovery. Bolstering previous work, we find that Ezhip originated and has been strictly retained on the X chromosome in placental mammals. In addition to the highly conserved H3K27M-like histone mimic motif, our motif analysis reveals seven previously unidentified EZHIP motifs, including a putative nuclear localization signal, and tandem repeats that are largely well-conserved in placental mammals, except in some lineages. We hypothesize that these motifs are also critical to EZHIPs functions, including in PRC2 interaction and inhibition. We show that Ezhip has evolved under strong diversifying selection in primates and underwent dynamic expansions and losses across species. Some paralogs, such as Ezhip2 in primates, also evolved under positive selection. Based on its evolutionary attributes and germ-cell expression, we propose that Ezhip arose and evolved rapidly due to inter-parental conflict over fetal development in utero in placental mammals. Our work provides a foundation for further investigations into EZHIPs essential, potentially multifaceted roles in mammalian reproduction and disease.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated an overall suppression in dexamethasone-induced transcription.

Heterozygous mice exhibited partial glucocorticoid resistance, dysregulated HPA axis activity and impaired dexamethasone suppression, closely recapitulating the patient phenotype. Homozygous Nr3c1T444I/T444I embryos were recovered at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) but did not survive to term, indicating mid-gestational lethality. Transcriptomic profiling of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed dosage-dependent effects with heterozygotes showing an intermediate response to dexamethasone compared to wild-type, while homozygotes showed a markedly blunted response.

Computational predictions, using a machine learning model trained on the human RCC TCGA dataset, and cell-based validations, confirmed BCL-XL dependence in all RCC subtypes. Remarkably, cell state changes, anoikis programs, inflammatory state, and metabolic perturbations (e.g., fumarate production in FH-deficient RCCs) independently conferred increased BCL-XL dependence. Correlation studies revealed that increased AMPK isoform 2 (PRKAA2) expression is a kidney-specific biomarker of BCL-XL dependence.

U6atac knockdown triggers R-loop mediated DNA damage while impairing repair by downregulating key DNA repair factors, disabling both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. This dual effect sensitizes prostate and breast tumors to PARP inhibitors, cisplatin, and radiation, independent of BRCA status.

We developed a microenvironment-inferred genotyping approach, enabling molecular classification by measuring the \"oligodendrocyte desert\" effect when direct genetic testing is impossible. Using single-cell RNA-seq data from 102 GBM patients (1.47M cells), we identified oligodendrocyte exclusion patterns associated with EGFR amplification.

EGFR-amplified tumors created detectable oligodendrocyte deserts (60-70% depletion, p<0.001). Our exclusionary classifier achieved AUC 0.845 in discovery cohorts and 0.756 average across validation datasets (n=540 patients). With a positive predictive value of 94%, this tool identifies high-confidence candidates for EGFR targeted therapies who would otherwise be excluded from treatment.

Anti-Death receptor-4 and -5 agonistic mAbs are TRAIL mimetics proven to have higher specificity towards DR4 and DR5 receptor thus avoiding decoy receptors.

S.", "abstract": "In 1946 Gilmore observed that the Hell Creek Formation portion of the late Maastrichtian TT-zone contained more tyrannosaur taxa than just titanic Tyrannosaurus rex, based on a small, ontogenetically mature skull with a higher tooth count than the tyrant lizard. Over four decades later the skull was assigned to its own genus, Nanotyrannus lancensis. Also tagged shortly after was the genus Stygivenator molnari. At the turn of the century it was contended that all TT-zone tyrannosaurs are adult or juvenile T. rex, a view that became accepted by many. Because of the unusual morphological alterations that this hypothesis requires, it was consequently proposed that during ontogeny T. rex experienced a peculiar fish like metamorphosis. Detailing normal amniote growth more broadly than prior work on the subject, this analysis rejects radical ontogenetic speculations, in favor of Tyrannosaurus having shared much the same average amniote/diapsid conventional growth observed in its fellow tyrannosaurids and especially tyrannosaurins. Actual juvenile Tyrannosaurus specimens show the same tooth count and other osteological features observed in the adults, negating the need for the metamorphosis not observed in any amniotes. Most lesser sized TT-zone tyrannosaurs possess a number of features that indicate they are not only not Tyrannosaurus, but represent an array of basal eutyrannosaur taxa that are neither Nanotyrannus nor Stygivenator, with high tooth counts, and at least in some examples elongated hands, prominent dentary grooves and other features. Two new taxa are correspondingly named, Gilmorelarsontyrannus lethaeus and Elegansvenator zannoae. These are postulated to represent at least in part the migration of basal eutyrannosaurs from former Appalachia into the Laramidia region via the new Laralachia land bridge.

However, current pharmacological tools cannot distinguish among receptors expressed by different neuronal populations, and the functional roles of beta2* nAChRs in specific neuronal types remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the expression and behavioral significance of beta2* nAChRs in distinct neuronal populations of the mouse PFC. We first used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the expression of the beta2 nicotinic subunit in major neuronal types and cortical layers. We then used CRISPR to knock down (KD) the beta2 subunit in two PFC populations and, for comparison, in a striatal population. KD of the beta2 subunit in deep-layer PFC neurons defined by neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression specifically altered working memory and exploratory behavior and affected social and anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, KD in PFC interneurons expressing serotonin receptor 5HT3a led to a hypersocial phenotype. KD of beta2* nAChRs in a rare NPY-expressing striatal population resulted in subtler and largely opposing changes in similar behavioral domains. These findings show that beta2* nAChRs expressed by distinct neuronal populations contribute differentially, and sometimes oppositely, to behavioral regulation. Our data suggest that cell-type- and region-specific expression of beta2* nAChRs is required for the modulation and fine-tuning of behavioral domains relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

We applied a modified Bayesian observer model, which partitions time reproduction into three stages: sensory measurement, time estimation, and motor response. We found that both MS and control groups showed a systematic bias in reproducing time, overestimating short intervals and underestimating long intervals. This bias was significantly larger in patients with MS compared with controls, reflecting an over-reliance on prior expectations relative to sensory-motor information. Computational modeling indicated that this increased bias in the MS group was driven by greater measurement noise during the sensory stage. Moreover, central tendency bias increases with age in healthy participants as reliance on prior expectations becomes stronger than sensory-motor evidence. Interestingly, we found that this age-related effect on bias was absent in patients with MS.

Epigenetic enzymes (writers and erasers) and effectors (readers) are largely influenced by the availability of metabolites grenerated through one-carbon metabolism (OCM), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and acetyl-CoA synthesis (ACS). In this study we examined the expression of epigenetic and metabolic genes to investigate their interplay in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Method: We examined 257 epigenetic genes (EpiGs), 96 metabolic genes (MGs), and 189 rate-limiting enzymes (RLEs) in transcriptomic data from iCCA, eCCA, CCA organoids, and normal bile ducts, alongside prognostic signatures. CRISPR-Cas9 DepMap data evaluated the impact of EpiGs and MGs on cell viability. HuCCT-1 iCCA cells were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 24 h) to assess EpiG responses. Transcriptomic deconvolution characterized EpiGs, MGs, and RLEs expression across four tumor microenvironment (TME) subtypes. Two mouse CCA models (Akt/TAZ, Akt/NICD) underwent RNA-seq, complemented by multi-omic profiling (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic) in Akt/TAZ livers. Results: Several EpiGs were upregulated in iCCA and eCCA, including writers (DNMT1, EZH2, SUZ12), readers (CBX3, PHF20L1, SMARCA4), and erasers (HDAC1, HDAC3, KDM5C). MGs in OCM, TCA, and ACS pathways were dysregulated (up: GART, IDH2, TYMS; down: ALDH1L1, MAT1A, SHMT1). Integrated analyses identified 27 EpiGs and 8 MGs whose overexpression predicted poor survival. Subsets of EpiGs, MGs, and RLEs were linked to proliferative, high-recurrence iCCA subclasses. CRISPR screens highlighted 50 EpiGs and 23 MGs essential for CCA viability. Tumor microenvironment (TME) analyses revealed distinct immune-stromal subclasses with coherent epigenetic-metabolic signatures. In CCA cells, hypoxia induced epigenetic programs that mirrored those in CCA patients. Transcriptomic analyses in human and multi-omic analyses (transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic studies) in mouse CCA livers highlighted rewiring of nucleotide, one-carbon, lipid, and mitochondrial pathways, with evidence of metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk. Conclusion: EpiGs and MGs are markedly altered in both human and experimental CCA, with several changes particularly enriched in aggressive molecular subclasses associated with poor prognosis. We observed substantial rewiring of epigenetic cofactor-related MG expression in CCAs.

Tau oligomers (TauO) are key mediators of tau toxicity, but whether their biochemical properties differ across AD subtypes has not been examined in human brain. We isolated endogenous TauO from frontal cortex of well-characterized control, slowly progressive AD (spAD), and rpAD cases using T22 immunoprecipitation and performed ultrastructural, biochemical, and proteomic characterization. rpAD TauO displayed compact, densely aggregated morphology and exhibited the highest levels of disease-associated phosphorylation (pS396, pS422). Label-free proteomics revealed that control and spAD shared a robust TauO interactome enriched for translation, proteostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and vesicle trafficking. Strikingly, these modules were absent in rpAD, which instead showed selective enrichment for aldehyde detoxification, amino-acid and carbon metabolism, and actin-regulatory pathways. rpAD TauO demonstrated increased association with SERPINA1, ALDH9A1, MAPRE3, DPYSL2/3, and NFASC, and reduced association with MRPL17 and C9. Functionally, rpAD TauO induced the strongest toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these findings indicate that rpAD likely harbors a biochemically distinct TauO species, defining a molecular signature that may underpin its fulminant clinical progression and support the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Light is one of the strongest cues driving circadian photoentrainment of the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via projections from the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Circadian research has historically centered males, and recent work has revealed multiple sex-differences in circadian circuitry and function, indicating that our understanding of this system in females is severely limited. Moreover, while recent studies have investigated the role of hormonal modulation of light responses, the additional possibility that ipRGC inputs may also be sex-dependent has not been directly tested. Here, we report that not only do ipRGCs in female mice show higher levels of melanopsin expression, but that melanopsin also plays a larger role in shaping circadian photic responses in females compared to males. Collectively, these results define a new retinal source for sex-dependent differences in circadian behavior.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the role of the neuropeptide precursor VGF (non-acronymic) in the nucleus accumbens, and its contribution to synaptic and opioid-evoked plasticity and behavior. We first characterized VGF expression within the nucleus accumbens, then examined its impact on excitatory synaptic transmission, and finally disrupted its expression to assess its influence on opioid sensitivity. We found that VGF is expressed by interneurons and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, and the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 reduced excitatory synaptic transmission onto nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons. Conditional genetic knockout of VGF from the nucleus accumbens did not affect acute opioid sensitivity, but amplified opioid-evoked psychomotor sensitization following chronic fentanyl exposure. These results establish VGF as a modulator of nucleus accumbens synaptic and drug-evoked plasticity. Uncovering the impact of VGF on nucleus accumbens plasticity following exogenous opioid exposure may lead to novel therapeutic targets to treat opioid use disorders.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Neurons regulate their average firing rate by adjusting their synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability. Both forms of homeostatic regulation utilize changes in intracellular calcium as a feedback signal to adjust ion channel densities. But two properties cannot be independently regulated using a single feedback signal, suggesting that either synaptic scaling and excitability regulation are linked by a shared feedback signal or that local calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Past studies on homeostatic regulation have focused on global calcium changes but spatially restricted calcium changes also occur. We hypothesized that local perturbation-induced calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Simulations in a simple two-compartment model confirmed that a perturbation applied to one or the other compartment induces local compensation only if the feedback is compartment-specific. Simulations in a biophysically detailed multicompartment model with realistic calcium handling confirmed that dendritic and somatic calcium signals remain relatively segregated and can, therefore, mediate homoeostatic regulation independently in subcellular compartments. Strong perturbations (as often tested experimentally) triggered widespread compensation because local compensation was overwhelmed. Non-local compensation also occurred when the spatial segregation of calcium signaling was weakened. Our results demonstrate the plausibility of spatially segregated calcium changes encoding separate feedback signals so that homeostatic changes can be locally controlled. Our results also highlight that whereas local homeostatic regulation nullifies local perturbations through compensation within the affected compartment, non-local regulation causes widespread compensatory changes that, while restoring the neuron's overall input-output relationship, distorts the input-output relationship of individual compartments, with potentially important consequences.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Within the central nervous system (CNS), APOE is produced by a variety of cell types, with differential roles in AD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that APOE4 produced by neurons plays a central role in promoting the development of major AD pathologies, including p-tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role as an upstream initiating factor that affects other cell types and downstream AD-related pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting APOE-I3, a neuron-specific splicing variant of APOE mRNA, effectively reduce APOE expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Treating PS19 tauopathy mice expressing APOE4 with this APOE-I3-targeting ASO reduces neuronal APOE4, rescues neurodegeneration, and diminishes neuroinflammation. Strikingly, the extent of neuronal APOE4 reduction predicts the efficacy of rescuing neurodegeneration. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated that APOE-I3-targeting ASO treatment decreases disease associated neuronal and glial subtypes and increases a disease-protective microglial subtype.

Owing to its therapeutic potential, extensive efforts have focused on developing selective 5-HT7R ligands. In the last decades, biased signalling has emerged as a key concept in GPCR pharmacology as biased ligands can stabilize specific active states of the receptor and trigger selective activation of downstream signaling pathways. In this context, we recently identified two biased 5-HT7R ligands, Serodolin and MOA51, from different chemical series. Here, we aimed to compare the pharmacological and safety profiles of these ligands and to assess their effect on pain-related behaviors and spinal neuroinflammation. In inflammatory pain models (acid acetic writhing, formalin and CFA tests), both serodolin and MOA51 effectively attenuated pain responses to a similar extend. Furthermore, in neuropathic pain models, spinal nerve injury (SNI) and Cuff model, both ligands reversed mechanical allodynia. Interestingly, unlike pregabalin, a clinically used reference drug, neither Serodolin nor MOA51 induced apparent tolerance after 10 consecutive days of administration. Treatment with these 5-HT7R ligands also reduced spinal microglial and attenuated neuronal hyperactivity in the spinal cord. Altogether these findings highlight the potential of 5-HT7R-biased ligands as promising analgesic candidates capable of modulating neuroinflammatory processes and mitigating both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Harnessing such information to induce regeneration in a non-regenerative setting has been a long-sought goal. The amputated salamander limb efficiently regenerates all of its missing bones, but paradoxically, a large bone gap without amputation - commonly called a Critical Size Defect (CSD) - is not regenerated, similarly to other vertebrates [Chen et al., 2015]. This non-regenerating injury provides a human-relevant setting to understand how to rescue lack-of-regeneration. Satoh and colleagues demonstrated in axolotl that transplantation of blastema cells from an amputated limb into a CSD yields cartilage bridging of the CSD [Satoh et al., 2010]. This work provided a roadmap for rescuing the CSD. Here we asked, what are the crucial molecular differences in cells populating a regenerating blastema versus the CSD and can they be used to elicit CSD bridging? Previous genetic fate mapping and single cell transcriptomics showed that limb regeneration occurs via migration and dedifferentiation of fibroblastic, soft connective tissue (CT) cells that form a multipotent, skeletal stem cell [Currie et al, 2016, Gerber et al, 2018]. Here using single cell transcriptomics and genetic fate mapping we found that the CSD is populated by CT cells that undergo a divergent molecular transition compared to the blastema. Using gene regulatory network (GRN) modeling, and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of mRNA we could express a single molecular factor, Wnt3a, to induce cartilage bridging of the CSD.

Key questions remain, however, about how RTK fusions transmit oncogenic signals, including how these largely cytoplasmic proteins activate downstream pathways that originate at the plasma membrane. Fusions are multimeric and can form mesoscale condensates in cancer cells, and condensation has been implicated as an essential mechanism to enable signal transmission from the cytoplasm. However, whether condensates play a causal role, or whether smaller \"diffuse\" assemblies are sufficient to transduce signals, has been challenging to establish. Here we apply advanced microscopy, single-cell analysis, and synthetic fusions to determine the principles by which multimerization and condensation drive signaling from cytoplasmic RTK fusions. For EML4-ALK, a prominent fusion that forms condensates, we found poor correlation between condensation and signaling. By contrast, EML4-ALK activity was abundant in the diffuse phase, and the kinetics of diffuse-phase activity aligned more closely with downstream Erk signaling than did kinetics of signaling within condensates. Synthetic RTK fusions showed that cytoplasmic ALK or RET fusion dimers, and even constitutively active monomers, were sufficient to induce strong Ras-Erk signaling despite the absence of condensates, and diffuse fusions were sufficient to transform cells in vitro and in subcutaneous tumor models. A panel of various other cancer-driving RTK fusions showed that low-order multimerization was universal across fusions, whereas mesoscale condensation was rare and did not correlate with signaling. Our results suggest that low-order fusion multimerization is sufficient to drive its phosphorylation, which is necessary and sufficient to trigger downstream oncogenic signaling.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Here we asked whether brief tFUS to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) modulates its FC with other brain regions. In a sham-controlled, within-subject study of healthy adults (N=16), we measured resting-state blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, during, and after five minutes of tFUS (i.e., five 20-second sonications followed by 40 second pauses). Subject-level sgACC-whole-brain FC was analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model (fixed: time, condition, time x condition; random: subject). tFUS increased sgACC-whole brain connectivity after sonication relative to sham. A smaller, non-significant trend was observed during sonication. Baseline-controlled analyses were employed to rule out the possibility that the observed increase in FC was due to a \"regression to the mean\" effect. Interestingly, network-level analysis revealed a clear disassociation in the evolution of resting-state FC across the 15 minute recordings: during sham sessions, the sgACC's connectivity with the default mode network (DMN) increased, while FC with other networks was largely unchanged. On the other hand, active tFUS led to a notable increase in FC with non-DMN networks (especially the cognitive control network), while connectivity with the DMN was stable. These results provide whole-brain evidence that tFUS reconfigures network dynamics in the human brain, motivating clinical applications to disorders characterized by dysregulated brain activity.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

These include mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, ataxia and blindness and several other symptoms. SWS and PNPLA6 are widely expressed in neurons and in several glial cell types in Drosophila and mice and both cell types require SWS/PNPLA6 function autonomously. SWS and PNPLA6 are structurally and functionally conserved because expression of human or mouse PNPLA6 can replace SWS in flies. These orthologues share several domains, including the highly conserved phospholipase domain that mediates its function in deacetylating phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine. In addition, they share three cyclic nucleotide binding sites and although about 10% of the known disease-causing mutations occur in these sites, their function is still unknown. We therefore generated mutations in these sites in SWS to address what consequences this has for the function of the protein. Mutating only one site (SWSG558E) results in a partially functional protein that rescues the sws knockdown and that decreases PC when overexpressed. However, mutating all three sites (SWS{Delta}CNB) renders SWS non-functional and results in an increase of PC when overexpressed, suggesting that cyclic nucleotide binding can regulate the phospholipase function.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we analyze the whole-brain Drosophila adult connectome using a nested stochastic block model to uncover its hierarchical community structure. We find that most of the roughly 1500 fine-scale communities--the smallest, and best resolved level of the hierarchy--are spatially compact, generally assortative, and aligned with known biological features such as neurotransmitter identity and cell type. Nonetheless, we find evidence of nonassortative communities, spatially co-localized within the optic lobe and vision-processing pathways.

However, the functionally-defined T cell subsets affected by these changes remain poorly characterized. Here, we sought to reveal aberrations in the composition, phenotype and function of canonical T cell subsets in the blood of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) patients, compared to healthy subjects and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHODS We developed a novel multidimensional flow-cytometry panel to simultaneously detect lineage-defining transcription factors, co-inhibitory receptors and other functional markers to characterize T cell subsets without in vitro restimulation. We compared T cell landscapes in SSc and SLE patients, and healthy subjects, using Optimized t-SNE and PhenoGraph algorithms. Cytokine production in patient samples was determined using intracellular cytokine staining. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to assess the role of IFN-{gamma} in fibroblasts. RESULTS The data show altered distribution and aberrant functional states of transcription factor-defined T cell subsets in patients with autoimmunity, with shared and unique features between diseases and their subtypes. Strikingly, SSc and SLE patients showed a severe deficiency in subsets of CD8+ and CD4-CD8- T cells that expressed T-bet, which is critical for IFN-{gamma}-dependent type 1 immunity, and exhibited features of exhaustion. Moreover, TIGIT+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, known to suppress Th1 responses, were selectively increased in SSc. Functionally, T cells from SSc patients produced less IFN-{gamma}, a cytokine that suppresses pro-fibrotic gene expression in fibroblasts.

We show that co-expression patterns of chemokine receptors (CRs) CXCR3, CCR5, and CXCR6 on CD8+ T cells provide a functional \"code\" defining subsets with divergent roles in on-target immunity versus off-target inflammation. In mouse and human melanoma, a triple-positive (CXCR3+CCR5+CXCR6+) T-cell subset is essential for tumor control, and its genetic signature correlates with positive clinical response, while a distinct CCR5+CXCR6+ subset drives liver immune-related adverse events (IRAEs).

Using a cross-fostering design with mixed-genotype colonies of wild-type and transgenically labelled individuals, we show that ants become non-aggressive specifically toward their foster genotype.

However, even sporadic re-exposure to individuals from the foster colony is sufficient to maintain tolerance for over a month, while the same paradigm fails to establish tolerance in the first place.

We show that this technique reliably differentiates amorphous aggregates from liquid-like condensates by their distinct refractive indices and morphologies. Coupled with size-exclusion chromatography, our analysis reveals that BSA phase separation strictly depends on higher-order oligomeric assemblies.

Methodology: Each Q3 parameter was converted to a radius of a polygon using a mathematical equation that converted each reference Q3 parameter to a value of 5. That equation was applied to the corresponding test product Q3 parameter and the areas of the treatment polygons determined. The ratio of the product area/outer area [Matrix Comparability Index (MCI)] was calculated using an outer polygon with each radius = 10. When generated across multiple lots for each treatment, the MCI values were statistically compared. Both actual (from our previously published investigation) and hypothetical MCI values were used to characterize the performance of the MoCMC across a range of situations. Results: MCI values successfully captured product Q3 differences, with the influence of any Q3 parameter decreasing as the number of radii increases. The ability to identify statistically significant product differences decreased as variability of either test or reference MCI values increased. By combining statistical analysis with a comparison of the spread of test and reference MCI values, the MoCMC provided a sensitive tool for assessing product comparability and identified product differences previously missed by comparing in vitro dissolution profiles alone Conclusions: While the impetus for this research was to identify a tool for supporting the evaluation of product bioequivalence containing locally acting drugs, its strengths support its potential use across a wider scope of situations.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Whether these canonical age-related changes to cellular physiology are present across diverse species that have variable rates of demographic aging remains less studied. Here, we tested whether several ubiquitous cellular hallmarks of aging - mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species generation, and inducible DNA damage - change with age and in a sex-dependent manner in a species with indeterminate growth and reproduction (painted turtles, Chrysemys picta). A further feature of their biology that recommends them for an ecological model of vertebrate aging is their female-biased longevity, despite an absence of genotypic sex determination. Thus lifespan and aging may be reliable features of sex-specific life-histories. We measured aspects of mitochondrial health (cellular basal, maximal, and spare oxygen consumption rates), cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, and aspects of DNA damage and repair from exposure to UVB. We used these measures across several physiological axes as proxies for age-related physiological dysfunction. We further assessed our measures across several populations of painted turtles. We found that sex explained the largest proportion of variation, with males differing from females in mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species production, and inducible DNA damage. In several cases, age significantly interacted with sex, but the effect size was small relative to sex alone.

Two major concerns are (1) the rising severity and frequency of marine heat waves and (2) disease outbreaks (e.g., OsHV-1). To better understand how multiple stressors influence oyster resilience and whether stress priming can improve survival, we tested the effects of parental immune challenge on offspring performance. We exposed broodstock to a Poly(I:C) immune challenge, reared their offspring to the seed stage, and assessed survival, growth, and metabolic responses under thermal stress in the lab. Offspring of immune-challenged parents showed higher growth rates during development. Under elevated temperatures, these offspring had higher survival than controls at 40{degrees}C, but lower survival at 42{degrees}C, suggesting thermal limits to priming benefits. Metabolic assays further revealed that at moderately elevated temperature (36{degrees}C), primed offspring had higher metabolic activity, whereas at higher temperature (40{degrees}C), they exhibited lower metabolic activity than controls. This pattern indicates that parental immune challenge may influence offspring metabolic flexibility, potentially enhancing thermal tolerance through an increased capacity for metabolic depression at extreme temperatures. Together, our results highlight cross-generational links between immune priming and thermal tolerance.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

For effective planning and management of such diseases, accurate and reliable quantification, i.e., prevalence, incidence, and severity, becomes crucial. Despite this, the quantification of these diseases in Tanzania remains limited. Here, digital image analysis (ImageJ and Plantix) was used in the identification and quantification of CBB and BLB in low and highland agroecologies represented by Kilosa and Mbarali districts, respectively, by surveying 24 paddy and common bean fields across 10 villages. The study revealed that CBB and BLB were highly prevalent (100%) across study sites, with varying incidence and severity. Incidence and severity of both CBB and BLB were significantly higher in Kilosa than in Mbarali, with a large proportion (>19%) of these variations accounted for by district-level differences. Interestingly, significant variations in incidence and severity were observed even at the village level. In Kilosa, CBB severity differed significantly among villages (p = 0.018), while in Mbarali, BLB incidence and severity varied significantly (p < 0.001; p = 0.0436). Village-level differences accounted for over 41% of the total variation. Conclusively, the study indicates that CBB and BLB are highly prevalent across both Kilosa and Mbarali districts and their respective villages, with incidence and severity varying due to both district- and village-level differences. To manage these diseases effectively, site-specific management and geographically targeted interventions are required that account for local variability while prioritizing areas of higher infection risk, such as Kilosa. This approach will not only improve plant disease management programs but also ensure efficient resource use, thereby promoting sustainable disease control under changing climatic conditions.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Hair-plate sensilla at the base of the antenna flagellum provide proprioceptive inputs to detect their position. In hemimetabolous insects, such as crickets, the first instar immediately after hatching also possesses antennae, but the developmental dynamics and spatial organization of antennal hair plates remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis of the antennal hair plates in crickets across developmental stages, from the first instar to adulthood. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we demonstrated that hair plate sensilla were present from the first instars and maintained a highly stereotyped spatial arrangement throughout development. Three-dimensional quantification revealed that new sensilla added during molting were formed at specific sites within the hair plate clusters that had existed at the previous stage, maintaining the spatial pattern despite the substantial growth of the antenna. Multidimensional analyses indicated that the spatial arrangement of sensilla was consistent across individuals, suggesting that organization was genetically determined. Retrograde labeling of sensory afferents showed that sensory neurons in the hair plates converged their axons, extended axon collaterals into the ipsilateral region of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, and ultimately projected to the subesophageal ganglion. There was no apparent difference in their projection site among hair plates, suggesting no evidence of topographic organization. Our findings highlight the conserved spatial organization of hair-plate sensilla in crickets, suggesting a robust proprioceptive system that provides reliable feedback of antennal position throughout development.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of epileptogenesis in relation to AD pathology using hAPP-J20 transgenic mice aged 9 to 27 weeks, encompassing the AD conversion phase. Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) was employed to monitor hippocampal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), including ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-600 Hz), in conjunction with histological, behavioral, and neurophysiological assessments to characterize underlying neural circuit alterations. We identified three distinct epileptogenic stages in transgenic mice: (1) 9-15 weeks: emerging memory deficits, increased excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuron ratio, mossy fiber sprouting, and peak seizure-related mortality, alongside the initial emergence of pathological HFOs; (2) 15-21 weeks: a pronounced escalation of pathological HFO activity and persistent network hyperexcitability preceding detectable amyloid plaque deposition, indicating rapid epileptogenic progression; (3) 21-27 weeks: stabilization of HFO activity despite continued progression of amyloid accumulation, suggesting a plateau in epileptogenic remodeling amid advancing Alzheimer's pathology. These findings indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability precedes amyloid plaque deposition and likely contributes to disease progression, highlighting a critical early window for therapeutic intervention in AD. Moreover, pathological HFOs hold promise as electrophysiological biomarkers of early circuit dysfunction and represent a promising target for modifying the course of AD.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

We recorded 64-channel EEG from 42 children (aged 9-15 years) during a translation-recognition task before and after a regular instructional vocabulary unit and sub-grouped children by baseline proficiency. We quantified the canonical N400 (300-500 ms, centroparietal region of interest; ROI) alongside electrical-neuroimaging indices of ERP strength and topography (Global Field Power, Global Map Dissimilarity, ERP template-map preponderance), using adult template maps from a prior study as a normative reference. Behaviorally, children showed large gains in vocabulary accuracy and higher discrimination sensitivity (d') in post-assessment. The classical N400 incongruity effect did not increase from pre- to post-learning. By contrast, global and topographic measures were learning-sensitive: Global Field Power increased across sessions and interacted with proficiency, and Global Map Dissimilarity showed main effects of session and proficiency as well as their interaction, indicating proficiency-dependent topographic reorganization. Adult normative template maps backfitted well; within the N400 window, high-proficiency children more consistently occupied an adult-like configuration; later (~650-800 ms), patterns also differentiated by proficiency and congruency. Relative to adults, children exhibited more diffuse topographies and stronger dependence on individual proficiency. In classroom settings, children's L2 vocabulary learning is therefore more sensitively indexed by scalp topography and global field dynamics than by a single N400 amplitude, positioning electrical neuroimaging as a proficiency-dependent, classroom-relevant marker of L2 acquisition.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

These are managed by life-long immunosuppression with considerable burden for the patient and society. Adoptive therapy with regulatory T-cells (Treg) is a promising approach to restore sustainable immune balance and avoid long-term adverse effects of immunosuppression. While Treg effectively inhibit activation of unwanted immune responses, they are less effective in controlling pre-existing/activated memory effector T-cells (Teff). Thus, co-administration of Treg with immunosuppressants is required to achieve a sustainable organ acceptance. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are powerful in controlling de novo generated and preformed Teff. However, CNI also dampen Treg immunoregulatory function. Thus, we hypothesize improved results of adoptive Treg therapy in immunosuppressed patients applying tacrolimus-resistant Treg. Methods: While retaining CNI modulation of Teff with tacrolimus, we knocked-out FKBP12 in Treg (FKBP12KO-Treg) by gene-editing using ribonucleoprotein-based CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate tacrolimus-resistant Treg and characterised them using flow cytometry, functional assays and in-depth phenotyping. Results: This detailed in vitro analysis showed FKBP12KO-Treg were comparable to non-gene edited Treg and impervious to tacrolimus while maintaining immunoregulatory function and sensitivity to alternative CNIs raising no safety concerns. Furthermore, we aligned our methodology to achieve GMP compliance laying the basis for a manufacturing license in preparation of a clinical trial. Conclusion: Based on the presented preclinical dataset implying safety and efficacy of FKBP12KO-Treg, we are now seeking to undertake a proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the co-administration of FKBP12KO-Treg and tacrolimus to enhance the management of living donor kidney transplant recipients.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

This agent not only potently reverses HIV-1 latency in CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) through coordinated IL-15 receptor signaling and sCD4-mediated HIV-1 envelope (Env) engagement, but also enhances antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response in PBMCs derived from PLWH.

This gap has limited translational efforts to monitor or therapeutically target specific Tfh states for clinical benefit. Here, we delineate human CD4 T cell heterogeneity in tonsils and peripheral blood using trimodal single-cell sequencing and spectral flow cytometry to define epigenomic, transcriptional, and proteomic features of distinct Tfh states. Tfh with a GC-like phenotype exhibited markedly increased chromatin accessibility and both mRNA and protein expression of G protein subunit gamma 4 (GNG4).

While the Hippo pathway effector Yap is known to regulate kidney development, its specific role within the distal nephron segments remains unknown. Methods: To investigate Yap function in the distal nephron segments, we generated a Cre-inducible Yap gain-of-function allele (Col1a1-Yap5SA) and a distal nephron-specific Slc12a3Cre to drive an active form of Yap in the distal nephron segments. We performed phenotypic assessments along with molecular and transcriptomic analyses to examine changes in epithelial organization and nephron segmentation. Results: Lineage tracing showed that Slc12a3Cre targets both DCT and CNT, suggesting that CNT cells arise from Slc12a3+ DCT cells. Constitutive Yap activation in these segments caused increased proliferation and ectopic cell migration into adjacent nephron segments. This was accompanied by disrupted expression of DCT/CNT marker genes, loss of apicobasal polarity, and compromised junctional architecture, indicating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Notably, mutant kidneys also exhibited downregulation of proximal tubule markers, indicating a non-cell-autonomous effect. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that sustained Yap activation in the distal nephron segments disrupts epithelial identity and structure while also exerting non-cell-autonomous effects on nephron patterning, particularly in the proximal tubule. These results underscore the importance of tightly regulated Hippo-Yap signaling in maintaining epithelial integrity and proper nephron segmentation.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

The role of FMC, which is the mass of moisture on a dry matter basis, in such processes is increasingly important due to changes in length and severity of climate extremes, like drought. Here we studied the sensitivity of forest and woodland FMC to climatic water balance, i.e. Standardised Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), across five landscapes in temperate and sub-tropical south-eastern Australia. To do this we used copula-probabilistic modelling, including consideration of drought (i.e. SPEI) length. We used an FMC dataset over eight years of Sentinel-2 satellite reflectance (2015-2023), based on the inversion of a radiative transfer model at 20m resolution. We found the spatial variation of FMC within landscapes to be large and that the spatial variation in response to drought was very large, particularly within the more arid landscapes. The areas of lesser response to extreme drought are revealed to be drought resistant forests and woodlands that are potential climate refugia for animals, and natural breaks in the contiguity of fire fuels.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Herein, we show that RPE65 from mouse, an animal that does not concentrate MZ in the eye, catalyzes L to MZ isomerization similarly as found for RPE65 from chicken and human, when expressed in cultured cells. Co-expression with xanthophyll-binding proteins had no impact on MZ yield. L and MZ both fit deep into the tunnel accessing the non-heme iron center, with strain evident for the 3'R,6'R {epsilon} ring of L. Interestingly, a negatively charged Glu148, found along substrate tunnel, highly conserved among carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, and which is critical for eye health, could be replaced by a neutral, isosteric residue (Gln) without impacting MZ yield.

VML directly reduces the number of myofibers and causes axonal degeneration of nerves, resulting in reduced muscle function and impaired neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Biosponge (BSG) scaffolds, composed of gelatin, collagen, and laminin-111, have been shown to improve muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and myofiber number following VML. However, improvements in NMJ quantity were not observed. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a growth factor that enhances motor unit survival and neurite outgrowth. In this work, BSG scaffolds were electrostatically coupled with GDNF via gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) to support myofiber regeneration and preserve NMJs post-VML in a rodent model. In vitro determination of release kinetics revealed an initial burst release of surface bound GDNF with almost an equivalent amount of electrostatically bound GDNF retained within the BSG post 1 week of incubation at 37 deg C in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To create the VML injury in male Lewis rats (10-12 weeks old), ~20% of the muscle mass was removed from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of both hindlimbs. Relative to BSG+GNP alone, treatment with BSG+GNP+GDNF showed a significant increase (~25%) in peak isometric torque at 6 weeks post-injury. Qualitative and quantitative histological analysis of NMJs revealed an enhanced overlap between pre- and post-synaptic structures in the BSG+GNP+GDNF group. Additionally, the incorporation of GDNF slowed BSG remodeling and degradation. Overall, these results suggest that the BSG-mediated delivery of GDNF is an effective strategy for mitigating NMJ loss and enhancing muscle recovery following VML.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Made up of only two ingredient--soy beans and water--it has nourished people for centuries; yet, its rheology remains incompletely understood. Here, we use tofu as a minimal model system to study how composition governs the mechanics and physics of hydrated soft solids. We perform over a hundred controlled compression tests on silken, firm, and extrafirm tofu, and observe a strong nonlinearity, a pronounced viscoelasticy, and a more than ten-fold increase in stress with only six percent decrease in water content. We demonstrate that automated model discovery can identify inelastic constitutive laws that accurately capture these unique characteristics across multiple loading magnitudes and rates. The discovered models autonomously separate elastic and inelastic mechanisms and reveal that tofu elasticity depends primarily on the second isochoric invariant, while tofu inelasticity depends on a combination of the second and third deviatoric invariants. This functional form is universal across all three tofu types, but scales in magnitude with water content. Our new water-content-based feature network reveals that this correlation in not linear, as assumed by traditional bi-phasic theories, but rather highly non-linear and sensitive to the individual model terms. These results position tofu as a quantitative benchmark for nonlinear poroviscoelastic solids and demonstrate how physics-informed machine learning can uncover the constitutive structure of hydrated soft materials.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

We tagged and fate-tracked individual lesions for progression and cessation rates, reanalyzed in situ photographs of previously monitored corals to determine prevalence and seasonality, and assessed the efficacy of amoxicillin treatments. Samples collected from lesions as well as unaffected and healthy controls were used to examine microbiomes, assess nine coral pathological parameters via histology, and measure 19 symbiont-specific physiological metrics using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Across all analyses, we concluded that the observed disease is unlikely to be SCTLD. Many, but not all, metrics had similarities to previous descriptions of white plague, and so we additionally conducted preliminary histology on presumed white plague samples of O. franksi for comparison. However, the dearth of quantifiable histology and TEM studies on white plague did not allow us to conclusively confirm or refute comparisons to white plague. Using the recommended coral disease nomenclature, we define this specific outbreak as \"Orbicella acute tissue loss disease\" (OATLD).

To overcome these challenges, we developed DISCO-seq, a tissue-clearing chemistry that enables superior RNA accessibility compared to fresh or fixed tissues. DISCO-seq integrates whole-organ or organism 3D imaging with both untargeted and targeted transcriptomics, yielding high-quality RNA from cleared tissues comparable to standard samples. We demonstrate its versatility by investigating tumor heterogeneity in a syngeneic glioblastoma mouse model, using 3D imaging to identify spatially distinct microenvironments and characterize their unique transcriptomic signatures. Moreover, DISCO-seq enabled unbiased, whole-body mapping of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein deposition in mice, followed by transcriptomic profiling of spatially defined niches.

Notably, endoplasmic reticulum stress markedly exacerbated SBMA pathology. Cross-species integrative analyses of patient-derived neurons and spinal cords of transgenic mouse models revealed high expression of multiple disease-associated neuropeptides, including urotensin II (UTS2), in patient spinal MNs that was correlated with disease onset and progression in iPSC-derived MNs.

Unlike other DNA features, evolution has not favored specific agents to stabilize G-quadruplex structures; their formation depends strictly on inherent sequence properties. Vertebrate promoters are notable for their consistently high GC-content and pronounced G/C strand asymmetry. The evolutionary acquisition of CGGBP1 in vertebrates has functionally constrained methylation-driven cytosine-to-thymine transition mutations at GC-rich transcription factor binding sites within promoters, thereby preserving GC-content in these regulatory elements across amniote genomes. CGGBP1 target sequences are associated with GC-rich DNA and display G/C asymmetry, while also modulating G-quadruplex formation. This underscores the importance of investigating G4-forming potential retention across vertebrates through CGGBP1's role in protecting GC-content. In this study, we reveal the extensive potential for G-quadruplex formation in the promoters and genomes of over 100 vertebrate species. The evolutionary conservation of these GC-rich regions arises from selective mechanisms that protect both the G-rich strand, capable of forming the G4 structures, and the unused C-rich strand by suppressing C-to-T transitions. We demonstrate that G4-forming regions under nuclear constraints are governed by this restrictive process, mediated by CGGBP1. Furthermore, sequences most influenced by CGGBP1 levels also conform to this protective evolutionary strategy. Our data suggest that CGGBP1 acts not only to prevent excessive secondary structure formation but also to sustain genome-wide GC-richness by regulating methylation-associated C-to-T transitions in these sequences. Collectively, these findings underscore the evolutionary emergence of CGGBP1 as a guardian of genomic GC-richness.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce the mechanoMR microparticle (M3, M-cube) sensor, a hybrid soft-matter/nanoparticle probe that integrates directly into tissue mechanical networks while transducing local stress into quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) readouts with single-particle resolution. We demonstrate the utility of this platform across diverse model systems, including tumor spheroids, Xenopus embryos, and mouse xenografts, where the M3 sensor enables noninvasive, spatiotemporally resolved mapping of tissue stress dynamics during cancer development. Using this approach, we reveal that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is accompanied by distinctive stress-remodeling patterns observable in vivo. Strikingly, we find that abrupt stress increases, rather than cumulative or peak stress magnitude, are the key determinants of EMT induction in cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment. Transcriptomic profiling under controlled stress-loading dynamics shows that sustained yet gradual stress escalation activates cytoprotective antioxidation pathways (e.g., FOXO/AMPK) that reinforce epithelial stability, whereas acute stress surges overwhelm these defense mechanisms, predisposing cells toward mesenchymal reprogramming. These findings establish the M3 sensor as a broadly applicable technology for linking dynamic mechanical cues to cell-state transitions in development, homeostasis, and disease.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

N-fold cross-validation is also used to mitigate this risk, and it is often combined with averaging across trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the impact of different regularization and cross-validation parameters on decoding performance remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variations in the support vector machine (SVM) regularization parameter (C) and the number of crossfolds (and the number of trials per average) on the performance of SVM-based decoding analyses. To achieve this, we examined the decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks from seven commonly used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity). Additionally, we evaluated the decoding performance in more challenging multiclass tasks, including decoding face identity, facial expression, stimulus location, and stimulus orientation. The results revealed that both decoding accuracy and effect size were highest when the regularization strength was equal to or greater than 1. Furthermore, using between 3 and 5 folds with at least 10 trials per average yielded optimal decoding performance in most cases. Researchers applying SVM-based decoding to datasets similar to those examined here-in terms of population, recording systems, class numbers, and paradigms-might benefit from using the parameters that we found to be optimal here.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

We profiled microglia, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and B cells and integrated transcriptomics, cell-cell communication, multiplex imaging, and comparative analysis with human microglia. We found striking depletion of Ccr7+ naive T cells and expansion of Gzmk+ cytotoxic Cd8+ effector memory T cells in the aging brain. At the same time, microglia shifted toward a pro-inflammatory state with enhanced activity of major histocompatibility class complex I (MHC-I) to T cell receptor and co-stimulation from CD86 to CD28. These shifts suggest enhanced neuroinflammatory polarization within the aged brain and in VaD. These signals were strongest from activated microglia to Gzmk+ Cd8+ TEM cells, indicating that age-related microglial polarization may sustain cytotoxic T cell activation in the aged brain.

Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rodent hippocampal CA1 slices under synaptic blockade, we show that following a brief current pulse, many neurons exhibit exponentially decaying firing rates with a broad distribution of time constants extending to tens of seconds.

While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Lipidomics revealed enrichment of saturated fatty acids and ceramides, forming a pro-inflammatory lipid signature and corresponding with enhanced cellular uptake of BL-EVs.

Conventional tabular foundation models are typically trained on synthetic datasets that assume generic statistical properties, and as a result, they fail to capture the distinctive characteristics of cfRNA. These limitations become even more pronounced in settings where labeled data are scarce. We introduce cfRNA-ICL, a cfRNA-specific in-context learning model trained entirely on tasks generated from a biologically grounded structural causal model (SCM). The SCM produces realistic cfRNA-like scenarios by incorporating empirical measurements of gene-level dropout, overdispersion, tissue-mixture-driven latent factors, compositional variability, and sequencing noise. This synthetic task universe enables cfRNA-ICL to acquire inductive biases that closely reflect the geometry of real cfRNA data. Across multiple cancer classification benchmarks, cfRNA-ICL demonstrates consistently higher performance than tabular ICL models trained on generic synthetic data. The gains are most substantial in few-shot settings, where the model benefits from its exposure to cfRNA-specific statistical regimes during meta-training. Representation-level analyses further show that cfRNA-ICL organizes samples into biologically coherent manifolds, preserving cancer-type identity without the use of supervised constraints, indicating strong alignment between the synthetic prior and real cfRNA structure. Taken together, these results show that domain-aware generative priors can meaningfully enhance in-context learning for biological tabular data. cfRNA-ICL provides a generalizable framework for cfRNA modeling and establishes a practical path toward foundation-scale models intrinsically adapted to the statistical landscape of plasma cfRNA.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

This study analyzed the microbiomes of two sympatric holothurians (sea cucumbers), Leptosynapta tenuis, and Sclerodactyla briareus, found in coastal, temperate waters of the Northeast Atlantic. First, we found unexpectedly high levels (approaching 107 cells/ml) of prokaryotic-sized cells in the coelomic fluid of the sympatric sea star Asterias forbesi. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed significant differences in alpha and beta diversity of sea cucumber microbiomes.

Host and body sites explained roughly equal amounts of microbial community variation (22% and 27%, respectively). We identified particular taxa associated with differences in community composition, including enrichment of anaerobic taxa (e.g., Desulftobacterota) in gut samples and Proteobacteria (including Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales) in epidermis samples. We also uncovered higher levels of Synechococcales cyanobacteria in CF relative to the gut, epidermis, and background seawater samples.

These docking proteins recruit and activate downstream signaling molecules and enzymes following ligand stimulation. The docking protein FRS2 has been established as a major signaling hub activated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), neurotrophic factors, and other extracellular cues. Here, we show that palmitoylation of FRS2 at two sites is essential for stabilizing its myristoylation-dependent association with the plasma membrane. FGF1-induced MAPK activation and other cellular responses are partially restored in cells expressing FRS2 mutants deficient in either one of the two palmitoylation sites. However full restoration of signal strength including MAPK response and other FGF1-induced cellular activities requires palmitoylation at both FRS2 sites. In addition to enhancing signaling robustness, anchoring of FRS2 to the plasma membrane creates a structural platform for assembling multi-protein complexes essential for cytoskeletal reorganization associated with membrane ruffling, macropinocytosis, and other FGF1-induced processes. Finally, we demonstrate that while PC12 cells lacking FRS2 or deficient in FRS2 palmitoylation can proliferate, FGF1-induced neuronal differentiation strictly depends on the palmitoylation of the docking protein.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Experimental results on these designs were then used to identify failure modes of design, which were subsequently used as a guiding principle to retrain the energy function. Specifically, we examined a diverse set of de novo protein designs experimentally tested for their ability to stably fold, identifying unstable designs that were predicted to be stable by the Rosetta energy function. Using deep mutational scanning, we identified single amino-acid mutations that rescued the stability of these designs, providing insight into common failure modes of the energy function. We identified one key failure mode, involving steric clashing in protein cores. We identified similar overpacking when using Rosetta to refine high-resolution protein crystal structures, quantified the degree of overpacking, and refit a small set of energy-function parameters to better recapitulate native-like packing. Following fitting, we largely eliminated the failure mode in the refinement task, while retaining performance on other benchmarks, resulting in an updated version of the Rosetta energy function.

Encapsulating AAVs within naturally secreted extracellular vesicles (EV-AAV) can shield them from neutralising antibodies and increase transduction efficiency; however, wild-type AAV capsids are incorporated into EVs inefficiently, with the percentage of total AAV genomes in the EV-AAV fraction ranging from 0.5% to 12%, depending on AAV serotype. Here, we establish a high-throughput screening platform that links AAV capsid genotype to EV encapsulation phenotype to improve encapsulation efficiency. We combined rational design with directed evolution to engineer AAV9 variants that preferentially sort into EVs. A library of 392,550 AAV9 capsid mutants was generated by inserting Late (L) domains, established EV-sorting motifs, and fully random amino acid inserts in a surface-exposed region of the AAV9 capsid protein. Screening data were analysed using a statistical model-assisted protein selection (SMAPS) workflow, developed as a novel quantitative modelling and selection strategy for protein engineering challenges of this kind. SMAPS functions as a digital twin of the protein variants in our high-throughput screen, allowing us to monitor uncertainty in copy numbers over multiple steps in the experimental workflow. Using SMAPS, we identified five lead hits, which showed up to threefold increased EV-AAV yield compared to wild-type, without altering particle size. Moreover, in vitro transduction experiments demonstrated that the lead AAV9 capsid exhibits substantially higher transduction efficiency compared to wild-type AAV9 and retained functional activity in the presence of neutralising anti-AAV9 antibodies. Collectively, our study: (i) delivers a scalable high-throughput screen for EV-AAV engineering, (ii) introduces the field first statistical model-guided quality-control framework for directed evolution, and (iii) provides best-in-class capsids for EV encapsulation.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

An arrayed overexpression library encoding all 102 genes was constructed and systematically screened using a plate-based cytotoxicity assay, identifying 29 genes that inhibit mycobacterial growth. Because mycobacteriophage genomes are also known to encode systems involved in phage-phage competition, we conducted additional phage defense assays for a subset of NBJ genes in our library. This analysis confirmed homotypic immunity by the predicted immunity repressor, and identified an additional gene involved in host defense against Cluster F phages and which was found to be critical for NBJ lysogen stability. Finally, we extended our analysis to explore the essentiality of all identified host-modulating genes in the NBJ life cycle, using CRISPR-enhanced recombineering to generate phage deletion mutants, revealing two host modulators that are critical for lytic growth.

J.; Marx, C. J.; Alleman, A. B.", "abstract": "Bacteria in the wild often encounter long periods of starvation. Evolutionary adaptation to cycles of nutrient deficiency has led to metabolic and physiological strategies that prevent cell death and promote rapid recovery from starvation. A cellular factor shaping outcomes during carbon starvation is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a widespread carbon polymer that helps maintain membrane integrity and promotes regrowth upon reintroduction to nutrients. The response to starvation is often highly heterogeneous across isogenic populations and confounded by environmental variables that mask underlying physiological mechanisms. Prior work has shown that hyper- or hypo-osmolarity greatly increases cell death, but little is known about how PHB and osmolarity jointly influence both population viability and the emergence of heterogeneity in periods of nutrient limitation. To investigate this, we subjected populations of Methylobacterium extorquens to carbon starvation across a range of osmolarities and analyzed the phenotypes of individuals regrowing from the combined stress. By resolving the distributions of key traits such as lag time and growth rate, we found that populations partition into subpopulations that appear either significantly or minimally impaired by the stresses presented. Osmolarity affected total survival, and surprisingly, populations maintained viability in ultra-pure water. PHB metabolism was beneficial for population viability across all conditions, and unexpectedly reduced the variance of populations in lag time and growth rate. These findings show that PHB aids survival and regrowth from starvation, and suggest that the restructuring of phenotypes in long-term stationary phase depends on PHB even though total osmotic sensitivity does not.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

However, their behaviour under chronic inflammatory conditions, such as those observed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), remains incompletely understood. Methods We investigated the impact of chronic inflammation on intestinal stem/progenitor cells by integrating bulk RNA sequencing from the largest IBD biopsy cohort to date with single-cell transcriptomic analysis and experimental assays using patient-derived intestinal organoids. Results Active inflammation was associated with a reduction in canonical LGR5 intestinal stem cells and a concurrent expansion of OLFM4 populations, consistent with an inflammation-induced epithelial repair program. Notably, SC/TA cells from both inflamed and non-inflamed IBD tissues exhibited persistent transcriptional changes that were distinct from those in healthy controls. Single-cell analysis identified transcriptionally heterogeneous SC/TA subpopulations, including a previously uncharacterized inflammation-associated cluster enriched in immune signalling pathways. Pseudotime trajectory analysis demonstrated a shift in differentiation toward deep crypt secretory (Paneth-like) cell lineages under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Chronic intestinal inflammation reshapes the epithelial stem and progenitor cell compartment, promoting altered differentiation and the emergence of immune-responsive epithelial states.

In this way, Pol III activity must be broadly coupled with cellular demands for protein accumulation and growth, increasing in response to nutrient availability and decreasing during differentiation and exit from proliferation. However, the currently established mechanisms of Pol III regulation remain relatively limited, due in part to the few Pol III-centered protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies performed to date. To address this gap, we first investigated PPIs shared by multiple Pol III subunits to under-stand the macromolecular interactome of Pol III, with special attention directed at potential regulatory candidates. Our proteomic survey uncovers interactions between Pol III and the NuRD (Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase) complex. Taken further, we show that NuRD localizes to active Pol III-transcribed genes and that its recruitment is Pol III-dependent but nonrandom, with peak occupancy and regulatory hallmarks converging on tRNA gene clusters associated with notably high expression levels. Inhibiting NuRD-associated histone deacetylase function reduces Pol III transcription at these sites, suggesting NuRD restricts Pol III and thereby modulates the global dynamic range of Pol III-derived RNA species. These findings are congruent with the transcriptionally repressive nature of NuRD and bring-to-light a new regulatory mechanism that may couple signaling events and changes in metabolic needs with the dynamic availability of specific tRNA pools.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

While recent advances delineating the molecular forces that underlie phase separation have largely focused on protein-protein interactions, the molecular details of protein-RNA interactions within condensates remain limited. In this study, we demonstrate that RNA modulates the phase separation of the low-complexity (LC) and arginine-glycine-glycine motif (RGG1) domains of FUS: low RNA concentrations enhance protein phase separation and excess RNA disrupts it. By integrating biochemical assays, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that RNA incorporates into FUS condensates, reducing condensate density while enhancing local relaxation and diffusional motion of FUS. Surprisingly, whereas RNA binding in the dispersed phase primarily involves the RGG1 domain, within the condensed phase, both LC and RGG1 domains contribute to interactions with RNA. NMR and simulation data show diverse interactions between amino acids and RNA moieties, including prominent glutamine-RNA contacts, that stabilize FUS-RNA co-condensates.

We experimentally characterized one of the most prominent families, the cytochrome P422 (formerly DUF6875) family, distributed throughout the prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

While many tools exist to infer tree sequences from genetic data, and many large pedigree datasets are available, few tools exist to identify the relationship between the two - finding which genetic ancestor corresponds to which pedigree ancestor, and conversely. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve this problem by providing, for each genetic tree, the list of all consistent ancestry paths within a genealogical tree. We also provide variants of the algorithm with moderate robustness to both tree sequence and pedigree errors. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach on the BALSAC genealogical dataset, which includes millions of individuals in Quebec, Canada. We find that 20 carriers usually provide enough information to reliably identify a common ancestor 15 generations ago or find the parent of origin of alleles among probands, but the number of possible ancestry paths within the pedigree can remain large.

Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions.

Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations.

During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear.

Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Here, the effects of palmitate (PA) and oleate (OA) were studied in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a focus on lipid accumulation and glucose uptake. We found that glucose rather than FFA availability promotes adipocyte maturation and fat accumulation associated with increased basal glucose uptake and altered expression of fatty acid oxidation markers (CPT-1 isoforms and UCP-1) toward lipid storage phenotype. Neither PA, nor OA altered insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by immature or mature adipocytes. Adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes in the presence of rosiglitazone led to appearance of double effect of PA on glucose uptake by differentiated adipocytes, i.e. (1) PA dose-dependently increased basal glucose uptake, and (2) at high concentration PA suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The effect of PA on basal glucose uptake was independent of mTORC1-mediated feedback in insulin signaling and persisted even when insulin signaling was inhibited by high-dose PA. Nonetheless, it was associated with GLUT4 exposure at the plasma membrane as reported by PA-induced, insulin-independent translocation of cMyc-GLUT4-mCherry chimera expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, we conclude that only excessive FFA may context-dependently trigger classic insulin resistance in adipocytes, but otherwise FFA increase glucose uptake in adipocytes via GLUT4 mobilization.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

D.; Spronck, B.", "abstract": "Background Ex vivo characterization of arterial viscoelastic properties shows arterial stiffness and contractility to depend on both axial stretch and dynamic pressurization. While these arterial properties are the subject of extensive ex vivo research due to their relevance to vascular pathophysiology, only few experimental approaches mimic both physiological axial stretch and dynamic pressurization when characterizing arterial biomechanics, vasoreactivity, and tissue microstructure. To fill this gap, we developed a custom dynamic biaxial pressure myograph compatible with two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). Methods We studied five murine carotid artery segments. Sample viscoelastic behaviour was characterized by quasi-static and dynamic pressurization experiments at and around physiological axial stretch, as well as quasi-static stretching at physiological pressures. In addition, vasoconstriction in response to 2 M phenylephrine was measured during dynamic pressurization and with axial loads that mimicked physiological conditions. Lastly, arterial collagen, elastin, and cell nuclei were imaged using TPLSM with the sample at physiological axial stretch and pressurized at 100 mmHg. Results The setup enabled capture of the non-linear biaxial viscoelastic behaviour of the arterial wall as well as the viscoelastic stiffening with dynamic pressurization. Modulation of these characteristics upon stimulated smooth muscle contraction was also captured well. Moreover, the related ultrastructural properties of the collagen-elastin network as well as the transmural cell distribution, were recordable at corresponding loading conditions by TPLSM. Conclusion The presented multi-modal characterization platform enables comprehensive ex vivo measurements under well-controlled in vivo-like loading conditions, for in-depth studies focusing on arterial stiffening. Our findings emphasize the need for controlling dynamic pressure and axial stretch conditions in investigating mechanistic and constitutive aspects of arterial stiffening.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we investigate a perforated slab with channels (PS) and Vgroove structures, which show enhanced algal growth performance compared to flat slabs of the same volume and footprint. By integrating experimentally measured photosynthetic parameters into radiative transfer and oxygen diffusion reaction simulations, we uncover the role of structure induced improvements in light penetration, surface area-to-volume ratio, and mass transfer dynamics driving increased algal growth and photosynthesis. Algal growth rates in printed PS and Vgroove geometries were 2.4 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, than in corresponding slab.

Herein, we cloned and purified SaTpx along with its plausible physiological redox partners to reconstitute its electron relay system. We solved the high-resolution crystal structure of SaTpx, revealing the essential active-site catalytic triad (Cys 60, Thr 57, Arg 128). The crystal structure of SaTpx reveals the presence of the highly conserved N-terminal {beta}-flap, absent in its mammalian orthologs (Peroxiredoxin 5). To investigate the plausible role of this highly conserved {beta}-flap, we cloned and characterized a deletion mutant, N{Delta}15-SaTpx, lacking this region.

Here, we explore the molecular parallels between oncogenesis and early human development by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data from three distinct cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and medulloblastoma) and embryoid bodies (EBs). By leveraging this integrative approach, we identify conserved progenitor-like cell states shared between oncogenesis and embryogenesis. These clusters exhibit high proliferative potential, enriched for key cell-cycle regulators such as UBE2C, TOP2A, BIRC5, and NUSAP1, and are driven by an E2F-TFDP transcriptional axis. Functional enrichment analyses highlight these clusters' involvement in cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and mitotic regulation. Trajectory inference via Slingshot further confirms that these proliferative states represent a progenitor-like hub, from which diverse tumor lineages arise. Notably, these clusters are enriched in lung adenocarcinoma and in lung tissue with basal cell hyperplasia, a potential precursor to squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings suggest that the E2F-TFDP-driven proliferative program is a conserved feature of tumor cell plasticity across distinct cancer types, with prospective implications for early detection or therapeutic targeting.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

While most species had paddles, elongated skull, body, and a laterally compressed tail, and lived in the open sea, some early species, with limbs similar to those of terrestrial animals and a varanoid-like body, lived in marine coastal shallow waters. Recently, mosasauroid remains have been discovered in freshwater environments in several continental deposits of the Santonian-Campanian of Europe. This study describes new cranial and postcranial mosasauroid remains from Santonian continental deposits in Provence, southeastern France, and attributes them to a new tethysaurine: Garamaudo bauciensis nov. gen., nov. sp. This mosasauroid, approximately 2.5 m long, with terrestrial-like limbs and a sacrum, and with osteosclerosis in its vertebrae and humerus (at least), was probably hovering at shallow depth in freshwater ecosystems. This new discovery raises the fact that, according to current knowledge, it is only within the Tethysaurinae that freshwater forms evolved, pointing to a possible niche partitioning, associated with of the maintain of the plesiopedal / plesiopelvic condition, in parallel with the invasion of open waters by most other hydropedal and hydropelvic mosasauroids.

Here, we identified 12 SABATH family genes from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and found that MpSABATH2 is essential for its development. Mpsabath2 mutants were severely inhibited in thallus growth and gemma cup formation, while spontaneously forming sexual branches under non-inductive conditions. These phenotypes resembled the developmental responses to far-red light, which was also supported by transcriptome analysis. Further genetic analysis connected this phenomenon with gibberellin (GA)-related metabolism. Blocking GA biosynthesis partially rescued Mpsabath2 phenotypes, which were restored by treatment with the GA precursor, ent-kaurenoic acid.

Objective: We aimed to identify molecular differences between individuals with primary hazelnut allergy and nonallergic controls by investigating a comprehensive spectrum of omics profiles in immune cells. Methods: We analysed DNA methylation, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in hazelnut-stimulated and unstimulated immune cells. Results: Across analyses, we identified 80 differentially methylated signatures, 125 differentially expressed genes, and 11 differentially secreted proteins associated with hazelnut allergy. DNA methylation signatures were highly concordant between unstimulated and stimulated conditions, consistent with stable epigenetic remodelling. Key findings implicated ZNF341, associated with a rare monogenic hyper-IgE syndrome, and ARL2, both linked to STAT3-mediated IgE dysregulation. Additionally, we identified a differentially methylated region (DMR) overlapping the T Helper Type 2 Locus Control Region Associated RNA (TH2LCRR) in the cytokine gene cluster, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism contributing to IL-5 and IL-13 upregulation. Antigen stimulation was required to reveal hazelnut-specific transcriptional and proteomic signals. Integration of these data demonstrated that IL-5 expression could distinguish both groups. We identified signals in epithelial barrier genes of the gut and skin (TRIM31, TRIM40, CDSN), activation of the vitamin D pathway (CYP27B1, IL32), and nominate additional signals (PHACTR1, MFHAS1, SPRED2, GALNT5/GALNTL4, NSMCE1-DT) for follow-up.

As a result, the visual feedback produced by a given motor command is context-dependent and requires an appropriately adapted response. Recent experiments have investigated how the fish Danionella cerebrum use visual cues to stabilize their position against simulated external currents. Logarithmic sensorimotor transformations have been proposed to enable adaptive responses to perturbations while preventing delay-induced instabilities. Here, we develop the theoretical framework introduced for continuous locomotion to show how logarithmic coding naturally gives rise to this adaptive behavior. The system is modeled by a nonlinear delay differential equation, which is analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We further analyze experimental data to uncover the mechanisms underlying swimming initiation and positional drift correction. Finally, we extend our framework to intermittent locomotion, resulting in a nonlinear difference equation, and show that it still produces robust adaptive behavior. This is motivated by the literature on zebrafish, where visuomotor stabilization has been extensively studied, but burst-and-coast swimming obscures the underlying adaptation mechanism. We show that our theory can reproduce the experimental results reported for motor adaptation in zebrafish without invoking internal models. Overall, our results highlight logarithmic coding as a unifying principle for visuomotor stability across continuous and intermittent locomotor regimes.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

In the past few years, asparagine-rich merozoite antigen (PfARMA) has emerged as a potential vaccine candidate due to its low amino acid sequence diversity and the association between anti-PfARMA antibody levels and protection to malaria. Here, we used samples from P. falciparum-exposed individuals to study naturally acquired B cell and antibody responses to PfARMA. B cell responses to PfARMA were dominated by IgM+ B cells that recognized the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of PfARMA. A human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) to IDR1 was non-neutralizing, while a second hmAb binding to the folded domain showed weak neutralizing activity. Both PfARMA-specific plasma IgM and IgG responses predominantly targeted IDR1 and their levels increased with P. falciparum exposure. However, in contrast to previous reports, these antibody responses did not correlate with protection in age and exposure-matched children. Interestingly, approximately 30% of unexposed individuals had IgG that also targeted IDR1 and was polyreactive, binding to regions with high asparagine content. Finally, we determined that PfARMA is located in or near PfEBA-175+ micronemes. These data suggest that while IgG to the folded domain of PfARMA may inhibit parasite growth, antibody responses to PfARMA are primarily directed to IDR1 and may not directly contribute to protection against malaria.", "date": "2025-12-13", "journal": ""}

Results show that most predictors perform well at predicting nanobody structures, but some struggle at ligand placement. AlphaFold3 outperformed the other softwares in all these tasks. Co-folding increased the accuracy of the predictions, modelling better CDR1. Contact analysis revealed that CDR1 was mostly involved in ligand binding instead of CDR3.

Using simultaneous spiking recordings from the left and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) of freely behaving rats, we found that signatures of criticality emerged at the onset of neuronal synchronization, both locally within individual hemispheres and globally across the combined population. Over time, cortical activity explored a continuum of intra- and interhemispheric synchrony levels, including states in which neurons were locally desynchronized yet maintained interhemispheric coupling.
