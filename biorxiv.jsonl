However, no studies have directly examined the involvement of the visual cortex in motor function. Here, we show that a rhythmic foot movement performed by acquired blind individuals can be disrupted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to their primary and secondary visual cortex (V1/V2). This disruptive effect was absent for congenitally blind or sighted individuals. As a control, TMS to the neck muscles of acquired blind individuals confirms that this disruptive effect was not caused solely by the sensory (tactile/auditory) sensations accompanying the stimulation. Our results provide the direct evidence that functional repurposing of the human visual cortex is not restricted to perception and cognitive functions but also extends to motor function. Moreover, our findings suggest the nessecity of the visual experience before visual loss for the functional reorganization of the visual cortex for motor function.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

The TSAR package incorporates multiple workflows that facilitate TSA analyses, returns publication-ready graphics, and includes an optional graphic user interface. The package is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/TSAR/. Applying TSAR, we screened two chemical libraries and found multiple molecules that potentially interact in vitro with the capsid protein (CA) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). First, a library of vitamins exemplifies the different graphic outputs of TSAR, and we report a change in the 50% melting temperature (Tm) for folic acid-treated CA hexamers (CAHEX). Since HIV-1 CAHEX interacts with host-derived acids like inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) or dNTPs, a second library was screened containing 96 organic, acidic metabolites; multiple anionic ligands caused a Tm for CAHEX. Subsequent investigation of these interactions includes biolayer interferometry, antiviral activity against pseudotyped HIV-1, and endogenous reverse transcriptase assays that were used to validate and investigate the biological impact of these native ligands that thermally-stabilize CAHEX. One compound hit, gallic acid, exhibited anti-HIV-1 activity as previously reported, and we show interacts with CAHEX as a potentially novel mechanism. Overall, the TSAR package facilitated quick analysis of TSA data from multiple libraries to help identify a biologically relevant hit, gallic acid, as a molecule that can inhibit HIV-1 replication and targets CAHEX.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

L.; Barash, E.; Katz, D. B.; Lin, J.-Y.", "abstract": "Learning depends on more than the association of paired stimuli in a vacuum. For example, benign experience with a taste stimulus weakens future conditioned taste aversions (CTA) to that taste: a phenomenon known as latent inhibition (Lubow and Moore, 1959). Our work has revealed a similar phenomenon in rodents whereby benign experience with tastes significantly enhances later CTA to a novel taste (Flores et al., 2016; Flores et al., 2018). This phenomenon suggests that taste experience broadly alters future taste processing in gustatory cortex (GC). To delve into this possibility, we previously have used in-vivo electrophysiology in female Long-Evans rats, recording GC activity during benign taste experience. These recordings revealed an increase in the discriminability of GC responses to both familiar and novel tastes following taste experience (Flores et al., 2022). Here, we build upon these earlier results to present a potential mechanism for this increased discriminability and salience: a reduction of cortical response variability of single-neuron responses, and enhanced coherence of ensemble responses, to the novel taste. We go on to demonstrate that the differences between pre- and post-CTA responses are greater following benign taste experience. These results suggest that benign taste experience impacts GC responses towards a novel taste pre- and post-CTA conditioning by increasing taste coding reliability at both the single-neuron and ensemble levels.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

We used a brief-access task (BAT) to reveal both between-rat individual differences in taste preferences and shifting preferences within individual rats (quantified in terms of lick bout lengths). We moved on to show that these phenomena are not simply random variation: first, we demonstrated that gustatory cortical (GC) taste response dynamics, the late part of which have been shown to reflect palatability, match that individual rat's BAT preferences (evaluated almost 2 weeks prior) better than canonical preference patterns, revealing that the individual differences reflect differences in neural taste processing; this enhanced correspondence, however, links neural taste processing only to the most recent BAT session--GC palatability processing does not reflect performance in earlier BAT sessions. The finding that rats' perceptual preferences shift across BAT sessions carries with it the implication that any tasting experience might change these preferences. We tested this implication by performing a second session of GC taste-response recordings--sessions in which tastes were delivered by intra-oral cannula to passive rats--and found that palatability-epoch taste responses in this later session no longer matched the most recent pre-recording BAT session. Together, these data demonstrate that every tasting experience (regardless of the method of taste delivery) changes the rat's perceptual/neural processing of those tastes.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Typically, athletes learn these strategies with instruction-based teaching methods where coaches offer athletes a correct solution. Inspired by recent evidence from decision neuroscience, we asked whether skilled athletes learn strategy choices better with an evaluation-based training strategy (reinforcement learning). To address this question, we conducted a three-day learning experiment with skilled alpine ski racers (n=98) designed to improve their performance on flat slopes on slaloms with four strategies at their disposal to achieve this goal. We compared performance and strategy choices of three groups: a reinforcement learning group, that only received feedback about their race times after every run, a supervised (free choice) learning group, that received strategy instructions from their coach, and a supervised (target skill) learning group, being coached to use the theoretically optimal strategy for skiing well on flats. We found that despite making similar strategy choices, the skiers in the reinforcement learning group, showed greater improvements in their race times during the training sessions than their counterparts in the supervised (free choice) learning group and outperformed them during a subsequent retention test. Surprisingly, the skiers in the reinforcement learning group even showed descriptively (but not significantly) better performance than those in the supervised (target skill) learning group. Our findings show that reinforcement learning can be an effective training strategy for improving strategy choices and performance among skilled athletes, even among the best ones.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Aside from the identification of causal genes, other difficult challenges to informing GWAS include characterizing the roles of predicted causal genes in disease and providing additional functional context, such as the cell type predictions or biological pathways in which causal genes operate. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) can assist in informing BMD GWAS by linking disease-associated variants to genes and providing a cell type context for which these causal genes drive disease. Here, we use large-scale scRNA-seq data from bone marrow-derived stromal cells cultured under osteogenic conditions (BMSC-OBs) from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to generate cell type-specific networks and contextualize BMD GWAS-implicated genes. Using trajectories inferred from the scRNA-seq data that map cell state transitions, we identify networks enriched with genes that exhibit the most dynamic changes in expression across trajectories. We discover 21 network driver genes, which are likely to be causal for human BMD GWAS associations that colocalize with expression/splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL/sQTL). These driver genes, including Fgfrl1 and Tpx2, along with their associated networks, are predicted to be novel regulators of BMD via their roles in the differentiation of mesenchymal lineage cells. In this work, we showcase the use of single-cell transcriptomics from mouse bone-relevant cells to inform human BMD GWAS and prioritize genetic targets with potential causal roles in the development of osteoporosis.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Tight regulation of Ca2+ is crucial for the function of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). Dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in OHCs is associated with impaired hearing and contributes to increased vulnerability to insults such as noise exposure. Ca2+ signaling in developing OHCs is modulated by oncomodulin (OCM), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether the lack of OCM disrupts the control of intracellular Ca2+ in mature OHCs, and influences vulnerability to acoustic injury. Using young adult CBA/CaJ mice, we found that OHCs from Ocm-knockout (Ocm-/-) mice showed normal biophysical profiles, electromotile responses, and synaptic innervation compared to littermate controls. Moderate noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 2 hrs) caused temporary threshold shifts in Ocm+/+ and OcmOcm-/- mice. However, while Ocm+/+ fully recovered thresholds 2 weeks after noise exposure, Ocm-/- mice showed permanent threshold shifts. Additionally, OcmOcm-/- mice had auditory brainstem responses with highly variable latencies and amplitudes both before and after noise exposure compared to OcmOcm+/+ mice. Using a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in OcmOcm+/+ and Ocm-/- OHCs, we found that prolonged noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 9 hrs) significantly increased GCaMP6s fluorescence, ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling and also caused greater threshold shifts in OcmOcm-/- compared to OcmOcm+/+ OHCs. However, prolonged noise exposure had no significant change in the number of presynaptic OHC ribbons in either OcmOcm+/+ or OcmOcm-/- mice. We assessed whether the ATP-induced responses were due to changes in P2X2 receptor expression. Prior to noise exposure, P2X2 expression was higher in the cochlea of OcmOcm-/- mice compared to OcmOcm+/+ mice. Following prolonged noise, P2X2 receptors were upregulated in the cochlea of Ocm+/+ but not in the OcmOcm-/- mice, which retained their pre-noise expression level. We propose that the lack of OCM increases susceptibility to cochlear pathology and that purinergic signaling and dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis likely contribute to early onset hearing loss in the OcmOcm-/- mice.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Proteins can diffuse micrometers in seconds, yet bacterial cells are able to maintain stable protein gradients. The best studied bacterial protein gradient is the Min system of Escherichia coli. In rod-shaped bacteria the MinCD proteins prevent formation of minicells by inhibiting FtsZ polymerization close to the cell poles. In E. coli these proteins oscillate between cell poles within a minute, resulting in an increased MinCD concentration at the poles. This oscillation is caused by the interaction between MinD and the protein MinE, which form an ATP-driven reaction-diffusion system, whereby the ATPase MinD cycles between a monomeric cytosolic and a dimeric membrane attached states. Bacillus subtilis also has MinCD, but lacks MinE. In this case MinCD form a static gradient that requires the transmembrane protein MinJ, located at cell poles and cell division sites. A recent reaction-diffusion model was successful in recreating the MinD gradient in B. subtilis, assuming that MinD cycles between cytosol and membrane, like in E. coli. Here we show that the monomeric and dimeric states of B. subtilis MinD have comparable membrane affinities, that MinD interacts with MinJ as a dimer, and that MinJ is not required for membrane localization of MinD. Based on these new findings we tested different models, using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and found that a difference in diffusion rate between the monomer and dimer, rather than a difference in membrane affinity, is important for B. subtilis MinCD gradient formation.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Disturbance of the microbiome by microbial invasion can be negative or positive: invasions of opportunistic pathogens can cause disease while dysbiotic states need invasions to recover.

In this study we measure interactions between members of a SynCom of prominent gut bacteria with supernatant assays. We measure relative abundances of growth of co-cultures up to four species to validate a generalised Lotka-Volterra model parameterized with these supernatant assays. We predict differential invasion profiles of the opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli and Bacteroides ovatus based on their monoculture growth profiles and interactions with other species. With experimental data of both predicted invasion and resistant communities we confirm model predictions of invasion success. Our model shows that both negative interactions within a community and neutral to positive interactions with the invading species promote invasion success, but the interactions towards the invading species dominate. Our validated approach opens the way for testing of interactions of human gut microbiome species, thereby developing inventions to avoid pathogenic overgrowth and therapies to enhance health-benefitting invasions.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

To assess overexploitation risk for such interjurisdictional populations, we propose a risk indicator IRIIS which incorporates 1. species-specific vulnerability 2. distribution of genetically-distinct populations with respect to jurisdictional boundaries and 3. differences in management practices across jurisdictions. As a case study we evaluated overexploitation risk for individual populations of nine commonly caught fish species spanning across multiple jurisdictions along Indias west coast.

However, in-vivo studies of insula anatomy in humans (in general), and within-insula parcellation (in particular) have been limited. The current study leverages 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to delineate cortical depth intensity profiles within the human cortex. Our analysis revealed two separate clusters of relatively high and low signal intensity across the insula cortex located in three distinct compartments within the posterior, anterior-inferior, and middle insula. The posterior and anterior-inferior compartments are characterised by elevated T1-weighted signal intensities, contrasting with lower intensity observed in the middle insular compartment, compatible with ex-vivo studies. Importantly, the detection of the high T1-weighted anterior cluster is determined by the choice of brain atlas employed to define the insular ROI. We obtain reliable in-vivo within-insula parcellation at the individual and group levels, across two separate cohorts acquired in two separate sites (n1 = 21, Glasgow, UK; n2 = 101, Amsterdam, NL).

Our results show that lethal human activities cause significant behavioural changes, with targeted species increasing vigilance and reducing foraging in affected areas. Active non-lethal activities elicited similar but generally weaker patterns, with many species showing little to no change in the magnitude of behavioural response. In contrast, passive non-lethal interactions, like those involving roads and development, produced highly variable responses depending on the species. These findings illustrate the importance of differentiating between types of human activity when considering their effects on wildlife.

We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca2+- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Indeed, micronuclei activation of the cGAS/Sting pathway, which has been thought to drive SASP(Kwon, Leibowitz, and Lee, 2020), remains controversial(Flynn, Koch, and Mitchison, 2021; Sato and Hayashi, 2024; Takaki et al., 2024). In this report, analyses of various cell lines induced to undergo senescence by diverse stressors revealed that HIF-1 is specifically induced in senescence but not in quiescence. Consistent with our previous findings(Wu et al., 2023a), we have further demonstrated how centrosome amplification induces a non-canonical SASP dominated by HIF-1 activation rather than the classical NF{kappa}B signaling. Lastly, we revealed that during SASP, centrosome amplification-generated micronuclei do not activate the cGAS/Sting-mediated interferon response.

Our computational modeling suggests that mutual inhibition between these GABA groups drives the anti-correlated activity and predicts how these interactions shape downstream responses to stimulation of GABA and UCN3 neurons. We test these predictions using optogenetics and confirm that GABA neurons are critical for the transmission of UCN3 signals to regulate luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency. Our study is the first to show how GABA neurons in the amygdala mediate stress effects on reproductive health, uncovering key neural mechanisms linking emotional and reproductive functions.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Variation in host-associated microbial communities often parallels patterns of phylogenetic divergence between hosts, a pattern known as phylosymbiosis. Understanding of this phenomenon relies initially on quantifying phylosymbiotic signals from across a broad range of host taxa. Quantifying signals of phylosymbiosis is typically achieved by calculating how congruent a host's phylogenetic tree is with a dendrogram that represents patterns of dissimilarity in their associated microbial communities. To statistically assess the degree of congruence, several studies have constructed null models using a Monte Carlo approach to randomly sample trees. Although this approach is becoming more common, it has several features that warrant benchmarking to advise its further use. This approach relies on quantification of congruence between a host's phylogenetic tree its microbial community dendrogram. Therefore, it is important to establish how choice of congruence metric influences null model-based inferences. Furthermore, phylosymbiotic signals may manifest at different scales of host divergence, and it is important to establish the extent of host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect a phylosymbiotic signal. To help improve our study of phylosymbiosis, here I examine how power and type 1 error (false positive) rates associated with this approach varies with choice of congruence metric and host phylogenetic coverage. Furthermore, I examine variation in sensitivity given uncertainty in tree estimation, as well as how well null congruence models align with expectations of community assembly that is completely neutral with respect to host phylogeny. I generally found that model performance increased rapidly with increasing tree sizes, suggesting lower limits on the host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect phylosymbiotic signals with this approach. Furthermore, I found several notable variations in performance between congruence metrics, which translated into different inferences regarding signal detection. Overall, these findings suggest that Monte Carlo sampling across tree space can be an effective way to quantify phylosymbiotic signals and highlight key considerations for its implementation.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

D.; Humphries, M. J.; Ambriovic-Ristov, A.", "abstract": "Background: Integrins form focal adhesions (FAs) at the cell edge and fibrillar adhesions (FBs) located centrally. Talin 1 is essential to FAs, while talin2 is found in FAs and FBs. KANK (kidney ankyrin repeat-containing) family proteins regulate adhesion dynamics and are recruited to adhesions through interaction with talins. Previously, we showed in MDA-MB-435S melanoma cells that KANK2 is part of integrin V{beta}5 FAs, that its interaction with talin2 regulates actin-microtubule (MT) crosstalk and that KANK2 knockdown mimics the effect of integrin V or {beta}5 knockdown by reducing cell migration. Here, in another melanoma cell line RPMI-7951 we observed that KANK2 is part of FAs and FBs and that KANK2 knockdown increases cell migration. Therefore, we analyse integrin adhesion complexes in RPMI-7951 cells, explore the localization and role of KANK2 in FAs and FBs. Methods: Knockdown in human melanoma RPMI-7951 cells was achieved by transfection with gene-specific siRNAs. Integrin adhesion complexes were isolated and analysed by mass spectrometry. Immunofluorescence analysis, live cell imaging and the proximity ligation assays were done using confocal microscopy. Cell migration was assessed using Transwell Cell Culture Inserts. MTT assays were performed to determine cell sensitivity to paclitaxel. Data were statistically evaluated using one-way or two-way ANOVA or unpaired Students t-tests in GraphPad Software. Results: We demonstrate that RPMI-7951 melanoma cells use integrin V{beta}5 FAs and integrin 5{beta}1 FBs for adhesion, and that KANK2 is part of both structures. KANK2 is predominantly in proximity to talin1 at the cell edge (FAs) and in proximity to talin2 in the cell center (FBs). KANK2 in FAs functionally interacts with talin1 to maintain FAs, and with talin2 to regulate their dynamics. KANK2 is a component of FBs, and its knockdown mimics integrin 5 knockdown by increasing MT-dependent cell migration. Conclusions: Our study reveals the distinct roles of KANK2 in FAs and FBs. We show that KANK2 is a component of FBs, linking them to MTs and promoting their stabilisation. Loss of integrin 5 or KANK2 from FBs increases cell migration, a process that relies on the MT cytoskeleton.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Following joint injury in mice, the CXCL16-CXCR6 signaling axis is activated in synovium, driven by synovial fibroblasts and macrophages. Human OA synovium also exhibited increased CXCL16 and CXCR6 gene expression. CXCL16 stimulated a pro-inflammatory response in fibroblasts and macrophages, contrasting with an anti-inflammatory response observed in mesenchymal progenitor cells. In mice, repeated intra-articular CXCL16 injections induced histological synovitis and sex-dependent activation of inflammatory and fibrotic transcriptional programs in synovium. Repeated CXCL16 joint injections also induced knee hyperalgesia, which was mitigated by co-administration of the CXCR6 antagonist, ML339. A single intra-articular injection of CXCL16 induced acute knee hyperalgesia as early as 30 minutes post-injection, which was completely abrogated by ML339 co-treatment, suggesting direct CXCL16 binding to nociceptor-expressed CXCR6. In a murine PTOA model, systemic CXCR6 antagonism with ML339 alleviated knee hyperalgesia and altered circulating immune cell profiles. Direct stimulation of mouse dorsal root ganglion-derived nociceptive neurons with CXCL16 induced rapid calcium signaling, which was abolished by co-treatment with ML339. These findings establish CXCL16 as a regulator of joint inflammation and identifies the CXCL16-CXCR6 binding mechanism as key in mediating pain-related behaviors and nociceptor activation, offering a therapeutic target for PTOA-related inflammation and pain management.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Structural variants (SVs) are large-scale (>50 bp) changes in the genome and have been implicated in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation. We investigated the role of SVs in the speciation and divergence of two deer species (Odocoileus spp.) across their North American range. Using multiple long-read and a short-read datasets, our bioinformatics workflow revealed SVs and genomic features that were unique to each species. The majority of species-specific SVs were deletions and insertions suggesting that these variants may show higher likelihoods of fixation within populations. Further, while most SVs were intergenic, some genes found to be impacted by species-specific SVs were under positive selection inferred from dN/dS. We also observed an increased number of enhancer motifs found in SVs compared to the rest of the genome. The SV-affected genes were associated with reproduction, sensory adaptation, and several metabolic pathways. Many of these functions are relevant to fertility and deer biology and therefore may provide insights into potential mechanisms leading to reproductive divergence.

In mammals, three PHD isoforms (PHD1-3) are responsible for proline hydroxylation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) alpha, a key regulator of the hypoxia response. In the accompanying paper (Jiang et al) we report development of a mass spectrometry-based method to reliably identify proline hydroxylation (OH-Pro) sites on proteins and use this to identify a PHD-dependent OH-Pro modification at Pro604 on the protein RepoMan (CDCA2), a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1{gamma}, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability. Here, we investigate the functional significance of hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. During M phase, the PP1- RepoMan complex dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms to ensure the correct localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. We show that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested cells. In cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan, exogenous expression of wild type RepoMan, but not a RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localisation in prometaphase arrested cells. RepoMan P604 is located proximal to the Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) that function as binding sites for the serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56{gamma} is reduced in cells expressing RepoMan P604A. Moreover, analyses in both fixed and live cells released from a prometaphase arrest, show that expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant results in defects in chromosome alignment and segregation, leading to increased levels of cell death. These data support a role for PHD1-mediated prolyl hydroxylation in controlling progression through mitosis, acting, at least in part, via hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 regulating the interaction of RepoMan with PP2A during chromosome alignment and thereby controlling the levels of Histone H3 phosphorylation at Thr3.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Recent work has extended this concept to gray matter morphology in the brain, but no such reference framework currently exists for white matter (WM) even though WM constitutes the essential substrate for neuronal communication and large-scale network integration. Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets. By establishing a unified, interpretable reference framework for WM structure, these brain charts provide a foundational metric for research and clinical neuroscience. The accompanying open-access trajectories, centile scoring tools, and harmonization methods facilitate precise mapping of WM development, aging, and pathology across diverse populations.

However, eDNA surveys are prone to imperfect detection, and non-detections are often misinterpreted as true absences, a critical issue when monitoring rare or elusive species. Despite its implications for biodiversity assessments, detection uncertainty is rarely quantified in eDNA-based studies. Occupancy modeling offers a powerful solution to this limitation but remains underused, partly due to a lack of accessible and flexible tools. We developed NeMO (Nested eDNA Metabarcoding Occupancy), a user-friendly R package for fitting multi-species occupancy models in a Bayesian framework. NeMO explicitly accounts for the nested structure of eDNA metabarcoding workflows, typically involving multiple replication steps such as field samples and PCR replicates, while accommodating presence/absence or read-count data and different PCR pooling strategies. The framework estimates species occupancy, eDNA collection probability, amplification probability, and expected read counts, and allows users to assess the influence of environmental or methodological covariates on each process. Crucially, NeMO helps rigorously assess detectability and optimize resource allocation in eDNA surveys. It estimates the minimum number of eDNA samples, PCR replicates, and sequencing depth required to reliably detect species when present, thereby guiding study design. We illustrate its utility using a fish biodiversity dataset from the Rhone River (France). NeMO integrates key modelling features into a single streamlined framework, providing researchers and practitioners with an accessible and effective tool to assess detectability and optimize resource allocation in eDNA metabarcoding surveys.

However, it remains unclear how tPBM modulates neural oscillatory activity in real-time and how stimulation parameters and individual characteristics affect these responses. Capturing these dynamics is essential to understanding how the photochemical effects of tPBM translate into effective neuromodulation, especially in diverse populations. Methods: Our study provides the first evidence of a cumulative increase in the power of neuro-electric oscillations in 46 healthy young adults with diverse skin tones who underwent 4 minutes of pulsed tPBM using varying laser parameters, including two wavelengths (808/1064 nm), two pulsation frequencies (10/40 Hz), and three irradiances (100/150/200 mW/cm2). To capture online and offline effects, we analyzed minute-by-minute baseline-normalized frequency band power and used mixed-effects modeling to uncover significant predictors of these responses among laser parameters, skin tone, and sex. Results: tPBM elicited frequency-band specific modulations in EEG power beginning near the stimulation site and propagating posteriorly over several minutes. Increases were cumulative with time, consistent with past fNIRS findings. They were also strongest and most sustained in beta/gamma bands, consistent with past findings of cognitive improvement. Significant parameter effects included stronger high-frequency responses at 808 nm and at 150 mW/cm2, wavelength-dependent frequency effects, larger responses in lighter skin, and parameter-specific sex differences. Conclusion: Both laser parameters and biological factors interact to shape the spatial and temporal neuromodulation profile of tPBM and hence, parameter selection is crucial for achieving specific outcomes. Our findings uncover the manner in which tPBM induces neuronal changes, and contribute to a framework for creating more informed and personalized tPBM protocols.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

CRs are key contributors to chromosome evolution and can play a pivotal role in reproductive isolation. The Drosophila nasuta-albomicans species complex presents an ideal model to explore this, as D. albomicans possesses neo-sex chromosomes formed by Robertsonian fusion of chr3L, chr3R, and a sex chromosome, unlike its sister species D. nasuta. In this study, we investigate CRs influence on accessible chromatin (AC) and its relationship with genetic differentiation. We used ATAC-seq to decipher ACs of testis in two hybrids of D. albomicans and D. nasuta, and genome-wide fixation index (FST) scans of D. albomicans and D. nasuta to identify regions of genetic differentiation. Our analyses revealed that chromosome 4 (Muller F) harbors the largest number of differentially accessible regions (~97 Kb), which coincide with peaks in FST. Moreover, changes in ACs were associated with differential transcription factor (TF) binding across the genome. These results suggest that CRs can drive epigenomic divergence in hybrids, particularly on Muller F, and chromatin-level changes may play a key role in reproductive isolation.

Land use types varied in the extent of anthropogenic influences and included forest meadows, human-impacted fields adjacent to agriculture or municipal parks, and highly disturbed habitats near railroad tracks. By building an integrative map of abiotic and biotic variables, we find that a key predictor of disease was biodiversity across ecological scales. Plant communities with higher diversity were associated with reduced disease burden in A. thaliana populations but also increased diversity within the microbiome of A. thaliana. This increased microbial diversity was additionally associated with less disease in A. thaliana.

Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain states and brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Their summed contributions predicted blood volume across states. Brain-wide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations coexist in the entire brain. Their differing contributions to blood volume largely explain the apparent differences in blood volume fluctuations across regions. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

The first task required bimanual coordination to control a virtual 2D arm over 400 center-out and return trials, targeting de novo motor learning. The second task involved unimanual reaching with the dominant hand, consisting of 200 trials in a null-field condition followed by 200 trials with object-like dynamic forces. The third task similarly began with 200 null-field trials and then introduced a viscous force field in the final 200 trials, with fast movements rewarded to encourage peak performance. This task also enabled comparison between dominant and non-dominant arms. All tasks detected age-related performance differences, with the viscous resistance task proving most sensitive to declines in movement speed, force generation, and response onset time. Scoring mechanisms that encouraged brisk performance amplified these effects. Across tasks, older adults generally moved more slowly, took longer to complete tasks, exerted lower peak forces, and had longer response onset times. However, some older participants performed comparably to younger individuals. In the third task, dominant arm performance consistently exceeded that of the non-dominant arm. These results demonstrate that robot-based tasks can sensitively quantify age-related sensorimotor decline and may offer valuable metrics for clinical assessment and monitoring.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are an attractive means for quantitative genetic analysis of complex traits because they encode the realized genetic relatedness between a sample of individuals in the presence of genetic drift, recombination, and mutation. Data structures for efficiently storing ARGs can also be used to rapidly process millions of genomes, and are thus promising for fitting linear mixed models (LMMs) to large phenotype and genome datasets. Here, we study the problems of variance component estimation and prediction of genetic values with ARGs, by describing a generative model of complex traits with additive effects on an ARG, and then developing algorithms that use the ARG to solve these problems efficiently on biobank-scale datasets. We observe nearly linear scaling of runtime with sample size, which is achieved by using the succinct tree sequence representation of the ARG for implicit matrix-vector products, along with modern randomized linear algebra algorithms. We estimate variance components using restricted maximum likelihood (REML), which we find performs substantially better than the Haseman--Elston method. In simulation tests, both variance component estimation and prediction of genetic values (using the best linear unbiased predictor, BLUP) perform nearly as well with inferred ARGs as with true ARGs. We also discuss interpretations of the variance component estimates as mutational variance and additive genetic variance. We provide an implementation of the algorithms as a Python package \\tslmm, which leverages the tree sequence library \\tskit.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

It affects numerous crop species and can cause symptoms that significantly reduce yield. CMV is primarily transmitted by aphids and more sporadically through seeds. It is frequently studied in laboratory settings with the aim of developing effective control strategies. In many experiments, infected plants are placed in direct contact with healthy ones assuming that CMV cannot be transmitted in this way. However, this has not been formally demonstrated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether CMV can be transmitted through plant-to-plant contact. Infected plants were first rubbed against healthy ones and then left in contact for 28 days. Target plants were subsequently tested using DAS-ELISA to detect potential transmission. We applied this protocol in two separate experiments totalizing 15 combinations of plant species including pepper (Capsicum annuum) and five weed species commonly found in Espelette pepper fields (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Cerastium glomeratum, Stellaria media, Stachys arvensis and Trifolium repens). We found that CMV could be transmitted through contact between pepper and all tested weed species except T. repens. These findings highlight the importance of verifying whether a virus is capable of contact transmission before carrying out experiments in conditions that could lead to such contacts. In case of transmission, appropriate precautions will be crucial to avoid unintended transmissions.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

We found that (1) larger groups compensated for reduced per-capita foraging efficiency by expanding into less-exploited areas over longer timescales rather than increasing daily travel; (2) this expansion was disproportionately directed toward smaller neighbors; (3) in the dry season, resource confinement to riparian zones increased intergroup encounters and reduced overlap, with larger groups occupying the highest-quality areas; and (4) climatic extremes linked to El Nino and La Nina exacerbated within-group foraging costs for large groups, whereas intermediate anomalies relaxed these constraints and amplified the benefits of between-group competitive ability.

While segregation of different audio streams is mostly accomplished in the auditory cortex, neural feedback connections run from the cortex to the brainstem and to the cochlea. The latter organ not only houses the mechanosensitive hair cells, but also possesses an active process enabling it to amplify sound in a frequency-dependent manner. A physiological correlate of the active process are distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) that can be measured non-invasively from the ear canal. Here we employed speech-like DPOAEs that are connected to the spectral structure of voiced speech to show that these emissions are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing voices as well as by intermodal attention. We found that speech-like DPOAEs evoked by the resolved harmonics of a voice were significantly reduced when that voice was attended as compared to when it was ignored. No such effect was observed for the unresolved harmonics of the target voice when the competing voice's harmonics in that range were unresolved as well, indicating that attentional modulation is specific to those components of voiced speech that are spectrally resolved. Our findings support the hypothesis that the cochlea's active process already shapes selective attention to speech in noise. Moreover, the speech-like DPOAEs that we developed open up further possibilities for investigating the contribution of the cochlear active process to auditory scene analysis in naturalistic settings.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Its ability to enhance the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio without requiring sample freezing makes it particularly attractive for investigating non-isotropic systems, including soft materials (e.g., hydrogels), semi-solids (e.g., membrane mimetics) and rigid solids (e.g., amyloid fibrils). In this study, we report on the enhanced sensitivity of solid-state NMR experiments on -synuclein fibrils using a MAS cryoprobe. Nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in S/N was observed in CPMAS, refocused-INEPT and 2D 13C13C chemical shift correlation spectra of -synuclein fibrils compared with data collected on a conventional MAS probe. The improved S/N enables the acquisition of slowly decaying signals in the indirect dimension, facilitating faster, high-resolution multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

They are generated in a multi-step process initiated by the Microprocessor, a protein complex composed of DROSHA and DGCR8. Recent studies have described the phenomenon of \"cluster assistance\", in which a prototypic primary miRNA hairpin can license the Microprocessor-mediated processing of a clustered suboptimal hairpin in cis. Genetic screening and mechanistic analyses led to the identification of two critical factors for this process, SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) and ERH (enhancer of rudimentary homolog), which have been shown to associate with the N-termini of DROSHA and DGCR8, respectively, but also form a complex with each other. However, it remains unclear how SAFB2 and ERH can alter the Microprocessor substrate specificity, and whether the described protein-protein interactions are required for cluster assistance. In this study, we focused on the role of ERH and show that its loss largely phenocopies the effect of SAFB1/2 deletion on the miRNA transcriptome, suggesting that both factors are involved in the same processes of primary miRNA biogenesis. In this context, our data demonstrate that both SAFB1/2 and ERH are required for efficient Microprocessor feedback regulation via processing of pri-miR-1306, uncovering a clear physiological function of cluster assistance. Mechanistically, our data show that ERH-mediated cluster assistance depends neither on its direct association with SAFB2 nor on its described interaction with DGCR8. In contrast, disrupting the ERH binding site within DGCR8 drives the processing of a subset of cluster assistance-unrelated pri-miRNAs. Thus, this study reveals dual roles of ERH in primary miRNA biogenesis, a largely suppressive one driven by its direct binding to DGCR8, and the other in cluster assistance that does not require DGCR8 binding.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

CRYAB-R120G mutant HT also exhibited dysfunctional calcium-contraction coupling, which exacerbated contractile deficits at higher pacing frequencies.

This selection excluded the expected \"altered in SD and recovered in RS\" pattern, which was not significantly observed. These two gene sets showed substantial overlap, but were still distinct from each other. Results: The analysis revealed that the selected gene sets were enriched in various brain regions, as evidenced through clustering in the Allen Brain Atlas. This suggests that the successful selection identified biologically meaningful genes. Furthermore, somatostatin (Sst)-expressing neuronal clusters were among the most highly enriched. Conclusions: Given that sst is already implicated in SD and RS, our fully data driven transcriptomic analysis successfully identified the activity of sst during SD and RS.

The impact of elevated flow on regulation of endothelial gene expression is less well studied; therefore, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of primary human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) gene expression under elevated flow, comparing it to gene expression induced by normal physiological and oscillatory flow. Methods: Analysis of HCAEC mRNA, microRNA and protein expression cultured under oscillatory shear stress (OSS), physiological laminar shear stress (LSS), and elevated shear stress (ESS) for 72 hours. Identification of changes in RNA isoform expression and proximity of flow-responsive genes to established coronary artery disease (CAD) risk loci were also performed. Results: 2,175 shear-regulated genes were identified, with 665 uniquely responsive to ESS. Both ESS and OSS induced significant changes in RNA isoform selection, predicted to affect 848 and 580 genes respectively. Signalling pathways regulating CAD pathogenesis including HIPPO, TGF{beta}/BMP, and IRF, showed altered RNA isoform selection which may influence plaque development and plaque erosion. 65% of linkage disequilibrium (LD)-filtered CAD-associated genetic variants contained at least one OSS or ESS-regulated gene within 250Kb.

We developed a class of task-optimized models that generate probability distributions over perceptual estimates. To assess whether human uncertainty representations align with the model's, we compared human confidence judgments, which might indirectly reflect uncertainty representations, to confidence judgments extracted from the model's uncertainty. In both sound localization and pitch perception, human confidence varied systematically, being lower for stimuli that produced more variable estimates across trials.

Building on our recent work, we investigated how EEG activity and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are related to one another, and how they jointly underpin rs-fMRI metrics. Using a multimodal dataset with macrovascular correction applied to all rs-fMRI metrics, we first examined associations between EEG metrics and CMRO2, then applied mediation analysis to evaluate how CMRO2 mediates EEG-fMRI associations. We found that bandlimited EEG theta and alphafractional power was significantly associated with CMRO2. Bandlimited EEG coherence was also associated with CMRO2 across all the bands. Bandlimited EEG fractional power and coherence were also significantly associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in a manner that varied by frequency. EEG broadband temporal complexity was positively associated with CMRO2; and EEG coherence was negatively associated with OEF. Notably, there are pronounced sex differences in these relationships, which suggests that the biophysical underpinnings of rs-fMRI are sex dependent. Moreover, the baseline metabolic and hemodynamic variables did partially mediate EEG-fMRI associations, with CMRO2 serving as the primary mediator. However, most of the mediations are partial, highlighting the complex interplay among electrophysiological activity, oxidative metabolism, and hemodynamics.

Apo MTR adopts a conformation where the two halves of the enzyme act independently with the C-half posed to bind cobalamin. Binding of cobalamin and its activation causes conformational changes in MTR that result in a flexible catalytically active state. AlphaFold predictions, validated by interaction studies, show that MMADHC interacts with the C-half of apo MTR to facilitate cobalamin loading. Unexpectedly we found that MTRR interacts at two distinct sites within the C-half of MTR which may aid in activation.

In this study, CT reconstructions with AI-assisted segmentation and phylogenetically informed regressions across 18 bush-cricket species were used to investigate how tympanal surface area and mean cross-sectional thickness relate to body size, carrier frequency, and the presence of auditory pinnae. Tympanal surface area scaled positively with body size, whereas thickness was independent of size. Carrier frequency decreased with increasing body size but showed no direct association with tympanal properties. Among 14 species with auditory pinnae, tympanal dimensions showed no correlation with peak cavity resonance frequency, indicating semi-independent evolution of pinna cavity and tympanal traits. Across species, pinnae did not alter tympanal surface area, although unilateral pinnae were linked to thicker tympana. Within these unilateral species, the pinna-covered tympanum remained consistently larger in area but thinner than the exposed side.

Polyphenism is thought to promote phenotypic diversification through the gain, loss, and re-evolution of alternative phenotypes. After the origin of a polyphenism, one of the alternative phenotypes often retains the developmental capacity to produce the ancestral trait, thereby permitting the other to evolve rapidly. Yet, little is known about the developmental processes underlying the re-evolution of polyphenic traits and how they may produce phenotypic diversification. Here we address this question by focusing on the caste polyphenism in ant societies, which produces a winged queen caste and a wingless worker caste in a single colony in response to environmental cues. We show, in a hyperdiverse group of ants, that a caste-specific trait called the ocelli (3 simple eyes on the dorsal head) is always present across queen castes but was lost and partially re-evolved multiple times, giving rise to novel patterns (1 ocelli) in the worker castes. Surprisingly, we discovered that a hidden (latent) expression of the ocelli gene regulatory network in worker castes that lost ocelli underlies the partial re-evolution of ocelli in this group. We therefore propose that latent developmental potentials may generally persist across polyphenic systems, including ant castes, and may facilitate the partial re-evolution of novel phenotypic patterns.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Using two photon light sheet microscopy to image 7-9 day old zebrafish that express pan-neuronal GCaMP6s, we recorded calcium dynamics throughout the brain while presenting a panel of strongly aversive stimuli including infrared heat, electric shock, and a whole field looming shadow, together with milder threats including vibration, loud sound, light transitions, and a partial looming stimulus. A compact cluster of neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal pallium (Rl) responded vigorously to strongly noxious and fully looming stimuli, but not to the milder cues. In contrast, neurons in the ventromedial pallium and habenula responded to all stimuli tested. Rl neurons are characterized by high Tiam2a expression, suggesting they can be genetically accessed. Our results identify a dedicated negative valence locus in the teleost pallium and underscore the evolutionary conservation of valence coding circuits.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Jumonji-domain 5 (JMJD5) is a highly conserved and essential 2OG-oxygenase that, thus far, is the only arginyl hydroxylase assigned in eukaryotes. We recently reported that JMJD5 hydroxylase activity is required for DNA replication fidelity, and that pathogenic variants cause replication stress (RS) and genome instability (GIN) in a novel neurodevelopmental disorder. Because of the prevalence of RS and GIN in cancer, and reported roles of JMJD5 in tumorigenesis, we here investigate the impact of JMJD5 cancer mutations on its role in replication fidelity. We describe the structural impact of cancer missense mutations on the hydroxylase activity of JMJD5 and its interaction with  RCCD1, an abundant binding partner encoded by a gene associated with susceptibility to a variety of tumour types. We show that the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction is disrupted by cancer mutations and that the complex is essential for suppressing RS and GIN in tumour cells. Finally, we describe a novel interaction of the complex with RAD51 paralogues and demonstrate the importance of the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction for normal replication fork restart. Our findings further highlight the importance of protein hydroxylases in fundamental cellular processes and the consequences of JMJD5 and RCCD1 deregulation in human disease.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

The ability to predict interaction partners is extremely valuable for avoiding costly, time-consuming experiments. It has been shown that AlphaFold has an unsurpassed ability to accurately evaluate interacting protein pairs. However, a protein can also form homomeric interactions, i.e. interact with itself.\n\nResultsWe found that AlphaFold yielded a significantly higher false-positive rate for identifying homodimers than for heterodimers. True Positive Rate (TPR) at 1% False Positive Rate (FPR) drops from 63% for heterodimers to 18% for homodimers. When we investigated the high-scoring false positives, i.e., non-homodimers with high AlphaFold scores when predicted as such, we found that their homologs were enriched for homomultimeric proteins. Using a simple logistic regression model that combines AlphaFold scores with structural and homology information, we increased the TPR (at 1% FPR) to 42{+/-}8% (5-fold cross-validation) from 19%. If we excluded the homology information, we achieved a TPR of 28{+/-}7%, which is still better than using AlphaFold metrics.\n\nAvailability and implementationAll data are available from Zenodo DOI:10.5281/zenodo.17738668 and all code from https://github.com/SarahND97/alphafold-homodimers.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available online.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Among these, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor-expressing (NDNF+) interneurons have been proposed to be \"master regulators\" of cortical microcircuits. While their role in coordinating physiological cortical activity is beginning to be understood, their contribution to restraining hyperexcitability during epileptiform activity remains unexplored. To address this, we employed calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in an NDNF-Cre mouse line to investigate how NDNF+ interneurons influence cortical hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures. Our results demonstrate that NDNF+ interneurons are actively recruited during interictal spikes and focal seizures, although more slowly than parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Optogenetic hyperpolarization of NDNF+ interneurons exacerbates epileptic discharges, whereas their depolarization suppresses focal seizures, even when the optogenetic stimulus is delayed by several seconds from seizure onset. This effect is largely mediated by GABAB receptor signalling. Additionally, chemogenetic depolarization of NDNF+ interneurons has robust antiepileptic effects both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish NDNF+ neurons as key regulators of cortical excitability and identify them as promising cellular targets for the development of anti-epileptic therapies.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

We previously found that Vhl-deficient AMs not sensing high oxygen pressure are immature and functionally impaired. Here we investigated the specific roles of HIF-1 and HIF-2 isoforms in the regulation of AM functions. With this aim, we combined deletion of Vhl with single or double deletion of Hif1a and/or Hif2a in AMs under the control of the CD11c promoter using a Cre-Lox system. Our work demonstrates that in Vhl-deficient macrophages, both HIF-1 and HIF-2 contribute to AM defective self-renewal, while HIF-2 plays a central role in regulating the impaired AM maturation associated with pVHL loss. HIF-1 promotes a glycolytic shift in alveolar macrophages, while HIF-2 hinders lipid oxidation and surfactant clearance. Thus, HIF-2 raises as a selective critical factor restraining the therapeutic potential of AMs to degrade surfactant excess in mice that have developed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Overall, regulation of both HIF-1 and HIF-2 isoforms is required for an optimal AM function, highlighting HIF-2 as a potential pharmacological target for secondary PAP.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Live imaging revealed that SOK polarisation does not follow a uniform global field but instead responds to local differences in growth and mechanical state between neighbouring tissues. SOKs accumulate at interfaces separating domains of distinct growth behaviour and dissipate under compressive stress. After perturbing tissue interfaces or the mechanical continuity of the tissue, the coherence of the polarity was disrupted, indicating that stable axis establishment requires mechanical coupling across the cell wall network.

Here, we have changed the chromophore chemistry by converting the thioether group of M66 to a thiol group through mutation to cysteine. The new variant termed mCoral due to its orange fluorescence hue has similar brightness to mCherry but has improved resistance to hydrogen peroxide. The variant is also responsive to pH with a low and high pKa forms that have distinct spectral properties, which DFT analysis suggests is due to protonation state changes in the newly introduced thiol group as well as the phenol group. The structure of mCoral reveals that the M66C mutation creates a space within the beta-barrel structure that is filled by a water molecule, which makes new polar interactions including with backbone carbonyl group of F65. Molecular dynamic simulations suggests that this additional water molecule, together with local solvation around the chromophore, could play a role in promoting planarity of the full conjugated system comprising the chromophore; the mCoral chromophore makes slightly more H-bonds with water than mCherry. The main water exit point for mCherry is also narrower in mCoral potentially explaining the increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide.

This study reveals a critical role for progranulin (PGRN) in regulating vascular senescence, function, and remodeling during aging. Methods: We assessed PGRN expression in human and mouse arteries and senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Functional vascular studies were performed in PGRN-deficient (PGRN-/-) mice. Senescence was modulated pharmacologically using the senolytic agent navitoclax (ABT-263), and vascular phenotype was evaluated in adult (6-month-old) and aged mice (18-month-old). Results: PGRN expression increased with age in human and mouse arteries, correlating with elevated p21 expression. PGRN deficiency in adult mice induced endothelial dysfunction, increased vasoconstriction, and induced vascular inflammation and remodeling. Transcriptomic analysis of PGRN-/- VSMCs revealed a senescence-associated signature, including perturbed oxidative phosphorylation, altered epigenetic regulation, and collagen pathways. Pharmacological clearance of senescent cells improved endothelial function but increased vascular contractility in PGRN-/- mice. In aged mice, PGRN deficiency aggravated vascular dysfunction, remodeling, and renal injury without further increasing senescence markers - suggesting premature, rather than progressive, senescence in the PGRN-/- mice. Conclusion: PGRN is a novel regulator of vascular aging, coordinating senescence, inflammation, and remodeling. While endothelial senescence contributes to dysfunction, VSMCs senescence may serve an adaptive role in modulating vascular tone. Targeting PGRN or senescence pathways may offer therapeutic opportunities for age-related vascular diseases, especially in patients with PGRN mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

However, foundational, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant preclinical safety data specific to the cerebral vasculature is lacking. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic evaluation of the technical feasibility, anatomic features, and 30-day clinical safety profile of the Onyx Frontier ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in a GLP-compliant canine intracranial model. Methods: In a prospective GLP study, a 2.0 x 8.0 mm Onyx Frontier ZES was implanted in the basilar artery of twelve healthy mongrel canines pre-treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Vertebral artery tortuosity was assessed via angiography and graded as Type I (non-tortuous/straight), Type II (moderately tortuous/S-shaped), or Type III (severely tortuous/coiled). The primary endpoints were procedural success and 30-day safety, assessed via angiography, serial neurological examinations, and comprehensive clinical monitoring. Results: Technical success was achieved in 100% of animals (12/12). The cohort exhibited challenging anatomy, with a mean basilar artery diameter of 1.39 {+/-} 0.10 mm. Tortuosity analysis revealed that 33.3% of animals were Type I (mild), 58.3% were Type II (moderate), and 8.3% were Type III (severe). Post-procedure, mild vasospasm was observed in all cases, with only one canine requiring intra-arterial verapamil. A single case (8.3%) of self-limiting contrast extravasation occurred without clinical sequelae. At 30 days, there was no mortality, and no animals suffered a neurological adverse event. Minor clinical events were unrelated to the device, and comprehensive clinical pathology panels revealed no evidence of systemic toxicity or a significant inflammatory response. Conclusion: This first-of-its-kind preclinical study demonstrates that implantation of the Onyx Frontier ZES is technically feasible with a 100% success rate in a sub-2mm vessel model with significant tortuosity and has an excellent 30-day safety profile with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity.

We demonstrate that pyridostatin interferes with lagging strand DNA synthesis during semiconservative replication of telomeres. Pyridostatin impedes replication fork progression and triggers telomere cleavage events involving the Flap-endonuclease FEN1 and the nuclease-helicase DNA2. Telomeric protein composition analysis reveals pyridostatin-induced association of LIG3 with telomeres. This enzyme is involved in repair of DNA double strand breaks by microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Depletion of MMEJ-factors or their chemical inhibition enhances telomere loss events in pyridostatin-treated cells.

For antagonistic fungi, specialization to host fungi is often facilitated through the acquisition of genes encoding novel secretions, including proteins and specialized metabolites that shape interactions with host defenses, as well the acquisition of nutrients. Alternatively, novel function may arise from diversifying selection eliciting evolutionary innovation in inert secretions. Through specialization, fungal metabolic capacity can serve as an imprint of the selective forces imposed on the antagonist and provide insights into its natural history and occupied niche. Here, we conduct a phylogenomic investigation of antagonistic ascomycetes in the genus Sympodiorosea, which are commonly found in basal fungus-growing ant gardens. Sympodiorosea and closely related genera of Escovopsis, Luteomyces, and Escovopsioides are canonically referenced as virulent mycoparasites, however, recent work has illuminated the possibility for diverse, non-virulent species to emerge within these attine-associated fungi. We explored genomic variation in Sympodiorosea to gain insight into the genomic potential for alternative lifestyles, focusing on diversity and evolution of metabolic genes. Our study revealed a constrained selective landscape across the Sympodiorosea genome. However, outcomes of in vitro interactions with host fungi are diverse and predictable based on the antagonists ant-species-of-origin, suggesting functional diversification. Phylogenomics reveals that gain/loss events of genes involved in secretions (secretome) are potential drivers of diversification. Additionally, we demonstrate that purifying selection acts more intensely on secretome-related genes relative to other genes. In contrast, few genes from the secretome experience diversifying selection, suggesting a mechanistic role for driving both functional differences between strains and host-specialization. Comparative genomics including other fungi within the family Hypocreales reveals that Sympodiorosea has experienced expansions and contractions in proteases genes that are discordant from expectations under a strictly mycoparasitic lifestyle, indicating either the potential for an alternative lifestyle within ant gardens, or that Sympodiorosea recently evolved from other niches.

What generates these diverse populations is unclear. We investigated this in preneoplastic zebrafish livers where the epigenetic regulator, UHRF1, is overexpressed in hepatocytes. Double strand breaks, DNA methylation repatterning, retrotransposon expression, cell cycle withdrawal and activation of atm and tp53 dependent senescence were early responses to UHRF1 overexpression. This evolved to generate diverse populations of senescent cells, some which expressed immune and senescence signatures plus anti-apoptotic markers, and others co-expressed proliferative genes. The fate of these populations was dictated by UHRF1 levels and Tp53, as Tp53 loss enabled proliferation of cells with reduced UHRF1 expression but not in cells expressing high UHRF1. The senolytic Navitoclax targeted only a subset of senescent cells.

Because the presence of 5mdC in the promoter region of a given gene silences its expression, this oxidation goes in hand with the reactivation of such silenced genes. In different highly aggressive cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma, loss of TET enzyme function and therefore reduced 5hmdC levels pave the way for tumor development. Impairment of TET activity can occur through metabolic inhibition, through loss-of-function mutations in TET genes themselves, and finally through suppression of TET-expression via epigenetic silencing. Reactivation of TET enzyme expression represents a major aim of epigenetic cancer therapy. Here we show that the carbocyclic antimetabolite 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (cAzadC), which is supposed to suppress the methylation of DNA during replication, leads to a substantial increase of TET2 expression and strongly increasing 5hmdC levels.

Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here, we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyzes NEDD8 deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Curiously, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryo-EM structures of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an NEDD8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the NEDD8-CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this tri-molecular CSN5i-3-NEDD8-CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish \"orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors\" as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that cell plasticity can emerge early during prostate cancer development, resulting from the knockout of the epithelial-specific ETS transcription factor EHF in prostate epithelial cells. Inspecting the transcriptome of human prostate cancers, we identified a correlation between low EHF expression, loss of luminal epithelial identity, and attenuated androgen signaling in both primary tumors and castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). In EHF knockout mouse models and human epithelial cells, EHF ablation was sufficient to disrupt epithelial cell lineage integrity and promote a progenitor/stem cell-like state with both basal and luminal features, enabling high plasticity and multi-lineage phenotypic transitions. Mechanistically, EHF acted as a central node controlling a hierarchy of transcriptional regulatory factors and downstream signaling pathways (e.g., COL1A1/DDR1, JAK/STAT3), thereby regulating epithelial lineage integrity and restricting stemness and phenotypic transitions. Activation of these downstream pathways, consequent to EHF loss, promoted non-luminal cell features, attenuated androgenic response, and resistance to AR antagonists. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into the causes of phenotypic plasticity and androgen indifference already at the early stages of prostate tumorigenesis and a new perspective on the paths to cancer progression directly relevant to the development of more efficient treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

We characterized 13 SCA48-associated variants in the TPR and U-box domains using recombinant protein and cellular assays. TPR mutations retained intrinsic ligase activity but lost HSC70 binding, substrate ubiquitination efficiency, and protein stability.

Combining data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (MS), nanoscale chromatography, and peptide detection based on probabilistic measure and three-dimensional ion visualization techniques allows attomole sensitivity identification of pMHCs.

Strikingly, surface expressed neoantigens are restricted to the corresponding set of such limited self-p53 peptide arrays and unaffected by enhancing p53 proteasomal turnover. Further curtailment of MS-validated, high affinity p53 neoepitopes that are structurally deviant from self-pMHC occurs in established tumours due to immune selection against the antigen presenting MHC allele or by a novel mechanism involving p53 neoepitope destruction by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1).

In this study, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) NET1/ARHGEF8 as a stretch-responsive protein. NET1 appears to be highly expressed in arteries and VSMCs. Under physiological levels of cyclic stretch, NET1 localizes to the cytosol and interacts with RhoA. In contractile cells, loss of NET1 blunted stretch-induced MYPT1 phosphorylation and impaired cell adhesion and spreading, without exerting any effect on cell proliferation.

Here, we describe the development of an in vitro platform that combines high-sensitivity triple quadrupole multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS analysis of paraxanthine with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qPCR) of CYP1A2 expression. Using human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B), we demonstrate that modulating CYP1A2 with known effectors, sulforaphane (a known CYP1A2 inhibitor), 3-methylcholanthrene (inducer), and galangin (moderate inducer), changes in both paraxanthine accumulation and CYP1A2 mRNA levels can be effectively monitored. The correlations observed between transcriptional responses and metabolic outputs validate paraxanthine as a sensitive readout of CYP1A2 function in these cell lines. Moreover, the assay remains robust across multiple experimental conditions and facilitates insights into enzyme induction or inhibition mechanisms. By providing a straightforward and scalable alternative to animal models, this approach expands the toolbox available for interrogating xenobiotic metabolism, and enzyme regulation.

STARD7 expression was markedly higher in the soleus, a mitochondria-dense slow-twitch muscle, compared with fast-twitch fibers. Although muscle fibers from mKO mice exhibited no apparent structural abnormalities, their endurance exercise capacity was markedly reduced. RNA-seq analysis revealed suppressed expression of fast-twitch-related genes accompanied by a reduction in fast-twitch fibers. At the mitochondrial level, respiratory chain complexes remained intact, but oxygen consumption was consistently decreased. Targeted lipidomic analysis showed decreased levels of PC, cardiolipin (CL), and coenzyme Q in mKO mitochondria, particularly in the soleus. Conversely, expression of CL biosynthetic enzymes was unchanged, and an in vitro binding assay indicated that STARD7 preferentially transfers linoleic acid-containing PC required for CL remodeling. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed disorganized cristae structures, whereas 4-HNE-modified proteins, mtDNA content, and OPA1 processing remained unaffected.

Using deep proteomics of ultra-pure RBCs and cross-linking interactomics, we identify biliverdin reductase B (BLVRB) as a previously unrecognized Band 3 interactor that binds the N-terminal cytosolic domain under normoxia and dissociates under hypoxia, when band 3-deoxyhemoglobin interactions increase threefold. This reversible interaction forms an oxygen-sensitive switch coupling structural, redox, and metabolic remodeling. In humanized mice, truncation of the Band 3 N-terminus disrupted glycolytic activation, reduced 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis, and impaired exercise tolerance despite preserved cardiopulmonary function, establishing the physiological relevance of this module. Population-scale proteome quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analyses revealed coordinated variation of SLC4A1 and BLVRB abundance but minimal association of biliverdin levels with BLVRB genotype, suggesting alternative functions beyond heme catabolism. Mechanistically, BLVRB Cys109 acts as a nitric oxide (NO) relay, trans-nitrosating glycolytic enzymes such as GAPDH at active site Cys152, transiently inhibiting glycolysis. This S-nitrosation-mediated feedback mirrors conserved mechanisms in plants, where GAPDH-SNO redirects carbon flow toward the Calvin-Benson cycle under nitrosative stress, revealing an evolutionary convergence in gas-responsive metabolic control.

Although cardiac power was preserved in rats with HFpEF, both experimental and human HFpEF hearts exhibited an impaired expression of proteins in mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, accumulation of 3-hydroxy-butyrate (BOH) in rat and also human HFpEF indicated that ketones do not rescue the cardiac energetic deficit. In HFpEF patients from the UK Biobank, higher BOH levels were associated with increased mortality, particularly those with hypertension. Applying 13C-butyrate to isolated perfused hearts with and without HFpEF resulted in isotope incorporation in butyryl-CoA and downstream TCA intermediates and thus proving its active metabolization. Butyrate was efficiently oxidized by cardiomyocytes and was overtaking BOH and amino acids in supporting respiration. Finaly, chronic butyrate supplementation improved survival, enhanced diastolic function, and reduced fibrosis and inflammation in HFpEF rats despite persistent hypertension.

While effective in 2D, extending these methods to 3D remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new ratiometric strategy for SMOLM in 3D. Building on the principles of Single Molecule Light Field Microscopy, which captures the 3D position information from a single snapshot by segmenting the back focal plane, we extend this strategy to orientation retrieval. Our approach uses the generalized 3D Stokes formalism to linearly decompose the intensity measurements across the light-field channels, allowing computationally-efficient estimations, while avoiding both complex PSF fitting and polarization projections.

By averaging feature vectors directly within this space, our method bypasses the need for explicit 3D alignment.

In contrast, the structural and energetic landscape of mTNF remains largely under-explored. Here, we combined multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics and Metadynamics-Adaptive Biasing Force simulations to characterize mTNF embedded in a physiologically relevant lipid bilayer. We show that in the absence of membrane engagement, the extracellular domain (ECD) dynamically samples multiple asymmetric conformations similar to those observed in sTNF. The association of the ECD with the membrane, mediated primarily by the basic residues R78-R82, R107, R108, R120, and R207, restricts conformational heterogeneity and stabilizes the symmetric state. By quantifying the energetic effects of ECD-membrane association, we demonstrate that the symmetric state in the membrane-bound ECD is stabilized over asymmetric conformations to a greater extent than in sTNF. This energetic effect, together with the spatial confinement imposed by the lipid bilayer, may explain the reported reduced affinity of certain biologics for mTNF. In conclusion, our work elucidates how the membrane influences the structure, dynamics, and energetics of TNF.

Mec1 is activated by interaction with a Mec1-activating protein. One such activator, Dpb11 (TopBP1 ortholog), is recruited to a 5' ss-dsDNA junction via the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp. Due to their differential DNA binding preferences, it remains to be determined how Mec1 encounters its activators on damaged DNA. Using real-time single-molecule imaging of checkpoint proteins binding to dsDNA containing a long ssDNA gap, we show that, even in the absence of 9-1-1, Dpb11 binds to ssDNA and localizes to ss-dsDNA junctions in an RPA-dependent manner. Importantly, we directly visualize that Dpb11 recruits Mec1-Ddc2 to ss-dsDNA junctions. Additionally, single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that Dpb11 can interact with multiple DNA sites simultaneously to form bridges both alone and in the presence of RPA, stabilizing ssDNA loops and reducing the end-to-end distance of gapped DNA.

The purpose of this study was to define whether AngII, directly or via increased blood pressure, promoted aortic disease in the proximal thoracic aorta and beyond. Methods: Fbn1+/+ and Fbn1C1041G/+ littermates were infused with either AngII or norepinephrine (NE) via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. Aortic dimensions were determined using in situ imaging. Micro Computed tomography (microCT) was used to determine the localization of aortic pathologies. Results: AngII infusion dramatically augmented aortopathy in Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. Aortic dissection was visible within 3 days of AngII infusion. Over 50% of male Fbn1C1041G/+ mice died during AngII infusion, primarily due to aortic rupture in either the thoracic or abdominal regions. Surviving males had greatly increased ascending aortic diameters and the appearance of pathology at branches of the abdominal aorta. Female mice had a much lower incidence of death but had greatly increased aortic diameters. Although NE infusion also increased systolic blood pressure, it did not significantly augment mortality or aortic diameters. MicroCT discerned novel pathology during AngII infusion that included development of branch aneurysms in the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.

This process is hampered by biological barriers that limit cellular uptake, degrade exposed mRNA, and thus necessitate effective endosomal escape to reach the cytoplasm. To address these challenges, we developed a hPep peptide-based nanoparticle (PNP) system that encapsulates mRNA, forming stable and biocompatible particles, which are rapidly taken up by the cells and enable efficient mRNA delivery across various cell culture models. Following systemic administration in mice, lead hPep3/mRNA PNPs achieve broad mRNA expression across multiple tissues, including the lungs, liver, and spleen, and enable effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system upon local administration. Furthermore, we established a high-yield ([&ge;]70%) microfluidics-based protocol to scale up the production of well-defined, sterile hPep3/mRNA PNP formulations (approximately 70 nm, PDI around 0.170). Most importantly, in a proof-of-concept study in nonhuman primates (NHPs), we demonstrate that hPep PNPs loaded with human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA induce dose-dependent expression of hEPO protein in monkey serum, reaching up to 10 ng/ml at 1.0 mg/kg dose, following both single and repeated administration, while remaining systemically well-tolerated. These findings underscore the potential of hPep peptide-based nanoparticles as a versatile platform for mRNA delivery across multiple tissues, highlighting their promise in advancing the development of mRNA therapeutics.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

K.; Labonte, D.", "abstract": "Many idle insects exhibit discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DCGs). During DCGs, CO2 is released in discrete bursts, followed by periods of negligible gas exchange. The standard metabolic rate (SMR) is thus determined to first order by the product between cycle frequency (fc) and burst volume (Vb, SMR {approx} fc {middle dot} Vb). The evolutionary allometry of these parameters is well studied, but it remains unclear if their static allometry, measured in individuals of the same species, sharing the same ontogenetic stage, follows the same patterns. To address this question, we investigate the static allometry of DCGs in Atta cephalotes leaf-cutter ants workers varying by two orders of magnitude in body mass. The SMR allometry significantly exceeded the standard prediction from the nutrient supply network model, and differed from the SMR allometry observed across insects. This disproportional increase was exclusively achieved by an increase in Vb, perhaps because fc is stabilised by neural and mechanical constraints. It may be necessitated by the positive allometry of the largest muscle in Atta--the mandible closer muscle--which increases with a virtually identical allometric coefficient, providing further evidence that the principles of symmorphosis may be upheld in insects.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

P.; Meech, R. W.", "abstract": "The multiple swimming bells, or nectophores, of the colonial hydrozoan Nanomia septata are capable of coordinated avoidance swims in both forward and reverse directions. Individual nectophores also contribute to slower forms of swimming during foraging. Communication between a nectophore and the rest of the colony is at cone-shaped structures in the colony stem. The stem provides an attachment point for the nectophores and houses the simple nervous system responsible for their coordination. The stem nervous system, revealed by immunocytochemistry, has three main components: two giant axons, a distributed, polygonal nerve network and a set of FMRFamide-immunoreactive nerve tracts. Whereas the nerve network is distributed throughout the stem, the nerve tracts link specific contra-lateral nectophores. Action potentials in the giant axons spread excitation rapidly along the stem, but their connection with individual nectophores is by way of the nerve network. Anatomical evidence is provided for the location of two connecting pathways between the nerve network and the nectophore; one excites an epithelial impulse and leads to reverse swimming; the other provides excitation for forward swimming by feeding into a ganglion-like cluster of nerve cells. Excitation passes to the swimming muscle epithelium by way of a single nerve axon and a nerve ring at the nectophore margin. The work presents physiological evidence for mechanisms, such as facilitation and summation, operating within a multifunctional, bidirectional nerve network, responsible for coordinating epithelial and neural signals in an early-evolved nervous system containing both condensed and distributed units.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

With time-resolved fMRI multivariate pattern analyses, we observed reverse spatiotemporal hierarchy during the visual memory recall and imagery: the neural activity in primary visual cortex was delayed compared with high-order visual areas. A similar pattern was found during auditory memory recall and imagery, where the bottom-up progression from the mid-level planum temporale to the high-level superior temporal gyrus observed during auditory perception was absent. However, the primary auditory area was not involved, suggesting modality differences in the role of primary sensory areas in corresponding memory recall.

Lipids play a critical role in atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and certain lipid classes like sphingomyelins are associated with inflammation and poor cardiovascular outcomes. Phosphatidylserine (PS), on the other hand, is a negatively charged anti-inflammatory phospholipid class involved in efferocytosis. In this study, we sought to investigate its anti-atherosclerotic properties through a combination of complementary human lipidomics analyses, in vitro assays and in vivo experiments in Apoe-/- mice. Methods. Human lipidomics studies were performed on the 300OB cohort comprising 300 obese and overweight individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease. In vitro assays were carried out using human monocytes and macrophages, and in vivo experiments included histopathological, immunophenotyping and single-cell transcriptomic analyses. Results. In humans, we identified PS as an anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective biomarker. Hence, we developed a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like formulation enriched in PS to exploit its properties in a targeted fashion in mice. In vitro, this formulation potently inhibited inflammatory cytokine production on human myeloid cells. Our in-depth in vivo experiments provided evidence of the formulation's potent plaque-stabilizing and anti-inflammatory actions. These effects were mediated by a shift in the monocyte/macrophage compartment toward homeostatic/repairing phenotypes. Conclusions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDL-associated PS potently suppresses inflammation and atheroprogression, and holds promise as a viable approach to improve immunomodulatory therapies.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine the physiological role of the T6SS in Bacteroides within a gut community derived from wild mice (the WildR microbiome). Using newly developed genetic tools and a strategy for functional replacement of strains within the WildR community, we demonstrate that the WildR isolate B. acidifaciens employs a T6SS to antagonize co-resident Bacteroidales. We also show that loss of T6SS function compromises the long-term maintenance of B. acidifaciens in the community but not its initial colonization, establishing the system as a determinant of strain persistence. The T6SS we identified resides on an integrative and conjugative element (ICE). ICE-seq, a targeted sequencing approach, reveals that the T6SS-ICE is distributed among select Bacteroidales and Muribaculaceae species in the WildR microbiome, between which it appears to be recently exchanged. We also show that transfer of the T6SS-ICE to WildR isolate Phocaeicola vulgatus confers transient colonization benefits in mice, but an eventual fitness cost.

Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) is increasingly deployed as a chemical-free postharvest technology, yet prescriptions remain framed in minutes rather than in probabilistic guarantees of disease control and safety. We present a dual framework that (1) establishes conservative confidence bounds on survival and (2) validates a \"shape-only\" morphological fingerprint. This approach addresses the biological complexity of host-pathogen interactions by quantifying isolate-specific heterogeneity, rather than averaging it away. We utilized a large Colletotrichum dataset (n = 5,363) from cacao and coffee, spanning diverse treatments including UV-C, UV-B, and sonication. First, focusing on the Coffee UV-C cohort (~10 min), we quantified this heterogeneity; the most conservative Clopper-Pearson upper 95% bound on survival reached 1.000, highlighting partial survival events (e.g., isolate P24-88) under otherwise high-efficacy conditions. This probabilistic framework captures the \"tail-risk\" of biological resilience instead of assuming complete kill. Second, we trained machine learning models on the full dataset using only geometric features (e.g., aspect ratio, asymmetry), explicitly excluding all primary size metrics. Serving as a rapid physiological indicator of UV-induced stress, these \"shape-only\" models successfully predicted pathogen host-origin (Accuracy = 0.93) and post-treatment survival (R-square = 0.74). The signal's ability to generalize across UV-B and sonication confirms that geometry, not just growth reduction, carries a robust and transferable physiological stress signature.

In the High Arctic, some bird species select nesting sites with physical features that limit the access by their main terrestrial predator, the arctic fox, though these features do not always provide full protection. We investigated how nest microhabitat characteristics and prey availability modulate nest survival in tundra birds that select pond and lake islets as breeding sites. Over four summers, we analyzed the survival of 132 cackling goose and 55 glaucous gull nests located on islets or on pond and lake shores within a 150 km2 area occupied by a snow goose colony on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. We also analyzed survival of 537 artificial nests deployed over three summers. We found that islets act as partial prey refuges, with higher nest survival rates on islets than on pond and lake shores. Nest survival generally increased with islet distance from shore, but we found little evidence of this effect for cackling geese and glaucous gulls, which avoided nesting on islets near shore. Moreover, water depth surrounding islets had little to no influence for any nest type. Nest mortality was much higher in a year with relatively low snow goose nest density, suggesting a short-term positive indirect effect of this colonial nesting bird on species nesting on islets. Since the arctic fox was virtually the sole predator of artificial nests, our findings indicate that annual variation in nest survival on islets were driven by a shift in fox foraging behavior in response to changes in prey availability across the landscape.

To benchmark accuracy, we simulated genomes under recent population divergence and compared PPSBM estimates with those from the widely used Leiden community-detection algorithm. The PPSBM correctly assigned 81.0% of individuals on average versus 67.0% for Leiden, outperforming Leiden in 92.0% of replicates. Posterior probabilities from the PPSBM reflected patterns of recent shared ancestry or admixture, whereas Leiden tended to merge such clusters or assign individuals deterministically.

Our results demonstrate that a probabilistic, IBD-based PPSBM yields more accurate and biologically interpretable population assignments than popular heuristic methods, while simultaneously quantifying uncertainty and accommodating admixed genomes.

J.", "abstract": "Allosteric effects are widespread in proteins, but predicting the impact of sequence substitutions at positions distant from ligand-binding or enzyme active sites remains challenging, as their effects are mediated through complex dynamical networks. Pinpointing such positions experimentally is labour-intensive and low throughput. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful: analysis methods can identify functional distal sites and networks, while free energy simulations can predict effects on stability or binding, given sufficient sampling; such simulations are typically time-consuming, requiring extensive simulation of each individual mutant. Here, we introduce a dynamical-nonequilibrium MD (D-NEMD) protocol using alanine substitutions as targeted perturbations to identify distal positions that influence enzyme function. Using the well characterised class A {beta}-lactamase KPC-2 as a test system, we show that D-NEMD distinguishes functional from non-functional sites based on whether substitutions generate structured, long-range responses that reach the active site. KPC-2 is clinically important due to its broad substrate spectrum and the emergence of resistance-associated point mutations, many of which act through non-local effects on catalytic residues. Alanine substitutions at positions 179 and 164, which disrupt the {Omega}-loop salt bridge, trigger persistent structural responses propagating through the protein and reach both catalytic residues and the oxyanion-hole backbone. Likewise, alanine substitution at position 220 elicits pronounced responses extending to the active-site {beta}-sheet and key loops, consistent with its known role in substrate specificity. In contrast, substitution at position 276-mutations of which have negligible kinetic impact-produces only local displacements with minimal propagation and no effect on catalytically relevant regions. These differential response patterns align with experimentally observed resistance phenotypes. D-NEMD therefore provides a fast, generalisable, and predictive approach for identifying allosterically connected distal positions.

ClpK is a caseinolytic ATPase that plays an important role in protein quality control and thermotolerance, making it a promising drug target. This study used in silico methods including ADMET screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate binding efficiency and dynamic stability of selected natural and synthetic compounds with ClpK under varying ionic conditions. ADMET screening of synthetic and natural compounds excluded compounds violating Lipinskis rule of 5 or showing predicted toxicity. Sclerotiamide P was identified as the top binder (-10.9 kcal/mol), while compound D3 had the weakest binding (-4.5 kcal/mol). The top ten compounds with the most favourable binding scores were then further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of NaCl and MgCl2. Trajectory and MM-GBSA binding analyses confirmed that ClpK-ligand complexes remained stable in both ionic environments, with negative binding free energy values indicative of favourable interactions. Overall, the study highlighted ADEP3 and sclerotiamide derivatives as promising ClpK inhibitors and provides a foundation for further experimental validation.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

However, the experimental elucidation of these interactions is complicated by the complexity and dynamic nature of protein interaction networks. In silico methods have become invaluable allowing researchers to identify potential interactions and focus on those that may be biologically significant to guide experimental validation and drug discovery. This study employed computational modelling, visualization, and network analysis to investigate the interactions of ClpK, a Clp ATPase integral to protein homeostasis and thermotolerance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Potential interacting partners of ClpK were predicted using the STRING database with ClpB used as a structural proxy for ClpK. The proteins with edge confidence scores greater than 0.8 were selected for molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to assess interaction stability and binding affinities. Molecular docking using the ClusPro server confirmed stable interactions between ClpK and its predicted partners, which were further characterised using PDBsum and Hawkdock to visualise binding interfaces and estimate binding free energies MM-GBSA calculation. Among the predicted complexes, KPN_01323 had the highest interaction score, highlighting it as the most promising candidate for further investigation. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stabilisation of putative partners upon interaction with ClpK supporting the robustness of this interaction. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the ClpK interaction network and establish a framework for future in vitro and in vivo studies contributing to elucidate the biological role and therapeutic potential of ClpK.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

It serves as a critical post-translational modification that rapidly synthesized in response to DNA damage, and participates in diverse important cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and RNA biogenesis, often by promoting biomolecular phase separation. However, PAR's conformational heterogeneity coupled with limited experimental characterization has hindered a mechanistic understanding of these processes. To address this challenge, we develop a five-bead coarse-grained model of PAR and perform molecular dynamics simulations to compare its conformational ensemble and ion atmosphere with those of RNA across diverse ion environments. Our simulations reveal that PAR undergoes a markedly stronger structural transition than RNA in response to divalent ions, driven by its preferential ion binding and effective ion-mediated bridging between phosphate groups. These interactions facilitate cooperative conformational changes and produce a compact, ion-rich atmosphere that is fundamentally distinct from RNA. Together, our work provides a physically grounded model for PAR, uncovers molecular features that differentiate PAR from RNA, and offers mechanistic insight into how PAR nucleates phase separation and organizes protein interactions at sites of DNA damage.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that spastin assembles tubulin into stacked-ring intermediates via strategically positioned microtubule-binding domains, thereby generating nucleation-competent sites for polymerization. Tubulin subunits within these spastin-induced rings adopt a straight, microtubule-like interface, in marked contrast to the twisted tubulin spirals characteristic of depolymerizing microtubule ends. Our results redefine the mechanistic landscape of multifaceted spastin functions and provide insights that may inform the pathological basis of HSP and guide future therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon was thought to arise from wave collisions triggering synchronized reversals of cell motility. However, using three-dimensional microscopy, we find no evidence for such synchronization during rippling. Instead, we show that ripples are surface waves with a period of ~20 min, wavelength of ~100  m and an amplitude of 6 to 20 cell widths at the top of a thick film of cells, akin to surface waves seen in fluids. We propose a physical model of rippling as surface waves of an active nematic liquid crystal. Two key predictions of this model are verified experimentally: the rippling wavelength increases with the surface tension at the film-air interface, and it decreases with substrate stiffness, which regulates the availability of water coating the bacterial film. These findings reveal the physical basis of rippling and highlight the role of active surface waves in shaping collective biological behavior.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

The small molecule Procaspase-Activating Compound 1 (PAC-1) entered oncology testing as a proposed activator of caspase-driven apoptosis. Here, we show that PAC-1-driven cytotoxicity occurs in the absence of executioner caspase expression, demonstrating that its anti-cancer activity occurs via an alternative mechanism. We provide genetic, biochemical, and biophysical evidence demonstrating that PAC-1 functions as a highly selective iron chelator that eliminates cancer cells by disrupting iron homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we discovered that expression of the key chemotherapy-resistance pump MDR1 confers marked hypersensitivity to PAC-1 treatment. While PAC-1 is only weakly effluxed by MDR1 under basal conditions, this process is potentiated when PAC-1 is bound to iron. Consequently, PAC-1 induces progressive iron depletion and selective cytotoxicity in otherwise drug-resistant MDR1-expressing cancer cells.

In this study, we employed a diet-induced mouse model of MASH using fructose-palmitate-cholesterol (FPC) feeding and evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Resmetirom. Resmetirom (5 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly improved systemic and hepatic lipid profiles. Histological analyses demonstrated marked attenuation of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, accompanied by reduced hepatic cell death. Transcriptomic profiling of liver tissues further revealed a robust Resmetirom-induced reprogramming of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, with prominent downregulation of gene networks governing lipid accumulation, immune activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and multiple forms of programmed cell death. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the multifaceted actions of Resmetirom and establish a comprehensive preclinical framework for understanding how THR-{beta} activation ameliorates key pathological hallmarks of MASH.

Their NS5 protein is central in viral replication, functioning both as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a methyltransferase, while also modulating cellular processes, including the interferon response. Although viral replication is cytoplasmic, the NS5 protein of several mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses cycles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected human cells. However, the nuclear localization and function of NS5 of tick-borne orthoflaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), remained poorly understood. Microscopy analysis and cell fractionation revealed that the NS5 protein of TBEV localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of infected cells. Mutagenesis studies identified critical residues required for its nuclear targeting. Mutating these residues in a TBEV replicon abolished viral replication. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analyses performed in two human cell lines infected with TBEV recovered 352 NS5 partners. Among them, 187 were nuclear or partially nuclear. By integrating our interactome data with that of Powassan virus (POWV), another tick-borne orthoflavivirus, we refined a list of 20 high-confidence NS5 partners, including splicing factors and chromatin modulators. Functional analysis revealed that seven of these nuclear partners significantly modulated viral replication, further underscoring the importance of nuclear NS5 in the viral life cycle.

Vesicular Monoamine Transporters (VMATs), key determinants of quantal content and synaptic tone, have traditionally been thought to function primarily through their full-length canonical isoforms. However, alternative splicing generates isoforms that remain largely uncharacterized in membrane transporter biology, despite growing proteogenomic evidence supporting their translation. Here, we reveal a potential mechanism by which a truncated splice isoforms of VMAT1 interferes with canonical oligomer formation. Using a combination of structural docking, atomistic lipid bilayer molecular dynamics, and Poisson-Boltzmann Surface-Area (MMPBSA) binding energy decomposition, we characterize the interactions and co-evolution between the truncated isoform and the canonical protein. While the isoform retains partial interface compatibility, it exhibits higher binding affinity for the canonical VMAT than the canonical homodimer itself. Mechanistically, this molecular latch shifts the rules of engagement from a contest of size (surface area) to one of intensity (charge), effectively resolving the David-versus-Goliath conflict: the system energetically favors the heterodimer, ensuring that the smaller isoform consistently dominates over the full-length protein. Functionally, this positions the truncated isoform as a negative regulator of VMAT oligomerization. These findings redefine VMAT assembly as a splicing-sensitive checkpoint and provide a novel mechanistic framework for understanding synaptic dysfunction in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Although an increasing number of models have shifted from relying solely on clinical variables to integrating multi-omics data, there remains insufficient exploitation and integrative utilization of gene regulatory network (GRN) structures and cancer subtype information, which limits the predictive accuracy and biological interpretability of multi-omics models. Therefore, this study proposes label-aware and graph-guided multi-omics collaborative learning framework, termed LaCONIC, to achieve accurate and interpretable cancer survival prediction. To obtain biologically meaningful regulatory features of different molecular types, we first construct a gene regulatory network comprising multiple molecular entities and their relations, and design a heterogeneous graph self-supervised pre-training module to obtain unified graph-based gene representations. To fully leverage multi-omics and multi-modal information, we develop an adaptive cross-omics representation learning module that performs intra-omics modality alignment (i.e., graph and expression modals) and inter-omics representation alignment, thereby achieving synergistic integration of multi-source information. Moreover, to comprehensively capture global cross-omics molecular interactions, we present a graph-guided cross-omics interactive learning module that explicitly encodes gene regulatory network priors within a Transformer-based architecture. Finally, we introduce cancer subtype information to construct a label-aware constraint mechanism that improves predictive performance while enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency of the learned representations. Experiments on multiple cancer datasets show that LaCONIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various metrics. SHAP-based interpretability analysis on breast cancer further identifies survival-associated regulatory modules and high-risk molecules (e.g., hsa-miR-148a-3p, ARMC1, TMEM242), highlighting its potential for biological mechanism elucidation and prognostic assessment.

D.; Deepa, S.", "abstract": "Background and Aims Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in obesity. Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain Like (MLKL), the effector of proinflammatory cell death pathway necroptosis, is consistently elevated in human and experimental MASLD, yet the hepatocyte-specific role of MLKL in the neoplastic progression of MASLD to HCC in obesity is unknown. Approach and Results We used a long-term WD-induced, MASLD-driven HCC model in which mice develop liver cancer at ages comparable to human HCC onset. Hepatocyte-specific MLKL knockout (MlklHepKO) mice were generated to define MLKL's liver-intrinsic function. WD robustly induced hepatic MLKL, whereas necroptosis markers were undetectable. MLKL loss did not alter WD-induced inflammation, fibrosis, or liver injury but markedly increased lipid droplet accumulation. Strikingly, MlklHepKO mice developed significantly fewer and smaller tumors with reduced stemness markers (DCLK1, OCT4). Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways in WD-fed MlklHepKO livers. WD suppressed the mitochondrial fusion protein and tumor suppressor Mfn2, while MLKL deficiency restored its expression. In HepG2 cells, MLKL knockdown or inhibition reduced proliferation and clonogenicity and enhanced oxidative metabolism. Human HCC datasets and tissue microarrays showed elevated MLKL in tumors and its association with poor survival. Conclusions Hepatocyte MLKL drives MASLD-driven HCC progression by an intrinsic, non-necroptotic mechanism. The mechanism involves MLKL-mediated suppression of the Mfn2 tumor suppressor protein, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and increase in both tumor cell proliferation and tumor stemness. All together these data position MLKL as a novel, druggable target in MASLD-associated HCC.", "date": "2025-11-30", "journal": ""}

Glutamate and dopamine are dominant excitatory drivers that activate most neurons in the ANC cortex, with a substantial overlapping populations and smaller transmitter-specific subsets. Glutamate continues to excite additional neurons at higher concentration, whereas dopamine responses saturate. Serotonin alone evokes mixed responses but, when applied first, consistently reduces glutamate- and dopamine-driven activation, revealing a state-dependent modulatory role. GABA and octopamine yield weak heterologous effects, and high-dose acetylcholine sharply suppresses global ANC neuronal activity while inducing muscular contraction, consistent with inhibitory cholinergic receptors in arm ganglia.
