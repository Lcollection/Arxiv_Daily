Lineage 1 (L1) is associated with low virulence, while Lineage 2 (L2) is linked to hyper-virulence, increased transmission, and drug resistance. We performed multi-layer comparative analyses integrating whole-genome sequencing with quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of a panel of L1 and L2 clinical strains, each grown under two in vitro conditions. Our data revealed variable correlations between transcript and protein levels across strains and gene categories, indicating lineage-specific post-translational regulation. Transcriptional and translational differences scaled with phylogenetic distance, with one in three SNPs on average leading to gene expression changes. A newly developed genome-scale transcriptional regulatory model identified master transcription factors - closely linked to the sigma factor network - whose targets were differentially expressed between L1 and L2. Notably, DosR proteins showed higher basal levels and a stronger nitric oxide (NO) response in L2. Time-course validation using an Rv1985c induction and wild-type H37Rv under hypoxia and reaeration confirmed the role of Rv1985c in the differentially expressed genes between L1 and L2. These findings suggest that limited genetic variation can translate into significant phenotypic differences via differential regulation of key transcriptional networks.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Zhao, W.; Rutherford, J. T.; Olaitan, A. O.; Hurdle, J.", "abstract": "Ferrous iron is the dominant form of iron in the oxygen-limited large intestine, the site for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). We investigated the extent to which C. difficile requires the ferrous iron transporter 1 (FeoB1), a main permease for iron acquisition, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Construction of feoB1 deletion mutant in C. difficile R20291 (i.e., R20291{Delta}feoB1) decreased intracellular iron content by ~25%. This was accompanied by downregulation of tcdA and tcdB genes and reduced synthesis of TcdA and TcdB toxins, which was reflected by a ~1000-fold reduction in cytopathy against Vero cells. Complementation with WT feoB1 restored toxin production. Transcriptional and biochemical analyses revealed {Delta}feoB1 altered metabolic pathways that negatively impact toxin production, including downregulation of the oxidative branch of the Kreb cycle and an associated cellular accumulation of pyruvate. Hence FeoB1 influences multiple bioenergetic and redox pathways, which in turn inhibits toxin biosynthesis. R20291{Delta}feoB1 was avirulent in mice with underlying colitis. In this model, mice are prone to develop severe CDI, but mice infected with the mutant lacked diarrheal symptoms, had lesser inflammatory responses, bacterial bioburdens and cecal toxin titers. These results strongly imply that ferrous iron acquisition and homeostasis is central to toxin metabolism and virulence. Hence targeting FeoB1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to impede the colonization and pathogenesis of C. difficile, even in the setting of colitis where intestinal bleeding may occur and CDI is more severe.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

To address this, it is essential to elucidate how coordinated activity emerges during development. However, tracking the functional maturation of neuronal populations over time remains challenging, as it requires long-term, non-invasive monitoring of membrane potential dynamics. Here, we developed a voltage imaging approach for zebrafish embryos using genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), enabling fast, direct and cell-type-specific measurements of membrane potentials from defined neuronal populations in a non-invasive manner. Using this approach, we detected coordinated voltage changes in spinal motor neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution. Depolarization and hyperpolarization events were observed at the population, single-cell, and subcellular levels. Notably, long-term voltage imaging revealed the early emergence and progressive maturation of membrane potential dynamics, characterized by increased firing rate, coupling strength and axonal outgrowth. This optical approach constitutes a significant advancement in the study of neural development, providing a powerful tool for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal populations in vivo.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

We systematically analyzed ~17,000 transcriptomes from 35 human tissues to quantitatively evaluate the individual and combined contributions of sex and age to transcriptomic variations. We discovered extensive sex-dimorphisms during aging with distinct patterns of change in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). Intriguingly, the male-biased age-associated AS events have a stronger association with Alzheimer's disease, and the female-biased events are often regulated by several sex-biased splicing factors that may be controlled by estrogen receptors. Breakpoint analysis showed that sex-dimorphic aging rates are significantly associated with decline of sex hormones, with males having a larger and earlier transcriptome change. Collectively, this study uncovered an essential role of sex during aging at the molecular and multi-tissue levels, providing insight into sex-dimorphic regulatory patterns.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Histone modifications in globular domain have regulatory potential because of their impact on nucleosome stability but remain poorly characterized. In this study we report the genome-wide distribution of acetylated H3 lysine 115 (H3K115ac), a residue on the lateral surface at the nucleosome dyad. In mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that H3K115ac is enriched at the transcription start site of active CpG island promoters, but also at polycomb repressed promoters prior to their subsequent activation during differentiation. By contrast, at enhancers H3K115ac is dynamic, changing in line with gene activation and chromatin accessibility during differentiation. Most strikingly, we show that H3K115ac is enriched on fragile nucleosomes within nucleosome depleted regions at promoters, and active enhancers where it coincides with transcription factor binding, and at CTCF bound sites. These unique features suggest that H3K115ac could contribute to nucleosome destabilization and that it might be a valuable marker for identifying functionally important regulatory elements in mammalian genomes.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Through detailed analysis of low-frequency rumble vocalizations of wild male African elephants, we demonstrate how these calls are employed in a coordinated manner. Our findings reveal a distinct pattern of call-and-response, usually initiated by a dominant male, with subsequent turn-taking responses from other group members. This antiphonal calling is instrumental in facilitating collective decision-making and group departures, highlighting a sophisticated level of communication previously unrecognized in male elephant groups. Furthermore, the study delves into the frequency content of these rumbles, finding significant individual variations in vocal characteristics. Analysis of the first two formant frequencies of these calls uncovers a distinct vocal space for each elephant, variable over time and across different social contexts. These individualized vocal spaces suggest a mechanism for personal identification within and across elephant groups, and may also relate to the information content of their vocal exchanges.

E.", "abstract": "Various mathematical models have been formulated to describe the changes in synaptic strengths resulting from spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). A subset of these models include a third factor, dopamine, which interacts with spike timing to contribute to plasticity at specific synapses, notably those from cortex to striatum at the input layer of the basal ganglia. Theoretical work to analyze these plasticity models has largely focused on abstract issues, such as the conditions under which they may promote synchronization and the weight distributions induced by inputs with simple correlation structures, rather than on scenarios associated with specific tasks, and has generally not considered dopamine-dependent forms of STDP. In this paper we introduce forms of dopamine-modulated STDP adapted from previously proposed plasticity rules. We then analyze, mathematically and with simulations, their performance in two biologically relevant scenarios. We test the ability of each of the three models to complete simple value estimation and action selection tasks, studying the learned weight distributions and corresponding task performance in each setting. Interestingly, we find that each plasticity rule is well suited to a subset of the scenarios studied but falls short in others. Different tasks may therefore require different forms of synaptic plasticity, yielding the prediction that the precise form of the STDP mechanism present may vary across regions of the striatum, and other brain areas impacted by dopamine, that are involved in distinct computational functions.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

The gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) encodes florigen, a mobile signal produced in leaves that initiates flowering at the shoot apical meristem. In response to seasonal changes, FT is induced in phloem companion cells located in distal leaf regions. Thus far, a detailed molecular characterization of the FT-expressing cells has been lacking. Here, we used bulk nuclei RNA-seq and single nuclei RNA (snRNA)-seq to investigate gene expression in FT-expressing cells and other phloem companion cells. Our bulk nuclei RNA-seq demonstrated that FT-expressing cells in cotyledons and in true leaves differed transcriptionally. Within the true leaves, our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that companion cells with high FT expression form a unique cluster in which many genes involved in ATP biosynthesis are highly upregulated. The cluster also expresses other genes encoding small proteins, including the flowering and stem growth inducer FPF1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (FLP1) and the anti-florigen BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT). In addition, we found that the promoters of FT and the genes co-expressed with FT in the cluster were enriched for the consensus binding motifs of NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1). Overexpression of the paralogous NIGT1.2 and NIGT1.4 repressed FT expression and significantly delayed flowering under nitrogen-rich conditions, consistent with NIGT1s acting as nitrogen-dependent FT repressors.

Previous studies on decapping activators Edc3 and Scd6 suggested their limited roles in mRNA decay. RNA-seq analysis of mutants lacking one or both proteins revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely redundant activities in targeting numerous mRNAs for degradation that are masked in the single mutants. These transcripts also are frequently targeted by decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1, and the collective evidence suggests that Scd6/Edc3 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2. Ribosome profiling shows that redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and their functional interactions with Dhh1 and Pat1 extend to translational repression of particular transcripts, including a cohort of poorly translated mRNAs displaying interdependent regulation by all four factors. Scd6/Edc3 also participate with Dhh1/Pat1 in post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for respiration and catabolism of alternative carbon sources, which are normally expressed only in limiting glucose. Simultaneously eliminating Scd6/Edc3 increases mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles typically observed only during growth in low glucose.

Although ROS levels rise during cell cycle progression, overall oxidation of the proteome remains constant with dynamic S-sulfenylation restricted to a subset of cysteines. Among these, we identify a critical redox-sensitive cysteine residue (C41) in the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21. C41 oxidation regulates the interaction of p21 with CDK2 and CDK4, controlling a double-negative feedback loop that determines p21 stability.

We systematically recovered all cecal contents and any watery (possibly diarrheal) intestinal contents. We isolated C. difficile strains, determined their toxin gene profile by PCR and established their PCR-ribotype according to the WEBRIBO database. We also performed free toxin detection. Twenty-seven Equidae were positive for C. difficile and twenty had a toxigenic strain, including one animal also colonized by a non-toxigenic strain. Toxigenic isolates belonged to eight common ribotypes: i) 078 and 126 (able to produce toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin), ii) 005, 012, 020, 181 and AI-53 (toxins A and B), and iii) 017 (toxin B). Non-toxigenic isolates were of ribotypes 009, 035 and 439. Ribotypes 017 and 009 were predominant (n=5). In two cases, Equidae of the same premises shared the same ribotype, either 020 or 009.

Unlike other hematopoietic cells, megakaryocytes do not enter the blood circulation intact. They remain anchored within the bone marrow while extending cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets through the sinusoidal endothelial barrier. These proplatelets subsequently fragment into functional platelets. This unique process of intravasation facilitates efficient platelet production while maintaining the megakaryocyte cell body within the bone marrow niche, thus preventing potential thrombotic complications. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the delicate balance between megakaryocyte retention and proplatelet extension remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the spatial organization and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. Our findings reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) ECM cages encompassing megakaryocytes and anchor them to the sinusoidal basement membrane. Gene deletion shows the existence of laminin 4 in the ECM cage that is necessary to maintain megakaryocyte-sinusoid interactions. Notably, megakaryocytes actively contribute to the ECM cage assembly; {beta}1/{beta}3 integrin knockout weakens these structures, increasing intravasation and entire megakaryocyte entry into circulation. The retention of megakaryocytes by these 3D ECM cages depends on dynamic remodeling processes. Inhibition of ECM proteolysis results in denser cage formation, increasing the frequence of immature megakaryocytes with impaired demarcation membrane system (DMS) development. Thus, the ECM cage represents a novel concept of an active and dynamic 3D microenvironment that is continuously remodeled and essential for maintaining megakaryocyte perivascular positioning. This specific microarchitecture guides megakaryocyte maturation and intravasation, underscoring the critical role of ECM microarchitecture and dynamics in megakaryocyte function.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Lady beetles are predators of small insects, but not bees, and also visit flowers to consume floral nectar to increase their reproductive output. Using laboratory-maintained bumble bees freely flying in arenas, we tested if bees could (1) innately recognize lady beetles as sources of social information about nectar, and (2) learn to use lady beetles to gauge nectar availability. Bees did not innately recognize lady beetles as a source of social information. They correctly learned to associate conspecifics with the presence and absence of food, but only learned to associate lady beetles with the presence of food and not the absence.

Here, we use the Drosophila ovary as a model to study the role of cytonemes in BMP signalling-directed germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and dedifferentiation of germ cells to GSCs. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarised towards the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signalling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme-niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localised to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalisation reduces the frequency, length and directionality of cytonemes. During homeostasis, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalisation impairs GSC fitness by reducing GSC BMP signalling and niche occupancy. Disrupting cytonemes by targeting Ena during dedifferentiation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate.

Culex pipiens s.s./Culex torrentium are the primary vectors of Usutu virus and West Nile virus in Europe and are found in and around human settlements. The prediction of spatial-temporal abundance allows for the early assessment of arbovirus transmission risk and the planning of effective intervention methods, such as vector control. Therefore, a process-based model was developed to predict the spatial-temporal occurrence of Culex pipiens s.s./Culex torrentium in Germany with a particular focus on depicting realistic overwintering behaviour, e.g. diapause induced through photoperiod and temperature in the larval stage. The model output is driven by local temperature and rainfall data. Evaluated with field data from 116 sampling sites in Germany, the model accurately identified the peak in abundance, with a mean absolute offset of 0 days between the simulated and observed peak, and offsets of 8 and 1 days for the start and end of the mosquito season, respectively.

However, 3-24% of women report bonding problems (BP), often accompanied by constraints for the mother-infant relationship, but not always depression with consequences for child development. Our present study investigates the neural and behavioral patterns that underlie the processing of emotional infant stimuli over the 1st year postpartum parallel to a neurofeedback intervention. Mothers with and without BP (N = 45) completed a newly developed Emotional Infant GoNoGo Task while fMRI scanning at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Our results show that response inhibition towards emotional infant faces elicits stronger results than towards adult faces in all mothers. While behavioral performance in BP is impaired, the neural responses to emotional infant faces as compared to neutral faces are increased at 3 months postpartum in limbic structures such as the anterior cingulate and insula, as well as nucleus caudatus. At 6 and 12 months behavioral reactions assimilate in BP to those of healthy controls, while differences in neural reactions between BP and healthy controls increase at 6 months and decrease again at 12 months. These effects are independent of depressive symptoms. Our findings point to an experience-based adaptive process of emotion processing and responses to infants' affect during the first year postpartum as a specific characteristic of clinical BP. Implications are for potential therapeutic interventions to target emotion processing and regulation.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

G.; Mora, A. R.; Vallat, A.; Koella, J. C.", "abstract": "Immune responses protect against infectious diseases but often incur physiological costs, such as oxidative stress. In mosquitoes, these costs may shape behaviours that help regulate oxidative balance, potentially including the consumption of nectar containing bioactive substances like prooxidants and antioxidants. We investigated whether Anopheles gambiae adjust their preferences for diets with such substances when they are infected with the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis. Using sugar solutions supplemented with hydrogen peroxide (a prooxidant) or ascorbic acid (an antioxidant), we assessed the feeding preferences of uninfected and infected mosquitoes at different ages and measured the effects of these diets on oxidative homeostasis, parasite load, and lifespan. Infected mosquitoes initially preferred the prooxidant diet, which reduced parasite load and extended lifespan, before shifting their preference towards the antioxidant diet as infection progressed. In contrast, uninfected mosquitoes consistently preferred the unsupplemented sugar, likely to avoid oxidative stress induced by the supplemented diets, which, surprisingly, also increased their lifespan. These results suggest a form of self-medication, despite benefits in uninfected individuals, where mosquitoes dynamically adjust their dietary choices throughout infection. We propose that such dietary strategies may be widespread among mosquitoes, helping them manage oxidative stress, with potential implications for vector-pathogen interactions and the success of biological control programmes.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Single cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNAseq) has provided unprecedented opportunities to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie AD at the cellular level. In this study, we address the problem of sample-level classification of AD using scRNAseq data, where we predict the disease status of entire samples from the gene expression profiles of their cells, which are not necessarily all affected by the disease. We introduce scAGG, a sample-level classification model which uses a sample-level pooling mechanism to aggregate single-cell embeddings, and show that it can accurately classify AD individuals and healthy controls. We then investigate the latent space learnt by the model and find that the model learns an ordering of the cells corresponding to disease severity. Genes associated with this ordering are enriched in AD-linked pathways, including cytokine signalling, apoptosis, and metal ion response. We also evaluate two attention-based models that perform on par with scAGG, but entropy analysis of their attention scores reveals limited interpretability value. As scRNAseq is increasingly applied to large cohorts, our approach provides a way to link individual phenotypes to single-cell measurements. Our cell- and sample-level severity scores may enable identification of AD-associated cell subtypes, paving the way for targeted drug development and personalized treatment strategies in AD.

The river-dwelling morphs of the species are distributed in Mexico and Texas, while the blind and cave-adapted morphs inhabit the karstic caves of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. Although the molecular, cellular and genetic underpinnings of Astyanax cavefish evolution are being elucidated, our understanding of its habitat and environment remains limited, thereby constraining the interpretations of its morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. In particular, the physico-chemical parameters of the water and the hydrological regimes to which cavefish are subjected remain largely unexplored. From 2009 to 2024, we have recorded the physico-chemical parameters of the water in which Astyanax mexicanus cavefish and surface fish are found in the El Abra and La Colmena regions of the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas, Mexico. Data were collected using a variety of devices and probes, including both point and longitudinal measurements of water quality. A total of 13 caves out of the 33 known Astyanax caves and 27 surface stations (rivers, springs, ponds) were sampled. The comparison of epigean and hypogean waters showed strong signatures of the two macro-habitats. As compared to surface, cave water was fresher, much less conductive and highly anoxic. Moreover, at the meso-habitat level, a comparison between caves revealed significant differences in both specific water parameters and hydrological regimes. One- or two-year longitudinal recordings demonstrated that some caves exhibited relatively stable hydrological regimes, while others experienced multiple, sudden and significant fluctuations. Finally, distinct pools within a single cave showed notable differences, displaying a highly reproducible increase in water temperature as a function of depth or distance from the cave entrance, and revealing specificities at the micro-habitat level. Our comprehensive dataset on cave water quality and hydrodynamics is interpreted in the context of an integrated view of cave biology and the evolution of cave organisms. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of cavefishes and the biology of the species in general.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Mice (n = 5+) were provided ad libitum access to water containing antibiotics (1 g/L neomycin, 1 g/L ampicillin, or 1 g/L ampicillin with 0.5 g/L neomycin) or control water from 5- to 16-weeks old, corresponding in skeletal development to ~10 to ~25 years in humans. At humane euthanasia, we collected cecum contents for 16S metagenomics and blood for serum cytokine quantification for comparison to control and among antibiotic groups. We used dimensional reduction techniques, multiomic integration, and correlation to discriminate antibiotic groups and identify specific relationships between high-abundance taxa and serum cytokines. Antibiotic treatment significantly lowered diversity, altered phylum relative abundance, and resulted in significant association with specific taxa. Dimensional reduction techniques and multiomic integration revealed distinct antibiotic-associated clusters based on genera relative abundance and cytokine serum concentration. Cytokines IL-6, MIP-1B, and IL-10 significantly contributed to antibiotic discrimination, significantly different among antibiotic treatments, and had significant correlations with specific taxa.

Here we use analytical theory and simulations to reveal the mechanism of these transitions. At low [Cion], the ionic solution acts as a highly correlated medium conferring long-range effective attractive interactions between spatially distant monomers. In this regime the ion concentration inside the condensate is higher than in the bulk solution. As [Cion] increases, the correlation length in the ionic plasma decreases, and the condensate dissolves. Second LLPS at high [Cion] is due to the entropy-driven crowding, and ion concentration inside the condensate is lower than in the bulk.

Thus, the rate of skill acquisition can predict how long juveniles remain with their parents before emigrating from the natal territory. Yet in some systems, young animals acquire adult-like skills and the capacity to be independent long before they emigrate. This raises the question of why the timing of emigration decouples from the rate of skill acquisition, resulting in extended parental care. We addressed this by leveraging GPS tracking data from juvenile golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), which learn to fly and to hunt while remaining with their parents for 61-283 days after fledging. Young golden eagles often go on excursions without their parents outside of their natal territories before emigration. We expected flight performance to predict the timing of excursions better than the timing of emigration, which should be more influenced by external factors. In a set of time-to-event models, we predicted the rate of excursions and of emigration using metrics of soaring flight performance or of daily movement. Contrary to our prediction, we found that soaring performance failed to predict the rate of either excursions or emigration, whereas daily movement predicted both rates, but inconsistently. This was likely because those coarser metrics captured motivation and weather in addition to flight skills. Thus external factors seem more likely to explain the timing of independence and internal development---in this case of flight skills---may be completed quickly. Juveniles may delay emigration not due to lack of skill, but because the costs of leaving parental care outweigh the benefits. The difference we discovered between when individuals were capable of independence and when they committed to it may obscure the more general link between skill acquisition and the end of parental care in other systems as well.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Applying our model, JODIE, to 30,000 child-mother-father trios with phased DNA information from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and the Norwegian Mother, Father, Child Cohort (MoBa), we jointly estimate the phenotypic variance attributable to these four effects unbiased of assortative mating (AM) for height, body mass index (BMI) and childhood educational test score (EA). For all three traits, direct effects make the largest contribu- tion to the genetic effect variance.

We calculate the heritability that would be obtained at the population- level in the absence of AM for common DNA loci, and show that the proportional contribution of direct effects to these heritability values can be calculated as 64.0% for EA in MoBa, 77.1% and 63.4% for height in MoBa and EstBB, and 81.2% and 88.0% for BMI in MoBa and EstBB.

This study aims to investigate the role of netrin-1 and its dependence receptor UNC5B in regulating CSC self-renewal in mCRC and explore their potential as therapeutic targets. Methods: We used patient-derived liver metastasis organoids (PDOs) to examine the effects of netrin-1 on CSC self-renewal. The role of UNC5B was evaluated by silencing its expression using CRISPR and assessing the impact on CSC apoptosis in response to an anti-netrin-1 blocking antibody (NP137) using extreme limiting dilution assays (ELDAs). Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to explore the molecular mechanisms behind netrin-1/UNC5B regulation of CSC fate. Clinical data from a patient with mCRC were used to validate the findings. Results: Netrin-1 promoted CSC self-renewal by inhibiting apoptosis, a process reversed by NP137. UNC5B was identified as the primary receptor mediating this effect, as its silencing eliminated Netrin-1- induced self-renewal. Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), secreted by UNC5B-expressing cells, plays a key role in netrin-1-induced CSC self-renewal. Clinical trial data from a patient with mCRC showed a reduction in TFF3 and stemness genes expression after treatment with NP137. Furthermore, combining NP137 with FOLFOX chemotherapy enhanced cell death and inhibited tumor growth in PDO xenograft models. Conclusion: This study identifies the netrin-1/UNC5B/TFF3 axis as a critical regulator of CSC self-renewal in mCRC and suggests that targeting this pathway with NP137, in combination with chemotherapy, could provide a promising therapeutic approach for mCRC patients.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Understanding these processes requires observations in living cells. Given the heterogeneity and lack of synchronization of such events demands for single-molecule experiments that can resolve distinct sub-populations. Here, we combine single-molecule FRET microscopy and single-particle tracking to track the ligand-induced dimerization and activation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase in the plasma membrane of living cells. First, using fluorophore-labeled variants of the MET ligand internalin B (InlB), we determined the lifetime of a ligand-activated dimeric (MET:InlB)2 receptor complex to around 1 second. Next, we determined the diffusion coefficient from monomeric and dimeric MET:InlB complexes from single-molecule FRET trajectories and found an about 1.6-fold slower diffusion of the dimeric receptor as compared to the monomeric receptor, accompanied by spatially restricted motion. The combination of single-molecule FRET and single-particle tracking delivers essential biophysical parameters of membrane receptor activation in living cells.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Multiple recent proteomic biomarker studies have identified latent transforming growth factor binding protein-2 (LTBP2) as a circulating factor associated with disease progression in fibrotic lung diseases in humans (including IPF), but its role in the development of fibrosis is incompletely defined. LTBP2 competes with the large latent TGF{beta} complex (LLC) for binding to the N-terminus of fibrillin, and we hypothesized that LTBP2 deficiency would promote LLC sequestration in matrix and reduce TGF-beta signaling. We recently reported an LTBP2 knockout (Ltbp2-/-) mouse with no baseline lung abnormalities. Here we show that Ltbp2-/- mice exposed to either bleomycin or silica have a significant reduction in fibrosis compared to wild type controls. Consistent with reduced fibrosis, Ltbp2-/- mice have reduced TGF{beta} signaling and cultured primary fibroblasts from Ltbp2-/- lungs exhibited impaired migration in an in vitro wound closure assay. Transcriptomic analysis of bleomycin treated control and Ltbp2-/- mice identified multiple LTBP2-regulated genes, including the lncRNA antisense of IGFR2 non-coding RNA (Airn), which is upregulated in Ltbp2-/- mice and has reported antifibrotic effects in other tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that Ltbp2-/- mice had impaired epithelial repair after bleomycin treatment, a phenotype that also occurred in a naphthalene model of club cell injury. These findings provide evidence that LTBP2 is profibrotic and facilitates TGF{beta} signaling but is also required for normal airway epithelial repair.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the Baby Connectome Project, the largest longitudinal infant neuroimaging and behavioral dataset available, we characterized white matter maturation across five major pathways (motor, auditory, visual, ventral language, and dorsal language) from birth to 24 months and correlated these trajectories with emerging motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills. We found that dorsal language tracts, initially immature at birth, rapidly matured in parallel with motor tracts, reaching maturity levels comparable to primary sensory tracts by approximately 24 months. Our data suggest two potential mechanisms: (i) Widespread brain-behavior interdependencies, wherein both ventral and dorsal tracts correlated significantly not only with speech but also broadly with other behavioral domains, and advanced speech skills were associated across multiple tracts; and (ii) a nonlinear developmental cascade, in which early gross motor skills promoted subsequent social interactions thus influencing later speech development, meanwhile, early social interactions fostered subsequent fine motor refinement indirectly influencing later speech development. Our data thus portray early brain networks as a malleable, integrative scaffold, coordinating information across motor, auditory, and visual systems into a coherent whole immediately after birth. Collectively, these findings reveal speech acquisition as an emergent property reflecting a fundamental integrative principle of early brain development.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant  mating-type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far unisexual reproduction has never been directly observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans. Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in both chaperoning and activating G proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans. Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, we found that deletion of both GPA2 and GPA3 in the MAT background leads to self-filamentation without sporulation, suggesting that differential modulation of the G proteins, likely involving Ric8, could underlie the switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus. Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and could modulate sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungi and microbial eukaryotes as well.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Among this protein family, the erlin1/2 complex is specifically located on the ER membrane. Previous studies have shown that the erlin1/2 complex plays an essential role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, mediating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of various proteins such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs), which are important calcium ion transporters on the ER membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying erlin-mediated FMMs organization and its role in ERAD remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the erlin1/2 complex under different detergent conditions. Our findings reveal that the erlin1/2 complex forms a 26-mer cage-like structure, composed of alternating erlin1 and erlin2 subunits. The erlin1/2 complex defines a nanodomain on the ER membrane, which could recruit various types of proteins to both the interior and exterior membrane regions of the cage. By caging cargo proteins, the erlin1/2 complex physically secludes them from their binding partners, leading to a potential halt in their function. Moreover, individual cages can further interact with one another, facilitating the organization of FMMs of different sizes on the ER membrane. These dynamic properties may play a general and critical role in various processes occurring on the ER, including viral replication, positioning the erlin1/2 complex as a promising new target for antiviral drug development.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Improved colour learning has been demonstrated with differential conditioning using reward-aversion paradigms in eusocial insects like wasps, bumblebees, and honeybees, where substances that induce strong aversion, such as quinine, enable more accurate learning. Although the associations created during learning are intrinsically linked to the reinforcements used, few studies have compared the role of negative reinforcements in shaping these associations, and their relevance across insect groups with different life histories. In our study, we compared the effects of aversive substances for learning in the hummingbird hawkmoth (Macroglossum stellatarum), a solitary pollinator that relies on vision for foraging. Linking to previous learning studies in insects, we combined a sugar-rewarded target with a distractor that was paired with either quinine, salt, citric acid, water, or was presented with no aversive substance. Learning was assessed by conditioning hawkmoths to invert a strong colour preference between perceptually close or distant colour pairs, to provide tasks with disparate challenges. Contrary to results from eusocial insect species, hawkmoths trained with quinine were worse at switching preferences between similar colours compared to training with citric acid or appetitive-only differential conditioning. Learning success was associated with foraging plasticity, where negative reinforcements were found to suppress exploration during foraging. Furthermore, we show that quinine interfered with sucrose perception, potentially impairing target acquisition during conditioning. Our results provide insights into the impact of negative reinforcements on solitary foragers and highlight the role of sensory ecology and life history in shaping learning outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

On hold-out sets the heads reached macro F1=0.84-0.98 and MCC=0.85-0.98.

The expression of DAM3 and DAM4 as well as plant morphology and physiology were analyzed during a period of endodormancy induction and breaking. Furthermore, to analyze whether there exists a correlation between DAM expression and chill requirement, DAM3 and DAM4 expression was compared between cultivars with different chill requirements. Lastly, the DAM1, DAM2, DAM3, and DAM4 expression of concurrently growing summer and winter leaves was compared at multiple stages of dormancy-breaking. DAM3 and DAM4 expression negatively correlated with leaf area and petiole length. We conclude that DAM3 and DAM4 expression patterns are consistent with that of regulators of endodormancy. DAM4 expression in particular correlates strongly with vegetative growth during endodormancy breaking. DAM3 or DAM4 expression were not found to correlate with the cultivar-specific chill requirements.

Using spatial transcriptomics, high-resolution proteomics, and scRNA-seq on human pulmonary TB lesions, we reveal a striking compartmentalization of immune responses between early pneumonia and mature granulomas. The immunologic composition of granulomas was distinct from the pneumonia; granulomas are enriched for antimicrobial gene expression in both macrophages and T cells and show reduced bacterial antigen burden. In contrast, TREM2-expressing foamy macrophages are the predominant cell type occupying alveolar spaces in TB pneumonia with T cells infrequent. These TREM2 macrophages exhibit a lipid-associated gene program, accumulate lipid droplets, and harbor Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and mRNA corresponding to increased bacterial viability in vitro. We further show that the M. tuberculosis virulence lipids, PDIM and mycolic acids, potently induce and activate TREM2 signaling in TREM2-expressing macrophages, promoting an intracellular environment permissive for bacterial growth. These findings establish TREM2 macrophages as an early niche for M. tuberculosis survival and implicate TB pneumonia as a critical stage in disease transmission.

This study aims to identify a median estimator that is unbiased. To derive the unbiased median estimator, we minimized the sum of residuals raised to a rational power approaching one. We compared the properties of the unbiased and conventional medians using Poisson-distributed datasets. Random samples were generated with the Mersenne Twister algorithm implemented in IgorPro software (WaveMetrics Inc., Oregon). For odd sample sizes, the unbiased median coincides with the conventional median (the middle value). For even sample sizes, the unbiased median is defined as the value that equalizes the product of distances to data points above and below it--a definition that differs from the conventional median in asymmetric distributions. Although both median estimators tend to underestimate the mean of Poisson-distributed data, the unbiased median is consistently closer to the expected value.

Targeted chromocenter disruption in Drosophila testes subjected to natural and artificial mechanical stress compromises nuclear mechanostability, leading to deformed nuclei, DNA damage, and chromosome breaks. Conversely, enhancing chromocenter formation through genetic means improves mechanostability. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that chromocenters enable physically linked chromosomes to respond collectively, rather than individually, to mechanical challenge, and dissipate external forces over a larger nuclear surface.

The spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus combined to the massive use of pyrethroid insecticides to limit arbovirus transmission resulted in the rise of resistance in various continents. Here, we investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying the recent adaptation of this mosquito to deltamethrin in La Reunion island. Bioassays confirmed the presence of resistance alleles in field populations. The resistance phenotype was further enhanced in the laboratory following a few generations of controlled selection. Combining whole genome Pool-seq and RNA-seq revealed no evidence of target-site resistance mutations but the over-expression and variant selection of detoxification enzymes associated with pyrethroid metabolism including cytochrome P450s, transferases and ABC-transporters. Among over-expressed detoxification genes, only one was linked to a gene duplication while polymorphism data suggest most of them being trans-regulated. Genome-wide selection signatures revealed a 9 Mb inverted superlocus responding to insecticide selection whose phenotypical importance remains uncertain. Altogether, this study indicates that the multigenic metabolic resistance phenotype observed in this insular territory mainly results from local adaptation.

Although components of the T cell receptors (TCRs) for these unconventional T cells are invariant, significant variability in the CDR3 regions still exist, opening questions as to how TCR sequence and function may be linked, and how to maximize the therapeutic potential of engineered unconventional T cells. Here, we develop a nanovial-based functional screening platform that enables high-throughput discovery of TCRs from unconventional T cells based on direct antigen recognition and cytokine secretion. By selectively labeling nanovials with MR1 and CD1d molecules displaying their cognate ligands, we achieve dose-dependent capture and activation of MAIT and iNKT cells from complex human PBMC samples comprising tens of millions of cells. Using oligonucleotide barcodes conjugated to nanovials encoding the antigen-presenting molecules and loading cytokine capture antibodies, we perform secretion-encoded single-cell sequencing to link TCR identity, gene expression, antigen specificity, and functional response. Applying this method, we isolate rare reactive T cells, recover their TCRs, and validate five novel MAIT TCRs. All five TCRs, when re-expressed in primary T cells, confer antigen-specific cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. The top two TCRs were evaluated using an in vivo solid tumor model, demonstrating specific tumor homing and efficacy. This function-first strategy offers a powerful tool to uncover functional TCRs from unconventional T cells, yielding a 100% hit rate when secretion-based validation is included as part of the initial screen, unlocking new opportunities for cell-based immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

We then profiled transcriptomic changes in hESCs under self-renewal and differentiation conditions using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Quantitative modeling of these Perturb-seq datasets uncovers distinct response patterns for different types of genes, including a striking non-monotonic response of lineage-specific genes during differentiation, indicating that mild perturbations of hESC TFs promote differentiation while strong perturbations compromise it.

They increase the root's exchange surface with the soil and provide it with good anchorage in the soil. Root hairs are an emblematic model of apical growth, a process also used by yeasts and hyphae to invade their environment. From a mechanical perspective, the root hair is considered as an elastic cylinder under pressure, closed by a dome that behaves like a yield fluid. We introduce here two innovative mechanical setups and protocols to characterize the mechanical properties of single growing root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the first setup, root hairs grow against an elastic obstacle until buckling. By measuring the critical buckling force, we determine the surface modulus and estimate the Young's modulus of the cell wall, which aligns with previous measurements. Using a 1D elasto-viscoplastic model of root hair growth, we assess the excess pressure beyond the yield threshold (the driver of tip growth) and estimate the axial stiffness of the root hair, reflecting its elastic resistance to compression. For the second protocol, we designed a setup where a single root hair grows against a cantilever with variable stiffness, a technique adapted from our earlier work on rigidity sensing by animal cells. This method provides an independent estimate of the root hair's axial stiffness, confirming our initial findings and suggesting that this stiffness primarily involves tip compression and depends mainly on turgor pressure, at least within the low deformation regime explored.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking fibrosis to inflammation-associated HCC development remain elusive, hindering early diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we combined unbiased multi-omics analyses, including metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, in a mouse model of chemical-induced liver fibrosis and HCC, and integrated publicly available transcriptome data from LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line. Our results revealed a profound rewiring of NAD+ metabolism as a central driver of metabolic disturbance. Multi-omics analysis of the bulk liver tissue showed increased activity of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, boosting the production of NAD+ precursors. Hepatic nicotinamide (NAM) level decreased due to the elevated expression of NAM N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) in HSCs. Despite the decreased hepatic NAM, serum NAD+ level was compartmentalized, with increased NAD+ in circulation, and hepatic sirtuins, including Sirt1, were downregulated to reduce conversion of NAD+ into NAM. This NAM consumption/salvage imbalance derived the disruption of NAD+ homeostasis, triggering the activation of NF-{kappa}B-mediated oxidative stress pathways. Furthermore, lipid dysregulation was evidenced by the domination of NF-{kappa}B regulation to SIRT1/SREBP-controlled lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes, leading to hepatic and serum lipid imbalance. These multi-omics insights elucidate mechanistic links between rewired NAD+ metabolism, inflammation, and lipid dysregulation during fibrosis-HCC progression.

Clinically, CDK4/6 inhibitors are under investigation in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), a subtype characterized by invasiveness, aggressiveness and poor prognosis. While CDK4 is primarily targeted for its role in proliferation, emerging evidence suggests it may also regulate other cellular processes. In particular, the mechanisms by which CDK4 could influence cancer cell migration, remain largely unexplored, particularly in highly heterogenous cell line like MDA-MB-231. This study investigates whether CDK4 contributes to the regulation of TNBC cells migration and identifies the pathways involved in MDA-MB-231 cells, independently of its role in proliferation. We demonstrate that loss or inhibition of CDK4, using respectively CRISPR/Cas9 mediated CDK4 knockout and pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibitor, leads to enhanced migration capacities and reorganization of actin subcellular networks. Mechanistically, the absence of CDK4 results in decreased phosphorylation of Myo9b at serine 1935 (S1935), which enhances RhoA signaling, a key driver of cytoskeletal dynamics, leading to polarity defects and increased cell migration. These findings reveal a non-canonical function of CDK4 in limiting TNBC cell migration through the CDK4/CyclinD-Myo9b-RhoA signaling axis. This work highlights the broader cellular roles of CDK4 beyond its established function in proliferation and suggest that inhibition of Myo9b-RhoA pathway could reduce metastatic behaviour in TNBC treated with CDK4/6i, thereby informing future co-therapeutic strategies against aggressive cancer subtypes.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Pachano, T.; Oudelaar, A. M.; Rada-Iglesias, A.", "abstract": "Enhancers are non-coding cis-regulatory elements that control the expression of distally located genes in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Recent studies indicate that enhancers can differ in their underlying genetic architecture and regulatory properties. However, these different types of enhancers were previously investigated under rather variable conditions (e.g. model organism, cell type, enhancer-promoter distance, type of target promoter, etc.), thus introducing confounding factors that make it difficult to discern the distinct regulatory properties of each enhancer type. To overcome these limitations, here we generated transgenic mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) lines in which different types of synthetic enhancers (i.e. typical enhancer, CTCF-associated enhancer, enhancer cluster/super-enhancer) were built upon the same core neural enhancer and inserted at the same distance (i.e. 100 Kb) from a typical developmental gene (i.e. Gata6). Subsequently, the mESC lines were differentiated to systematically compare the regulatory properties of the different enhancer types under identical conditions. Regarding the CTCF-associated enhancer, our data revealed that the addition of a CTCF site to the core enhancer increased insulation and led to the formation of a smaller contact domain, while having a rather mild effect on enhancer-promoter contact frequency and target gene expression. On the other hand, in comparison to the core enhancer alone, the enhancer cluster synergistically increased target gene expression and burst fraction. Importantly, we found that, in contrast to previous models, the strong regulatory activity of the enhancer cluster can not be explained by changes in enhancer-promoter contact frequency or the formation of transcriptional condensates. Instead, our data suggest that the emergent regulatory properties of enhancer clustering preferentially entail an increase in RNA Polymerase II pause release and, thus, in the fraction of enhancer-promoter contacts that are transcriptionally productive.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Among them, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) stands out as a unique member, possessing an intrinsically disordered N-terminal interaction domain and a canonical carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Gal-3 binding to glycosylated plasma membrane cargo leads to its oligomerization and membrane bending, ultimately resulting in the formation of endocytic invaginations. An interactomic assay using proteomic analysis of endogenous Gal-3 immunoprecipitates identified the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPRC5A as a novel binding partner of Gal-3. GPRC5A, also known as Retinoic Acid-Induced protein 3 (RAI3), is transcriptionally induced by retinoic acid. Our results further demonstrate that extracellular recombinant Gal-3 stimulates GPRC5A internalization. In SW480 colorectal cancer cells, glycosylated GPRC5A interacts with Gal-3. Interestingly, while GPRC5A expression was upregulated by the addition of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), its endogenous internalization in SW480 cells was specifically triggered by extracellular Gal-3, but not by ATRA. This study provides new insights into the endocytic mechanisms of GPRC5A, for which no specific ligand has been identified to date.

However, to date we know relatively little about the impact of translocation on the dynamics of skin-associated microbes, or the consequences of translocation-mediated disturbance of the microbiome for amphibian health. 3. We investigated the skin microbiome of the critically endangered frog Craugastor ranoides, now restricted to a fraction of its historical range in Costa Rica. We first conducted a multi-population survey to characterise among-population variation in skin bacterial communities. We then translocated individuals to a new site, using radio tracking to monitor them over time and assess individual-level changes in body mass, microbiome composition, and predicted microbial function. 4. We found limited among-population variation in skin microbiome composition across three different populations of C. ranoides. Response of the microbiome to translocation was highly individual-specific; some frogs demonstrated relatively stable community richness and composition, whilst others exhibited marked turnover in bacterial membership and predicted function. Body mass showed similar dynamics, but several of the recaptured frogs had gained mass after several days in the translocation site. 5. Synthesis and Applications: Our findings highlight the importance of considering microbiome dynamics in threatened species translocations to optimize individual health. This includes considering whether individuals should be prioritised for translocation based on their initial microbiome composition, and understanding how shifts in microbiome post-translocation may alter overall success of translocation efforts.

We start by predicting a scaling relationship between population and assemblage abundance with genome size. This allows us to simplify DNA shotgun sequencing equations for the reads of a population and a gene. Then we derive the temperature dependence of population and assemblage abundance using the volume-temperature and abundance-volume rules, and integrate them with simplified DNA sequencing equations to show that these predictions are compatible with a metagenomic framework. In addition, we derive predictions for the temperature dependence of the structure (abundance and richness) of genes and groups of related genes (e.g., metabolic pathways).

To systematically explore lncRNA dependencies in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we compiled a comprehensive annotation by merging GENCODE, BIGTranscriptome, and MiTranscriptome databases and performed a CRISPR Cas9 deletion screen targeting 1,029 TNBC-enriched lncRNAs. The screen revealed several essential lncRNAs and those modulating doxorubicin sensitivity, with TPL1 emerging among top hits. TPL1 silencing significantly impaired TNBC cell proliferation in both 2D and 3D cultures and reduced invasive capacity in an organ-on-chip model. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling following TPL1 knockdown revealed downregulation of genes involved in ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cell migration, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Mechanistically, TPL1 directly interacted with key proteins including EIF4B, MDM2, TARBP2, TLE5, and GTPase RAN, suggesting TPL1 could regulate RNA processing, transcriptional repression, and translation, as well as modulate GTPase signaling pathways. Additionally, TPL1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sequestering miR-10396b-5p, miR-486-3p, and miR-450a-2-3p, among others, thereby modulating expression of pro-tumorigenic targets.

However, this approach captures only a fraction of the entire sample and lacks the spatial context necessary for comprehensive tissue assessment. Recent advancements in multimodal imaging have introduced the fusion of histological data with three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques, such as Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM), to enhance tissue analysis by integrating complementary spatial information. A key challenge in this fusion process is the accurate alignment of corresponding structures across modalities, which is complicated by differences in resolution, sectioning-induced deformations, and varying imaging orientations. Existing solutions often require manual selection of image pairs or technical expertise, limiting accessibility to non-specialist users. Methods: To address these limitations, we introduce LitSHi (Light Sheet meets Histology), a novel registration tool that enables the automated and precise alignment of LSFM and histological images. LitSHi allows multimodal image fusion to be performed fully automatically, which significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Results: We evaluated LitSHi on testicular tumor specimens, demonstrating its ability to achieve enhanced structural correspondence between LSFM and histological images.

Nine animals were trained on a reach and grasp task; hand kinematics were assessed with markerless tracking. Focal M1 lesions within the central sulcus (New M1 in Strick's terminology) and the posterior part of M1 on the gyrus (Posterior Old M1) both produced increases in reach trajectory variability and reductions in speed. The speed deficit was more long-lasting for Posterior Old M1, the trajectory variability deficit was more consistent for New M1. Anterior Old M1 lesions produced only small effects on speed. An extensive cortical lesion, which combined New and Old M1 with pre-motor and somatosensory cortex damage produced no more extensive deficits than lesions to OldM1 or NewM1 alone, suggesting that effects arose mainly from damage to descending pathways rather than cortico-cortical interactions. Lesions of RNm led to long-lasting slowing of reach, but no increase in variability. Subsequent cortical lesions to Old M1 led to more severe effects, and worse recovery, than without the preceding RNm lesion. This emphasizes a key compensatory role of the rubrospinal tract following cortical damage in monkey, which is not possible in humans where the rubrospinal tract is vestigial. None of the lesions investigated led to overt abnormal synergies. The results fit with differences in descending connections from each area: New M1 has fast cortico-motoneuronal output, known to be important for fine motor control (here assessed by trajectory variability); Old M1 has cortico-reticular connections able to activate the reticulospinal tract, important for generating the high forces needed for fast movements.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Structural variations (SVs), which span broader genomic regions and often exert larger functional impacts than SNPs, hold promise for capturing this heritability. Although graph-based pangenomes have advanced SV detection and association analysis, traditional SNP-centric frameworks typically overlook detailed SV sequence information, treating overlapping SVs as independent variants and leading to reduced statistical power. To overcome this limitation, we developed SVrefiner, an algorithm that aligns overlapping SVs and partitions them into non-overlapping refined SVs (rSVs) based on sequence congruence. By generating precise genotype matrices, SVrefiner enables more accurate association studies. When applied to human, tomato, and pig genomes, SVrefiner delineated 48,712 rSVs from 77,696 human SVs, 6,607 rSVs from 51,561 tomato SVs, and 5,237 rSVs from 142,784 pig SVs.

Results: High-risk adolescents exhibited a distinct gut microbiota profile compared to low-risk adolescents, with this effect primarily driven by female participants. This profile was characterized by a higher abundance of Prevotella, which was 2-fold higher in high-risk females, and lower levels of other beneficial genera. High-risk females were also significantly more advanced in adrenarcheal development; the link between depression risk and adrenarcheal development was mediated by gut microbiota in females. Cardiovascular stress reactivity did not differ between groups and was not linked to gut microbiota. Conclusions: Our results reveal sex-specific links between depression risk, adrenarcheal development, and gut microbiota in adolescence. The increase of Prevotella in high-risk females suggests inflammation-related pathways may connect familial vulnerability to mood disorders. Future long-term studies examining hormones, microbiota, and mood during pubertal changes are essential to determine causality and develop targeted treatments.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we found that EPEC induced isolated Ca2+ responses in epithelial cells, triggered by extracellular ATP (eATP). These responses were dependent on type III secretion (T3S) and down-regulated by the bacterial secreted protease EspC, consistent with eATP released by the T3S translocon. By performing high speed Ca2+ imaging, we uncovered that at the onset of infection, low eATP levels triggered Ca2+-responses involving the whole cell but showing the small amplitude and fast kinetics usually associated with local Ca2+ responses. The findings, supported by theoretical modeling, evocate a conceptual shift whereby low amounts of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) induced by low eATP levels and subsequent moderate Ca2+ release enable the fast coordination of IP3 receptor cluster activation throughout the cell. Importantly, these yet undescribed coordinated fast responses occurred over prolonged time periods and defined a cell state with dampened activation of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional activator NF-kB associated with a decrease in its Ca2+-dependent O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine modification.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Interpretation of mant-ATP fluorescence decay kinetics is confounded by inconsistencies in state definitions and kinetic assumptions. Here, we develop a mass-action kinetic model of myosin cross-bridge cycling and mant-ATP turnover to reconcile these discrepancies and provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting SRX measurements. Our model simulates ATP label-chase experiments and demonstrates that conventional double-exponential fitting methods do not directly quantify SRX occupancy. Instead, we show that slow and fast decay phases of mant-ATP fluorescence arise from label redistribution among kinetically distinct states, not state populations in equilibrium. The model resolves several apparent paradoxes identified in recent studies by reproducing experimental observations without requiring SRX and DRX kinetic isolation or implausible equilibrium constants. Simulations further quantify the impact of experimental factors - such as ADP accumulation, photobleaching, and initial rigor state occupancy - on fluorescence kinetics and SRX estimates. These results support a revised framework for SRX quantification and suggest that label-chase experiments must be interpreted using mechanistic models to accurately assess myosin state distributions and transition kinetics.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a high-throughput, lineage-resolved microfluidic imaging platform for quantifying the expression and spatial distribution of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in Escherichia coli during antibiotic exposure. The system is built around a custom-designed multilayer microfluidic device, fabricated using a direct-write photolithography protocol, which ensures uniform delivery of nutrients and antibiotics while confining thousands of individual cells in dead-end trenches. Brightfield imaging provides a label-free, high-temporal-resolution method for tracking cell growth and division, enabling accurate reconstruction of lineages over time. Efflux pump abundance is quantified using GFP-tagged AcrB, while a red fluorescent reporter driven by a constitutive promoter serves as a control to account for growth-dependent fluorescence artifacts. To analyse the sources of heterogeneity in efflux abundance and its consequences for antibiotic response dynamics, we developed a lineage-resolved analytical framework that compares cells of similar replicative age but differing spatial positions, and vice versa. This analysis was made possible by a novel machine-learning-based image processing pipeline, which enables robust cell segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction across multiple fields of view. By extracting time-resolved single-cell data, this platform allows precise dissection of non-genetic variability in efflux activity and its role in determining survival outcomes, offering a powerful foundation for future quantitative studies of bacterial physiology under antibiotic stress.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, we hypothesized that immune activation alters angiogenetic CD8 T cell (Tang) function driving endothelial chronic inflammation. Endothelial cell repair is partially mediated by angiogenic T (Tang) cells which facilitate proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow derived and resident endothelial progenitor cells at site of vascular injury. The role of CD8 Tang cells in the setting of viral infection, including chronic HIV infection is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a subset of CD8 T cells expressing CD31high that exhibited a long-lived memory precursor phenotype (CD127+KLRG1-) and secreted the pro-angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mice infected with acute LCMV. Furthermore, in PWH, the frequencies of circulating CD8 Tang cells were reduced and showed an activated phenotype and expression of granzymes. GZMA+GZMB+CD8 Tang cells correlated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. In vitro, granzyme dependent PAR1 activation led to calcium mobilization and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and Angiopoietin-2 by primary human endothelial cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that HIV driven activation of CD8 Tang cells promotes endothelial inflammation and chronic stimulation of this pathway may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in PWH.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

This is paradoxical given the abundant infiltration of CD8 T cells in HNSCC, suggesting that current T cell profiling methods fail to fully capture functional anti-tumor immunity and that key immunosuppressive mechanisms remain poorly understood. To uncover mechanisms regulating T cell function in situ, we developed a multimodal profiling framework integrating high-dimensional flow cytometry, single-cell RNA- and TCR- sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, including spatially-resolved TCR profiling at single-cell resolution. Applying this approach to paired blood and tumor samples from 27 HNSCC patients enabled single-cell resolution mapping of T cell clonality, transcriptional state, and spatial localization within intact tumors. Tumors with similar clinical features and immune profiles by flow cytometry and scRNA-seq exhibited markedly different spatial immune architectures. Within the T cell compartment, stem- and memory-like T cells localized within immune-rich niches, while exhausted cells were broadly dispersed in tumor-rich regions. Targeted spatial TCR mapping revealed that tumor-enriched TCR clones were distributed throughout the tumor yet adopted distinct, location-dependent phenotypes, indicating that both antigen specificity and spatial cues shape T cell differentiation and function in human tumors. These findings reveal fundamental principles of T cell organization in solid tumors and establish a versatile platform for spatially-resolved, antigen-specific T cell profiling.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

ESAT-6 treatment elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels, but blocking of these cytokines failed to restore DC differentiation. Mechanistically, ESAT-6 suppressed phosphorylation of p65, establishing that ESAT-6 impairs DC differentiation by inhibiting NF-{kappa}B activation and this function is dependent on the last six amino acids of its C-terminal domain.

Here, we show that human blastocysts can give rise to both trophoblast organoids and extraembryonic mesoderm cells under the same culture conditions. Trophoblast organoids originate from both outer trophoblast cells and inner cells of the blastocyst, while extraembryonic mesoderm cells derive exclusively from inner cells. These organoids recapitulate the cellular composition, morphology, and function of the in vivo trophoblast. Moreover, given the high rate of aneuploidy at the blastocyst stage, aneuploid trophoblast organoids can be readily generated.

We demonstrate this pipeline on a custom-designed landscape featuring two asymmetric potential wells. By systematically varying a kinetic hopping term in the Hamiltonian, our variational quantum eigensolver simulations, averaged over 100 runs, successfully reproduce the physical transition from a localised ground state to a delocalised state governed by tunnelling.

Here, we show that GBM patients exhibit heightened platelet reactivity driven by protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) signaling. In murine GBM models, targeting PAR4 with BMS986120 prolongs survival in females but not males. This survival advantage is estrogen-dependent and TME-specific, driven by enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration within the tumor. Inhibiting platelet PAR4 signaling decreases platelet alpha-granule secretion in female tumor-bearing mice while enriching alternative exocytosis pathways, thereby influencing CD8+ T cell activity. PAR4-activated platelets within the TME suppress CD8+ T cell function and CD8+ T cell depletion eliminates the tumor induced platelet reactivity and survival benefit when PAR4 is inhibited.

Neutrophils are key instigators of vascular tissue injury and perpetuation of inflammation, and targeting their actions is a viable therapeutic opportunity. We here identify a distinct subset of activated neutrophils within atherosclerotic lesions that express the chemokine receptor CCR2, which directs their migration toward areas enriched with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and contributes to plaque instability. Methods Flow cytometry and single cell transcriptomic analysis of CCR2+ neutrophils within murine and human atherosclerotic plaques. Tracking of CCR2+ neutrophil in hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/- mice and in mice reconstituted with Ccr2GFP/- bone marrow. In vivo reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) analysis in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis.

In vivo neutrophil recruitment and atherosclerotic plaque destabilization analysis upon CCR2 and CCL2 blockade in a model of advanced atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. Results CCR2+ neutrophils preferentially populate mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions and displayed a proinflammatory phenotype with enhanced capacity for ROS production and NET release. Genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of CCR2 significantly reduces neutrophil migration and infiltration to the atherosclerotic lesion, reducing their presence in SMC-rich areas. Consistently, neutralization of the CCR2 ligand CCL2 decreased lesional neutrophil numbers and preserved fibrous cap integrity by increasing SMC content and decreasing overall plaque instability.

The nonbranching parallel fibres traverse at right angles to the dendritic plane, forming en passant excitatory synapses. This arrangement makes it very likely that any synaptic connection between a parallel fibre and an interneurone will involve only a single contact. We obtained 20 paired recordings of synaptically connected granule cells and interneurones in cerebellar slices of immature rat, recorded at room temperature. Three of these pairs were successfully labelled using biocytin and a single point of contact between them was indentified. In 19/20 recordings, multiple release events corresponding to asynchronously released vesicles were frequently resolved following a single action potential. The frequency of these events could not be accounted for by spontaneous EPSCs, whose frequency was very low.

One such factor, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), is a monomeric peptidoglycan (PGN) fragment released extracellularly due to inefficient recycling by the permease AmpG. Although TCT is known to be a potent NOD1 agonist in vitro, its role in vivo remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that TCT release during infection suppresses pulmonary inflammation. Mice infected with a TCT over-releasing strain, TCT(+), exhibited reduced lung immunopathology compared to wild-type or TCT-under releasing, TCT(-), strains. Reporter assays revealed that TCT(+) preferentially enhanced NOD1 activation, while TCT(-) strains skewed signaling towards NOD2. In vivo, NOD2 knockout mice displayed reduced lung inflammation, implicating NOD2-driven responses in pulmonary pathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified IL-1B; as closely associated with expression of NOD2 but not NOD1. In support, TCT(+) infection led to reduced IL-1B; protein levels than WT or TCT(-). CellChat analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data identified alveolar macrophages as the primary source of IL-1B; and airway fibroblasts as key responders. Infected airway fibroblasts upregulated inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL13 and CCL19, promoting lymphocyte recruitment. Proteomic profiling and flow cytometry confirmed reduced chemokine levels and B cell recruitment in TCT(+) infections. Importantly, IL-1 receptor knockout mice showed significantly impaired recruitment of B and CD4+ T cells and higher bacterial burdens, despite unchanged innate cell infiltration. This underscores the role of IL-1 in coordinating adaptive immunity. Together, these findings support a model in which TCT release skews host signaling towards NOD1, suppresses NOD2 and IL-1 mediated fibroblast activation, blunts chemokine-driven lymphocyte recruitment, and impairs adaptive immune clearance. These results suggest that TCT release is an immune evasion strategy to dampen inflammation, prolong persistence and prevent the development of protective adaptive responses and highlights divergent outcomes following engagement of NOD1 or NOD2 during infection.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

The existing computational methodologies proved to be successful in those cases when a protein target is a relatively rigid molecule (e.g., many enzymes), or when an in silico methodology is applied during hit-to-lead optimization of an already potent binder. However, these methods fail when applied to highly flexible or intrinsically disordered protein targets which represent the bulk of pharmacologically important proteins. The major factors contributing to the failure are either incorrect or simplified treatment of protein flexibility, inadequate or overfitted scoring function, absence of correctly annotated druggable pockets, and lack of structural data about potential allosteric sites. The Q-MOL drug discovery platform addresses the problem of treatment of protein flexibility during the course of protein-ligand docking by computationally implementing some of postulates of the energy landscape theory of protein folding. The Q-MOL protein-ligand docking method was thoroughly validated in academic and commercial settings across a panel of more than 60 diverse proteins (of viral, bacterial and animal origin). This methodology, originally developed for high fidelity virtual ligand screening, is also used for the prediction of ligand binding sites. The ability to reliably predict ligand binding sites on the surface of novel and unannotated protein targets is critical for successful drug discovery. The Q-MOL drug discovery platform is agnostic to the nature of a protein target. Rigid, flexible or intrinsically disordered proteins are processed by the same protein-ligand docking protocol. Importantly, the software does not require the presence of structurally well-defined binding pockets or sites. The correct and validated implicit treatment of protein flexibility allows for successful discovery of small molecule ligands against allosteric sites lacking any structural features of a classical druggable pocket. In contrast to other docking programs, all of the Q-MOL in silico drug discovery features were thoroughly validated in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo when possible. In this paper, the results of several previously published drug discovery projects are briefly presented and related to relevant computational features of the software. The corresponding protein targets include viral proteinases (West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue and Zika viruses), hemopexin domain of membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase, retinoid X receptor , and {beta}-catenin armadillo repeat domain. It has been also shown that contrary to existing belief, highly flexible proteins (or their domains) represent significantly more amenable drug discovery targets than rigid proteins. Flexible and intrinsically disordered proteins exist in a vast array of environment-dependent conformational states, and thus, they can accommodate a significantly larger number of ligand chemotypes ensuring both potency and specificity of interactions with a protein target.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

It is desirable to alleviate the energy barriers associated with the cellular uptake of sEVs and minimize perturbation of sEVs when loading drugs onto them. In this study, we developed a simple drug-loading system for sEVs using a dimeric curvature-sensing peptide, which enhances sEV accumulation on the cell surface by acting as an adhesive, subsequently inducing endocytic uptake of sEVs through a clathrin-mediated pathway. The dimeric curvature-sensing peptide selectively binds to the sEV surface within 10 min, even in the presence of serum proteins, and functions as a membrane interfactant to reduce the energy barriers for the cellular uptake of sEVs. The cellular uptake of sEVs and the dimeric curvature-sensing peptide under coexisting conditions increased to over fivefold and 20-fold, respectively, compared with those administered alone.

Additionally, DM1 pathology requires drug localization to the nucleus, where pathogenic mutant RNA is trapped, posing challenges after endocytosis and endosomal escape. Here, we show that a locked nucleic acid oligonucleotide targeting mutant CUGexp RNA tracts, conjugated to a bottlebrush polymer, exhibited improved muscle distribution and potent correction of DM1-associated splicing at low nanomolar doses in a DM1 mouse model. Significant improvements in myotonia, body weight, and grip strength were observed. The conjugates were well tolerated after 12 weeks of weekly intravenous dosing.

However, few existing strategies are capable of simultaneously overcoming these two barriers, underscoring a critical scientific gap and the need for innovative therapeutic platforms that enable both effective BBB traversal and tumor immune reprogramming. Here, we present a coronavirus-mimicking protein nanocage platform (EcomPC) derived from Thermotoga maritima encapsulin, rationally engineered for the targeted and sustained delivery of interferon; (IFN) to GBM lesions. Through strategic insertion of flexible linkers, cysteine-to-serine mutations, and modular surface functionalization via SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, EcomPC enables intracellular self-assembly of IFN and glioma-specific targeting. In orthotopic GBM models, EcomPC-IFN demonstrates efficient BBB translocation, selective tumor accumulation, and potent anti-tumor efficacy. Mechanistically, localized IFN release induces tumor cell apoptosis and reprograms the immune microenvironment-characterized by increased CD8 T cell infiltration, decreased Foxp3 regulatory T cells, and a favorable chemokine shift. These therapeutic effects are not recapitulated by free IFN or untargeted nanocages, underscoring the essential role of both structural mimicry and ligand-guided delivery.

Here, we present a high-throughput, sequence-based model that leverages contextual embeddings from protein language models to predict ice binding potential, as well as the expression and activity potential of candidate proteins. Using a curated data corpus of over 18,000 ice binding proteins - far larger than previous datasets - we fine-tuned a ProtBERT-based model, achieving 99% accuracy for prediction of ice binding potential. Sensitivity analyses through targeted mutagenesis (alanine and threonine substitutions) confirmed the model's biological significance, revealing functionally important residues and sequence patterns. Additionally, we developed an expression prediction model that achieved an R2 score of 0.64 and low false-negative rates in identifying highly expressible candidates in Pichia pastoris. An additional regression model trained to predict ice activity as measured by thermal hysteresis achieved an R2 score of at least 0.79 with a clear difference in prediction between ice binding and non-ice binding proteins.

Here we pooled data measuring 66 cytokines from 4 different inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) cohorts over 5 seasons (N=581) and identified a significant correlation between baseline/day 0 serum IL-18 and IFN-{beta} concentrations and the antibody response on day 28. We investigated this further in human tonsil and spleen organoids, and found that several cytokines, including multiple Type I IFNs (IFN-{beta} and others), IL-21, IL-12, IL-10, but not IL-18 or its downstream Type II IFN (IFN-{beta}), could adjuvant the IIV vaccine to enhance the antibody response. The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) induced a stronger antibody response than the inactivated one in organoids. Adding a single cytokine, IFN-{beta}, recapitulated most of the live vaccine-specific cytokine activation program and increased the antibody response of the inactivated vaccine to that of the live vaccine. Thus, the human vaccinees and the organoid data showed that IFN-{beta} is a natural adjuvant. Two other antibody-boosting cytokines, IL-12 and IL-21, were induced by LAIV but not by Type I IFNs, which suggested parallel regulatory pathways. Moreover, IL-21 mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) greatly augmented the quantity and breadth of antibody responses in a mouse model of IIV vaccination, while IFN-{beta} LNPs enhanced durability.

However, comprehensive monitoring of all three major pathogen types remains uncommon, primarily due to the technical difficulty of simultaneously concentrating and characterizing these diverse microorganisms from a single water sample. Here, we evaluated a membrane adsorption followed by bead-beating-based direct nucleic acid extraction for its sensitivity in detecting waterborne pathogens. We further applied the optimized protocol to river water samples. Our results demonstrated that the use of magnesium chloride in combination with a mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (pore size: 0.8 m) achieved the highest concentration efficiency for Cryptosporidium parvum, Legionella pneumophila, and murine norovirus (MNV), outperforming other methods utilizing the membrane with alternative pore sizes or membrane with another material (i.e., nylon). Furthermore, targeting rRNA of C. parvum instead of rDNA, or incorporating a preamplification step for the L. pneumophila mip gene and MNV, significantly improved the sensitivity. Notably, the 50% limit of detection for C. parvum using our method was comparable to that of traditional immunofluorescent antibody testing. Application of this method to river water further revealed a higher abundance of Bacteroides rRNA markers compared to their corresponding rDNA, underscoring the potential of rRNA-based targets for more sensitive bacterial detection. Importantly, when the target is genomic DNA or RNA, preamplification enables the use of a larger nucleic acids input volume, thereby enhancing sensitivity without introducing measurement bias. Overall, the combination of membrane adsorption and bead-beating-based direct nucleic acid extraction offers a sensitive, all-in-one approach for simultaneous detection of protozoa, bacteria, and viruses in environmental water.

Norovirus exhibits remarkable genetic diversity. Understanding the impact of genetic diversity on infection and immunity has been challenging due to the difficulties of in vitro cultivation and the current lack of a small animal model. Murine norovirus (MNV) has emerged as a premier model system to investigate norovirus biology. Here, we identify Trim47 as a host restriction factor that potently inhibits MNV infection in a strain dependent manner. We determine that Trim47 expression inhibits an early stage of the viral life cycle for the MNV strain CR6, while the replication of the closely related strain CW3 is not restricted by Trim47. Using a forward genetic screen we determine that genetic variation within the nonstructural gene NS1 accounts for this differential sensitivity to Trim47. While most TRIM containing proteins promote the ubiquitination and degradation of its targets, Trim47 does neither. Instead, Trim47 promotes the deubiquitination of the NS1/2 precursor protein.

Using a decade-long time-series metagenomics dataset from the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO), we investigated the role of vitamin biosynthesis in structuring the seasonal marine microbial interactions among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Gene co-occurrence analysis revealed that vitamin-related metabolism had the highest number of associations among all metabolic pathways, underscoring the potential role of vitamins in microbial interactions. Metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) co-occurrence analysis further identified the prokaryotic biosynthesis of cobalamin (B12) and thiamine (B1) as key mediators of these associations. Rather than between complete vitamin synthesizers and auxotrophs, the main associations were found between partial synthesizers, suggesting that vitamer cross-feeding may represent an essential microbial interaction in sustaining vitamin biosynthesis throughout the year. While complete cobalamin synthesizers dominate in summer, partial synthesizers and lower-ligand activators are more prevalent in winter, driving cross-feeding interactions. In contrast, thiamine biosynthesis is more widespread, with complete synthesizers peaking in winter. The association strength, however, was maximum between prokaryotic vitamin producers and eukaryotes, highlighting the dependence of eukaryotes on bacterial vitamin production.

A study was initiated to determine the requirement of nucleoid-associated protein FIS for growth and genome compaction in the small rods at low temperature. Growth and nucleoid staining analyses revealed that the fis null mutant displayed decreased growth and initially formed filaments containing decondensed nucleoids at 12{degrees}C, indicating that FIS facilitates production of small rods with condensed nucleoids at low temperature. However, characterized by biphasic growth at low temperature, the fis null mutant exhibited increased growth, cell division, and nucleoid condensation following a lag phase. Furthermore, compacted circular-shaped nucleoids were formed near the onset of the second growth phase. Therefore E. coli responds to the absence of FIS by inducing an adaptive mechanism that causes a shift towards nucleoid condensation resulting in genome compaction in small rods. Furthermore, the deletion of sulA (encodes DNA damaged-induced cell division inhibitor SulA) in the fis null mutant resulted in suppression of the filamentous morphology. This indicates that the absence of FIS with nucleoid decondensation led to DNA damage, inducing cell division inhibition by SulA.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

J.; Drabinska, J.; Duggan, N.; McClean, S.", "abstract": "Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by chronic respiratory infections, involving opportunistic pathogens, including Burkholderia cenocepacia. The CF lung comprises hypoxic niches that drives bacterial adaptation and the adaptability of pathogens to this environment is key to their successful colonisation. We previously identified several proteins encoded on a low-oxygen activated (Lxa) locus that were significantly increased in abundance in late chronic infection B. cenocepacia isolates. However, the impact of long-term hypoxia exposure on B. cenocepacia adaptation remains unclear. Results: To investigate the role of hypoxia in driving traits associated with chronic infection, we exposed an early infection B. cenocepacia isolate to low (6% O2) or atmospheric oxygen (21% O2) over 22 days. By day 22, 364 proteins were significantly increased in abundance in hypoxia-adapted cultures relative to the ancestral strain. Overall, 1066 individual proteins were significantly increased in abundance in the hypoxia-adapted cultures relative to normoxia-adapted cultures, across four different timepoints from day 1 to day 22. Comparative proteome analysis identified 81 proteins with consistent changes in abundance both in hypoxia-adapted cultures and the respective late infection isolate relative to the ancestral strain (the early infection isolate), including lxa-encoded proteins and the FixK transcriptional regulator. Proteins associated with shikimate pathways were also significantly changed in abundance. Importantly, hypoxia-adapted cultures showed increased survival in CF macrophages, increased attachment to CF lung cells, elevated protease activity, greater resistance to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin, all of which are consistent with adaptations observed in late chronic infection isolates. Hypoxia-adapted cultures also displayed enhanced virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae, as did the late infection isolate. Conclusions: The changes in phenotype and proteome of B. cenocepacia observed after long-term hypoxia suggest that hypoxia may drive the adaptation to chronic infection, promoting survival in macrophages, host-cell attachment, antibiotic resistance and protease activity.

In particular, the coexistence of a large diversity of copiotrophic bacteria, which are capable of fast growth but typically remain at low abundance, has been interpreted as a feast or famine existence. Here we show that contrary to the notion of infrequent growth, Vibrio bacteria exhibited consistent growth rates in coastal ocean samples, despite representing only a small fraction of the total community. These observations were enabled by a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), which we adapted to function as a single-cell chemostat. By maintaining a continuous supply of native seawater around each trapped cell, we prevented nutrient depletion and used the SMR's high mass precision to resolve growth rates that are otherwise undetectable. Vibrio species displayed significantly larger cell mass and faster growth than other community members across samples collected at different temporal intervals from days to years. Surprisingly, their growth was consistently limited by carbon, contrary to the expectation that heterotrophic bacteria in the euphotic zone would be limited by nitrogen and phosphorus due to competition with algae. The correlation between cell mass and growth rate of Vibrionaceae in seawater followed established growth laws derived from laboratory conditions, suggesting that growth physiology observed in pure cultures is applicable to wild bacterial populations.

Among biological properties, the recruitment of soil microbial communities by plant roots is influenced by both physico-chemical soil properties and plant characteristics, dependent on species or genotypes. Here, rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with five fonio genotypes cultivated under three locations were investigated. Rhizosphere soils were collected for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize soil bacterial diversity. Additional parameters were assessed to classify soil fertility at three locations and to evaluate relationships between the bacterial communitys composition and soil fertility variables. PCA revealed a clear effect of location, whereas genotype had no significant impact on soil chemical properties or enzyme activities. Overall, soils were low in fertility, with Boukoumbe soil standing out for its higher chemical values and enzyme activities. For example, Boukoumbe reached 1.48% organic carbon, compared to 0.61% in Gogounou and 0.36% in Ina. Similarly, total nitrogen and available phosphorus were also higher in Boukoumbe. Regarding bacterial community, there is no impact of location and genotype on their richness and diversity. However, Bray-Curtis index revealed a significant difference in bacterial community structure among locations, but not among fonio genotypes. This suggests, in rhizosphere, bacterial community structure is more modulated by soil properties than crop genotypes. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota were most abundant phyla, varying significantly across locations. Moraxellaceae and Oxalobacteraceae bacteria were most abundant families within Proteobacteria, while Chitinophagaceae and Weekselleceae dominated in Bacteroidota.

Alternative splicing (AS) is one such post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms. In this study we used RNA binding protein (RBP) motif enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data to identify enriched RBP positions around alternatively spliced exons in primary osteocytes cultured in high glucose conditions (HG). We identified the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) as a top candidate regulator of AS in our datasets. We investigated the mechanistic role of HuR in osteocyte adaptation to high glucose using HuR knockdown (KD) in MLO-Y4 cells. HuR KD led to profound differential gene expression and differential mRNA splicing changes. Functional splicing analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to stress response, translation, and insulin signaling. Mechanistic studies confirmed AS analysis; HuR KD cells showed decreased mitochondrial mass, impaired respiratory function, reduced ATP production, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress under challenging conditions. HuR KD cells exhibited reduced viability specifically under HG but not osmotic stress conditions. Additionally, HuR KD displayed dysregulation in key translational signals, including activation of mTOR kinase, decreased MNK1 activity and decreased in eIF4E phosphorylation while preserving global protein output.

Modulation of ADAR1 expression and editing activity has previously been described to play a role in cancer development and progression, with upregulation of ADAR1 being observed in a range of cancers. Further, depletion of ADAR1 leads to increased sensing of endogenous dsRNAs by dsRNA sensors in cell lines that require ADAR1 for survival, which are termed ADAR1-dependent. The activation of these sensors induces downstream production of type I interferons as well as translational inhibition and apoptosis. Therefore, ADAR1 is a promising oncologic therapeutic target. Recently, the small molecule ZYS-1 has been developed and presented as a direct inhibitor of ADAR1. We performed a series of in vitro and cellular experiments to validate the efficacy and specificity of ZYS-1 as an ADAR1 inhibitor. Evaluating the effect of ZYS-1 on cell viability revealed it to be equally cytotoxic to both ADAR1-dependent and ADAR1-independent cell lines, as well as wildtype and ADAR1 knockout cells. Moreover, ZYS-1 treatment had little effect on activation of PKR or induction of IFN stimulated genes.

These structural changes are driven by eight DExD/H-box RNA helicases that act at distinct stages of the splicing cycle. Among them, Prp5 and Sub2 are involved in prespliceosome formation, with Prp5 implicated in displacing the U2 snRNP component Cus2, and Sub2 in facilitating the release of the Msl5-Mud2 heterodimer. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the functions of these two proteins remain unclear. Here, we show that Sub2 is not essential for splicing in vitro, but it can enhance splicing independently of ATP. Strikingly, prespliceosome formation can proceed without ATP in the absence of either Sub2 or Cus2. Moreover, though ATP is required for prespliceosome formation under standard conditions, ATP hydrolysis is not. These findings reveal a coordinated interplay among Prp5, Sub2, Cus2 Mud2 and Msl5 during prespliceosome formation and indicate that ATP binding, rather than ATP hydrolysis, drives the early remodeling events that initiate spliceosome assembly.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

However, they also serve as major entry points for bacterial contamination and trigger foreign body responses, necessitating locking strategies that are both bactericidal and biocompatible. This study introduces the first gel-based catheter lock, in contrast to conventional liquid locks. The gel is a poloxamer-based hydrogel formulated with 2-hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin (HP-CD). HP-CD forms supramolecular complexes with the poloxamer to enhance gelation, and with the nitric oxide (NO) donor to modulate NO release kinetics. This thixotropic gel can be injected into the catheter lumen when the catheter is not in use and withdrawn when vascular access is needed. The gel matrix provides a physical barrier that slows bacterial migration and minimizes drug loss. Simultaneously, the released NO functions as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, effectively preventing biofilm formation on both the internal and external surfaces of the catheter. The NO-releasing hydrogel also demonstrates excellent hemocompatibility and reduces clot adhesion. Together, the gel-based lock offers a promising strategy for more effective catheter maintenance and represents a new application of hydrogels.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Triethylene glycol (TEG) has been documented as having microbicidal capabilities and has been proposed as one such mitigation strategy. Aerosolized TEG exhibits antimicrobial activity against airborne microorganisms; Grignard Pure Technology was developed to safely aerosolize TEG for air decontamination. Here we show that this TEG formulation effectively inactivates airborne microorganisms, resulting in 2 to 4.5 net log reduction in concentration of viable bacteria, viruses, and mycobacteria within 30-60 minutes at TEG concentration (aerosol + vapor) of ~0.7 mg/m3, which is well within the range considered safe for humans. Our data also demonstrate that aerosolizing both the test organisms and the antimicrobial product provides a more accurate and relevant measure of the product's efficacy for indoor usage compared to traditional surface - or solution - based disinfection assays. Accurate evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy is a crucial step in adopting novel interventions and tools to control airborne pathogens that pose a public health risk. Our findings argue that testing protocols must match the intended use of any intervention. Given the safety concerns of aerosolizing human pathogens for direct testing of airborne infectious burden, we also advance an approach for selecting suitable surrogate microorganisms based on their phenotypic and biophysical similarity to corresponding pathogenic species", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Microbial species are integral in environmental homeostasis and have thus developed diverse strategies to adapt, survive, and proliferate under exogenous stress. The growing demand for nanoscale battery materials has led to increasing environmental concentrations of nanomaterials and their constituent metal ions. Previous work has shown that the gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis is able to rapidly evolve resistance to one such nanomaterial, lithiated nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC). Yet, the specific stimuli that trigger resistance evolution and the ensuing genomic changes were previously unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of cobalt and nickel ions released from NMC trigger a gene duplication amplification (GDA) event that enables stable nanomaterial and metal resistance. Amplification copy number is highly dynamic over the period of study, yet amplification events persist over prolonged recovery in the absence of metal stress. Growth rate comparisons reveal no physiological cost associated with high copy GDA. The stability of this genomic mutation combined with the lack of observable fitness cost distinguishes this genomic perturbation from previously reported GDA events. Lastly, the observed GDA event was unique to the combination of cobalt and nickel, which implies that the intracellular targets of these metal ions have a specific interaction that yield resistance. Ultimately, we report a dynamic and specific GDA event that allows S. oneidensis to survive metal stress. This work not only illuminates the broader ecological consequences associated with introducing nanomaterials and metals into the environment but also provides insight into the larger scope of bacterial resistance mechanisms.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

A key parameter shaping transmission is the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) the time between a mosquito acquiring a virus and becoming infectious--which is strongly influenced by temperature. However, the temperature-EIP relationship remains poorly characterized across arboviruses and mosquito species. Methods: We conducted the first systematic review of laboratory studies evaluating temperature effects on EIP-related outcomes across all reported mosquito-arbovirus pairings. We searched three databases and extracted data on transmission efficiency (TE), applying linear regression models adjusted for diurnal temperature range and viral dose. Studies where TE could not be extracted were synthesized narratively. Results: Our synthesis included 60 studies covering 17 arboviral diseases and 20 mosquito species. We found substantial heterogeneity in temperature effects on TE. While CHIKV, ZIKV, DENV, and WNV generally showed increased TE and shorter EIP at higher temperatures, many viruses--such as SINV, USUV, and BATV--exhibited no clear trends, often due to limited data and small sample sizes. Even across different vectors of the same virus, findings varied widely, reflecting both biological differences and inconsistent experimental designs.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Given that transmission potential varies among mosquito populations, identifying population-specific transmission barriers is crucial for optimizing vector control strategies especially under resource constrains. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study assessed the Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission potential of three Aedes aegypti populations from Thailand: two field-derived populations from Chiang Mai (CSP) and Nakhon Sawan (NAK) and a long-established laboratory strain (DMSC). Following oral exposure to a locally circulating ZIKV strain, viral transmission potential was evaluated. CSP mosquitoes demonstrated the earliest and highest ZIKV prevalence in salivary glands at 7 days post-infectious blood meal (dpibm), with DMSC and NAK populations reaching comparable infection levels at later time points. Despite this, NAK mosquitoes exhibited a strong salivary gland escape barrier, resulting in significantly lower transmission potential. Genetic crosses revealed that this phenotype is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is similarly effective against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), underscoring the broad-spectrum potential of NAK Aedes aegypti for transmission suppression. Furthermore, male NAK mosquitoes exhibited superior mating competitiveness, reinforcing their viability as a tool for vector control by population replacement. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings highlight significant variability in ZIKV vector competence among Thai Aedes aegypti populations, emphasizing the importance of direct transmission assessments in vector competence studies. The discovery of a naturally occurring, heritable salivary gland escape barrier presents an opportunity for vector control strategies through NAK-based population replacement approaches. With their strong mating capability and broad arbovirus-blocking ability, NAK mosquitoes provide a natural alternative to Wolbachia-based and genetically modified mosquito interventions.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

This is particularly relevant for experimental evolution and metabolic studies.

Here, we present the ModuloStat, a modular, open-source framework that facilitates continuous culture in mini-bioreactors. The ModuloStat system is grounded on digital fabrication tools easily accessible in FabLabs and programmable electronics. Maintaining a culture is divided into tasks assigned to dedicated printed circuit boards with a microcontroller connected to a Wi-Fi network. According to Internet of Things principles, each board operates a set of sensors and actuators autonomously and can receive and send information. The boards are stacked to implement complex behaviors and can be modified to accommodate new features. A thermoregulated box holds the components and can be placed on a laboratory bench or transported under a sterile hood for inoculation. Sterility is ensured by autoclaving, after assembly, all components that will come into contact with the culture medium. In-situ optical density monitoring combined with modularity and computer control enables many cultivation modes. Additionally, we present the construction of the Bacillus subtilis strain ZB designed for bioreactor culture that exhibits a zero-biofilm phenotype.

Recently, the CRISPR-Cas3 system, a Class 1 CRISPR effector complex with unidirectional DNA degradation activity, has gained attention as a potential alternative, offering reduced off-target activity. In this study, we applied the CRISPR-Cas3 system to human T cells and successfully disrupted two clinically relevant genes, T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M). These gene deletions were associated with a reduction in both graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risk and host immune rejection. Importantly, no off-target mutations were detected in CRISPR-Cas3-edited cells, in contrast to the off-target effects observed with CRISPR-Cas9.

L.", "abstract": "Functional asymmetries in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are significant attributes of this brain area, implicated in its role in emotional processing and executive function. Evidence suggests that, under normal conditions, there is a tonic inhibition of the right (R) mPFC by the left (L) mPFC, and a dysregulation of this hemispheric functional lateralization is implicated in detrimental chronic stress effects. Considering the wide interhemispheric connection and the inhibitory tone from the LmPFC to the RmPFC, we hypothesize that alterations in the activity of the direct projections between the mPFC hemispheres during stressful situations are related to stress vulnerability. To address this question, we used a chemogenetic approach to modulate the activity of L-to-R dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) monosynaptic projections during psychosocial stress (PSS) exposure in mice. We found that activating LdmPFC projections during a repeated PSS protocol prevents stress-induced apathy-like behavior in females and males and social avoidance in male mice. On the other hand, inhibiting such projections during a single session of PSS increases vulnerability to stress effects in male mice, increasing social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors. Both glutamatergic and GABAergic cells compose the projecting interhemispheric neurons in the dmPFC. However, the LdmPFC showed a higher density of glutamatergic projections to the RdmPFC than the opposite. In conclusion, our results revealed an involvement of the monosynaptic projections from the LdmPFC to RdmPFC in the vulnerability to the behavioral alterations induced by PSS in female and male mice.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

To further explore the role of humoral immunity in reassortment, we generated two divergent fluorescent protein-expressing viruses and used strain-specific and cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to assess the impact of cross-immunity on reassortment. Our results indicate that all mAbs altered the genotypic diversity and significantly reduced the release of progeny virions in co-infected cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, antibody transfer studies in mice revealed protection from challenge with divergent pathogenicity profiles. Notably, selection driven by a strain-specific mAb depended on its neutralizing specificity, whereas the selection driven by broadly reactive mAbs was independent of neutralization specificity.

Activation of the NOD2/ NF-{kappa}5B signaling axis is linked to the dysregulated overexpression of the PG remodeling enzyme AmiA and the subsequent cleavage and mislocalization of D-Ala-D-Ala analog.

In mammalian neurons, the homolog of HuR, ELAVL4 or HuD, is expressed; however, its role in miRNA regulation remains unknown. PC12, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, is a well-established model for studying neuronal differentiation that resembles sympathetic neurons. In PC12 cells, HuD levels increase during differentiation, which suppresses HuR expression. Thus, HuD overrides HuR's control of miRNA activity in differentiating cells, promoting differentiation by regulating the activity and levels of specific miRNAs, such as let-7a and miR-125b. When HuD is present, it decreases the activity of these miRNAs by binding to them, thereby facilitating their export and ensuring neuronal differentiation. Overall, there is a shift in miRNA regulation, with HuR being replaced by HuD in controlling miRNA export during neuronal differentiation.

GLP-1-based drugs have massively transformed care, but long-term consequences are unclear in part due to reductions in energy expenditure with ongoing use. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and cold exposure (CE) raise EE via brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT). Methionine restriction (MetR) is a candidate DIT trigger, but its EE effect has not been benchmarked against CE, nor have their tissue-level interactions been defined. Objective & Methods: In a 2 by 2 design (Control vs. MetR; room temperature, RT: 22C vs. CE: 4C for 24 h), we used male C57BL/6N mice to benchmark MetR-induced thermogenesis against CE and mapped how diet and temperature interact across tissues. Bulk RNA-seq profiled liver, iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT. Differential expression was modeled with main effects and a diet by temperature interaction; KEGG GSEA assessed pathways. Results: MetR increased EE at RT and shifted fuel use toward lipid oxidation, supporting MetR as a bona fide DIT factor. CE elevated EE across diets and blunted diet differences. Transcriptomic responses were tissue-specific: in liver, CE dominated gene induction while MetR and CE cooperatively repressed genes. The combination enriched glucagon/AMPK-linked and core metabolic pathways. In iBAT, CE dominated thermogenic and lipid-oxidation programs with minimal MetR contribution. In iWAT, MetR and CE acted largely additively with high concordance, enhancing fatty-acid degradation, PPAR signaling, thermogenesis, and TCA cycle pathways. In eWAT, robust co-dependent differential expression emerged only with MetR+CE, yet pathway-level enrichment was limited. Conclusion: MetR is a genuine DIT stimulus that remodels metabolism in a tissue-specific manner. Our study provides a tissue-resolved transcriptomic resource that benchmarks diet-induced (MetR) against cold-induced thermogenesis and maps their interactions across liver, iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Upon stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), IRAKs are recruited to supramolecular signalling complexes, known as myddosomes, through interactions between their DDs and the adaptor protein MyD88. Myddosomes are essential for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) in response to diverse pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), and they contribute to inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation. In the hierarchical assembly of the myddosome, MyD88 first recruits IRAK4, which serves as a scaffold for the subsequent binding of IRAK1 and/or IRAK2. To explore alternative models for studying IRAK function, we expressed human IRAK1, IRAK2 and IRAK4 individually in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and performed a comparative analysis. Heterologous expression of these kinases, especially IRAK4, impaired yeast growth; an effect dependent on its kinase activity. Transcriptomic and biochemical assays revealed that IRAK1 and IRAK4, but not IRAK2, differentially impacted metabolic regulation. Notably, IRAK4 induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, whereas IRAK1 had the opposite effect. Additionally, IRAK4 led to actin depolarization and vacuole fragmentation. Based on these findings, we develop two yeast-based bioassays to screen for IRAK4 kinase inhibitors: one based on growth recovery and another using a fluorescent reporter. We provide proof-of-concept that both assays are suitable for evaluating IRAK4 function and its pharmacological inhibition.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Marginal reductions were also observed for low pitch (p = .096, = .120), speech presented from a 0.5-meter distance (p = .058, = .147), and unilateral conditions (ps = .066.077, s = .130.142). No group differences emerged for N100 latency. These findings suggest attenuated early auditory responses in ASD to both typical and spatially complex speech cues. Conclusions: Results support predictive coding models proposing reduced sensory precision in ASD. The consistent amplitude attenuation, including near-significant findings, points to subtle but pervasive impairments in early auditory encoding. The use of ecologically valid speech stimuli and portable EEG underscores the translational potential of N100 as a biomarker for early identification and intervention in autism.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we profile the spatial spread of atrophy across the whole brain, determine whether brain degeneration preferentially maps onto specific functional networks, and investigate the relationship between cerebellar and cerebral anatomical changes. Methods: Whole-brain grey and white matter (GM and WM) voxel-based morphometry was performed on 408 individuals with SCA3 (82 pre-ataxic) and 293 controls. The SCA3 cohort was stratified by ataxia severity to investigate disease progression, with cerebellar GM atrophy mapped onto a task-based functional atlas. Volume was correlated with disease duration and intensity. Cerebrocerebellar volumetric covariance was assessed to determine whether atrophy was coupled between infra- and supratentorial regions. Results: The pattern of atrophy is spatially consistent but progressive in magnitude across the disease course. The greatest atrophy was found in the pons, cerebellar WM, and cerebellar peduncles; correlations with disease severity and duration were also strongest in these regions. Cerebellar GM atrophy was greatest in functional regions associated with motor execution and planning, attention, and emotional processing. Sparse cerebral cortical atrophy appears only in the most severe disease subgroup, while striatal atrophy begins in the earliest stages. Reduced cerebrocerebellar structural covariance is observed in SCA3 participants versus controls. Interpretation: While cerebellar and brainstem atrophy become more severe, the pattern of atrophy remains largely consistent as SCA3 progresses. Cerebellar GM degeneration occurs in regions associated with motor, cognitive, and affective control, in line with clinical presentation. Cerebellar atrophy is not directly mirrored by cerebral changes.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

However, even after forming a memory about a certain event, we are often exposed to related information about that same event at later points in time. This additional information sometimes causes one to have to re-evaluate the interpretation of the original event. Over a two-day fNIRS experiment, participants were exposed to events that were subsequently updated with schema-congruent or schema-incongruent additional details. These schema-incongruent additional details make those events more fitting to another schema than originally was the case, meaning that participants would need to dissociate that event from the original schema and re-integrate it with another schema. The fNIRS results showed stronger PFC activity for events updated with schema-congruent compared to schema-incongruent details. When specifically looking at those events that were updated with schema-incongruent details, our results suggest that dissociating an event from the original schema and re-integrating it with another schema was accompanied by an initial PFC decrease early in the trial followed by a PFC increase later in the trial. This was a distinctly different pattern compared to trials in which participants failed to re-integrate the event with another schema, which showed delayed PFC increase with lower amplitude and no initial PFC decrease. Our results refine our understanding of mechanisms of adaptive memory updating in the face of conflicting information.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

H.; Morillon, B.", "abstract": "Speech comprehension relies on contextual lexical predictions to optimize the processing of incoming words. As in other predictive paradigms, it is commonly assumed that prediction error, or surprisal, is weighted by a single summary statistic: uncertainty. Uncertainty reflects the overall unpredictability of the context and is typically quantified using Shannon entropy. However, for predictions involving many alternatives, as in speech, Shannon entropy is an ambiguous measure. We investigated alternative measures of uncertainty, namely the family of Renyi entropies, of which Shannon entropy is a special case. Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 33 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech, we show that, rather than Shannon entropy, contextual lexical uncertainty in speech is best captured by two extremes of the Renyi family. These reflect the probability of the most likely word and the spread across all plausible alternatives, which we term strength and dispersion, respectively. These representations are processed in distinct neural populations in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, with the encoding of dispersion preceding that of strength. Around each word onset, information flows between these clusters in a top-down and subsequently bottom-up sequence. Finally, they interact differentially with word surprisal during word processing. Our findings demonstrate that the brain encodes a multidimensional representation of uncertainty and reveal that multiple summary statistics may coexist in predictive processing. More broadly, this work introduces a flexible framework for characterizing the neural bases of uncertainty. It also highlights the potential mismatch between formal definitions of cognitive variables and their neural implementation.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

V.; Vekony, T.; Fabo, D.; Nemeth, D.", "abstract": "The brain must balance the automatic extraction of environmental regularities with top-down cognitive control, yet the causal neural mechanisms governing this interplay are debated. In particular, the hemispheric contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) remain unresolved. Here, we applied inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC in 95 healthy adults during a probabilistic sequence learning task. We found that inhibiting the right and bilateral DLPFC significantly enhanced statistical learning compared to sham and left DLPFC stimulation. Contrary to the hypothesis that this competition is mediated by the suppression of existing knowledge, episodic memory performance was unaffected across all stimulation groups. These findings challenge a direct episodic gating mechanism and suggest the DLPFC's influence on statistical learning is hemisphere-dependent. As an alternative, we propose that right DLPFC inhibition shifts cognitive processing toward a more exploratory information-sampling strategy, a view supported by our finding of significantly greater reaction time variability in the right and bilateral stimulation groups. Together, our results provide causal evidence for a right-lateralized suppressive influence of the DLPFC on unsupervised learning and suggest its modulatory role is linked to information processing style rather than direct competition with episodic memory systems.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Autophagy is critical for a-Synuclein clearance, yet its real-time dynamics remain challenging to assess in human-relevant systems. Here, we used live-cell imaging to assess autophagy within human neuronal cultures and midbrain organoids (hMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of PD patients carrying a triplication of the a-Synuclein gene (3xSNCA). Using the LC3-Rosella dual-fluorescent reporter, we quantified autolysosomes dynamics in real time. In 3xSNCA neuronal cultures, we detected early autophagy defects. In 3xSNCA hMOs, reduced autolysosome area, increased total and phosphorylated a-Synuclein (pS129), and decreased electrophysiological activity were observed at 50 days of differentiation (DoD). By 70 DoD, autophagy impairment became more pronounced, overlapping with dopaminergic neuron loss. These findings support the use of human iPSCs-derived models to study autophagy dysfunction in PD and demonstrate a temporal correlation between impaired autophagy, a-Synuclein pathology and neuronal degeneration.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a pluripotent-stem-cell-based 3D ectodermal organoid model that faithfully recapitulates early ectodermal patterning of future central nervous system, epidermis and cranial and trunk NC, as well as a diverse selection of NC derivatives offering a comprehensive platform to study neurocristopathies from early induction of pluripotent-like stem cells at the neural plate border to differentiated cells. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion of ~fifty genes, many of which play broad roles during embryogenesis. While DGS is traditionally considered to originate from all germ layers, its clinical manifestations including craniofacial anomalies, cardiac outflow tract defects, thymic hypoplasia and thyroid dysfunction are consistent with tissues requiring NC contributions. This raises the question why DGS mainly manifest in organs of NC origin? Using patient-derived iPSCs, we show that DGS organoids display reduced pluripotency gene expression and impaired maintenance of ectodermal stem cells, leading to defective NC specification, posteriorization of cranial NC, and failure to form cartilage. We identify a small subset of genes within the DGS deletion as potential drivers of these early NC defects. Consequently, impaired NC cells are further affected during cranial and vagal mesenchyme maturation, likely worsened by hemizygosity of additional DGS genes that individually, without the initial NC defect, are insufficient to cause the disease. We hypothesize that DGS is primarily, or possibly entirely, a neurocristopathy.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}

Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) are highly-conserved loci containing human-specific variants and can act as neurodevelopmental enhancers. However, the neurodevelopmental functions of HARs and their mechanism of gene regulation are largely unknown. Here, we show that human (Hs) HAR1984 promotes neurogenesis by influencing species-specific transcription and chromatin interactions. Hs-HAR1984 knock-in chimpanzee (Pt) cortical organoids contain more progenitors and neurons, whereas Pt-HAR1984 knock-in human cortical organoids exhibit the opposite phenotype. Hs-HAR1984 knock-in mice recapitulate increased neurogenesis, producing a thicker cortex with folding. Hi-C reveals HAR1984 exhibits chromatin looping with its target genes ETV5 and TRA2B in human fetal brains, notably reduced in chimpanzee, macaque and mouse neural cells. We show that human-specific mutations in HAR1984 directly promote these interactions, favored by nearby structural variants. Further, we discover that human-specific ETV5 binding auto-regulates enhancer activity. This work demonstrates new molecular mechanisms underlying human-specific neurodevelopment, linking HARs to chromatin architecture, cortical cell fate and expansion and folding of brains.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": ""}
