Modifying the glycocalyx of CAR T cells is unexplored; we report on genome-editing of the MGAT5 gene to abolish human CAR T N-glycan poly-LacNAc modifications. This boosted tumor control in carcinoma and lymphoma models, for donors of whom the non-engineered CAR T cells largely failed in tumor control. More blood-circulating MGAT5 KO CD70 nanoCAR T cells were found, exhibiting potent tumor cell-killing activity ex vivo, while non-glycoengineered CAR T cells faltered. MGAT5 KO CD70 nanoCAR T cells also mediated durable anti-tumor immunity, improving control of secondary carcinoma challenge months later. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed increased mitotic activity and type I interferon signaling, indicating sustained intratumoral activation. The glyco-engineered cells had unaltered antigen sensitivity and dependence on T cell growth factors, preserving key safety features. MGAT5 KO is readily compatible with clinical manufacturing, representing a promising approach to enhance CAR T cell therapy.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

In asexual eukaryotes however, it is unclear how, or if, genetic variation is generated and maintained to promote phenotypic variation. C. albicans , an asexual fungus that causes opportunistic infections in susceptible hosts, has several phenotypic switching systems, including the colony morphology phenotypic switching (CMPS) system. CMPS, a penetrant change in colony morphology on solid medium in vitro , is associated with incipient or fulminant clinical disease. CMPS results in the alteration of additional virulence properties, including drug resistance, that are not tightly correlated with colony morphology. Importantly, it is unknown whether CMPS is a regulated or stochastic process. We found that specific mutants affecting the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway showed an increase in CMPS frequency and CMPS in these mutant backgrounds was associated with changes in rapamycin sensitivity. We also identified growth conditions that promoted CMPS in clinical strains and found that CMPS in these backgrounds was also linked to the TOR pathway through changes in rapamycin sensitivity. These results demonstrate that CMPS promotes phenotypic variation through the TOR pathway, supporting a model that this is a regulated process. Since the TOR growth control pathway is conserved throughout the eukarya, the identification of TOR as a phenotypic diversity regulator likely has broad implications.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

While LKB1 loss-induced polyp formation has been ascribed to non-epithelial tissues, how LKB1 deficiency increases cancer risk of patients by altering the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues remains poorly understood. Methods Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1-deficient mouse small intestinal and human colon organoids. These organoids were characterized by an integrated approach that combines imaging, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and growth factor dependency assays. Our findings were validated in human PJS-derived tissues using immunohistochemistry and linked to colorectal cancer profiles using the TCGA cancer database. Results Our results reveal that heterozygous Lkb1 loss is sufficient to push intestinal cells into a premalignant transcriptional program associated with serrated colorectal cancer, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity. This altered epithelial growth state associates with persistent features of regeneration and enhanced EGFR ligand and receptor expression, conferring niche-independent growth properties to Lkb1-deficient organoids. Moreover, our newly generated LKB1-mutant signature is enriched in sporadic serrated colorectal cancer, and synergistic cooperation of Lkb1-deficiency with mutant Kras was experimentally confirmed by assessing organoid growth properties and transcriptomes. Conclusions Heterozygous loss of LKB1 pushes intestinal cells into a chronic regenerative state which is amplified upon loss-of-heterozygosity.

We sequenced recombined immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH), TCRbeta (TRB), and TCRdelta (TRD) genes in parallel from all subjects, including select B- and T-cell subsets in most cases, with a focus on their hypervariable CDR3 regions, and correlated this AIRRseq data with demographics and clinical findings from subjects' electronic health records. We found that age affected NAb levels in vaccinees but not infectees. Intriguingly, we found that vaccination, but not infection, has a substantial effect on non-productively recombined IGHs, suggesting a vaccine effect that precedes clonal selection. We found that repertoires' binding capacity to known SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ TRBs performs as well as the best hand-tuned fuzzy matching at predicting a protective level of NAbs, while also being more robust to repertoire sample size and not requiring hand-tuning.

Using colorectal cancer (CRC) as a model, we developed a machine learning (ML) framework, CANDiT (Cancer Associated Nodes for Differentiation Targeting), to selectively induce differentiation and death of cancer stem cells (CSCs)--a key obstacle to durable response. Centering on one node, CDX2, a master differentiation factor lost in high-risk, poorly differentiated CRCs, we built a transcriptomic network to identify therapeutic strategies for CDX2 restoration. Network-based prioritization identified PRKAB1, a stress polarity sensor, as a top target. A clinical-grade PRKAB1 agonist reprogrammed transcriptional networks, induced crypt differentiation, and selectively eliminated CDX2-low CSCs in CRC cell lines, xenografts and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Multivariate analyses in PDOs revealed a strong therapeutic index, linking efficacy (IC) to the biomarker-defined CDX2-low state. A 50-gene response signature--derived from an integrated analyses of all three models and trained across multiple datasets--revealed that CDX2 restoration therapy may translate into a [~]50% reduction in recurrence and mortality risk.

For example, tiles of mineralized polygonal structures called tesserae occur at cartilage surfaces in chondrichthyans, but recent studies showing trabecular mineralization at elasmobranch cartilage surfaces suggest that tesserae are not as common as previously thought. Also, while areolar mineralized tissue in elasmobranchs is generally considered a unique, shared chondrichthyan feature, some chondrichthyan species demonstrate bone-like tissues in both a specific region of tesserae termed the cap zone and continuous (not tiled) mineralized neural arches. To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans, adult skeletal tissues in a holocephalan chimaera (spotted ratfish) and two elasmobranchs (small-spotted catshark and little skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Endoskeletal mineralization in the ratfish, catshark, and little skate varied both quantitively in tissue mineral density (TMD), and qualitatively in the morphology and localization of mineralized structures and tissues. For example, TMD of several skeletal elements was significantly lower in ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate. Trabecular and areolar mineralization were shared among these extant chondrichthyan species, but tesserae and bone-like tissues were not. Interestingly, three separate analyses argued that the adult chimaera endoskeleton has features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. Generally, this study proposes specific terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton and infers those states in ancestral chondrichthyans with reference to fossil data.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying nonlinear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with synthetic data derived from simulations using ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results: We suggest scrutinizing these characteristics, such as size, diversity, and noise, of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets. Here, we demonstrate how to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance. We conduct a proof-of-concept study on three simple, but widely used systems and four real-world datasets. We find a strong interdependency between synthetic dataset size and diversity effects. Good transfer learning settings heavily rely on real-world data characteristics as well as the data's coherence with the dynamics of the model underlying the synthetic data. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning.

During the last two decades, new E. coli multi-drug resistant clones such as ST131, particularly its clades C1 and C2, have spread globally, as has their generally less resistant sister clade ST131-A. Phylodynamic coalescent modeling has indicated exponential growth in the populations corresponding to these clades during the early 2000s. However, it remains unknown how their transmission dynamics compare to viral epidemics and pandemics in terms of key epidemiological quantities such as the basic reproduction number R0. Estimation of R0 for opportunistic pathogenic bacteria poses a difficult challenge compared to viruses causing acute infections, since data on E. coli infections accumulate with a much longer delay, even in the most advanced public health reporting systems. Here, we developed a compartmental model for asymptomatic gut colonization and onward transmission coupled with a stochastic epidemiological observation model for bacteremia and fitted the model to annual Norwegian national E. coli disease surveillance and bacterial population genomics data. Approximate Bayesian Computation leveraged by the ELFI software package was used to infer R0 for the pandemic ST131 clades. The resulting R0 estimates for ST131-A, ST131-C1 and ST131-C2 were 1.47 (1.31-1.60), 1.18 (1.12-1.20) and 1.13 (1.08-1.20), respectively, indicating that the ST131-A transmission potential can be even comparable to pandemic influenza viruses, such as H1N1. The significantly lower transmissibility of ST131-C1 and ST131-C2 suggests that their global dissemination has been aided by antibiotic selection pressure and that they may be more effectively transmitted through healthcare facilities instead of primarily community-driven transmission. In summary our results provide a fundamental advance in understanding the relative transmissibility of these opportunistic pathogens and that it can vary markedly even between very closely related E. coli.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the fungal-specific functions of the endolysosomal network require further investigation. Here, we systematically characterized the endolysosomal network in Fusarium graminearum using the dynamin-like GTPase FgVps1 as an entry point. Functional analysis revealed that FgVps1 is essential for the release of retromer- and sorting nexin-associated vesicles from endosomes, thereby facilitating the trafficking of v-SNARE protein FgSnc1 and promoting fungal development and pathogenicity. Building on this, we further discovered that the retromer core subunit FgVps35 interacts with sorting nexin FgSnx4 and identified the corresponding interaction interface, which involves residues FgVps35N383 and FgSnx4E373. In addition, the ESCRT-II component FgVps36 bridges ESCRT-I and -III and interacts with both FgVps35 and FgSnx4, thereby preventing their mislocalization to the vacuole and maintaining endolysosomal trafficking. Notably, we demonstrated that inhibition of FgVps1 function, either by blocking its GTPase activity or by disrupting actin polymerization, effectively impaired endosomal trafficking and attenuates fungal pathogenicity.

This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

The, thoracic NSCs grow at a faster rate compared to those in the abdominal region. We show that in addition to its role in apoptosis and nervous system remodeling, abdA also plays an instructive role in regulating the rate of NSC size increase and its timely entry into mitosis. Weak expression of abdA in larval abdominal NSCs was sufficient to retard the rate of their size increase and delay their mitotic entry compared to thoracic NSCs. Knockdown of abdA in NSCs enhances their rate of size increase leading to early mitotic entry, while ectopic abdA expression in thoracic NSCs reduces their size and delays their mitotic entry.

This assumes that a pair of heterozygous deleterious mutations in trans behave effectively as homozygotes, so that the fitnesses of trans heterozygotes are lower than those of cis heterozygotes. We examine the properties of the two different models, using both analytical and simulation methods. We show that the gene model predicts positive linkage disequilibrium (LD) between deleterious variants within the coding sequence, under conditions when the sites model predicts zero or slightly negative LD. We also show that focussing on rare variants when examining patterns of LD, especially with Lewontin's D' measure, is likely to produce misleading results with respect to inferences concerning the causes of the sign of LD. Synergistic epistasis between pairs of mutations was also modeled; it is less likely to produce negative LD under the gene model than the sites model.

By developing a circuit topology-based fold analysis approach, combined with atomistic simulations, we reveal that site-specific phosphorylation facilitates formation of non-local contacts, leading to the emergence of disordered compact topologies with significant entanglement, which are distinct from solvent exposed topologies. While we observe that the topological buildup of solvent-exposed states is similar in different phosphovariants, it depends on the exact phosphorylation site for the disordered compact states. This study thus reveals the complex regulatory role of the GR phosphorylation and introduces a unique analysis framework that can be broadly applied to studying topological dynamics of disordered proteins.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

However, in contrast to ion channels, the understanding of the fundamental principles governing ion transport through these nanopores remains in its early stages. In this study, we integrate experimental, numerical, and theoretical approaches to elucidate ion transport mechanisms in these biological nanopores. We identify and characterise two distinct nonlinear phenomena: open-pore rectification and gating. Through extensive mutation analysis of aerolysin nanopores, we demonstrate that open-pore rectification is caused by ionic accumulation driven by the distribution of lumen charges. Additionally, we provide converging evidence suggesting that gating is controlled by electric fields dissociating counterions from lumen charges, promoting local structural deformations. Our findings establish a rigorous framework for the characterisation and understanding of biological ion transport processes, enabling the design of adaptable biosensors. We illustrate this by optimizing an aerolysin mutant for computing applications, paving the way for novel nanofluidic technologies.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Understanding the cargo features is essential for elucidating autophagys function in specific physiological or pathological contexts. Here we present a simple and rapid method for isolating LC3B-positive autophagosomes from the tissues of GFP-LC3 transgenic mice, a widely used autophagy reporter model, without relying on the complex ultracentrifugation steps required by traditional methods. When combined with quantitative proteomics, this approach enables efficient in vivo characterization of autophagy cargoes. We applied this method to establish autophagy cargo profiles in skeletal muscle during starvation and exercise, two physiological conditions that activate autophagy, and identified distinct cargo selection patterns, with significantly higher levels of ER-phagy and ribophagy observed during starvation. We further revealed the ER-phagy receptors TEX264 and RETREG1/FAM134B as potential mediators of the elevated ER-phagy under starvation. In summary, we report an efficient workflow for in vivo autophagy cargo characterization and provide detailed analysis and comparison of cargo profiles under starvation and exercise conditions.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

While current weakly supervised learning methods significantly reduce the need for extensive annotations and leverage large quantities of annotation-free whole-slide images (WSIs) to enhance classification robustness, they often fall short in segmentation accuracy. We attribute this limitation to the optimization goals in classification, which tend to focus solely on the most representative features--an approach that is particularly inefficient for WSIs with gigapixel resolution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on streaming convolution, an end-to-end method for WSI training. Our contributions include the Rectified LogSumExp (ReLSE) pooling method and adaptive pseudo annotation generation for self-training, both designed to encourage models to learn from sub-representative features.

Two such predictions are validated here: selective disruption of the basal ganglia indirect pathway, supported by diffusion MRI in 51 DOC patients; and increased cortical inhibitory-to-inhibitory synaptic coupling, supported by RNA sequencing from resected brain tissue in six human coma patients and a rat stroke model. The model also identifies high-frequency subthalamic nucleus stimulation as a promising DOC intervention, supported here using electrophysiology data from human patients.

However, with 70% of current microbial reference data derived from Europeans and the Americans, East Asia, especially China, remain underrepresented. Methods We constructed the human Gut Microbiome Reference (GMR), comprising 478,588 high-quality microbial genomes from Chinese (247,134) and non-Chinese (231,454) populations. Species-level clustering and protein annotations were performed to characterize microbial diversity and function. We further integrated novel genomes into taxonomic profiling database and validated the improvements using independent cohort data. Results The GMR dataset spans 6,664 species, including 26.4% newly classified species, and encodes over 20 million unique proteins, with 47% lacking known functional annotations. Notably, we observed that 35.35% and 32.46% of species unique to Chinese and non-Chinese populations, respectively.

However, assigning samples to new taxa requires a cautious and rigorous approach. Historically, taxonomy has heavily relied on morphological traits, which can be subjective and may not always correspond to underlying genetic divergence. This challenge is especially pronounced in organisms with limited diagnostic morphological traits. A prime example is the poriferans of the genus Oscarella (Homoscleromorpha), where species delimitation often depends on insufficient morphological features and genetic data. In this study, we addressed these challenges by integrating a comprehensive genetic dataset, including both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, with systematic photographic documentation of 192 specimens collected in Western Mediterranean Sea (Bay of Marseille, France). This method allowed us to provide a more robust assessment of Oscarella diversity, leading to the identification of four species new to science. In addition, our phylogenetic multigene analyses enabled us to propose a meaningful evolutionary scenario for color polymorphism. Additionally, our data showed the critical limitation in current methodologies for Oscarella studies, such as the low resolution of the widely used cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1/COI) gene, the lack of genetic data for many species, and the insufficient information regarding their geographical distribution.

Although there is substantial information on the effects of B. burgdorferi lipoproteins (BbLP) on immune modulatory pathways, the application of multi-omics methodologies to decode the transcriptional and proteomic patterns associated with host cell responses induced by lipoproteins in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) has identified additional effectors and pathways. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) performed on BMDMs treated with various concentrations of borrelial lipoproteins revealed macrophage subsets within the BMDMs. Differential expression analysis showed that genes encoding various receptors, type I IFN-stimulated genes, signaling chemokines, and mitochondrial genes are altered in BMDMs in response to lipoproteins. Unbiased proteomics analysis of lysates of BMDMs treated with lipoproteins corroborated several of these findings. Notably, dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) gene was upregulated during the early stages of BMDM exposure to BbLP. Pre-treatment with benzylidene-3-cyclohexylamino-1-indanone hydrochloride (BCI), an inhibitor of both DUSP1 and 6 prior to exposure to BbLP, demonstrated that DUSP1 negatively regulates NLRP3-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and positively regulates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and those encoding Ccl5, Il1b, and Cd274. Moreover, DUSP1, IkB kinase complex and MyD88 also modulate mitochondrial changes in BMDMs treated with borrelial lipoproteins.

Its risk is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and flooding, a common public health challenge in large urban centers together with urban environmental modifications, and socio-economic factors. This retrospective observational research investigated the association between the distribution of leptospirosis cases and three contextual factors -drainage, soil impermeability and social vulnerability-in Campinas city, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We hypothesized that the number of cases will increase in areas that are impermeable and in proximity to drainage systems as well as where social vulnerability is high. We investigated the associations based on 83 autochthonous cases, comparing cases where infection risk was linked to contact with floodwater or mud (n=54) to cases associated with other exposures (n=29). Spatial statistics were used to map disease distribution and investigate the relationship between leptospirosis cases and contextual factors. Our results indicate that the density of leptospirosis increases near drainage systems with risk peaking at 200 m, in areas of greater social vulnerability with increased risk due to floodwater or mud exposure in highly vulnerable regions, and in highly waterproofed urban areas. This study demonstrated that leptospirosis risk remains highly determined by living and working conditions. These findings support targeted strategies to deliver effective prevention, treatment and control interventions in highly populated urban areas of the Global South and similar contexts.

Secreted roGFP2-Orp1 can inform about local diffusion barriers and protein cysteinyl oxidation rate in the apoplast, after pre-reduction.

To address this, we defined the transcriptional landscape of human trophoblast organoids infected with seven diverse teratogenic viruses. We found that herpesviruses, including HSV-1, HSV-2, and HCMV, did not trigger a typical interferon (IFN) response. Instead, they activated the expression of DUX4 and its downstream target genes, collectively known as DUX4-stimulated genes (DSGs). This program was highly specific for trophoblasts and was associated with cells containing low viral transcripts following HSV-1 infection, suggesting an antiviral activity. Screening of highly expressed DSGs revealed that many of them exhibited anti-herpesvirus activity, indicating the existence of an alternative antiviral pathway similar to the IFN-stimulated gene response.

First, we measured the frequency response relating thorax deformation to wing stroke angle in sacrificed honeybees and army cutworm moths. Using these data, we developed a linear model of the flight system, which we then extended to incorporate nonlinear effects associated with large wing stroke angles. Our findings revealed that both species flap below the linear resonance of the wing hinge. At larger angles, nonlinear aerodynamic damping reduces the resonant frequency, causing both species to flap above wing hinge resonance. We discuss how wing-thorax coupling and muscle dynamics may cause the resonant frequency of the entire flight system to deviate from that of the wing/wing hinge system.

Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic \"foreground\" sounds are often masked by more stationary \"background\" sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

So far, hyperscanning studies have examined synchrony across different dyads and tasks, leading to inconsistencies in experimental findings and limiting cross-study comparability. This variability has hindered efforts to develop a unified theoretical framework for neural synchrony. This study investigated the effects of interpersonal closeness and social interactivity on neural synchrony using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. We recorded brain activity from 142 dyads (70 close-friend, 39 romantic-partner, and 33 mother-child dyads) across three interaction conditions: video co-exposure (passive), a cooperative game (structured active), and free interaction (unstructured active). Neural synchrony was computed between participants' bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) using wavelet transform coherence. Results showed that true dyads exhibited significantly higher synchrony than non-interacting surrogate dyads (qs < .001, Cohen's d range: 0.17-0.32), particularly in combinations involving the right IFG. Mother-child dyads displayed lower synchrony than adult-adult dyads at the network (p < .001) and local level of analysis, pointing to possible developmental and maturational influences on neural synchrony. At the network level, synchrony was highest during video co-exposure, followed by the cooperative game and free interaction (p < .001). However, left IFG-left IFG and left IFG-right TPJ synchrony peaked during the cooperative game. Although these effects were statistically significant, the overall impact of social interactivity on interpersonal neural synchrony was small, suggesting that the complexity and richness of social exchanges alone may not strongly influence neural synchrony in naturalistic contexts. By providing an experimental framework to systematically compare different types of dyads and interaction contexts, this study lays the groundwork for future hypothesis-driven hyperscanning research, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human social interactions.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Actin filaments continuously assemble and disassemble, enabling cells to rapidly reorganize their cytoskeleton. Filament severing accelerates actin turnover, as both polymerization and depolymerization rates depend on the number of free filament ends - which severing increases. Here, we use light to control actin severing in vitro by locally generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with photosensitive molecules such as fluorophores. We see that ROS sever actin filaments, which increases actin polymerization in our experiments. However, beyond a certain threshold, excessive severing leads to the disassembly of actin networks. Our experimental data is supported by simulations using a kinetic model of actin polymerization, which helps us understand the underlying dynamics. In cells, ROS are known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

Thus, it is biogeographically unique due to its specialised anatomy and biology as a volant rodent. As a result of habitat fragmentation and destruction, Siberian flying squirrels experience severe and ongoing population declines throughout most of their distribution. While considered Least Concern throughout their immense Eurasian distribution, this species is red-listed as Vulnerable and even Critically Endangered in parts of its range. More knowledge about the population structure and overall biology is needed to improve conservation efforts for this umbrella and flagship species of old-growth boreal forests. Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of any Pteromyini, represented by P. volans (Uoulu_pteVol_1.0). The final assembly has a total length of 2.85 Gbp in 19 chromosome-scale scaffolds with only minor differences in the chromosomal structure compared to other Sciuridae. All chromosome-scale scaffolds show indications for telomeres at both ends; the N50 value and busco as well as k-mer completeness scores are high with 157.39 Mbp and 97 - 99 %, respectively, indicating chromosome-level quality of the assembly. Based on whole-genome data from 17 rodent species, P. volans clusters according to known evolutionary relationships.

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has opened a new window for mesoscopic (<0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging of the angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long, often exceeding 40 minutes, making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods, such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders, are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brain's venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999) in vivo. Furthermore, leveraging the fact that MRI allows coverage of the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans.

In target-pursuing insects, including dragonflies and hoverflies, Small Target Motion Detector (STMD) neurons are found in the optic lobes and are believed to be presynaptic to Target Selective Descending Neurons (TSDNs) that project to motor command centres. While STMDs respond robustly to target motion -- even when displayed against moving backgrounds -- TSDN target responses are modulated by background motion. Depending on whether the background motion is syn- or contra-directional to the target motion, the response of the TSDNs is either suppressed or facilitated (amplified). This suggests that TSDNs not only receive input from STMDs but also from neurons sensitive to background motion, but this neural circuit is not clearly understood. To explore the underlying neural mechanisms, we developed three candidate TSDN circuit models -- which combine input from bio-plausible STMDs and optic flow-sensitive Lobula Plate Tangential Cells (LPTCs) in different ways -- and fitted them to published electrophysiology data from hoverfly TSDNs. We then tested the best-fitting models against new electrophysiological data using different background patterns. We found that the overall best model suggests simple inhibition from LPTCs with the same preferred direction as the STMDs feeding into the TSDN. This parsimonious mechanism can explain the facilitation and suppression of TSDN responses to small targets, may inform similar studies in other animals and open new avenues for bio-inspired robotics.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a functional interplay between two key splicing regulators, RBM39 and serine/arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), and show that dual targeting of these factors severely compromises splicing fidelity in high-risk neuroblastoma. We use the molecular glue indisulam to degrade RBM39 and repurpose the clinical ALK inhibitor alectinib which potently inhibits SRPK1. Co-treatment with indisulam and alectinib inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G2/M arrest in multiple cancer cell lines, including MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. RNA sequencing revealed enhanced splicing defects preferentially in DNA repair and genome maintenance related genes following combination treatment, leading to R-loop accumulation and increased DNA damage. In the Th-MYCN/ALKF1174L neuroblastoma mouse model, combination therapy induced complete tumour regression and significantly improved survival rates compared with monotherapies.

ScRNA-seq analysis of epidermal TRM revealed that local antigen experience in the skin resulted in an enhanced differentiation signature in comparison with bystanders. Upon recall, TRM displayed greater proliferation dictated by affinity of antigen experienced during epidermal development. Finally, local antigen experienced TRM differentially expressed TGF{beta}RIII, which increases avidity of the TGF{beta}RI/II receptor complex for TGF{beta}. Selective ablation of Tgfbr3 reduced local antigen experienced TRM capacity to persist, rendering them phenotypically like bystander TRM.

We used here replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and simulated tempering (ST) simulations to explore the conformational landscape of a set of nine cyclic peptides. The N-ter to C-ter backbone cyclized peptides of seven to ten residues were previously designed for a high conformational stability with a mixture of L and D amino acids. Their experimental NMR structures were available in the protein data bank (PDB). For each peptide we tested several force fields, Amber96, Amber14, RSFF2C and Charmm36m in implicit and explicit solvent. We find that the variability of the free energy maps obtained from several protocols is larger than the variability obtained by just repeating the same protocol. Running multiple protocols is therefore important for the convergence assessment of REMD or ST simulations. The majority of the free energy maps showed clusters with a high RMSD to the native structures, revealing the residual flexibility of this set of cyclic peptides. The high RMSD clusters had in some cases the lowest free energy, rendering the prediction of the native structure more difficult with a single protocol. Fortunately, the combination of four implicit solvent REMD and ST simulations, mixing the Amber96 and Amber14 force fields, predicted robustly the native structure. As implicit solvent in the REMD or ST setup are up to one hundred times faster than explicit solvent simulations, so running four implicit solvent simulations is a good practical choice. We checked that the use of an explicit solvent REMD or ST simulation, taken alone or combined with implicit solvent simulations, did not significantly improved our results. It results that our combination of four implicit solvent simulations is tied in terms of success rate with much more expensive combinations that include explicit solvent simulations. This may be used as guideline for further studies of cyclic peptide conformations.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

After telencephalic brain injury, neural stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular zone (VZ) become activated, proliferate, and generate new neurons essential for brain repair. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes remain unclear. Here, we investigate the transcriptional regulation of midkine-a (mdka), a heparin-binding growth factor gene encoding the secreted protein Midkine-a (Mdka), which is upregulated after injury in radial glial cells (RGCs), the bona fide NSCs of the adult zebrafish telencephalon. Using genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, we identified six putative cis-regulatory elements (CREs) associated with mdka. Transgenic assays revealed that these CREs coordinate mdka expression during both development and regeneration. In the zebrafish embryo, CRE2, CRE3, CRE4, and CRE6 are required for EGFP expression in the nervous system, with CRE3 showing the strongest activity. In the adult telencephalon, CRE2, CRE4, and CRE6 are active in NSCs, with CRE2 best mimicking mdka expression at the ventricular zone. Importantly, individual CREs could not fully reproduce endogenous mdka expression, especially under regenerative conditions. In contrast, a combined CRE2346 construct closely recapitulated mdka expression in both the embryo and adult telencephalon under homeostatic conditions. These results suggest that mdka expression is controlled by a modular and cooperative cis-regulatory architecture that enables precise gene regulation during development, telencephalon homeostasis, and regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

The BART and EBNA transcription units are characterised by extensive alternative splicing. We generated LCLs with B95-8 EBV-BACs, including one engineered with \"barcodes\" in the first and last repeat of internal repeat 1 (IR1), and analysed their EBV transcriptomes using long-read nanopore direct RNA-seq. Our pipeline ensures appropriate mapping of the W promoter (Wp) 5' exon, and corrects W1-W2 exon counts that misalign to IR1. This suggests that splicing across IR1 largely includes all W exons, and that Wp-derived transcripts more frequently encode the EBNA-LP start codon than Cp transcripts. Analysis identified a short variant of exon W2 and a novel polyA site before EBNA2, provided insights into BHRF1 miRNA processing and suggested co-ordination between polyA and splice site usage, although improved read depth and integrity are required to confirm this. The BAC region disrupts the integrity of BART transcripts through premature polyadenylation and cryptic splice sites in the hygromycin expression cassette.

However, there are a growing number of experimental databases in biology. While these databases provide more observations, they often do not have observations that match the system of interest exactly. For example, database measurements might be collected at different experimental conditions or on a different scale compared to the system of interest. Here, we investigate what information can be gleaned from generalizing databases across these differences in the context of modeling a specific system - cell signaling. Ultimately, our goal is to better determine models of specific systems, thereby increasing their utility. To do this, we propose a novel, multiscale, probabilistic framework. We use this framework to integrate measurements of protein structure from the Protein Data Bank and measurements of amino acid sequence from the Universal Protein Resource into the parameter inference of cell signaling models. Then, we quantify exactly what information is gained from these measurements when modeling cell signaling. We choose to investigate the utility of these databases in the context of dynamic cell signaling models because experimental measurements of the variables of interest, protein dynamics, are still quite limited. We find that we can successfully integrate measurements from these databases to significantly improve parameter estimation of signaling models. The impact of sequence and structure measurements on model predictions depends on the sensitivity of the prediction to perturbations in the parameter values.

These results firmly establish the critical contribution of IG light chain polymorphism in Ab repertoire diversity, with important implications for investigating Ab responses in health and disease.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

As PD has no significant cure or treatments to this day, early diagnosis, or detections of PD within potential patients is a crucial task to maximize the effect of mediations which are implemented to achieve temporal prohibition of motor failure progression. In recent research, alongside conventional diagnosis methods based on neurological examinations or MRI based brain imaging, use of deep learning based artificial intelligence models, such as ResNet, are repeatedly reported to have significant progress in detecting PD in early stages with high performance. Based on current success, this research attempted to further enhance AI-driven PD diagnosis by developing a deep learning based causal representation learning framework that extracts only highly robust PD features from simple hand drawings. Specifically, convolutional VAE based reconstruction and information theory based weakly supervised learning were linked with causal representation learning methods to distinguish significant PD features from geometrical features within hand drawing images. Not only aiding conventional tests for PD diagnosis, but also giving reliable representations of PD features such as tremor and rigidity, developed framework was found to achieve high performance in both retrieving latent factors of PD in images and predicting PD diagnosis results.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

These are computationally convenient and portable, but the discoveries resulting from their rejections are not immediately interpretable, and require post-processing as \"clumping\" and \"fine mapping.\" An interesting alternative is provided by conditional independence hypotheses: their rejections lead to the identification of distinct signals across the genome, accounting for measured confounders, and pointing to separate causal pathways. An obstacle to the wide adoption of this approach has been that it requires access to individual level data. Overcoming this barrier, recent work has shown how summary statistics resulting from the standard marginal GWAS analysis can be used as input of a procedure to test conditional independence hypotheses while controlling the false discovery rate. This secondary analysis requires sampling of synthetic negative controls (knockoffs) from a distribution determined by the linkage disequilibrium patterns in the genome of the population under study. In prior work, we have pre-computed this distribution for European genomes, starting from information derived from the UK Biobank. Thus, researchers working with GWAS in a European population can carry out a knockoff analysis with minimal computational costs, using the distributed routine GhostKnockoffGWAS. Here we introduce and release a new software (solveblock) that extends this capability to a much richer collection of studies. Given a set of genotyped samples, or a reference dataset, our pipeline efficiently estimates the high-dimensional correlation matrices that describe dependencies across the genome, making rather common sparsity assumptions. Taking this sample-specific estimate as input, the software identifies groups of genetic variants that are highly correlated, and uses them to define an appropriate resolution for conditional independence hypotheses. Finally, we compute the distribution for the exchangeable negative controls necessary to test these hypotheses. The output of solveblock can be passed directly to GhostKnockoffGWAS, allowing users to carry out the complete analysis in a two step procedure. Simulations, based on five UK Biobank sub-populations, illustrate the method's FDR control. The analysis of 26 phenotypes of varying polygenicity in British individuals, results in {approx} 19 additional discoveries, compared to standard marginal association testing.

While progress has been made toward understanding the sex determination and differentiation of this species, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that warm temperature promotes gonadal transformation by up-regulating testicular differentiation genes such as dmrt1/sox9a in ovaries. Trpv4, a Ca2+-permeable cation channel expressed in gonads, is highly sensitive to ambient temperature and mediates warm temperature-driven sex change of ricefield eel. In female fish reared at cool temperature, injection of Trpv4 agonist into the ovaries leads to significant up-regulation of testicular differentiation genes, and in female fish exposed to warm temperature, Trpv4 inhibition or trpv4 siRNA knockdown suppresses warm temperature-induced male gene expression. pStat3 signaling is downstream of Trpv4 and transduces Trpv4-controlled calcium signaling into the sex determination cascades. Inhibition of pStat3 activity prevents the up-regulation of testicular differentiation genes by warm temperature treatment and ovarian injection of Trpv4 agonist, whereas activation of pStat3 is sufficient to induce the expression of male genes, in the presence of Trpv4 antagonist. pStat3 binds and activates jmjd3/kdm6b, an activator of the male gene dmrt1. Consistently, ovarian injection of Kdm6b inhibitor blocks the up-regulation of testicular differentiation genes by warm temperature treatment. We propose that environmental factors such as temperature promote gonadal transformation of ricefield eel by inducing the expression of male pathway genes in ovaries via the Trpv4-pStat3-Kdm6b-Dmrt1 axis.

Unfortunately, some of the most useful technologies to advance genome editing in E. coli have not yet been ported into other bacterial species. For instance, the addition of bacterial retrons to the genome editing toolbox has increased the efficiency of recombineering in E. coli by enabling sustained, abundant production of ssDNA recombineering donors by reverse transcription that install flexible, precise edits in the prokaryotic chromosome. To extend the utility of this technology beyond E. coli, we surveyed the portability and versatility of retron-mediated recombineering across three different bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacillota and Actinomycetota) and a total of 15 different species. We found that retron recombineering is functional in all species tested, reaching editing efficiencies above 20% in six of them, above 40% in three of them, and above 90% in two of them.

To address this question, we recorded flight paths and pulse emissions of Rhinolophus nippon and Miniopterus fuliginosus as they navigated seven obstacle-rich arenas in complete darkness. Using a machine learning model - a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) - we show that bat flight is governed by a consistent internal policy. Trained on only part of each trajectory, our model accurately predicted future flight paths across arenas and individuals, preserving key features such as turning direction, obstacle-avoidance arcs, and velocity profiles. The model's ability to faithfully reproduce species-specific strategies despite differences in sonar and flight morphology supports the existence of structured internal control in bat navigation. Our approach reveals that bat flight, while appearing improvisational, is in fact guided by internal policies that can be directly inferred from trajectory data, without relying on handcrafted assumptions. Furthermore, the data-driven model developed here enables a priori testing of flight-path reorganization by virtually imposing environmental changes and analysing the resulting predicted trajectories, providing a powerful tool for biomimetic robotic design and for forecasting ecological responses to landscape transformation.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Specifically, feedforward connectivity from low-level visual areas to vOT was observed for all conditions, with the strength of orthographic information flow to left superior temporal cortex (ST) modulated by stimulus word-likeness. Conversely, feedback flow from left ST to vOT appeared for pseudowords that allow top-down linguistic constraints to facilitate reading, and occurred later for word-like than complete pseudowords. Our findings suggest that left vOT during word reading functions in a hybrid manner: operating in efficient feedforward mode for familiar word recognition while flexibly recruiting bidirectional processing for unfamiliar pseudowords.

These medically important protists lack conventional transcriptional control due to their unusual genome organization. Consequently, tRNA modifications may provide an additional mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. One such modification is queuosine (Q), which is incorporated at anticodon wobble position 34 of specific tRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that Q-tRNA levels increase substantially during Leishmania differentiation from the insect stage to the mammalian-infective stage. Mutant cells lacking the enzyme responsible for Q incorporation, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), exhibit substantial changes in the proteome during differentiation in vitro. Specifically, downregulated proteins were enriched in NAU codons, whereas upregulated proteins predominantly contained NAC codons. We further evaluated the effect of Q-tRNA depletion on macrophage infections and using mouse model. Although LmxTGT2 knockout parasites exhibited normal growth and differentiation in vitro, they demonstrated impaired survival within macrophages and reduced pathogenicity in mice. Taken together, these results highlight the critical role of Q-tRNA modification in maintaining translational balance and reveal a novel level of gene expression regulation facilitating parasite adaptation to changing environments and contributing to Leishmania virulence.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Yet, how distinct facets of this variability evolve from childhood to older adulthood remains poorly understood, limiting mechanistic models of neurocognitive aging. Here, we characterize lifespan neural variability using an integrated empirical-computational approach. We analyzed high-density EEG cohort data spanning 111 healthy individuals aged 9-75 years, recorded at rest and during passive and attended auditory oddball stimulation task. We extracted scale-dependent measures of EEG fluctuations amplitude and entropy, together with millisecond-resolved phase-synchrony networks in the 2-20 Hz range. Multi-condition partial least squares decomposition analysis revealed two independent lifespan trajectories. First, slow-frequency power, variance and complexity at longer timescales declined monotonically with age, indicating a progressive dampening of low-frequency fluctuations and large-scale coherence. Second, the temporal organization of phase-synchrony reconfigurations followed an inverted U-trend: young adults exhibited the slowest yet most diverse switching--characterized by low mean but high variance and low kurtosis of jump lengths at 2-6 Hz and the opposite pattern at 8-20 Hz--whereas children and older adults showed faster, more stereotyped dynamics. To mechanistically account for these patterns, we fitted a ten-node phase-oscillator model constrained by the human structural connectome. Only an intermediate, metastable coupling regime reproduced the empirical combination of reduced low-frequency variability and maximally heterogeneous synchrony dynamics observed in young adults, while deviations toward weaker or stronger coupling mimicked the childrens and older adults profiles. Our results demonstrate that development and aging entail changes in the switching dynamics of EEG phase synchronization, by differentially sculpting stationary and transient aspects of neural variability. This establishes time-resolved phase-synchrony metrics as sensitive, mechanistically grounded markers of neurocognitive status across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by such fungi act as semiochemicals that inhibit pathogens, with VOC production influenced by physical interactions between competing fungi. This study explores the interaction between the beneficial soil fungus Trichoderma hamatum GD12, previously shown to antagonize crop pathogens such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, to test the hypothesis that its antagonistic effect is mediated by volatile chemical signalling. A GD12 mutant deficient in the chitinolytic enzyme N-acetyl-{beta}-glucosaminidase {Delta}Thnag::hph, which shows reduced biocontrol activity, was also examined. RESULTS: In dual-culture confrontation assays, co-inoculation of GD12 and S. sclerotiorum led to fungistatic interactions after 7 days, whereas{Delta} Thnag::hph showed no antagonism, indicating a loss of antagonistic function. VOCs collected from individual and co-cultures were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing significant differences in VOC production between treatments, with VOC production notably upregulated in the GD12 + S. sclerotiorum co-culture. Peak production of 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one occurred 17 days post-inoculation. This upregulation was absent in the{Delta} Thnag::hph co-culture, suggesting VOCs may drive antagonism. Synthetic VOC assays revealed several compounds inhibitory to S. sclerotiorum, including 1-octen-3-one, which also arrested the growth of key fungal pathogens (Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenopeziza brassicae, and Gaeumannomyces tritici). Structural insights into 1-octen-3-one's antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the antagonistic properties of T. hamatum GD12 against crop fungal pathogens can, in part, be attributed to VOC production.

K.; Aru, J.", "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics are known for their profound effects on consciousness and are gaining renewed interest as potential psychiatric treatments. These advances underscore the need to clarify the mechanisms of action of these compounds. This systematic review compiles and critically evaluates 23 in vitro and 26 in vivo electrophysiological studies on psychedelic compounds, with an emphasis on layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex, where 5-HT2A receptors are densely expressed. Our findings reveal that psychedelics exert complex, heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and network oscillations. These results challenge the simplified view that psychedelics uniformly increase cortical excitability. Instead, they modulate both excitatory and inhibitory processes in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner, with evidence for biphasic, dose-dependent, and context-sensitive responses. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors leads to intricate calcium signaling, downregulating excitatory currents and firing rates in many neurons, while enhancing glutamate release and activating a subset of projection fibers. Modulation of presynaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors appears central to these effects, and some indirect evidence supports the involvement of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors. These insights prompt a reassessment of prevailing models of psychedelic action and underscore the value of incorporating electrophysiological data into psychedelic neuropharmacology.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Results Among highly cited authors, retraction rates were 3.3% in men and 2.9% in women; among all authors, rates were 0.7% for both genders. Differences varied by field: women's rates were at least one-third lower than men's (R < 0.67) in Biology, Biomedical Research, and Psychology (R < 0.67), but higher (R > 1.33) in Economics, Engineering, and Information and Communication Technologies.

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2 breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

To assess reproducibility, we extracted claims from 400 articles on the Drosophila immune response to bacteria and fungi and performed preliminary verification by comparing these claims to other published literature in the field. Using alternative approaches, we also experimentally tested some unchallenged claims, which had no published follow-up. The intent of this analysis was to centralize evidence on insights and findings to improve clarity for scientists that may base research programs on these data. All our data are published on a publicly available website associated with this article (https://ReproSci.epfl.ch/) that encourages community participation. This article provides a short summary of claims that were found to have contradictory evidence, which may help the community to assess past findings on Drosophila immunity and improve clarity going forward.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Given this challenge, understanding the mechanisms of driving chemoresistance is essential for guiding our chemotherapeutic choice. Emerging evidence suggests that methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive glycolytic byproduct, may play a role in modulating tumor behavior and therapy response, offering a novel angle for patient stratification. Our recent study indicates that the accumulation of MG in PDAC cells leads to MG-induced cellular stress associated with gemcitabine (GEM) resistance. The primary objective of this study was to identify a predictive transcriptomic signature associated with MG stress in PDAC and compare it to the recently reported GemPred signature.\n\nPatients and methodsMG stress classification was applied to the Puleo et al. cohort (n=309), enabling differential gene expression analysis and the development of a prognostic 16-gene MG-GEM signature through LASSO Cox regression. The signature was validated for survival prediction and diagnostic performance using cross-validation and ROC analysis.\n\nResultsThe prognostic significance and predictive performance of the signature were validated in both internal and external cohorts, including this from the phase III PRODIGE-24/CCTG PA6 trial, composed of 167 GEM and 183 FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) patients. Importantly, the MG-GEM signature demonstrated independent and complementary predictive value relative to GemPred.\n\nConclusionWe present a novel clinically actionable 16-gene transcriptomic signature reflecting MG-induced stress that enables robust stratification of PDAC patients likely to benefit from adjuvant GEM therapy.

MG-GEMs predictive capacity was further validated in the independent PRODIGE-24/CCTG PA6 clinical trial data.

S.", "abstract": "Background: Aging is linked to widespread changes in sensorimotor control, leading to functional decline, mobility limitations, and an increased risk of falls. Certain aspects of the neurological examination and assessment of the motor system are subjective, underscoring the need for objective and quantitative tools to evaluate sensorimotor performance. Methods: To address this, we designed three experimental tasks using the vBOT planar robotic manipulandum to compare sensorimotor performance in healthy young adults (<35 years) and older adults (>60 years). Unlike previous assessments, our tasks uniquely integrate simultaneous bimanual control and altered dynamic conditions to comprehensively assess sensorimotor capabilities. The first task involved a bimanual de novo motor learning paradigm in which participants coordinated both hands to control a virtual 2D arm and performed 400 center-out and out-to-center trials. The second task assessed unimanual control using the right hand to perform center-out movements to eight targets. It introduced dynamic forces simulating object manipulation during the final 200 trials. The third task was similar but applied a viscous force field in the last 200 trials. It also included a scoring mechanism rewarding brisk movements, thereby encouraging participants to perform closer to their maximum capabilities. In this task, performance was also compared between the dominant and non-dominant arms. Group comparisons and within-subject differences were evaluated using appropriate statistical analyses. Results: Each task effectively identified age-related differences, but the viscous resistance task proved particularly sensitive, capturing significant age-related declines in force generation and movement duration. This scoring approach likely amplified performance differences, highlighting its suitability for detecting subtle effects of aging. Older adults generally showed slower movement, longer task completion times, reduced peak forces, and prolonged reaction times. However, individual performance varied, with some older participants performing on par with younger individuals. In the third experiment, the dominant arm showed consistently better performance than the non-dominant arm, underscoring the sensitivity of the metrics to lateralized differences in motor control. Conclusions: These findings suggest that robot-based tasks have potential to quantify age-related differences in sensorimotor control and may support more precise clinical assessments.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

While both classical and AI-based structural approaches have recently provided crucial insights into ligand-LRR-RK binding mechanisms, our understanding of ligand perception by LRR-RPs remains limited. In contrast to LRR-RKs, many LRR-RPs typically embed one or more loopout regions in their extracellular domains that are crucial for functionality. Here, we employed an AI-based approach to reveal a novel ligand-binding mechanism shared by the Arabidopsis LRR-RPs RLP23 and RLP42 - the PRRs for the short peptide ligands nlp20 and pg13, derived from NECROSIS- AND ETHYLENE-INDUCING PEPTIDE 1-like proteins (NLPs) and fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs), respectively. This mechanism relies on a beta-strand interaction with the N-terminal part of the island domain (ID) loopout, which adopts an antiparallel beta-sheet conformation. Additionally, we investigated the larger and more complex binding interface of RLP32 - the PRR for proteobacterial TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 1 (IF1), a folded protein ligand that requires its tertiary structure for recognition. Finally, we describe a mechanistic role of the ID for co-receptor recruitment conserved across LRR-RPs. Together, our results shed light on the ligand-binding mechanisms and receptor complex formation of this important class of PRRs. This opens avenues for a molecular understanding of the plant-pathogen co-evolution, as well as the engineering of plant immune receptors for crop disease resistance.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Altering leaf shape could be a simple strategy to reduce LAI. To test this, we developed 204 near-isogenic soybean lines differing in leaf morphology by introgressing narrow-leaf alleles from donor parents PI 612713A and PI 547745 into the elite, broad-leaf cultivar LD11-2170. We evaluated the lines across two locations and two row spacings (38-cm and 76-cm) to assess how reduced investment in leaf area influences canopy architecture, crop physiology, and yield. Narrow-leaf lines showed 13% lower peak LAI and 3% lower digital biomass compared to broad-leaf counterparts yet maintained yield parity (5,756 vs. 5.801 kg ha-1, p = 0.43) across environmental conditions. Photosynthetic capacity remained largely unchanged, with narrow-leaf lines showing modest increases in electron transport rate and leaf mass per area. Narrow-leaf lines achieved similar canopy closure timing despite lower LAI, suggesting architectural compensation mechanisms. The most striking difference appeared in seed packaging, with narrow-leaf lines producing 34% four-seeded pods compared to only 1.8% in broad-leaf lines. There was a nonlinear relationship between peak LAI and yield, with optimal LAI values of 9-11 varying by environment. These findings show that the single-gene GmJAG1-controlled narrow-leaf trait offers a tractable strategy for reducing LAI and maintaining high productivity. This could reduce the metabolic costs associated with excessive canopy development and support sustainable agriculture under increasing climate variability.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the role of Enterobacter sp. SA187 (SA187), a plant growth-promoting bacterium, in enhancing growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana under elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) conditions. While SA187 inoculation did not have major effects under ambient CO2, it was found to significantly enhance root and shoot biomass, and to increase N- and reduce C-contents under eCO2. Moreover, transcriptomics and metabolomics suggested that SA187 modulated phytohormonal homeostasis, with activation of the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling pathways, and increased primary metabolism including the TCA cycle, N and carbohydrate metabolisms. Finally, the growth-promoting effects of SA187 were shown to be mediated through ethylene-dependent pathways, as evidenced with the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2-1 which did not show similar benefits in plant fresh weight and altered gene expression. This beneficial plant-microbe interaction under eCO2 in a non-leguminous plant highlights a novel aspect of microbial influence on plant physiology in the context of climate change.

We here investigate whether epithelial-mesenchymal (E/M) state, a major axis of heterogeneity in cancer cells, influences signaling response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells; a signaling axis and disease combination of high clinical significance. We perform confocal imaging of cells immunofluorescently labeled with 'common markers' (DNA, F-actin) and 'variable markers' of phospho-signaling (p-AKT-S473, p-AKT-T308, p-ERK1, p-S6) at short intervals (2, 5, 20, 60 minutes) post-EGF stimulation. Single-cell quantitation of cell spatial context-, morphology-, marker level-, and subcellular localization-features was performed on >64,000 cells, fueling representation learning to map all cells within a common, condition-invariant 'E/M state landscape'. Comparison of E/M state-dependent variations in EGF-stimulated phospho-signaling revealed consistent differences: epithelial cells exhibited rapid, transient activation, while mesenchymal cells showed delayed and sustained responses, particularly in the PI3K/AKT pathway. Subcellular localization of p-AKT also varied dramatically, with epithelial cells establishing early membrane and punctate localizations, while mesenchymal cells maintained sustained nuclear and ruffle-associated AKT activity. Using regression-based 'computational multiplexing' to infer all phospho-signaling feature values concurrently in all cells, we defined a multi-molecular 'signaling landscape' and compared signaling response trajectories between epithelial and mesenchymal cells, confirming robust differences in multi-molecular signaling. EGF-induced signaling heterogeneity is thus substantially predetermined by pre-existing E/M states, which dictate distinct intracellular signal localization and signal propagation trajectories. These findings suggest that understanding how heterogeneous E/M states within tumors shape distinctive oncogenic signaling responses will be vital to understanding differential sensitivity to anti-oncogenic signal therapies.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a conceptual framework to model phase-separation nucleation and validate the nucleation distance of a P-body in living yeast cells. Using microfluidic cell sorting and quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we found that smaller cells contain fewer, larger P-bodies, whereas larger cells form more, smaller granules. Monte Carlo simulations of P-body nucleation accurately recapitulate these cell size-dependent patterns, revealing a nucleation distance of approximately 2.2 micrometers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increasing vacuolar volume reduces the effective cytoplasmic space and elevates the number of P-bodies, although cell size remains the dominant determinant.

This includes the formation of membrane-less cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures called stress granules (SGs) that sequester and protect mRNAs encoding many housekeeping genes. SGs are not static biomolecular condensates but transform into solid states during a maturation phase. Although SG maturation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative pathologies, little is known about the mechanisms and physiological relevance underlying the maturation process. Here we show that yeast SGs mature into a solid-like state during long-term stationary phase stress, which delays SG disassembly and cell cycle restart. Profiling of phosphorylation sites during stationary phase revealed that SG maturation is driven by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of the SG proteome. Indeed, upon stationary phase the catalytic PKA subunits condense in SGs where they maintain kinase activity, while during this time cytoplasmic PKA is inhibited. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of key SG components, like the pyruvate kinase Cdc19, is necessary and sufficient for its timely accumulation in SGs, where Cdc19 assembles into amyloid-like structures. Importantly, inhibiting PKA during long-term stationary phase prevents SG maturation, delaying ordered re-start of cell growth after re-feeding. Taken together, these results describe a SG maturation mechanism, selectively activated during chronic stress, that preserves SG integrity and promotes cell survival.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that prior to acquiring malignant features, a transient mechanical crosstalk between AJs and FAs provides a proliferative advantage to mammary epithelial cells overactivating the Src kinase proto-oncogene. We show that AJs and FAs are transiently under high tension during the early phase of cellular transformation. Preventing the strengthening of tensile forces at FAs by knocking down PXN or inhibiting FAK activity, suppresses the cell abilities to build up tension at AJs and to grow. Conversely, disrupting the trans junctional homophilic interactions between cadherin extracellular domains with EGTA or preventing AJ strengthening by knocking down P-cadherin, impedes the transient increase in tensile forces at FAs, the activation of EGFR-ERK and MRTF-A-SRF signalling and cell proliferation. Moreover, knocking down E-cadherin, the sole classical cadherin in Drosophila, inhibits the growth of Src-overexpressing tissues in vivo.

Our objective was to better understand the expression patterns and molecular function of AP-2{beta} in breast cancer.

High TFAP2B was also evident in high proliferation tumours lacking ER, with no specific enrichment for lobular histology. Restoring AP-2{beta} expression to highly proliferative ER+ breast cancer cell lines that lack it strongly induced apoptosis. Conversely, reducing AP-2{beta} expression in a molecular apocrine breast cancer cell line model potently inhibited proliferation and cell viability associated with downregulation of MYC oncogene expression. To identify genomic determinants of AP-2{beta} function in molecular apocrine cells in relation to other known transcriptional regulators, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) for AP-2{beta}, AR, GATA3, FOXA1, and acetylated lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27ac, a marker of active enhancers and promoters). When present alone, AP-2{beta} was preferentially enriched at active promotors. Enhancers bound by AR, GATA3 and FOXA1 were more active when AP-2{beta} was present and genes that define the molecular apocrine phenotype were significantly more likely to have active enhancers co-occupied by all four transcription factors. We conclude that AP-2{beta} plays a context-dependent role in breast cancer and propose that activation of enhancers defining molecular apocrine identity is a key function of AP-2{beta} in the biology of this subtype of breast cancer.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

However, standard language models such as transformers are best suited for sequentially structured data with well defined absolute or relative positional relationships, while single cell RNA data have orderless gene features. Molecular-interaction graphs, such as gene regulatory networks (GRN) or protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, offer graph structure-based models that effectively encode both non-local gene-gene dependencies, as well as potential causal relationships. We introduce GREmLN, a foundation model that leverages graph signal processing to embed gene-regulatory network structure directly within its attention mechanism, producing biologically informed single cell specific gene embeddings. Our model faithfully captures transcriptomics landscapes and achieves superior performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines on both cell type annotation and graph structure understanding tasks. It offers a unified and interpretable framework for learning high-capacity foundational representations that capture complex, long-range regulatory dependencies from high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic data. Moreover, the incorporation of graph-structured inductive biases enables more parameter-efficient architectures and accelerates training convergence.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

M.; Wang, W. H.; Zhang, S.", "abstract": "Background and Objectives: The skin is the largest organ of the human body, capable of protecting it from external harm. However, due to trauma, paralysis and other external factors, skin damage can occur, scars may form. Exosomes have regenerative functions and, as a cell-free therapy, show great potential for wound healing. In this study, we investigate that whether different umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (UCMSCs-Exos) can accelerate the healing of skin. Methods: In our study, UCMSCs were cultured from newborns and Cultured with thrombin. Exosomes were isolated from mesenchymal stem cells culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation. The impact of exosomes on Hacat cell migration was evaluated in vitro. Additionally, the wound healing capacity of exosomes was evaluated in vivo using a mouse skin injury model. Results: Compared to UCMSCs-Exos, T-UCMSCs-Exos significantly promoted cell proliferation and migration of cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that T-UCMSCs-Exos can accelerate wound closure and enhance collagen maturation, promoting angiogenesis in the vascularized wound area. These results indicate that T-UCMSCs-Exos have a good potential for accelerating wound healing and minimizing scar formation. Conclusions; Our research indicate that thrombin pre-UCMSCs, the production of exosomes significantly increased. The prepared T-UCMSCs-Exo can accelerate skin wound healing during the process of skin injury repair, promote angiogenesis, and facilitate the reconstruction of epidermis and dermis as well as hair follicle regeneration. These findings demonstrate that T-UCMSCs-Exos for skin wounds are a promising cell-free therapy that can be applied in the treatment of skin injuries.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Several mechanisms are known to repress retrotransposon transcription during development which are generally thought to persist thereafter. However, integration of retrotransposable elements into host genomes has also provided a major source of genetic variation across evolution. This has generated many sequences that have acquired advantageous host functions, but little is known about retrotransposon expression and mobility in adult stem cells or about how these processes might be dynamically regulated. Here we describe the landscape of somatic retrotransposition in haematopoietic stem cells and identify a previously unrecognised pathway which links cytokine signalling, RNA-modulating HNRNP complexes and repression of retrotransposon activity. Activation of JAK2, by thrombopoietin or gain-of-function JAK2 mutations, triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of HNRNPA1 that represses expression of ERVs, LINEs and SINEs and reduces insertional mutagenesis. This pathway coordinates retrotransposon activity with cellular context and state and provides a mechanism for protecting the haematopoietic stem cell genome.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

In Antarctica, changing sea ice dynamics threaten ice-dependent species. Behavioural adjustments could help mitigate these threats, but how they link to demographic rates, as well as potential thresholds, remains elusive. Long-term studies and circumpolar approaches could address this challenge. Here, we used a 15-year dataset (2010-2024) comprising over 23,000 foraging trips from Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in East Antarctica, to investigate how the species responds to variable sea ice conditions during reproduction via flexible foraging effort (trip duration). We identified a non-linear relationship between sea ice concentration (SIC) and foraging effort in the absence of landfast ice, a feature predicted to define the species' future habitat during chick-rearing. Minimal effort occurred around 10-20% SIC and increased more than two-fold in the presence of landfast ice, or of heavy pack-ice (>76% SIC). This relationship was sex-specific, with females showing greater environmental sensitivity. Through a circumpolar synthesis, we also showed that foraging effort during chick-guard predicted reproductive success across ten populations spread across the Adelie penguin's range (marginal R2 = 0.74). Threshold analysis revealed that reproductive success remains comparatively high until chick-guard foraging trip duration exceeds ~29 hours (approximately three times minimum values), beyond which demographic performance declines at a stronger rate. Our findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Adelie penguin's responses across a large environmental gradient, revealing that behavioural flexibility can buffer moderate changes but has clear limits. As it mediates the relationship between environmental variability and reproductive success, our results also establish trip duration as a valuable early warning indicator for population responses to environmental change.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Although some studies have investigated TB and COVID-19 co-infection in terms of immune responses, microbial dysbiosis in such cases remains unexplored. In this study, we understand the interface between TB and COVID-19 by systematically inspecting the microbial composition of sputum samples collected from four groups of individuals: TB only, COVID-19 only, and both TB and COVID-19 (TBCOVID) infected patients, and uninfected group (Controls). Besides metagenomic analysis of the microbiome of these sputum samples, we also performed whole genome sequencing analysis of a subset of TB-positive samples. Different bioinformatic analyses ensured data quality and revealed significant differences in the microbial composition between Control vs. disease groups. To understand the effect of COVID-19 on TB, we compared TBCOVID vs. TB samples and observed (i) higher read counts of TB-causing bacteria in the TBCOVID group, and (ii) differential abundance of several taxa such as Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Escherichia coli, Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. Functional profiling with PICRUSt2 revealed significantly elevated pathways in the TBCOVID group relative to TB group, some of which are related to metabolism of pulmonary surfactant lipids (e.g., Cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) biosynthesis pathway with fold change of 7.46). Further clustering of these significantly elevated pathways revealed a sub-cluster of individuals with adverse treatment outcomes. Two individuals in this sub-cluster showed prevalence of respiratory pathogens like Stenotrophomonas maltophilia - knowing such information can help personalize the antibiotic treatment to match the pathogen profile of the individual.

Using a chemical reaction network (CRN) model with growth-phase-dependent rate-modifying functions, GEAGS accurately reproduces the observed oscillations and identifies amino acid recycling and growth phase transition as key drivers. We reduce the model to an effective form for practical use and demonstrate its adaptability by applying it to layered feedback circuits, resolving longstanding mismatches between model predictions and measured dynamics.

Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool allow animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness. Here we discover a bacterial anti-phage defense system named Clover that overcomes this tradeoff by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of Clover phage restriction in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal p3diT (5'-triphosphothymidyl-3'5'-thymidine) that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-EM structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function.

Using evolutionary convergence analysis on 7099 S. aureus genomes we uncovered frequent, reversible loss-of-function (LoF) mutations caused by simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Functional assays showed SSRs are potent, length-dependent switches that activate and deactivate genes, a mechanism exemplified by frequent LoF mutations in mutL (DNA mismatch repair) that causes a hypermutator phenotype. Analysis of over 600 episodes of human S. aureus colonisation and infection confirmed laboratory findings and showed that mutL SSR hypermutability behaves like a phase-variable evolutionary capacitor that unlocks subsequent adaptive SSR variations. We also experimentally demonstrate that SSRs facilitate foreign DNA uptake (hsdR restriction endonuclease) and lead to gentamicin-resistant small colony variants that are known to cause persistent infections (menF menadione biosynthesis). Furthermore, the phenomenon is widespread, with 27 of 29 diverse human microbiome samples harbouring S. aureus with distinct SSR subpopulations, indicative of niche-specific adaptations. Thus, SSRs are potent reservoirs of previously unrecognized S. aureus genetic heterogeneity that confer rapid adaptive capacity, including in antigens targeted by past vaccine trials. A deeper understanding of SSR evolutionary trajectories has the potential to improve treatments and to anticipate S. aureus responses to new therapies.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that M. aurita forms a genetically distinct clade, diverging from Manis pentadactyla sensu stricto approximately 1.2 million years ago during the early Pleistocene through genome resequencing, mitochondrial phylogenetics, and single-copy ortholog analyses. Morphometric analyses, including linear cranial and external measurements as well as 3D geometric morphometrics, consistently differentiate M. aurita from M. pentadactyla, with significant variation in skull size, nasal morphology, and external traits such as ear size and tail length. Population genomic analyses reveal that M. aurita exhibits reduced recent inbreeding compared to M. pentadactyla, yet both species show declining effective population sizes since the Middle Pleistocene. Negligible interspecific gene flow highlights their long-term evolutionary isolation. Genomic islands of divergence are enriched for olfactory receptor genes, suggesting possible ecological adaptation. Therefore, we formally establish Manis aurita (common name Himalayan pangolin) as a valid species under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, rejecting its former synonymy with M. pentadactyla and M. indoburmanica.

During normal growth and development, RDE-3 pUGylates transposon RNAs to silence transposons and protect genomic integrity. How C. elegans identifies specific RNAs for pUGylation and whether the pUGylation system is used for other biological purposes is not yet known. Here we show that pUGylation contributes to antiviral immunity in C. elegans: During infection of C. elegans with Orsay virus, RDE-3 adds pUG tails to viral RNAs, which converts these RNAs into templates for RdRP-based antiviral siRNA production, thereby limiting viral replication. We present evidence that MUT-15 is critical for viral pUGylation because it interacts with RDE-3 and the NYN domain-containing endonuclease RDE-8, thus bridging the enzymes that cleave and pUGylate viral RNA, ensuring efficient antiviral immunity.

Nevertheless, the GARN technique also left room for improvements when considering its final 3D structure for predicted molecules, which can be more refined by presenting more elements, also known as pseudoatoms. In this study, we improved the last version of the technique GARN, which is GARN2, enhancing the visualization of the 3D model by adding more pseudoatoms to the helices in our technique GARN3. In GARN3, we also added a machine learning prediction model to improve the scoring calculation, aiming to improve the prediction of new molecules. In our tests, we demonstrated good results when comparing GARN3 with other techniques in the literature. GARN3, in the same way as GARN2, presents better results for large molecules.

DGAT constructs heterogeneous graphs integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and spatial information, encoded using graph attention networks. Task-specific decoders reconstruct mRNA and predict protein abundance from a shared latent representation. Benchmarking across public and in-house datasets, including tonsil, breast cancer, glioblastoma, and malignant mesothelioma, demonstrates that DGAT outperforms existing methods in protein imputation accuracy. Applied to ST datasets lacking protein measurements, DGAT reveals spatially distinct cell states, immune phenotypes, and tissue architectures not evident from transcriptomics alone.

Three-way (3WJ) and four-way (4WJ) junctions are dynamic, multi-stranded structures containing an open cavity at the centre. We have previously demonstrated that supramolecular dinuclear metallo-cylinders bind well inside 3WJ cavities, having an optimally complementary size and shape match, cationic charge to bind the anion, as well as the ability to pi-stack with the branchpoint nucleobases. Herein we show that a longer metallo-cylinder with a similar but extended central pi-surface, binds to both 3WJ and 4WJ structures with good selectivity over double-stranded DNA. Experimental investigations, informed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reveal that while this longer cylinder can bind 3WJs as the previously studied cylinders, the extended pi-surface of the cylinder now also facilitates 4WJ binding. The simulations capture two metastable 4WJ conformations - one resembling a 3WJ, and another where the extended length enables the cylinder to angle into and stabilise a rhombus-shaped 4WJ cavity. The ability to tune the structure of supramolecular assemblies is important for targeting different DNA structures with varying specificity and in this work we demonstrate the usefulness of overall length as a parameter for modulating DNA binding.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Similarly, membrane-embedded DNA nanotechnology is increasingly used to modulate cellular behaviour and communication. However, there is a gap in knowledge in how PEG-lipid formulations can be optimised for both liposome properties and control of selective DNA hybridisation. To address this, we systematically investigated the effect of liposome PEG content on DNA mediated tethering of liposomes to glass surfaces. We formulated liposomes of two different lipid compositions (DOPE/DOPC or DPhPC), with varying amounts of PEGylated lipid (0-50%). We measured the effect of increased PEG content on liposome size and polydispersity through dynamic light scattering (DLS). Small amounts of PEG (0-20%) introduced repulsive forces that reduced size, while large amounts of PEG (30-50%) increased polydispersity. PEG-liposomes were then decorated with cholesterol-DNA strands and labelled with either intercalating lipid dyes or fluorescently labelled lipids. Binding to surfaces via complementary DNA strands was quantified using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We found that PEGylation of DNA-liposomes could either block or enhance surface binding, depending on the amount of PEG. DNA-liposomes with reduced surface binding included DPhPC/DiD with 10% or 20% PEG-lipid. In contrast, DNA-liposome surface binding increased for DOPE/DOPC/DiD with increasing PEG%. This study highlights that while PEG can act to stabilise liposome formulations, its ability to block specific DNA binding interactions on membranes is variable and dependent on membrane composition.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have highlighted its potential anti-cancer activity in various in vitro and in vivo models. In this study, we evaluated the anti-breast cancer activity of MON and 37 synthetic analog compounds using cell monolayer and organoid models. Through a mini-ring cell viability assay, several compounds were identified that were more potent and selective against breast cancer cells compared to non-cancerous cells, surpassing the activity of parent MON. MON and these compounds induced significant DNA fragmentation, reduced cell migration, and downregulated SOX2 expression. Furthermore, MON and the most potent analog, compound 12, reduced the percentage of CD44+/CD24-/low stem-like cells and diminished cell self-renewal properties. Proteomics analyses revealed that several pathways, including extracellular matrix organization, were significantly dysregulated by MON and compound 12 in breast cancer cells. Among these, TIMP2, a protein associated with the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis, was identified as one of the most prominently upregulated proteins by MON and compound 12 in MDA-MB-231 cells. This finding was also validated in other breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. To simulate breast cancer metastasis to the brain, a human Hybrid Organoid System: Tumor in Brain Organoid (HOSTBO) model was developed. MON and compound 12 significantly reduced Ki-67 expression within the HOSTBOs, and compound 12 significantly downregulated SOX2 expression. Collectively, MON and compound 12 significantly reduced the proliferation of breast cancer stem-like cells in the organoid models, inhibited their migration, and dysregulated markers associated with stemness, demonstrating their potential as anti-metastatic agents and warranting further clinical development.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

Enzymatic depolymerization offers a viable strategy for PU waste valorization. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of reliable high-throughput screening (HTS) assays capable of precise and quantitative evaluation of enzymatic activity. Current enzyme screening assays face significant limitations due to poor substrate relevance and inadequate quantification methods. Here, we present a novel HTS assay featuring a chemically defined, synthetic poly (ethylene adipate)-based PU substrate that enables unambiguous structure-activity analysis and direct quantification of degradation products (adipic acid and ethylene glycol). Coupled with this substrate is a highly sensitive fluorescence-based detection cascade, in which released ethylene glycol is stoichiometrically converted to resorufin via a two-enzyme system (glycerol dehydrogenase and diaphorase). This assay overcomes key limitations of commercial substrates (e.g., Impranil DLN) by providing quantitative, real-time monitoring of PU hydrolysis with molecular precision. Validation with known PU-degrading enzymes demonstrated that the assay can sensitively distinguish differences in enzymatic activity with high reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. Our platform enables rapid, cost-effective screening of enzyme libraries and engineered variants, significantly advancing enzyme discovery and optimization efforts.

We investigated the presence of FEC in a range of synthetic and stress-related genetic circuits in continuous culture. Our results reveal that it effectively stabilizes cell populations by mitigating the detrimental trade-offs between growth and gene expression.

Their gut microbiota, shaped by exposure to diverse environments, may act as both reservoirs and vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In this study, we reconstructed 2,516 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 718 gut metagenomes of wild birds to comprehensively profile their resistome and virulome. We identified 5,596 ARG-encoding proteins across 389 distinct ARG types, with multidrug resistance emerging as the most dominant category. Escherichia coli was the principal carrier of ARGs, and genes conferring resistance to elfamycin antibiotics via target alteration were notably widespread-indicating persistent antibiotic selection pressures in avian habitats. Co-occurrence analyses revealed extensive genetic linkage between ARGs, VFGs, and MGEs. Critically, we detected 25 ARG-MGE co-localization events within 5-kilobase genomic regions, highlighting a strong potential for horizontal gene transfer and accelerated resistance dissemination within microbial communities. Of particular concern was the detection of the tetX1 gene-conferring resistance to tigecycline, a last-resort antibiotic-in the gut microbiota of Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Cygnus cygnus. This finding strongly implicates anthropogenic pollution in the spread of clinically relevant ARGs into wildlife and emphasizes the risk of environmental transmission to other hosts, including humans. These results underscore the critical ecological role of wild birds in the global antimicrobial resistance network. As both reservoirs and potential vectors of ARGs, they represent a significant but under-monitored interface between environmental and clinical resistance pathways.

Compost communities were cultivated for 20 weeks at 50 {degrees}C in a membrane bioreactor, with a continuous supply of 2 mg/L diclofenac as the sole carbon source. After two weeks, the microbial community steadily enhanced its ability to remove diclofenac, achieving removal rates up to 60%. The consortium demonstrated flexibility in the degradation of further pollutants, namely sulfamethoxazole, paracetamol, and ciprofloxacin, with changes in their community structure depending on the substrates. In addition, thermophilic isolates Chelatococcus sp. strain D3 and Mycobacterium sp. strain D1 were characterized and demonstrated variation in the first reaction of transforming diclofenac, which is the crucial step in mineralization of this pollutant, resulting in either 4OH-Diclofenac or Diclofenac-Lactam, respectively. Furthermore, Chelotococcus sp. strain D3 demonstrated the capability to catalyze the biotransformation of diclofenac into 4-hydroxydiclofenac in treated wastewater. Notably, this transformation was effectively carried out even at lower temperatures (25 {degrees}C and 37 {degrees}C).

Here, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to identify specific amino acid residues within surface-exposed virulence factors that predict human dissemination phenotypes. Utilizing the whole genome sequences from 299 clinical Bb isolates, we extracted and characterized variants of seven known virulence factors (BB_0406, BBK32, DbpA, OspA, OspC, P66, and RevA). Protein variants were classified based on their association with disseminated versus localized infections using clinical metadata. Cramer's V analysis revealed strong associations between dissemination phenotypes and five adhesins: BBK32, DbpA, OspC, P66, and RevA. We developed ML models using five algorithms with multiple feature selection strategies, achieving robust predictive performance for DbpA, OspC, and RevA variants (all performance metrics >0.7).

To gain insights into how these fungi control their insect hosts, we investigated the metabolome and virulence traits of two potential biocontrol agents from the genus Cordyceps. Virulence assays on beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua, Lepidoptera) revealed varying levels of pathogenicity, with C. javanica BCC 82944 exhibiting a higher virulence than C. blackwelliae BCC 37653, which revealed intermediate pathogenicity. Using state-of-the-art metabolomics, combined with 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) crystallography and comprehensive 1D/2D NMR spectroscopy, we identified diverse metabolites, including the cyclodepsipeptides beauverolides. Cordyceps javanica exhibited remarkable beauverolide diversity, featuring various amino acid rearrangements and fatty acid chain lengths, including three previously undescribed derivatives (1-3). While the main products of C. blackwelliae were diketopiperazines, feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) analysis uncovered the production of unprecedented beauverolides. To explore the functional relevance of these unique natural products, we analyzed the original insect cadavers from which each fungus was isolated. Our results revealed the presence of beauverolides and beauvericins in the host tissue, providing for the first time direct evidence of their involvement in fungal colonization during infection. Notably, not all beauverolides induced insect mortality in vitro, suggesting differentiated biological functions dependent on their amino acid organization. These findings indicate that distinct secondary metabolites may contribute to specific steps of the infection process. Moreover, the detection of species-specific metabolite profiles in the insect corpses suggests that Cordyceps species have developed chemically divergent infection strategies, possibly shaped by host specificity and ecological niche adaptation.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

It is a high-dimensional dataset, meaning it has thousands of gene expression features (predictors) and relatively fewer samples (observations). The dataset contains thousands of genes, making it difficult to identify key biomarkers. The selection of variables is imperative for data reduction and for understanding the modeled relationship. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression is among the modeling approaches that address high throughput data. The data might be divided into different blocks representing different biological pathways or cancer types. Many genes are correlated, which can reduce interpretability. In many areas, including modern biology, variable selection is an important problem. For instance, choosing genetic characteristics for categorization (i.e., identifying harmful bacteria, diagnosing diseases, etc.) is an example of this. Multiblock Lasso (a variant of Lasso regression) is particularly useful when data is structured into blocks (e.g., different biological processes or pathways). It helps in selecting important features across multiple blocks, improving interpretability by grouping related genes, reducing over fitting in high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we apply Multiblock Lasso to extract significant gene features for cancer classification. We preprocess the dataset, define block structures using biological pathways, and optimize the regularization parameters using cross-validation.

A major limitation of these models is that these rd1 strains are not congenic, which prevents the use of appropriate controls. Furthermore, many strains have mutations in other genes which introduces genetic variability and may confound results. To address this issue, we backcrossed the rd1 allele from FVB mice onto a C57BL/6J genetic background over many generations, producing a C57BL/6J.Pde6brd1 strain that was confirmed to be congenic to C57BL/6J mice.

L.; Gupta, V.; Moore, K.; Xue, Y.; Majowka, J.; Veeravalli, S.; Borchert, R.; Pomaville, M.; Chlenski, A.; He, C.; Piunti, A.; Applebaum, M.", "abstract": "MYCN-amplification is a strong predictor of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, an embryonal malignancy that accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Here, we found that MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors had increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) deposition on Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target genes. 5-hmC and H3K27me3, a catalytic product of PRC2, directly co-localized at the nucleosomal level in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Genes with co-localization of 5-hmC/H3K27me3 were involved in development related pathways and were transcriptionally repressed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Inhibition of 5-hmC deposition resulted in a loss of H3K27me3 on protein-coding genes and sensitized neuroblastoma to DNA demethylating agents. 5-hmC deposition predisposed H3K27me3 marked genes to transcriptional activation upon PRC2 inhibition with tazemetostat. Low expression of genes marked by 5-hmC/H3K27me3 was associated with poor clinical outcome. Our results suggest that 5-hmC/H3K27me3 co-operate to repress mediators of development highlighting a novel link between DNA and chromatin modifications with potential therapeutic implications in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "In frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is lost from the nucleus, leading to cryptic exon inclusion events in dozens of neuronal genes. Here, we show that many cryptic splicing events have been missed by standard RNA-sequencing analyses because they are substrates for nonsense-mediated decay. By inhibiting nonsense-mediated decay in neurons we unmask hundreds of novel cryptic splicing events caused by TDP-43 depletion, providing a new picture to TDP-43 loss of function in neurons.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Doallochthonous flows explain deviations from the Redfield ratio in lakes?", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.06.663341", "authors": "Pichon, B.; Guichard, F.; Daufresne, T.; Gounand, I.", "abstract": "Lakes or streams show strong deviations of their stoichiometry compared to the Redfield ratio measured in oceans. Allochthonous inflows of resources might contribute to those deviations directly, by changing composition of detritus in ecosystems, but also indirectly, by shaping local community dynamics and stoichiometric constrains within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we developed a stoichiometric model to understand those direct and indirect mechanisms through which allochthonous inflows affect seston stoichiometry. Our results emphasize that increasing allochthonous inflows promotes heterotrophic functioning, and relax decomposers' carbon limitation. This release of stoichiometric constrain of decomposers (i) destabilizes the aquatic ecosystem by promoting competition between phytoplankton and decomposers, (ii) decreases the ability of the lake to regulate allochthonous flows, and (iii) push seston stoichiometry away from the Redfield ratio. Our study emphasize how the quantity and the stoichiometry of inflows shape community dynamics and the elemental constraints within the ecosystem, and open perspectives for stoichiometry at the landscape extent.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Detection of vasculogenic mimicry in equine ocular, oronasal, and genital squamous cell carcinoma", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.05.663314", "authors": "Schwarz, S.; Kummer, S.; Klang, A.; Walter, I.; Nell, B.; Brandt, S.", "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant tumor disease in horses. It predominantly affects the ocular, oronasal, and anogenital region. Equine SCC is difficult to treat, also because important aspects of SCC development and metastasis are still unclear. We previously provided evidence that equine SCC cells can adopt a stem cell-like phenotype as a hallmark of malignant progression. Here, we investigated whether equine SCCs harbor endothelial-like tumor cells that form an alternative network of pseudo-vessels better known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Following histopathological diagnosis, 43 equine SCCs or precursor lesions (15 ocular, 14 genital, 14 oronasal tumors) were PCR-screened for equine papillomavirus (EcPV) infection. Subsequently, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded-sections of all tumors were analyzed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for endothelial cell marker CD31. Obtained micrographs were evaluated by a scientific board to unanimously identify sections of intact tumor tissue displaying PAS-positive, CD31-negative lumens harboring erythrocytes. Thirteen lesions exhibiting these features were subjected to triple immunofluorescence (IF) staining for CD31, pan-cytokeratin (KRT) and type 4 collagen (Col4) or alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) to confirm the presence of VM, and to determine whether pericytes have a role in this phenomenon. All genital and 50% of oronasal lesions scored positive for EcPV type 2, whilst ocular lesions tested negative. One mandibular SCC harbored EcPV type 5. Six genital, three oronasal, and four ocular tumors unambiguously exhibited VM as revealed by CD31-/PAS+ vessel-like structures containing erythrocytes, the detection of CD31-negative cells lining their lumens, and the presence of Col4 and SMA in this lining. Detection of these two proteins in the context of VM suggests that VM-forming cancer cells recruit pericytes to enhance channel formation and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence of VM in equine cancer, and more generally, SCC in animals.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": ""}
