Its genetic tractability and capacity for whole-system imaging make it well suited for studying neuron replacement, regeneration, and neural circuit function. Here, we present the most comprehensive molecular and spatial characterization of the H. vulgaris nervous system to date. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified eight neuron types, each defined by distinct neuropeptide expression, and further resolved these into fifteen transcriptionally distinct subtypes with unique spatial distributions and morphologies. To investigate the gene regulatory networks underlying neuronal differentiation, we applied trajectory inference, identified key transcription factors, and performed ATAC-seq on sorted neurons to map chromatin accessibility. All datasets are available through an interactive, user-friendly web portal to support broad use by the research community. Together, these resources provide a foundation for uncovering molecular mechanisms that govern nervous system development, homeostasis, and regeneration in H. vulgaris.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts brain responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors and suggest instead that functional organization can arise from a single principle: learning generally useful visual representations subject to local spatial constraints.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of PDE1A in NSCLC. The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated STAT3 pathway. This work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides therapeutic strategies for treating NSCLC patients with metastasis.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Dysregulated protein synthesis has been implicated in several disorders characterized by memory deficits. In contrast to mRNA methylation such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) that was widely studied in memory, the regulation and function of mRNA acetylation in memory remain largely unknown. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), the only known form of RNA acetylation in eukaryotes, has recently been shown to regulate mRNA stability and translation efficiency. In this study, we identified the ac4C epitranscriptome through ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq) in the homogenates and synaptosomes of mouse hippocampus, a brain region critical for spatial memory. The task of Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to induce and evaluate memory acquisition and forgetting processes. Interestingly, the levels of ac4C mRNA were upregulated in the synaptosomes after memory formation but returned to normal levels after memories were naturally forgotten. The dynamic changes of ac4C-mRNAs regulated by memory were validated by ac4C dot-blot, Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and acRIP-qPCR analysis. We further demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer, in mouse hippocampus is important for spatial memory via regulating memory-related mRNAs, proteins, and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we generated a freely-accessible website (http://ac4catlas.com) that included the dataset of ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampus.

We investigated the neural basis of cognitive control in the ACC of rats performing an adjusting-amount delay discounting task. Decision-making in this this task can be guided by using either a lever-value tracking strategy, requiring a  resource-based form of cognitive effort or a lever-biased strategy requiring a  resistance-based form of cognitive effort. We found that ACC ensembles always tightly tracked lever value on each trial, indicative of a resource-based control signal. These signals were prevalent in the neural recordings and were influenced by the delay. A shorter delay was associated with devaluing of the immediate option and a longer delay was associated with overvaluing of the immediate option. In addition, ACC theta (6-12Hz) oscillations were observed at the choice point of rats exhibiting a resistance-based strategy. These data provide candidates of neural activity patterns in the ACC that underlie the use of  resource-based and  resistance-based cognitive effort.

To understand the contributions of various brain cells to the spreading of S pathology, we examined the metabolism of S aggregates in neuronal and glial cells. In neurons, while the full-length S rapidly disappeared following S PFF uptake, truncated S accumulated with a half-life of days rather than hours. Epitope mapping and fractionation studies indicate that S fibrils internalized by neurons was truncated at the C-terminal region and remained insoluble. In contrast, microglia and astrocytes rapidly metabolized S fibrils as the half-lives of S fibrils in these glial cells were <6 hours. Differential uptake and processing of S fibrils by neurons and glia was recapitulated in vivo where injection of fluorescently labeled S fibrils initially accumulated in glial cells followed by rapid clearance while neurons stably accumulated S fibrils at slower rate. Immunolocalization and subcellular fractionation studies show that internalized S PFF is initially localized to endosomes followed by lysosomes. The lysosome is largely responsible for the degradation of internalized S PFF as the inhibition of lysosomal function leads to the stabilization of S in all cell types. Significantly, S PFF causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons. In summary, we show that neurons are inefficient in metabolizing internalized S aggregates, partially because S aggregates cause lysosomal dysfunction, potentially generating aggregation-prone truncated S. In contrast, glial cells may protect neurons from S aggregates by rapidly clearing S aggregates.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Using dual RNAseq of the root organs harboring rhizobia or nematodes, we identified genes from plant host, rhizobia, and nematode whose expression differed between parasite-infected and -uninfected plants, and between plants inoculated with different rhizobial strains. At the site of host-parasite interactions (in nematode galls), hundreds of host genes and few nematode genes differed in expression between host plants inoculated with different rhizobia strains. At the site of host-mutualist interactions (in rhizobia nodules), hundreds of host genes and few rhizobial genes responded to parasite infection. The vast majority of parasite-induced changes in host gene expression depended on the resident rhizobia strain. We additionally observed differences in parasite load and in some root architecture traits between plants inoculated with different rhizobia strains, showing that genetic variation in a mutualistic symbiont impacted parasite colonization.

Custom designed enzymes can produce tailor-made biocatalysts with potential applications extending beyond natural reactions. However, current design methods require testing of high numbers of designs and mostly produce de novo enzymes with low catalytic activities. As a result, they require costly experimental optimization and high-throughput screening to be industrially viable. Here we present rotamer inverted fragment finder diffusion (Riff-Diff), a hybrid machine learning and atomistic modelling strategy for scaffolding catalytic arrays in de novo proteins. We highlight the general applicability of Riff-Diff by designing enzymes for two mechanistically distinct chemical transformations, the retro-aldol reaction and the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. We show that in both cases it is possible to generate catalysts exhibiting activities rivalling those optimized by in-vitro evolution, along with exquisite stereoselectivity. High resolution structures of six of the designs revealed an angstrom level of active site design precision.

We collected evaluations for 138 social features from GPT-4V for images (N=468) and videos (N=234) that are derived from social movie scenes. These evaluations were compared with human evaluations (N=2254). The comparisons established that GPT-4V can achieve human-like capabilities at annotating individual social features. The GPT-4V social feature annotations also express similar structural representation compared to the human social perceptual structure (i.e., similar correlation matrix over all social feature annotations). Finally, we modeled hemodynamic responses (N=97) to viewing socioemotional movie clips with feature annotations by human observers and GPT-4V. These results demonstrated that GPT-4V based stimulus models can also reveal the social perceptual network in the human brain highly similar to the stimulus models based on human annotations.

In order to predict and adapt to the sensorimotor consequences of our actions, compelling behavioral studies in humans, non-human primates, and in rodents have shown the existence of internal models -- predictive models of our body in the environment. These internal models are theoretically used to compute an updated state estimate with prediction errors. Here, we directly test whether such errors are encoded in primary somatosensory (S1) or motor (M1) cortex during a motor adaptation task in mice. Using control theory-derived features that include prediction errors, we find that functionally distinct neurons are mapped onto specific computational motifs. We find that layer 2/3 population dynamics encode command-like signals and sensorimotor prediction errors (SPEs). S1 neurons encode SPEs more prominently than M1, and the neural latent dynamics change in S1 more than in M1 during this within-session learning. Then we asked, in which coordinate frameworks are such errors computed? To do this, we developed a novel 50-muscle model of the adult mouse forelimb that is capable of studying motor control and learning in a physics simulator. We identify both high-level 3D position and muscle spaces as coordinate frameworks for SPEs.

However, assessing whether an in-vitro cellular model is effectively capturing in-vivo biology is challenging. An in-vitro model is transportable to an in-vivo phenotype of interest if perturbations impacting the in-vitro phenotype also impact the in-vivo phenotype with mechanism-consistent directionality and effect sizes. We propose a framework; Gene Perturbation Analysis for Transportability (GPAT), to assess model transportability using gene perturbation effect estimates from perturbation screens (in-vitro cellular phenotypes) and loss-of-function burden tests (in-vivo phenotypes). Using UK Biobank whole-genome sequence data and data from published genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we evaluated transportability of in-vitro cellular models to in-vivo human phenotypes. In hypothesis-driven analyses, we found evidence that higher lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in-vitro is a transportable model for lower LDL-cholesterol measured in human blood plasma (P = 0.0006), consistent with the known role of lysosomes in lipid biosynthesis. In contrast, we found limited evidence for other putative in-vitro models. In hypothesis-free analyses, we found strong evidence for transportability of proliferation in cancer cell lines for in-vivo human plasma cellular phenotypes.

We examined the effect of reduced flight time during running (i.e., grounded running) on finite-element predicted bone strains within the tibia-fibula complex. Methods: Nine physically active males ran on an instrumented treadmill at 2.2 m/s using a preferred and reduced flight time technique in a randomized order. Three-dimensional force and motion capture data were recorded during running and a computed tomography image was subsequently acquired for the participant's left leg. An inverse-dynamics-based musculoskeletal modeling workflow was used to calculate bone-on-bone contact and muscle forces during the stance phase of running. These forces served as inputs to a participant-specific finite-element model to estimate peak bone strains and strained volume (i.e., the volume of bone experiencing strains above a specific threshold) within the tibia-fibula complex. Results: Guided attempts to reduce flight time was successful with an 18 ms (95% CI: 12 ms, 25 ms; p<0.001) reduction in flight time. Reducing flight time was associated with significant reductions in peak tibial/fibular strains (17% lower; 95% CI: -7.1%, -25.0%; p=0.002) and strained volume (35% lower; 95% CI: -13.57%, -50.87%; p=0.007). Conclusion: We conclude that guided attempts to reduce flight time significantly reduces strains in the tibia and fibula during treadmill running at a fixed speed.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain incompletely understood, largely owing to the absence of models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. Here, we developed an in vitro human cartilage model using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying either wild-type or Arg719Cys COL2A1. Directed differentiation into chondrocytes yielded cartilage tissues that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and RNA-sequencing. Tissues derived from Arg719Cys heterozygotes displayed a deficient matrix, closely reflecting the human disease phenotype. Arg719Cys procollagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and partially retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to ER distention. Notably, despite introduction of an aberrant cysteine residue--expected to engage redox-sensitive folding and quality control pathways--Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not detectably recognized by the ER proteostasis network. The resulting inability to mount a quality control response, including activation of the unfolded protein response, indicates a failure in cellular surveillance. As a result, malformed procollagen-II both accumulates intracellularly and is secreted, contributing to the deposition of a structurally compromised extracellular matrix that drives disease pathology. The iPSC-derived cartilage model presented here provides a genetically defined and expandable, human-based system for dissecting the mechanisms of failed proteostasis in collagenopathies. These findings shed light on the types of substitutions in procollagen that cells can or cannot recognize, and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular surveillance and collagen quality control pathways in COL2A1-related disorders and beyond.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

TERRA transcripts encompass hundreds to over a thousand nucleotides of telomeric repeats, predominantly originating from 61-29-37 bp repeat promoters enriched with H3K4me3, RNA pol II, CTCF, and R-loops. We develop a bioinformatics tool, TERRA-QUANT, for quantifying TERRA using RNA-seq datasets and find that TERRA increases with age in blood, brain, and fibroblasts. TERRA upregulation in aged leukocytes is confirmed by RT-qPCR. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis demonstrates TERRA expression across various cell types, with upregulation observed in neurons during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.

The VNC of newly hatched larvae contains a set of 22 motoneurons organized into three distinct classes (DD, DA, and DB) that show consistent positioning and arrangement. This organization arises from the action of multiple convergent genetic pathways, which are poorly understood. To better understand these pathways, accurate and efficient methods for quantifying motoneuron cell body positions within large microscopy datasets are required. Here, we present VNC-Dist (Ventral Nerve Cord Distances), a software toolkit that replaces manual measurements with a faster and more accurate computer-assisted approach, combining machine learning and other tools, to quantify neuron cell body positions in the VNC. The VNC-Dist pipeline integrates several components: manual neuron cell body localization using Fiji's multipoint tool, deep learning-based worm segmentation with modified Segment Anything Model (SAM), accurate spline-based measurements of neuronal distances along the VNC, and built-in tools for statistical analysis and graphing. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility of VNC-Dist, we applied it to several genetic mutants known to disrupt neuronal positioning in the VNC. This toolbox will enable batch acquisition and analysis of large datasets across genotypes, thereby advancing investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern VNC neuronal positioning and arrangement.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Experimental data suggests two modes of translocation to support entry of cholesterol from outer and inner membrane leaflets, but the exact mechanism of translocation remains unclear. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (~2 millisecond simulations) and biochemical assays of SMO mutants, we assess the energetic feasibilities of the two modes. We show that the highest energetic barrier for cholesterol translocation from the outer leaflet is lower than that from the inner leaflet. Mutagenesis experiments and complementary simulations of SMO mutants validate the role of critical amino acid residues along the translocation pathways. Our data suggests that cholesterol can take either pathway to enter SMO, thus explaining experimental observations in literature. Thus, our results illuminate the energetics and provide a first molecular description of cholesterol translocation in SMO.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Graft-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) drive CLAD pathogenesis and exhibit stable, dysregulated signaling; however, the transcriptomic and epigenomic drivers behind this fibrogenic transformation remain elusive. Here, we utilize single-cell multi-omic technologies to study gene expression and chromatin accessibility of MCs from the lavage fluid of lung transplant recipients with and without CLAD, obtained either early post-transplantation or after disease onset. MCs obtained after CLAD onset (CLAD-MCs) demonstrated a unique transcriptomic signature compared to non-CLAD controls; a logistic regression model trained on these profiles classified the disease status of individual cells with > 98% accuracy using a set of signature genes. Chromatin accessibility and motif scan analysis identified the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins family of transcription factors, specifically CEBPD, as a key marker of the CLAD-enriched subtype. Footprint analysis of early time-point MCs revealed minimal differences in accessibility, suggesting that CEBPD-associated regulatory changes emerge over time after transplantation. Integration and unsupervised clustering identified 8 distinct cell states, and a compositional shift was noted uniquely in CLAD-MCs. Knocking down CEBPD with siRNA in CLAD-MCs partially reverted the CLAD transcriptomic signature, confirming its importance in the dysregulated molecular state of CLAD-associated MCs. scRNA-seq analysis on human lung CLAD tissue provided in situ validation of key genes and CEBPD expression changes noted in CLAD-MCs.

In this study, we aim to assess the individual and combined impact of future climate and land use change on global terrestrial vertebrate diversity under a sustainability (SSP1-RCP2.6) and an inequality (SSP4-RCP6.0) scenario. Location: Global land, excluding Antarctica. Time period: 1995, 2080 Major taxa studied: Amphibians, birds, and mammals. Methods: We combined global climate-driven species distribution model (SDM) projections of 13903 vertebrates (amphibians, birds and mammals) with future and present land use projections from the Land Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project. We refined the SDM outputs by the habitat requirements of each species using a land use filtering approach. We then analyzed future species richness changes globally, per region and per land-use category and also looked at taxon-specific effects. Results: Under both scenarios, decreases in future species richness dominate at low and mid-latitudes with climate and land use change playing an equally important role. Land use change can be either an alleviating (SSP1-RCP2.6) or an exacerbating (SSP4-RCP6.0) factor of climate-induced biodiversity loss. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to become a high-risk area for future land use-driven biodiversity loss under the inequality scenario. Under SSP1-RCP2.6, forested and non-forested land areas increase, while SSP4-RCP6.0 leads to higher rates of deforestation and pasture expansion. Mammals experience the largest climate-driven losses, affecting 56.4% of land area under SSP4-RCP6.0, while amphibians are particularly vulnerable to land use-driven losses, especially under SSP4-RCP6.0.

However, the evidence in the context of auditory perception remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of perceptual rhythmicity, variations in listening tasks and attentional demands, differing analytical approaches, and the reliance on fixed participant samples for statistical testing. To systematically address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural target sounds presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialization by the participants, the necessity of memory across trials and the manipulation of attentional demands across modalities. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in perceptual sensitivity and response bias that emerge at multiple frequencies. Notably, the rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears to be largely independent among participants, and the strength of rhythmicity in behavioural data is possibly linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements of the task. Overall, these results may help to resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the results of a high-throughput screening of 10,000 small molecules aimed at identifying compounds selectively targeting vulnerabilities associated with concurrent ATRX and NF1 loss.

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of Afadin, a key component of AJs, leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified ganglion cells into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain retinal ganglion cells. Overall, these findings provide the first evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses.

This approach allows us to identify mutations with distinguishable functional profiles which can be related to specific phenotypes, thus providing a data-driven pipeline for genotype-to-phenotype translation.

Muscle cell reorganization occurs in response to various physiological stimuli; however, the mechanisms behind this remodeling remain enigmatic due to the lack of a genetically trackable system. Previously, we reported that a subset of larval muscle cells is remodeled into adult abdominal muscle through an autophagy-dependent mechanism in Drosophila. To unveil the underlying mechanisms of this remodeling, we performed a comparative time-course RNA-seq analysis of isolated muscle cells with or without autophagy. It revealed both transcriptional dynamics independent of autophagy and highlighted the significance of BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in muscle remodeling. Mechanistically, we found that BNIP3 recruits autophagic machinery to mitochondria through its LC3-interacting (LIR) motif and minimal essential region (MER), which interact with Atg8a and Atg18a, respectively. Loss of BNIP3 leads to a substantial accumulation of larval mitochondria, ultimately impairing muscle remodeling. In summary, this study demonstrates that BNIP3-dependent mitophagy is critical for orchestrating the dynamic process of muscle remodeling.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

We hypothesised that body function constrains both the sense of ownership and sensorimotor control of the body movements. We studied these relationships in the context of control of unilateral goal-directed forward arm reaching movements made with a virtual arm. In addition, we expected that children possess more adaptable body representations compared to adults, facilitating greater acceptance of virtual bodies with altered sensorimotor contingencies. We tested 5-7 and 8-10-year-old children, and young adults. Participants took part in an animal feeding game within a Virtual Reality environment. At each age, we manipulated the virtual arm length (visual gain) to alter reaching functionality in three groups: compared to a normal (100%) condition, reaching arm length was slightly reduced (80%); slightly increased (120%); or greatly increased (400%). Parameters representing reach kinematics, subjective perception of arm length, and subjective limb embodiment were assessed during and after reaching with normal and altered control gain. In addition to changes in their reach kinematics, changes in subjective embodiment and reaching affordance were recorded compared to baseline reaching without altered visual gain. We found that the altered reaching functionality reduced Subjective ratings of limb ownership during exposure to the 400% visual gain modification in the group of adults only. In contrast, changes in reach kinematics occurred in all the age groups of children and adults, with age group-specific adjustments in the motor control strategy, characterised by altered magnitude and spatiotemporal placement of peak velocity as well as smoothness of reaching. Finally, at all ages subjective reaching affordance estimates were enhanced following exposure to the two functionality conditions with increased arm length. Our results indicate that the sense of ownership, accuracy of body representations, and characteristics of sensorimotor control are related to bodily function. In addition, it appears that these relationships might be more plastic, or perhaps more tolerant to functional alterations in terms of perceived ownership, in children compared to adults.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

The evolution is characterized by the emergence of new clades competing or temporarily coexisting as each clade undergoes evolutionary change. Previous studies on predator-prey dynamics tracking simple ecological and phenotypic metrics have shown predation to fundamentally alter prey evolution, facilitating defense evolution followed by coevolution and frequency dependent selection between defended and undefended prey genotypes. Moreover, these dynamics can differ between prey species depending, for example, on mutation rate and the physiological and fitness effects of the mutations available. Here we sought to consolidate these fields by examining genome-wide evolution in five bacterial prey species separately subjected to long-term evolution under ciliate predation. For all species, we found mutational signals of prey adaptation, with genomic and phenotypic data demonstrating changes in composition between the experimental treatments. Mutational targets and dynamics also differed between prey species. Intriguingly, however, overall temporal molecular dynamics across the prey species were strikingly similar to those of bacteria evolving alone, with constant emergence, competition and quasi-stable coexistence of clades. This makes molecular evolution more interesting and less predictable than we might expect based on existing coevolutionary theories.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well-understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum, supplemented by in situ hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins - proteins analogous to corals' galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped Sycon ciliatum's biomineralization, similar to that in corals.

We compared actively transcribed genes in rats susceptible to weight loss to the subpopulation of rats resistant to weight loss under the same experimental conditions. Results: We reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA. Discussion: These findings represent an essential first step in understanding how circuit-specific gene expression patterns may contribute to susceptibility to ABA and provide potential molecular targets for manipulation in this animal model of AN.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Mouse sperm bind and cross the ZP at any site, while fish sperm cross the chorion through a funnel-shaped opening, the micropyle. To explore these divergent processes, we established cross-species insemination assays, mixing zebrafish eggs with mouse sperm. While mouse sperm could not bind to the chorion, a subpopulation successfully located and crossed the fish micropyle. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that sperm entered the micropyle and accumulated in the zebrafish inter-chorion space. However, transgenic mouse sperm with mCherry-labeled acrosomes failed to undergo acrosome exocytosis efficiently in the micropyle, with both acrosome-intact and reacted sperm found in the inter-chorion space. Sperm entry and crossing were dependent on hyperactive motility, as sperm from CatSper1Null mice, which fail to undergo hyperactivation, did not interact with or cross the micropyle. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism for sperm entry into the micropyle, providing a novel platform to investigate cross-species gamete interactions and uncover novel steps in fertilization.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Recent work suggests that in these environments, ACC neurons monitor decisions and their outcomes to inform behavioral strategy. Yet, it remains unclear whether ACC neurons similarly encode behavioral history in fully deterministic perceptual decision-making tasks and, if so, how behavioral history signals interact with other signals that are represented by ACC neurons. Here, we recorded the activity of ACC neurons in freely moving mice performing a visual evidence accumulation task. Many ACC neurons had mixed selectivity: they were strongly driven by non-linear combinations of previous choices and outcomes (trial history). We observed that trial history could be decoded well from the ACC population and that the neural representations of trial history remained stable over multiple seconds. Using linear encoding models, we demonstrate that both trial history and movements strongly drive neural activity in the ACC. We found no relationship between trial history encoding and behavioral biases and instead observed that the neural dynamics encoding trial history were low-dimensional, similar between sessions from the same subjects and conserved across different subjects. These findings suggest the ACC might implement a trial history monitoring process that is independent of behavioral biases and common to different subjects.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that small extracellular vesicles (sEV) mediate oncogenic signaling within glioma stem cell populations, yet their role under radiation-induced stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterized sEV uptake dynamics among H3K27M-pDMG tumor cells, identified key sEV surface proteins, and demonstrated that sEVs derived from radioresistant (RR) H3K27M-pDMG cells confer radioprotective effects on radiosensitive tumor cells. Molecular profiling revealed that RR-sEVs carry proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and metabolites associated with glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair. Upon uptake, RR-sEVs reprogrammed recipient cells by altering gene expression and metabolic pathways, and enhancing DNA repair and survival following radiation exposure.

Here we characterize the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior of fungi-based steak using multi-axial mechanical testing, rheology, and texture profile analysis. We find that the rate-independent response under quasi-static compression and shear is isotropic, while the rate-dependent response under dynamic compression is markedly anisotropic with stiffnesses and peak forces four times larger cross-plane than in-plane. Automated model discovery reveals that the exponential Demiray model best explains the rate-independent elastic response upon chewing in both directions. The rate-dependent directional stiffening can be linked, at least in part, to the high water content of mushroom root mycelium and to the restricted fluid flow at higher loading rates. Complementary sensory surveys reveal a strong correlation with mechanical metrics and suggest that we perceive the fungi-based steak as more moist, more viscous, and more fibrous than traditional animal- and plant-based meats.

Importantly, cancer cells have a higher dependency on iron compared to normal cells to support their rapid growth and survival. Due to this fact, tumors are more vulnerable to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death. Radiation therapy (RT), a standard treatment for many cancer patients, is known to induce ferroptosis. Ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT offers an improved therapeutic window by minimizing damage to normal tissues while preserving tumor control. However, the precise biological mechanisms behind the protective effects of FLASH RT on normal tissues remain unclear. In this study, we propose that variations in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, driven by intrinsic differences in iron levels between normal and cancerous tissues, contribute to this effect. Our findings show that FLASH RT increases lipid peroxidation and induces ferroptosis in tumor cells but does not significantly elevate lipid peroxidation in normal tissues compared to conventional RT. To determine whether raising iron levels in normal tissues could abrogate the protective effects of FLASH, mice were fed a high-iron diet before RT. A high-iron diet before and after RT reversed the protective effect of FLASH, resulting in increased intestinal damage and lipid peroxidation. This suggests that baseline iron levels and iron-driven lipid peroxidation are critical factors in mediating the protective outcomes of FLASH RT. Overall, our study sheds light on the role of iron in modulating RT responses and provides new mechanistic insights into how FLASH RT influences normal and cancerous tissues.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews. Results: This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of SNP. However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

However, biological understanding reveals that protein-protein interactions span entire genomic regions, underscoring the limitations of focusing solely on individual proteins. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that extends the context size of transformer models across the entire viral genome.

D. M.; Dicenta, F.; Martinez-Garcia, P. J.", "abstract": "Almond (Prunus dulcis) is a major nut crop with high genetic complexity due to its heterozygosity and self-incompatibility. In this study, genetic parameters for flowering and maturity time, two key complex traits in almond breeding, were estimated using classical methods (midparent-offspring regression and between/within family variance components) as well as a Bayesian linear mixed model. A comprehensive dataset from the CEBAS-CSIC Almond Breeding Program (CC-ABP), comprising over 17,500 individuals and more than 30 years of historical phenotypic records, was used to generate the first complete pedigree and evaluate trait inheritance. Narrow-sense and broad-sense heritability estimates were obtained, showing substantial variation across traits and methods, with the highest values derived from classical approaches. Bayesian mixed models, implemented via the MCMCglmm R package, allowed for the estimation of breeding values (EBVs), repeatability, and variance components under unbalanced data conditions. Repeatability estimates ranged from 0.15 to 0.56. EBVs were calculated for all individuals, including those without phenotypic records, enabling the construction of trait-specific rankings for early or late flowering and maturity. Reliability values were used to refine these rankings, improving the accuracy of parental selection. Genetic trends based on EBVs revealed changes in breeding objectives over time and highlighted the limited genetic progress achieved through phenotypic selection alone. The integration of the complete pedigree, EBVs, and trait rankings offers a robust framework to optimize crossing strategies. This work lays the groundwork for incorporating genomic selection into future almond breeding efforts, improving selection efficiency for traits of agronomic importance.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Oligonucleotides play a crucial role in automated genome engineering through oligo library generation and in DNA data storage, where they encode binary information in DNA libraries. The accurate sequencing of large and diverse oligonucleotide libraries hence is essential, however, accessible sequencing solutions for oligonucleotides, particularly DNA primers for PCR, oligo DNA libraries for mutagenesis or RNA libraries used in gene expression analysis, remain inadequate. Current biological research platforms still rely on expensive and cumbersome quality control methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. To address this gap, we develop OligoSeq, an innovative approach that integrates two complementary techniques: AmpliSeq (based on PCR) and RevSeq (based on reverse complementation of either sequence-specific or random primers) to facilitate sequencing of single-stranded oligonucleotides. OligoSeq uses nanopore technology and can be used as a reference for other sequencing platforms requiring double-stranded adapters, offering a practical and scalable alternative for standard quality control in single-stranded oligonucleotide synthesis.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity(1,6,7). Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E)(8), though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Recent advances suggest that refining the culture environment to replicate spatiotemporal cues present during embryonic organogenesis improves patterning. Here, this paradigm was applied to FGF signalling, a key regulator of embryonic nephron progenitor maintenance, nephrogenesis and ureteric branching. Both FGF8b and FGF10 signalling is sufficient to support nephrogenesis, with each having distinct effects on nephron patterning. FGF10 enhanced the initial WT1+ mesenchymal population, leading to proximally biased nephrons, while FGF8b biased toward early distal patterning, leading to the formation of cells with connecting segment identity. The addition of both FGF8b and FGF10 together had an additive effect, leading to a balance of proximal and distal patterning. This differential patterning was retained in tissue transplanted under the murine renal capsule, with FGF8b-treated organoids displaying increased distal/connecting segments. These findings highlight plasticity during organoid nephrogenesis that can be modulated by FGF signalling and identify an approach to refine nephrogenesis toward key cell types.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Using human iPSC-derived i3 cortical neurons, we demonstrate that both 24S-HC and 27-HC significantly impair neuronal calcium signalling by elevating resting calcium levels, reducing spike amplitude, and disrupting network synchrony. These functional deficits are accompanied by widespread organelle dysfunction. Both oxysterols induce mitochondrial fragmentation, decrease spare respiratory capacity, and impair lysosomal degradation. Notably, 27-HC uniquely triggers lysosomal swelling and membrane permeabilisation. Additional signs of cellular stress, including axonal swellings and elevated endoplasmic reticulum calcium levels, were also observed. Furthermore, both 24S-HC and 27-HC were found to directly interact with alpha-synuclein (aSyn), promoting its accumulation in cellular models. In contrast, cholesterol itself had minimal impact, highlighting the distinct toxicity of its hydroxylated metabolites. Together, these findings reveal a mechanistic link between oxysterol accumulation and neuronal dysfunction, supporting the hypothesis that elevated levels of 24S-HC and 27-HC, commonly observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, may actively drive neurodegenerative processes.

OT is thought to modulate behavior by enhancing the salience of social cues and attenuating prediction error (PE) processing, the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes that drives learning. Since both salience coding and PE processing involve dopamine (DA) neurons as well, the current study investigated the putative interdependence between OT and DA in social safety learning using the social transmission of food preference (STFP) paradigm. STFP is based on the observation that mice (observers) display neophobia toward novel food, but develop a preference for it after a conspecific demonstrator signals its safety. We interpreted STFP acquisition as a functional parallel to human trust-based learning and found that OT enhanced learning in a trust acquisition condition, but only when DA signaling was intact. In a trust violation condition, where demonstrated food was later paired with lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced food aversion, both OT and DA depletion blocked learning, resulting in retained preference for demonstrated food, but not when OT was administered under DA depletion. These findings reveal a functional interaction between the OT and DA systems to modulate social safety learning, which may have important implications for the potential of OT in treating disorders involving DA dysfunction.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response (PDR) as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls, we found that ITD just-noticeable-differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC levels. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In both experiments, participants were assigned to either the Extent Group, which trained with targets of varying amplitudes in a single direction, or the Angular Group, which trained with targets of equal amplitude in different directions. We found marked differences in how the two groups learned: the Angular Group learned more implicitly than the Extent Group, as evidenced by larger post-perturbation aftereffects when participants were instructed to forgo re-aiming strategies. Just as striking were the differences in what the two groups learned: the Angular Group learned a translation rule, which generalized to new directions but not amplitudes, while the Extent Group learned the imposed gain rule, which generalized to new amplitudes but not directions.

A.; Vehra, O.; Han, A.; Radeny, J.; Resstel, C.; Bell, S. L.", "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading infectious killer and infects one quarter of the global population. During infection, Mtb evade host immune responses via secreted effector proteins that interfere with, modulate, and protect from potent antibacterial responses. One such class of mycobacterial effector proteins are the PE/PPE proteins, a huge family of proteins encoded by an impressive 10% of the Mtb genome. Because some PE/PPEs have demonstrated roles in immune regulation and host cell interaction, and because of the sheer number of PE/PPEs in pathogenic mycobacteria (~170-200+ members depending on the species), they are thought to contribute to Mtb virulence and pathogenesis. However, the cellular functions of Mtb's 169 PE/PPE proteins have yet to be comprehensively characterized, at least in part because of their high GC content and large regions of extremely repetitive regions found both in DNA and amino acid sequences. One member of this family, PE5, is likely critical for mycobacterial pathogenesis, but its cellular and molecular functions, particularly within a host cell, are unexplored. We investigated the molecular functions of PE5 using affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and identified an interaction with the CRL2 complex, a host E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. PE5 interacts with CRL2 through its C-terminal Gly-Gly motif, which is bound by the CRL2 substrate receptor, KLHDC2. PE5 does not get ubiquitinated, but it is degraded upon being bound by KLHDC2. Interestingly, binding to PE5 increases the autoubiquitination of KLHDC2, but this autoubiquitination does not interfere with KLHDC2's ability to degrade known substrates or the ability of CRL2 to degrade substrates bound by other substrate receptors. Therefore, while PE5 binds to CRL2-KLHDC2 and does not get ubiquitinated itself, it does not appear to impede CRL2 activity. This study identifies a novel interaction between PE5 and a host ubiquitin ligase pathway, and it raises new questions about how PE5's interaction with the host modulates cell biology to promote Mtb virulence. Furthermore, it implicates CRL2 complexes in mediating cell-intrinsic host response to Mtb infection, a novel function for this ubiquitin ligase complex. Our results expand our understanding of how PE/PPEs may target innate immune responses and contribute to our knowledge of how uncharacterized PE/PPEs contribute to Mtb's virulence.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Inhibition of WEE1 kinase during S phase increases CDK activity, which blocks the PCNA-dependent degradation of TRESLIN and enhances its chromatin association along with MTBP. This increased loading is required for elevated helicase recruitment and DNA synthesis under CDK-hyperactive conditions. These effects are reversed by CDK inhibition and depend on both TRESLIN and MTBP. We define a conserved sequence within TRESLIN required for its CDK-sensitive degradation. Significantly, the recruitment of TRESLIN-MTBP and loading of helicase exceed levels observed in unperturbed S phase, supporting a model in which dormant origin firing is actively upregulated through CDK-mediated stabilization of the initiation machinery.

Methods KRT6A and KRT17 expression in adult mouse MG and PC was examined by single nucleus RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence (IF). Bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase assays were conducted to assess the turnover rate of PC progenitor cells. Lineage tracing experiments were performed using Krt6a-CreERT2 and Krt17-CreERT2 mice carrying Rosa26RnTnG or Rosa26RmTmG reporter. As Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, the histone deacetylase HDAC3, and the transcription factor KLF4, regulate KRT6A and KRT17 in other contexts, IF was conducted to assess the in vivo effects of overexpression of the Hh pathway activator GLI2{Delta}N, and inducible epithelial deletion of Hdac3 or Klf4, on KRT6A and KRT17 expression in the MG and PC. Results KRT6A and KRT17 are primarily expressed in the MG central duct and ductules. KRT6A also shows robust expression in PC. MG and PC epithelial progenitor cells turn over within 14 days. Lineage tracing indicated that Krt17 labels self-renewing SCs in the MG whereas Krt6a labels SCs in the PC. GLI2{Delta}N overexpression induced ectopic KRT17 expression in MG acini and PC but did not affect KRT6A expression in either MG or PC. Hdac3 deficiency caused expanded expression of KRT6A and KRT17 in MG acini and ectopic KRT17 expression in PC. Klf4 deletion resulted in ectopic KRT17 expression in PC but did not influence KRT6A expression in MG or PC. Conclusions Krt6a- and Krt17-expressing cells contribute to adult PC and MG homeostasis, respectively.

However, most current therapeutic interventions fail to effectively address the proliferation of the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCSs) lining the pulmonary vasculature and highlight the importance of identifying novel pathways to target for intervention. The Sphk1/S1P/S1P2 signaling axis is upregulated in PAH patients and is known to induce PASMC proliferation during hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Interestingly, Sphk1 modulates mitochondrial function in that it regulates dynamics, cell growth and survival and in C. elegans, it induces activation of the unfolded protein response (UPRmt). We aimed to investigate if the Sphk1/S1P/S1P2 signaling axis promotes vascular remodeling in PAH via activation of the UPRmt. PASMCs isolated from IPAH patients were subjected to RNAseq analysis. The effect of Sphk1 or S1P was interrogated in hPASMC cell lines and the HPH model was used to assess the effect of the UPRmt on PAH pathogenesis. RNAseq analysis revealed that pathways involved in mitochondrial respiration were among the top 20 most significantly regulated pathways. Furthermore, ATF-5, the transcription factor that mediates the UPRmt was significantly upregulated. In hPASMCs, Sphk1/S1P lead to decreased respiration, increased glycolysis, fission, ROS and UPRmt activation. Pharmacological inhibition of the UPRmt mediator, mtHSP70, mitigated the Sphk1 induced increase in hPASMC proliferation. Furthermore, mtHSP70 inhibition was protective in hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension (HPH) as we observed a decrease in right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling.

We find that ATXN3 is required for lysophagic flux after lysosomal damage but is not involved in the initial phagophore formation on terminally damaged lysosomes. Instead, ATXN3 is recruited to a distinct subset of lysosomes that are decorated with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate and that are not yet fully reacidified.

ATXN3 thus facilitates degradation of a fraction of LAMP2 likely via micro-autophagy to regenerate the lysosomal membrane and to thereby reestablish degradative capacity needed also for completion of lysophagy. Our findings identify a key role of ATXN3 in restoring lysosomal function after lysosomal membrane damage and uncover K48-K63-branched ubiquitin chain-regulated regeneration as a critical element of the lysosomal damage stress response.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

The human LT-HSC compartment is molecularly and functionally heterogeneous and also varies across ontogeny. Dissecting the molecular basis for this variation is impeded by the absence of immunophenotypic markers to resolve LT-HSC heterogeneity. Here, we identified ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+transporting 1 (ATP2B1/PMCA1) as a novel cell surface marker that is heterogeneously expressed by CD49f+ LT-HSC across ontogeny. ATP2B1 immunophenotypic expression stratified human CD49f+ LT-HSC from fetal liver (FL), neonatal cord blood (CB) and adult mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) sources into functionally distinct subpopulations in single-cell (sc) clonogenic assays. CD49f+ATP2B1+ LT-HSC exhibited superior long-term repopulation and self-renewal capacities in vivo compared to CD49f+ATP2B1- LT-HSC. Molecular profiling by scMultiome and immunofluorescence microscopy point to enrichment of an HSC self-renewal program that includes the TFEB-endolysosomal axis in CD49f+ATP2B1+ LT-HSC.

A.; Poh, W.-C.; Stansfeld, P. J.; Chng, S.-S.", "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics in part due to the asymmetric architecture and barrier function of their outer membrane (OM). To establish proper lipid asymmetry, cells need to ensure an intricate balance of constituent OM components, especially lipids. In this regard, the conserved, trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex plays a primary role in maintaining OM lipid homeostasis, thus OM integrity, possibly via retrograde phospholipid transport. However, mechanistic details for this process are unknown, owing to the lack of evidence for direct lipid binding. In this study, we discover that the periplasmic protein TolB, a key component of the Tol-Pal system, associates directly with membranes in vitro, via specific interactions with cardiolipin (CL). Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a CL-binding site on TolB; a single amino acid mutation at this site abolishes in vitro membrane interaction, consequently impairing cellular Tol-Pal function in maintaining OM homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Curiously, we find that the functional requirement for TolB-CL interactions can be bypassed in cells lacking CL, suggesting compensatory effects through other lipids. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated lipid-binding role for TolB, and provide novel insights into how the Tol-Pal complex may facilitate phospholipid transport across the cell envelope. Our work will inform future strategies towards developing new antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

K.; Sen, M.; Sengupta, S.; Maity, W.; Palapetta, S.; Jha, A.", "abstract": "High-quality metadata is essential for downstream AI applications, yet metadata curation remains a persistent bottleneck in biomedical research. The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc. We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation. Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Despite the identification of several substrates and interaction partners for MuRF1, the precise molecular mechanisms by which MuRF1 causes skeletal muscle atrophy remain unclear. To gain further insight into the underlying mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy, we applied targeted biochemical approaches, and identified tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (TRIM72) as a novel MuRF1-interacting protein. Subsequent analysis using MuRF1 knockout and rescue experiments showed that TRIM72 protein abundance is dependent on the presence of MuRF1 protein. Furthermore, TRIM72 protein level was increased by dexamethasone treatment in C2C12 myotubes, alongside increased MuRF1 protein level. Dexamethasone decreases IRS1/Akt signalling, protein synthesis, and glucose uptake specifically in wild-type myotubes, but not in MuRF1 KO myotubes. Further analysis showed that overexpression of TRIM72 impairs IRS1/Akt signalling without the presence of MuRF1, indicating that MuRF1 induces a negative impact on insulin signalling through a plausible cooperation with TRIM72. Our findings provide novel non-degradative molecular roles of MuRF1 that link together skeletal muscle atrophy and impaired insulin responses.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

It follows a modular pathway in which modules are assembled independently and then associated together to form the mature complex. Here, we identify and characterize PAF1 as an assembly factor for the membrane arm of complex I in plants. We show that this protein plays a role in stabilizing a module of the membrane arm prior its association with the rest of the complex. PAF1 was likely present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor and it has been lost in mammals in which the assembly of the membrane arm involves assembly factors not conserved in plants.

Two highly conserved motifs in Aha1-the NxNNWHW and RKxK motifs-are known to regulate specific aspects of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that the K60 residue within the RKxK motif facilitates the structural organization of the NxNNWHW motif prior to ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of the K60 residue partially impairs the in vivo functionality of yeast Aha1. Additionally, we reveal that each individual residue within the NxNNWHW motif modulates the ATPase rate and apparent affinity for ATP of Hsp90.

To support human islet viability and function, we developed alginate-based bioinks incorporating human pancreatic decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM). These bioink formulations were optimized for shear-thinning properties for extrusion of human islets, as well as selective permeability that supports nutrient and therapeutic molecule exchange. Extrusion-based printing parameters were refined to minimize shear stress-induced damage to human islets. The resulting bioprinted pancreatic constructs demonstrated robust structural integrity, high human islet viability (>85%), and long-term glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) over a 21-days in vitro culture period, even at a high islet packing density (10,000 islet equivalent/mL) while free islet controls displayed a significant functional decline. The higher performance of bioprinted islets maybe attributable to the supportive 3D dECM-rich microenvironment mitigating culture-induced stress by recapitulating the islet pancreatic niche.

No software currently exists that can identify and characterise novel, unannotated open reading frames from a transcriptome, and analyse their mutations and fixation patterns within or across species. To address this gap, we introduce DESwoMA (De novo Emergence Study With Outgroup MutAtioNs), a software tool designed to: (1) detect neORFs in transcriptomes, (2) filter neORFs with no homology to outgroup genes, and (3) search for syntenic sequences homologous to neORFs in outgroup genomes (and optionally transcriptomes) and analyse mutations in coding features between these sequences. We applied DESwoMAN with two different strategies to three setups, using twice human and once fruit fly as query species. Our results highlight the tool's capabilities and demonstrate its potential for elucidating the early stages of de novo gene emergence. DESwoMAN is available at https://github.com/AnnaGrBio/DESWOMAN.

The study involved 305 students from health-related undergraduate and graduate programs. Two simulations were designed: a pharmacokinetics (PK) simulation representing systemic circulation and drug metabolism using plastic blocks and classroom stations; an enzyme kinetics (EK) simulation using both digital slides and physical block sets to model substrate-product reactions and construct Michaelis-Menten curves. Student perceptions were measured using a Likert-scale instrument adapted from validated educational models. Quantitative data (pharmacokinetic and enzymatic curves) were also generated from simulation outcomes. Students successfully built representative pharmacokinetic and enzymatic activity curves, allowing exploration of key concepts such as drug absorption, metabolism, Cmax, Tmax, half-life, and enzyme-substrate reaction rates. Perception surveys revealed high approval levels, particularly regarding the effectiveness, engagement, and collaborative aspects of the simulations. Over 85% of participants preferred the simulation-based approach over traditional lectures.

HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene, and the rate of somatic expansion of this CAG repeat throughout life is now known to drive the age of onset and rate of disease progression. As the CAG repeat expands, the extent to which the HTT mRNA is alternatively processed to generate the HTT1a transcript and highly aggregation-prone and pathogenic HTT1a protein increases. Several HTT-lowering modalities have entered clinical trials that either target both HTT and HTT1a together, or full-length HTT alone. We have developed siRNAs that target the Htt1a mouse transcript (634/486) and used these, together with a potent Htt-targeting siRNA (10150) to compare the efficacy of lowering either full-length Htt or Htt1a. zQ175 and wild-type mice were treated with 10150 or 634/486 alongside control groups at 2 months of age with treatment to 6 or 10 months, or at 6 months with treatment to 10 months. The siRNA potency and durability were most effective in the hippocampus. Whilst both strategies showed benefits, despite the greater potency of 10150, targeting Htt1a was more effective at delaying HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation than targeting full-length Htt.

Using quadruple-guide RNAs (qgRNAs) and Cas9, or an inactive Cas9 version fused to a synthetic transactivator, we ablated 2304 and activated 2428 human genes related to mitochondrial, trafficking and motility function in HEK293 cells. After exposure of cells to -Syn fibrils, pSyn129 signals were recorded by high-throughput fluorescent microscopy and aggregates were identified by image analysis. We found that pSyn129 was increased by activating the mitochondrial protein OXR1, which decreased ATP levels and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Instead, pSyn129 was reduced by ablation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein EMC4, which enhanced ER-driven autophagic flux and lysosomal clearance. OXR1 activation preferentially modulated cellular reactions to fibrils derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, whereas EMC4 ablation broadly reduced pSyn129 across diverse -Syn polymorphs. These findings were confirmed in human iPSC-derived cortical and dopaminergic neurons, where OXR1 preferentially promoted somatic aggregation and EMC4 reduced both somatic and neuritic aggregates.

Both effects were presynaptic in origin and likely due to the activation of different presynaptic cholinergic receptors as depression was replicated by muscarine (presynaptic inhibition) and facilitation by nicotine (presynaptic facilitation). IPSCs evoked by presumed physiological patterns of stimulation (short trains of stimuli at 15 Hz) were also affected by cholinergic agonists. Muscarine caused presynaptic inhibition accompanied by frequency facilitation and nicotine promoted the opposite effect. Notably, both agonists reduced the total inhibitory charge transferred to postsynaptic neurons during the train. Our results shed light on a possible additional mechanism for a cholinergic-mediated relief of GABAergic inhibition of PnO neurons under presumed physiological conditions, as a local component of the mutual inhibitory interaction design between sleep controlling systems at REM-s brainstem executive areas.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

With the increasing resistance to existing antimalarials, there is an increasing demand in the continuous search for novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Glycogen synthase kinase (pfGSK{beta}) is a key enzyme involved in metabolic processes such as glycogen synthase phosphorylation, cell differentiation and cell proliferation of the malaria parasite. An attempt to exploit this enzyme as a potential target for drug repurposing was investigated. The insilico method investigated in this research work involved the use of Python coding to mine data from the CHEMBL database for possible GSK3{beta} inhibitors. The data mining using Python coding returned 53 potential molecules ranked according to their 1C50 value. The in silico analysis of these compounds using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations showed that three new molecules, labelled S20 -CHEMBL ID 1910196 (4-[5-(6-hydroxy-1H-indol-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]benzonitrile), S39- CHEMBL ID 2321945- (2-(7-bromo-2-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxoindole-6-carboxylic acid) and S56-CHEMBL ID 2321951 (methyl 2-(2-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-3-nitroso-1H-indole-5-carboxylate), are potential molecules that can be used to inhibit pfGSK3{beta}, of all these three molecules compound S56 were found to behave better insilico than S1- (3,6-diamino-4-(2-chlorophenyl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2,5-dicarbonitrile)-the co-crystallised ligand in pfGSK3{beta} which was used as a control for the insilico drug repurposing research because it has already been tested to inhibit pfGSK3{beta}, Finally, Protox III-an online webserver tool for insilico toxicity study was used to give the potential toxicity of the molecules, this will serve as a tool to guide further research in toxicity of the repurposed molecules. In conclusion, we have been able to propose that three new drug molecules, S39, S20 and S56, have the potential of being repurposed for the treatment of Malaria infection.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

As a member of the large MAF protein family, MAFA's stability and activity are intricately regulated by GSK3-mediated phosphorylation. To decipher the functional roles of these phosphorylations, we engineered knock-in mice (Mafa4A/+) in which MAFA is rendered non-phosphorylatable. In all Mafa4A/+ animals, MAFA stability was markedly enhanced. Under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, Mafa4A/+ males rapidly developed glucose intolerance, which was attributed to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed disrupted beta-cell identity, characterized by increased expression of MODY-associated genes and a delta-cell signature, suggesting beta-to-delta cell reprogramming, a hypothesis supported by lineage-tracing experiments. Conversely, Mafa4A/+ females exhibited hypoglycemia and, with age, developed pronounced inflammatory cystic ducts including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs). Strikingly, MAFA protein was also detected in MCN biopsies from female patients, linking our findings to human pathology. Our results unveil a sex-biased impact of GSK3-mediated MAFA phosphorylation. The male phenotype closely parallels the MODY-like diabetes observed in patients with MAFA S64F mutations, implicating defective phosphorylation in disease etiology. The emergence of MCNs in female mice suggests a novel role for MAFA stability or mutations in the pathogenesis of these enigmatic neoplasms, providing a fresh molecular hypothesis with clinical relevance.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Coordinating such robust stress response mechanisms requires intercellular communication and coordination. Such modalities of intercellular communication have been relatively understudied in the context of stress tolerance. Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster third instar fat body to demonstrate that adipocytes communicate with each other through intercellular bridges called ring canals to buffer endoplasmic reticulum stress. The fat body supports the exponential growth from embryo to late larval stage over a short period of time through its energy storage and secretory functions, enduring a high basal level of ER stress in the process. We discovered that individual cells in the fat body are paired to one neighboring cell through ring canals. We further demonstrate that ring canals mediate rapid and highly specific intercellular cargo and organellar trafficking, and allow the transport of cytoplasmic, ER-bound and Golgi vesicular proteins. Disrupting fat body ring canals resulted in higher levels of ER stress response markers, aberrant cell size, as well as increased cell lethality in response to exogenous stress. We also find that animals with disrupted fat body ring canals display an overall delay in larval development, likely due to reduced secretion of larval serum proteins from the fat body. In sum, our work reveals a novel feature of intercellular communication in adipose tissue that serves to buffer ER stress across cells which is required for both homeostatic secretory function and maintaining tissue viability under exogenous stress.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Mounting evidence suggests that, in addition to recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues through specific phosphobinding modules, many protein kinases selectively recognize pTyr directly adjacent to the tyrosine residue they phosphorylate and catalyze the formation of twin pTyr-pTyr sites. Here, we demonstrate the importance of this phosphopriming-driven twin pTyr signaling in promoting cell cycle progression through the cell cycle-inhibitory protein p27Kip1. We identify, structurally resolve, and tune two distinct molecular determinants driving the selective recognition of pTyr directly N- and C-terminal to the target phospho-acceptor tyrosine site. We further show structural and biochemical conservation in this recognition, and identify cancer-associated alterations to these determinants that are unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates. Finally, using an in vivo mouse model of leukemia we show that Bcr-Abl mutants unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates paradoxically result in enhanced tumor development and progression. These data indicate that Bcr-Abl, like other proto-oncogenes such as Ras or Myc, engages both pro- and anti-oncogenic programs, but in the case of Bcr-Abl, this is accomplished through a mechanism involving traditional and phosphoprimed substrate recognition.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy have been remarkably effective in treating hematological cancers, but their efficacy is limited in solid tumors. Recently, CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms) have emerged as a promising solid tumor immunotherapy, primarily for their intrinsic tumor infiltration and effector functions. However, CAR-Ms are engineered using viral transduction, which is associated with aberrant immunogenicity and toxicity. To overcome these challenges, we developed a bioinspired oxidized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for mRNA-based engineering of human CAR-Ms. A library of 24 ionizable lipids was synthesized, formulated into LNPs, and screened for delivery to human macrophages. The composition of the top LNP was subsequently optimized using an orthogonal design of experiments (DoE) and physicochemical properties, such as size and mRNA encapsulation, were tuned via optimization of microfluidic mixing parameters, yielding a particle that significantly outperformed a gold standard C12-200 LNP. Utilizing small molecule and antibody inhibitors, we demonstrate that uptake of optimized LNPs into macrophages is driven by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent macropinocytosis, which is further supported by potent extrahepatic spleen tropism upon intravenous administration to mice. Lastly, we demonstrate the translatability of this LNP platform and utilize it to engineer functional primary human HER2-CAR-Ms ex vivo with potent antigen-specific tumor killing, validated in an ex vivo co-culture with ovarian cancer cells.

Using a bioengineered gut-on-a-chip model, we independently modulated flow and mechanical strain to assess fibroblast dynamics under intact or impaired epithelial barriers. Inflammation-associated fibroblasts resisted biomechanical stress, exhibiting myofibroblast-like phenotypes with hypertrophy and elevated -smooth muscle actin aligned with stress fibers. In contrast, normal fibroblasts were highly susceptible to shear stress, undergoing matrix metalloproteinase-dependent apoptotic injury, while mechanical strain alone had minimal effect. Notably, an intact epithelial barrier was both necessary and sufficient to protect fibroblasts from shear-induced damage, suggesting that ''good fences make good neighbors''. Under barrier dysfunction, prolonged exposure to shear stress induced the formation of stiff fibroblast aggregates composed of mechanoadaptive myofibroblast-like cells. These findings identify mechanostimulatory cues, particularly shear stress, as critical drivers of early fibrotic remodeling in inflammatory bowel disease and underscore epithelial barrier integrity as an essential biomechanical safeguard against pathological fibroblast dysregulation.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, the initiating factors of joint degeneration remain poorly understood. Research has primarily focused on age-related changes in individual musculoskeletal tissues, with limited investigation into the complex interactions between tissues. Recent studies on interorgan communication between musculoskeletal tissues and other organs have gained attention, but local interactions within the shoulder remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate age- and sex-related differences in bone-tendon-muscle (BTM) crosstalk, hypothesizing that these interactions vary by age and sex, with older and female tissues exhibiting a reduced secretory phenotype. Using novel in vitro monoculture and co-cultures of explanted whole tissues, we assessed inflammatory responses across bone, tendon, and muscle from young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. Our results demonstrate significant age- and sex-dependent differences in cytokine secretion, with aged males and females showing altered inflammatory profiles. We observed a general increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in monocultures, with aging amplifying this response. Tissue co-cultures revealed that crosstalk between bone and tendon was primarily mediated through secreted factors, while muscle-tendon communication required physical proximity or contact, suggesting a distinct mode of interaction between these tissues. Sex differences were evident in both the individual tissue responses and in the patterns of inter-tissue communication. Importantly, our findings suggest that tendon plays a crucial role in mediating inter-tissue communication, with aging disrupting this crosstalk. However, these sex differences diminished with aging, indicating that the age-related decline in tissue-specific signaling may override sex-based distinctions.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Mutations in the pore domain result in developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), where early life seizures and a culprit lesion synergistically disrupt neurodevelopmental trajectories, resulting in intellectual disability that often presents with disturbances in sleep, sociability and sensory processing. Abnormalities in the subcellular localization of Kv1.1, via mutations in/autoantibodies against LGI1 and CNTNAP2, also give rise to syndromes of epilepsy and neuropsychiatric impairment. Mice with deletions of Kcna1(-/-) display spontaneous seizures at 2-3 weeks of age and premature mortality. In this study, we applied instrumented home-cage monitoring to examine how aberrations in KCNA1 expression may result in pervasive alterations in spontaneous behavior. Compared to wildtype, Kcna1-/- mice displayed a robust multifaceted behavioral syndrome featuring marked nocturnal hyperactivity, insomnia, reduced sheltering, fragmented feeding/drinking rhythms, sensory over- responsivity and diminished wheel-running. In identical recordings, Kcna1+/- mice only displayed increased sheltering, Lgi1+/- mice displayed mild insomnia and Cntnap2-/- mice showed home-cage hypoactivity. Kcna1 loss in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Pv-Cre) resulted in a subtle phenocopy, with mild insomnia accompanied by reduced sheltering behavior, while similar deletions in forebrain pyramidal neurons (Emx1-Cre) or dopaminergic neurons (DAT-Cre) were asymptomatic. Adult-onset conditional deletions of Kcna1 also produced only mild insomnia 6 weeks later. To survey the molecular landscape in Kcna1-/- mice, we conducted a mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of dissected hippocampal tissue (a predominant seizure onset zone and where astrogliosis is observed). This revealed significant upregulations in BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and the immediate early transcription factor EGR3 (early growth response-3), which is necessary for the induction of BDNF following electroconvulsive seizures. Heterozygous or homozygous deletions of Egr3 in Kcna1-/- mice resulted in significant survival prolongation, a partial neurobehavioral rescue, and a significant improvement in the frequency of spontaneous seizures and spreading depolarization events. These clinical improvements were associated with an amelioration of BDNF induction, hippocampal astrogliosis and proteomic disturbances. Together, these data illustrate how an ion channel that governs excitability at millisecond scales also shapes the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous behavior at meso- or macroscopic time scales. Our results provide a model and a set of precision endpoints to understand how ictal and interictal features of DEE may be ameliorated by inhibiting the long-term downstream transcriptional alterations imparted by early life seizures.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Although wild-type C. muridarum persists in the mouse large intestine for long periods, intrOv is cleared by the group 3 innate lymphoid cells that produce IFN{gamma} (IFN{gamma}+ILC3s). The current study aims to reveal the mechanism by which intrOv induces IFN{gamma}+ILC3s for its own clearance from the large intestine. IntrOv-induced IL-23 and IL-23 signaling were required for the clearance of intrOv from the large intestine. The intrOv clearance depended on dendritic cells, as depletion of CD11c+ cells reduced both IL-23 and IFN-{gamma}, resulting in the growth of intrOv. Deletion of MyD88 from dendritic cells, but not phagocytes or epithelial cells, rescued the growth of intrOv, indicating a critical role of MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells. Furthermore, TLR2/4 signaling is also essential for inhibiting intrOv, as the deficiency in TLR2/4 fully rescues the growth of intrOv. Both the TLR and MyD88 signaling must be in the same dendritic cells to inhibit intrOv, as the growth of intrOv in the MyD88- or TLR2/4-deficient mice was blocked by only wild-type bone marrow-derived dendritic cells but not dendritic cells deficient in either MyD88 or TLR2/4. Thus, we have demonstrated a dendritic cell-intrinsic TLR/MyD88/IL-23 pathway for recruiting effectors to clear intrOv from the large intestine.

Here, we demonstrate that patients with loss-of-function NFKB1 variants, like those with CTLA4 variants and APDS, exhibit dysregulated CD4+ T cell expansion, accumulation of transitional B cells, and a relative lack of follicular B cells. In patients with monogenic CVID and clinical autoimmunity, we observed a relative expansion of transitional and activated naive (aN: CD21loCD11chi) B cells in peripheral blood accompanied by a marked increase in the frequency of VH4-34 expressing autoreactive 9G4+ B cells, which expanded between T2 and T3a transitional B cell stages. Single-cell transcriptomic and B cell receptor analysis further revealed a marked expansion of activated T1/2, T3 and extrafollicular activated naive and double negative (DN: IgD-CD27-) B cell subsets in APDS patients. Notably, one B cell subset appeared exclusively in the APDS disease state, characterized by high oxidative phosphorylation in transitional B cells, specifically. In APDS patients, we also observed a clonal expansion of specific extrafollicular class-switched DN B cells, which were clonally derived from activated transitional B cells. DN B cells were also identified in APDS lung tissue, consistent with the contribution of activated, extrafollicularly-derived B cells to tissue inflammation. Together, these findings suggest that in many patients with CVID and autoimmune features, premature activation of autoreactive transitional T2 and T3a B cells induces the survival and expansion, rather than the tolerization and elimination, of self-reactive B cells. This process leads to extrafollicular expansion of autoreactive B cells capable of tissue infiltration.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

While the liver maintains homeostasis by exporting cholesterol via very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, this process is paradoxically suppressed under cholesterol excess by insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1), which inhibits sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) activity. How VLDL secretion persists during cholesterol overload to prevent lipotoxicity remains unresolved. We identify a cholesterol-responsive interaction between nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-1 (NFE2L1) and INSIG1 that sustains cholesterol balance. Hepatic NFE2L1 deficiency elevates INSIG1 levels, suppressing SREBP1 activation and impairing VLDL secretion, leading to cholesterol accumulation and liver injury. Mechanistically, NFE2L1 binds to INSIG1 via its N-terminal homology box 2 (NHB2) domain, with cholesterol enhancing this interaction to drive INSIG1 degradation and SREBP1 activation. In NFE2L1-deficient mice, wild-type NFE2L1 restores SREBP1 activity and VLDL secretion, while the NHB2-deleted mutant ({triangleup}NHB2) fails. Lipidomics reveal that NFE2L1 deficiency reduces serum triglyceride composition, restored exclusively by wild-type NFE2L1. In a murine MASH model, NFE2L1 overexpression activates SREBP1/2, enhances cholesterol secretion, and alleviates liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, without elevating atherogenic lipoproteins due to compensatory LDL receptor upregulation.

Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to suppress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Microbial communities, complex ecological networks crucial for human and planetary health, remain poorly understood in terms of the quantitative principles governing their composition, assembly, and function. Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability. Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodologys effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

The statistics were obtained simulating receptive fields from current knowledge about ipRGCs anatomy and physiology. Our findings reveal that human-made environments exhibit significantly higher melanopsin, luminance, and ipRGC excitations compared to natural environments. In natural scenes, luminance contrasts were higher than melanopsin and ipRGC contrasts across most of the range. Melanopsin contrast was largely independent of excitation, and was significantly reduced for larger receptive fields.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising approach for both treatment and prevention. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of 4F11, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAb with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against HMPV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date. Viruses rescued with the K179E escape mutation had significantly decreased fitness in vitro compared to wild-type virus. In a hamster challenge model, 4F11 significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nasal turbinates. These findings highlight 4F11 as a promising candidate for therapeutic development, particularly for immunocompromised individuals and other high-risk groups.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

We investigated the function of Ikaros-Ikaros, Ikaros-Aiolos and Aiolos-Aiolos in B-lymphocytes, and show that the dimers are not equivalent. Ikaros homodimers are required in proB and large preB cells where they repress surprisingly few genes related to cell adhesion and migration. In contrast, Ikaros-Aiolos and Aiolos-Aiolos are expressed in small preB and immature B-cells, and regulate 10-fold more targets involved in immune functions. Aiolos-containing dimers are repressors in small preB but activators in immature B-cells, where Aiolos-Aiolos antagonizes Ikaros-Ikaros. Mechanistically, Aiolos binds more GGAA motifs than Ikaros, which depends on a single amino-acid difference in its DNA-binding domain.

A key branchpoint in this pathway is production of the metabolite 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-HK) by the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (Kmo). We have previously reported that administration of exogenous 3-HK promotes survival of zebrafish larvae to Salmonella Typhimurium infection by restricting bacterial expansion via a systemic mechanism that targets kainate sensitive glutamate receptor (KAR) ion channels and that the endogenous production of 3-HK by Kmo is required for defense against systemic Salmonella infection. Here we show that endogenous 3-HK promotes lysosomal acidification to contribute to macrophage microbicidal activity, with its absence leading to increased host susceptibility to infection. Further, 3-HK promotes lysosomal acidification in a KAR-dependent manner. We thus reveal a novel link between KARs and macrophage lysosomal acidification, and a novel mechanism by which 3-HK promotes control of bacterial infection.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Characterisation of freshwater microbiomes has the potential to be an important tool for understanding freshwater ecology, ecosystem health and ecosystem function. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as Illumina short-read and Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing, are widely used for microbial community analysis. However, the relative performance of these approaches for monitoring freshwater microbiomes has not been well explored. In this study, we compared the performance of long- and short-read sequencing approaches to assess archaeal and bacterial diversity in 42 river biofilm samples across seven distinct river sites in England by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Our findings demonstrated that longer reads generated by PacBio sequencing provide a higher taxonomic resolution, enabling the classification of taxa that remained unassigned in the short-read Illumina datasets. This enhanced resolution is particularly beneficial for biodiversity assessments because it improves species-level identification, which is crucial for ecological monitoring. Despite this, both sequencing methods produced comparable bacterial community structures regarding taxon relative abundance, suggesting that the sequencing approach does not profoundly affect the comparative assessment of community composition.

This myogenesis process is driven both by intrinsic MuSC properties and extrinsic cues. While coordinated inflammatory signals are necessary for healthy regeneration, chronic inflammation participates in various pathologies affecting the skeletal muscle. In the idiopathic inflammatory myopathy dermatomyositis (DM), MuSCs exhibit impaired myogenesis in vitro, indicating that they may have acquired intrinsic defects, contributing to the disease and providing a mechanism for sustained patient muscle weakness despite efficient anti-inflammatory treatments. Here, we investigated the transcriptomic regulation of DM-derived MuSCs, with a focus on the H3.3 histone variant which regulates myogenesis progression. DM-derived MuSCs were unable to effectively execute the myogenic transcriptional program during in vitro differentiation. They exhibited an activated canonical TNF- signaling. They also showed reduced expression of H3.3 and its chaperone genes, coupled with a decrease in H3.3 deposition across the entire genome, and particularly at myogenic regulatory factor loci. The loss of H3.3 combined with elevated TNF- signaling was associated with a failure of DM-derived MuSCs to achieve myogenesis, suggesting a mechanistic link between epigenetic dysregulation and defective muscle regeneration in humans.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to develop Tol 5 cells expressing carbonic anhydrase and to evaluate CO2 conversion ability as a whole-cell biocatalyst. A codon-optimized carbonic anhydrase from Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense (SyCA) was first produced in the cytoplasm. Western blotting confirmed expression, but the Wilbur-Anderson unit assay showed little carbonic anhydrase activity as a whole-cell biocatalyst. To enhance activity, we fused six signal peptides (SPs) to SyCA for periplasmic expression: PelB and TorA from Escherichia coli, the Sec-type SP of Tol 5 outer-membrane protein Omp38, and three putative Tat-type SPs from Tol 5. All constructs except the one fused to the SP of PelB produced SyCA protein. The Omp38-SP fused SyCA was correctly processed to the expected molecular size and exhibited increased whole-cell carbonic anhydrase activity, whereas other SPs were not processed and showed smaller activities. These results show that periplasmic expression of SyCA with a suitable SP is important for efficient CO2 hydration in Tol 5.

Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis.

Surprisingly, ALOX12B is predominantly expressed in the skin. Furthermore, skin-specific overexpression of human ALOX12B in transgenic mice resulted in psoriasis-like inflammatory symptoms, including epidermal hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, and elevated IL-1{beta}/Th17 responses. ALOX12B is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme that catalyses the production of 12R-HETE from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid. Mechanistically, we found that ALOX12B/12R-HETE accumulation in the skin acts as an intrinsic danger signal that triggers enhanced IL-1{beta} processing and secretion via ROS generation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Increased IL-1{beta} levels in turn drive IL-17 producing T-cell polarization. We further designed a novel first-in-class, potent, ALOX12B inhibitor, 6a, which exhibited favorable topical pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The topical application of 6a reduced inflammation-associated pathologies in Tg-hALOX12B mice by suppressing 12R-HETE-induced IL-1{beta} production and ROS generation.

Targeting IL-1RAP, using knockout mice, led to selective reduction in eosinophilia, IL-5 and IL-13 in the airways without impairment of fungal killing. This study identifies a role for IL-1RAP in the generation of eosinophilia independent of neutrophil influx and highlights its potential as a novel immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of allergic fungal airway disease.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we determined the molecular mechanisms underlying MeV vaccine attenuation in primary human immune cells. We found that enhanced infection of innate immune cells in combination with uncontrolled viral RNA synthesis and the inability to evade host antiviral responses induced a strong type-I interferon signature that limited replication of the vaccine strain.

We investigated whether MUA-3, a fibrillin-related ECM protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, contributes to calcium regulation in dystrophic muscle. Using fluorescent calcium imaging in transgenic worms expressing muscle-specific GCaMP2, we found that downregulating mua-3 selectively elevated resting calcium levels in healthy muscle but had no effect in dystrophic (dys-1) muscle, suggesting impaired MUA-3 function in dystrophy. Despite altered calcium dynamics, mua-3 downregulation did not affect locomotor function. In human dystrophic myoblasts, we observed significantly elevated sarcoplasmic calcium levels concurrent with substantial downregulation of fibrillin genes FBN1/FBN2. These findings demonstrate that fibrillin-related proteins regulate calcium homeostasis across species, suggesting that ECM integrity directly contributes to cellular calcium control in muscle. This work identifies a conserved mechanism linking extracellular matrix stability to intracellular calcium regulation and suggests that targeting ECM-calcium coupling may offer new therapeutic approaches for muscular dystrophy.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Although its precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood, autophagy deficiency in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells has been associated with AMD in patients; however, the regulatory pathways involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, we report that deficiency in the Dapl1 gene inhibits RPE cell autophagy and leads to age-dependent retinal pathologies in mice. Specifically, 18-month-old Dapl1-/- mice manifest age-related retinal dysfunction and structural abnormities, including increased retinal stress, photoreceptor/RPE cell damage, lipid aggregates and microglial activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autophagy is impaired in the RPE cells of Dapl1-/- mice, while overexpression of DAPL1 in RPE cells enhances autophagy activity. Mechanistically, we elucidate that DAPL1 suppresses the expression of E2F1 and c-MYC, which consequently downregulates mTOR and upregulates ATG16 and Beclin1 expression via DAPK1 in RPE cells, thereby promoting autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DAPL1 acts as a novel regulator of autophagy in RPE cells, and its deficiency increases susceptibility to age-dependent retinal pathologies in mice.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

The origin of these LFSPs remains to be elucidated and may or may not be related to external sound sources. The underlying causes of these perceptions could also be subjective and belong to the tinnitus family, especially in cases where no external sound source sufficiently explaining the LFSP can be found. The present study puts forth two hypotheses to explain the phenomenon, based on both subjective and objective auditory phenomena: an unusually high auditory sensitivity to low-frequency sound, and hearing one's own low-frequency spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), sounds actively produced by the inner ear as a normal, physiological by-product of cochlear amplification. The present study employed high-resolution, low-frequency hearing threshold measurements and SOAE measurements in 28 individuals with LFSPs, and in control groups devoid of LFSPs. LFSP complainants self-reported hearing a LFSP at a median frequency of 50 Hz obtained with a frequency-matching procedure. With a few clear exceptions, complainants most often did not present unusually sensitive low-frequency hearing thresholds. Furthermore, hearing threshold fine structure was comparable to the control group. In addition, no SOAEs in the low-frequency range could be measured. Based on our results, while cases of hearing physical external sound sources are not ruled out, we suggest that a subjective tinnitus-like phenomenon in the low-frequency range is often the reason behind hearing these LFSPs.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

One of the proposed mechanisms, the \"gating hypothesis\" of tinnitus, suggests an alteration in the modulation of sensory activity by the frontostriatal network. Although structural changes in frontal areas support this idea, gray matter differences in subcortical regions -such as the auditory pathway and basal ganglia- remain poorly understood. Here, we examined subcortical structures and auditory function in older adults with mild presbycusis from the ANDES cohort, including 51 tinnitus patients and 40 age-matched controls. We analyzed brain volume via structural magnetic resonance imaging and subcortical auditory functionality via auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). We found non-significant differences in age, hearing loss, cognitive performance, and ABR amplitudes between the groups. Notably, tinnitus patients presented a significant increase in the volume of basal ganglia structures (striatum and pallidum) but not in auditory areas.

The primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) receives sensory input through the lemniscal pathway, which exclusively carries signals from the contralateral side of the face due to a complete crossover of axonal projections from the brainstem to the thalamus. This contralateral whisker input organization is disrupted in mice with a conditional knockout of the Robo3 gene (Robo3cKO mice), leading to abnormal bilateral representations of the whiskers in wS1. We investigated the behavioral and neural consequences of these bilateral whisker representations in Robo3cKO mice. Performance on a discrimination task in which mice reported whether a left-side or a right-side whisker was deflected was on par with that of wild-type littermates. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition of wS1 showed that activity in the wS1 contralateral to a stimulated whisker was required for mice to report its side correctly, despite a representation of that whisker in the uninhibited hemisphere. Single-unit recordings in wS1 and the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1), a major downstream target of wS1, showed abnormal bilateral whisker responses in wS1 but largely normal responses in wM1, suggesting that the bilateral responses in wS1 were filtered out along the sensorimotor processing stream.

The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity. NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the fly's visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels. Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves ~70% accuracy on the fly's visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types.

This receptor diversity enables distinct responses to the same neurotransmitter, highlighting the need to understand NR distribution and function to fully interpret circuit logic. Here, we focus on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the primary mediators of fast excitatory transmission in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Functional nAChRs are pentamers assembled from a pool of 10 subunits (alpha1-alpha7 and beta1-beta3), yet their in vivo expression and function remain poorly defined. We used T2A-Gal4 lines and endogenous protein tagging to examine nAChR expression in larval motor neurons (MNs) and identified eight subunits expressed in these cells. MN-specific knockdown of individual subunits caused distinct locomotor defects, indicating their functional importance. Co-localization analysis revealed some subunit pairs are frequently co-expressed at the same synapses, while others localize to distinct subcellular domains. Supporting this, double knockdown of co-localized subunits did not worsen locomotor phenotypes compared to single knockdowns, whereas knockdown of non-co-localized subunit pairs produced additive defects. These results suggest that different nAChR subtypes are strategically positioned in discrete synaptic domains within single MNs, where they serve non-redundant roles. Our findings provide new insight into the spatial organization and functional diversity of nAChRs in motor circuits that drive locomotion.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Although bacterial defence systems are typically considered barriers to horizontal gene transfer (HGT), previous studies revealed that bacteria with more restriction-modification (RM) systems (the most abundant bacterial defences) frequently carry more MGEs. It was suggested that this counterintuitive relationship might result from stronger selection for RM systems when exposure to costly MGEs increases. Here, we test this hypothesis using a combination of modelling and bioinformatics analysis of >40,000 bacterial genomes to better understand how eco-evolutionary feedbacks between selection for RM and acquisition of MGEs shape bacterial genome evolution. Our model predicts negative associations between HGT and RM, but only if RM diversity is high. By contrast, at low RM diversity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks drive the emergence of positive associations between HGT and RM. Consistent with these predictions, we identified negative relationships between acquired ARG counts and RM counts across species but positive relationships within individual species. Collectively, our work helps to understand how RM systems shape patterns of HGT of ARGs, which may offer opportunities for targeted surveillance of strains at higher risk of horizontally acquiring novel drug resistance alleles.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations. NBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers. Here, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package \"STbayes\" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects for any parameter. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations.

Viral antigen triggered innate immune response leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including ADAR1 p150 isoform, which edits adenosine (A) residues within double stranded RNAs in both the virus and the host. Such RNA editing mediated by ADARs plays a crucial role in innate immune responses during viral infections through modulation of host-virus interactions. Additionally, ADAR editing acts post-transcriptionally, and serves as a mechanism of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and proteome diversity. While evidence points to changes in ADAR editing during infection, we do not know whether editing targets change over the course of the infection. Here, we explored temporal changes in ADAR expression and editing patterns, across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we examined whether infection-triggered dysregulation in ADAR editing persists or returns to pre-infection states post-viral clearance. We addressed this question by analyzing publicly available whole blood RNA sequencing samples from forty-five, age-matched individuals. The individuals selected had no documented comorbidities, developed mild COVID-19, and were sampled across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: pre-, mid-, and post-infection. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in ADAR expression and editing across the three stages. We further identified unique editing sites resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all three stages of infection, within genes involved in immune response pathways. Noteworthy, genes within neutrophil degranulation pathway appear to be edited, suggesting they may play a role in inflammation and sequelae observed post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate a consistent trend of elevated ADAR expression and reduced overall ADAR editing within each individual mid-infection. Subsequently, in some post-infection samples ADAR expression returns to approximately pre-infection levels, while in others it remains dysregulated. These differences may be contributing to heterogeneity in disease outcomes seen in individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

While most reading studies evaluate mental processes during reading, the only mental process we evaluate is fatigue. While most reading studies use stimuli presented in the middle of the screen, our poem sections are presented in 24 lines of text that span the top to the bottom of the display. While most multi-line reading studies use a very large interline spacing, our interline spacing is more typical of text reading in newspapers, magazines and books. We report on changes in the characteristics of fixations as a function of time-on-task (TOT).  We determine the start and end of reading for each subject/session and divide this reading time into 10 equal length (number of samples) periods (referred to as epochs). We looked for changes in fixation characteristics across epochs. We emphasize our results for horizontal position because these changes were monotonic and interpretable. For horizontal position signals, we found that the mean intersample distances in fixations increases, the rate of changes of fixation position decreases and the total fixation width increases as a function of epoch. We interpret our results to mean that, as reading progresses, it becomes more difficult to hold the eye still. Early in reading, the total fixation width is lower, the mean intersample distance is lower and there are frequent adjustments (i.e., changes in direction) to keep the eye well focused on the target word. As time progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to hold the eye perfectly steady, so fixations become wider and mean intersample distance increases.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In recent years, the widely deployed Cf-9 resistance locus has been overcome, which has prompted breeders to deploy the novel resistance locus Cf-6. However, Cf-6-mediated resistance has already been overcome in several locations worldwide. To date, the identity of Cf-6, as well as the gene encoding the matching Avr6 effector from F. fulva have remained unknown. Here, we report the identification of Avr6 using a comparative genomics strategy. Whole genome sequencing of Cf-6-breaking F. fulva strains revealed that the gene coding for the known secreted effector Ecp5 is either deleted or mutated in these strains. Ecp5 was subsequently confirmed to be Avr6 through potato virus X-mediated expression in Cf-6 tomato plants, as well as by gene knockout and complementation experiments. Using the Avr6-triggered hypersensitive response as a marker for disease resistance, we mapped the Cf-6 locus to the short arm of chromosome 12 in tomato. In addition to identifying Avr6 and setting the foundation for cloning of Cf-6, this work highlights the urgent need for more research into durable gene-for-gene resistance in tomato against F. fulva.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Here we show that \"Clade X\" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed 'Methylaecorales'; 'methyl' for 'methylotrophic metabolism' and 'aecor' for 'ocean surface', as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaecorales have small, streamlined genomes (~1.5 Mb) and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea.

E.; Postec, A.; Erauso, G.", "abstract": "The primary source of carbon is one of the most fundamental questions regarding the development of microbial communities in serpentinite-hosted systems. The hydration of ultramafic rock to serpentinites generates hydrogen and creates hyper-alkaline conditions that deplete the environment of dissolved inorganic carbon. Metagenomic studies suggest that serpentinite-hosted microbial communities depend on the local redissolution of bicarbonate as well as on small organic molecules produced by abiotic reactions associated with serpentinization. To test these hypotheses, microbial consortia collected from the Prony Bay hydrothermal field were grown under anoxic conditions in hydrogen-fed bioreactors using bicarbonate, formate, acetate, or glycine as the sole carbon source. In contrast to glycine, the other three carbon substrates allowed the growth of microbial consortia characterized by significant enrichment of individual taxa. Surprisingly, these taxa were dominated by microbial genera characterized as aerobic rather than anaerobic as expected. We propose that an intricate feedback loop between autotrophic and heterotrophic foundation species facilitates the establishment of serpentinite-hosted shallow subsurface ecosystems. Bicarbonate-fixing Meiothermus and Hydrogenophaga, as well as formate-fixing Meiothermus, Thioalkalimicrobium, and possibly a novel genotype of Roseibaca might produce organic compounds for heterotrophs at the first trophic level. In addition, the base of the trophic network may include heterotrophic Roseibaca, Acetoanaerobium, and Meiothermus species producing CO2 from acetate for a more diverse community of autotrophs.

Focusing on Gen as a viable alternative antibiotic for treatment of gonorrheal infections, we used RNA-Seq to determine if sub-lethal levels of Gen might impact gonococci on a transcriptional level. We found that sub-lethal Gen levels altered expression of 23 genes in Ng strain FA19. Many of the differentially regulated genes were associated with known stress responses elaborated by Ng under different harmful conditions. We found that the transcripts of the hicAB operon, which encodes a putative HicA-HicB toxin-antitoxin system that is encoded by tandem genes with the prophage Ngo {varphi}3, were increased in response to Gen. While loss of hicAB did not impact gonococcal susceptibility to a variety of antimicrobial agents or harmful environmental conditions it did reduce biofilm formation in Ng strains F62, FA1090, WHO X and CDC200 but not that of strain FA19. Further, in strain F62, but not FA19, loss of hicAB reduced the in vivo fitness of Ng during experimental lower genital tract infection of female mice. Further, we found that expression of hicAB can influence levels of the norB transcript, which encodes the nitrate reductase shown previously to be upregulated in gonococcal biofilms.

The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS activates immune signaling via the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein. Emerging evidence suggests crosstalk between innate immune DNA and RNA sensing, implicating a role of STING protein in RNA virus infection. This study characterizes STING in the context of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an RNA virus of the flaviviridae family. We observe that activation of type I IFN through MAVS is essential for cGAS and STING activation. Knockdown, null mutant and inhibitor studies confirmed that STING restricts JEV replication independently of IFN{beta} signaling and autophagy. Transcriptomic analysis of STINGgt/gt bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed enhanced IFN response, but reduced activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Phosphorylated STING was recruited on the virus replication complex (RC), marked by the non-structural protein NS1, subsequently triggering the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome on the RC. STING proton channel activity was essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1{beta} production, and activation of pyroptotic cell death markers. Stinggt/gt mice, showed higher viremia, earlier disease onset, reduced survival, and decreased brain inflammation.

D.", "abstract": "Heme, a toxic by-product of Plasmodium proteolytic digestion of host hemoglobin, is detoxified by the malaria parasite through its conversion into hemozoin (Hz), the malaria pigment. This detoxification pathway is a key target for many antimalarial drugs, which aim to induce heme-mediated toxicity to the parasite. The Heme Detoxification Protein (HDP) plays a central role in heme-to-Hz transformation; however, its precise mechanism remains unclear, largely due to the absence of successful recombinant expression in a native, soluble form. In this study, we aimed to express HDP recombinantly in its native soluble state using an E. coli-based system. A range of strategies were employed, including expression of orthologs, consensus sequence design, fusion to solubility-enhancing partners, co-expression with molecular chaperones, and extensive construct optimization through N-terminal truncations. Despite extensive efforts, most recombinant HDP constructs were either insoluble or formed soluble aggregates. Notably, only a single construct, with a 44-residue N-terminal truncation and a C-terminal 6-His tag (HDPpf-C10), was successfully expressed in a soluble form. Surprisingly, HDPpf-C10, although retaining domains implicated in heme binding and transformation, exhibited no detectable heme-to-Hz transformation activity. This finding highlights the essential role of the flexible-unstructured N-terminal region in mediating both heme binding and its subsequent conversion to Hz, providing new insights into HDP function and guiding future structural and mechanistic studies.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

These megacomplexes, composed of spectrally distinct phycobiliproteins and linker proteins, allow efficient energy transfer to reaction centers of the photosystems. While PBS structures from many cyanobacteria have been resolved in recent years, the PBS of Gloeobacter violaceus - a phylogenetically ancient, thylakoid-less cyanobacterium - remains poorly characterized. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the G. violaceus PBS, a >10-MDa complex with a unique architecture consisting in 516 polypeptide chains totaling nearly 90,000 residues and harboring over 860 bilin chromophores. Unlike canonical PBS with radiating rods, the Gloeobacter PBS features diverging, conformationally flexible rod bundles formed by stacked phycoerythrin (PE) and phycocyanin (PC) hexamers. These rods emerge from a pentacylindrical allophycocyanin (APC) core, which is encircled by additional PC hexamers - a structural feature atypical for other cyanobacteria. We identify the role of the two Gloeobacter-specific multidomain linker proteins, Glr1262 and Glr2806, as critical stabilizers of this bundle-shaped architecture. Structural analysis suggests these linkers mediate rod-core interactions while permitting rod mobility, potentially balancing light capture and photoprotection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lateral cylinders of the APC core create alternative energy transfer pathways from the rods to the terminal emitters, ensuring robust excitation delivery under varying light conditions. This redundancy may represent an evolutionary adaptation to Gloeobacter's unique physiology. Our findings provide the high-resolution structural insight into Gloeobacter PBS, revealing divergent adaptations in early-branching cyanobacteria.

Two distinct groups were identified, each with different protein substrate specificities. Both had similar molecular weights of 52-62 kDa, with 4-6 N-glycans, but one group consisted of trypsin-like acidic SVSPs and the other were chymotrypsin-like basic SVSPs. Each acted differently on fibrinogen: the acidic SVSPs showed thrombin-like alpha/beta-fibrinogenase activity, whereas the basic forms were shown to be alpha-fibrinogenases. The acidic SVSPs possess gelatinase activity - a novel activity for SVSPs and the first example of an SVSP acting on proteins other than those of the haemostatic system. Analysis of the transcripts of both sets of SVSPs revealed structural details of the substrate-binding sites that supported the experimental findings. The activity and sequences of the basic SVSPs show that they are very like the alpha-fibrinogenase ML-AF of M. lebetina, which until now was considered to be a unique SVSP. Thus, this basic SVSP and the acidic SVSP with its gelatinase activity can be considered to be atypical viper serine proteases.

To biofabricate complexity, bioprinting can introduce high-resolution heterogeneous structures that guide cell behaviors. The designs of the granular ink and support hydrogels are crucial to achieving complexity. High resolution structures and channels depend on small particles that flow and can be stabilized, and that can be printed and then removed, respectively. Herein, an all-granular system is described that used a granular formulation of an established, tunable hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel as the basis for a support matrix and a small particle gelatin hydrogel as an ink. Towards facilitating stabilization of the printed structure and flow during printing, the support and ink materials included soluble, interstitial components, and all exhibited yield stress behaviors characteristic of granular hydrogel systems. The support matrix's viscoelastic properties were dependent on intraparticle hydrogel network design, and it could be stabilized against flow by photoinitiated crosslinking. The gelatin ink could form fine filaments, as small as 100 m in testing here, and melted to leave channels within crosslinked support matrices. Channels could support flows introduced by hydrostatic pressure and could be used to rapidly transport soluble factors into the construct, which could be used to establish soluble gradients by diffusion and support cell viability. The all-granular system supported printing of complex, multimaterial structures, with feature resolution on the order of 100 m and spatial positioning on the order of 10s m.

In the present work, we studied in vitro the effect of sinusoidal mechanical vibration of 2 mm amplitude and frequency ranging from 5 to 100 Hz for 10 min duration. Physicochemical properties of controlled and mechanically vibrated RBC were examined using UV-visible, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and morphology was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results showed that mechanical vibrations affect oxygenation level at the Q band (543 nm and 578 nm), and variation in transmission intensity is observed in the Amide region.

C.; Mikkelsen, M.", "abstract": "Purpose: Spectral editing is the most common MRS approach for noninvasive in vivo measurement of low-concentration, strongly overlapped metabolites in the brain, such as {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH). Multi-metabolite editing methods, including HERMES and HERCULES, have recently been introduced, where multiple J-coupled metabolites can be edited in a single acquisition without increasing total scan time. Yet little is known regarding the reliability of these methods. This study assessed the test-retest reliability of HERMES and HERCULES, where volume localization was achieved using either PRESS or sLASER. Methods: Sixteen healthy adult volunteers were scanned twice in two separate sessions. Single-voxel edited MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe using the following sequences: (1) HERMES-PRESS; (2) HERMES-sLASER; (3) HERCULES-PRESS; (4) HERCULES-sLASER. Spectra were processed and metabolites were quantified using the Osprey software. Data quality metrics and reliability statistics were estimated for all four acquisitions. Results: HERMES-sLASER demonstrated lower within-subjects coefficients of variation (CVws) for GSH, glutamine (Gln), and glutamate (Glu) + Gln (Glx), suggesting improved reliability compared to HERMES-PRESS. However, GABA + co-edited macromolecules (GABA+) and Glu showed higher CVws for HERMES-sLASER. HERCULES-sLASER produced better reliability than HERCULES-PRESS for GABA+, GSH, Glu, Gln, Glx, aspartate (Asp), and lactate (Lac). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) showed higher CVws for HERCULES-sLASER. These findings suggest that sLASER may be more advantageous than PRESS for volume localization in simultaneous multi-metabolite editing. Conclusion: Using sLASER yielded better test-retest reliability for most metabolites than using PRESS for volume localization for HERMES and HERCULES.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) presents a fundamental paradox: patients maintain cognitive function during acute infection despite cytokine storms that meet sepsis criteria. Through computational modeling of quantum coherence in neural microtubules during HIV-induced neuroinflammation, we discovered that Fibonacci scaled microtubular architectures maintain quantum coherence up to 104-fold longer than regular structures through geometric optimization. This protection mechanism operates through resonant coupling at the golden ratio ({varphi} = 1.618), achieving 74.4% efficiency in preserving quantum information. Using five complementary computational models validated against recent experimental quantum data, we demonstrate: (1) power law decay (exponent  = -1.015) in Fibonacci structures versus near-exponential collapse ( = -10.102) in regular grids; (2) quantum sanctuary formation at t = 0.6 time units creating coherence-preserving boundaries; (3) precise mathematical optimization at {varphi} = 1.618033988749895; (4) temperature resilience maintaining function during HIV-associated fever; (5) strong correlations with clinical neuroimaging (r = 0.74 - 0.82, p < 0.001). Monte Carlo analysis (n = 50) confirmed the probability 100% of sanctuary formation during acute inflammation above 38.5 C.

J.; Ugurbil, K.; Eryaman, Y.", "abstract": "Purpose: This study proposes an alternative approach to MR thermometry (MRT) for the safety validation of multi-channel RF transmit coils and demonstrates its use to enable human studies at 10.5T. Methods: To ensure patient safety, specific absorption rate (SAR) limits established under international guidelines must not be exceeded. Predicting SAR on state-of-the-art parallel transmit systems relies on electromagnetic simulations, which require extensive experimental validation. Despite a well-established validation workflow, SAR prediction errors are unavoidable and must be quantified as a safety margin. While MRT tests are commonly used for this purpose, their technical challenges necessitate an alternative. The proposed technique propagates the error between experimentally and numerically acquired B_1^+ distributions to the uncertainty in simulated peak local SAR using Monte-Carlo simulations without the need for MRT. This method was validated using a 16-channel transceiver coil for imaging the human torso (henceforth referred to as a \"body\" coil) at 10.5T with two excitation scenarios, as well as an 8-channel 10.5T head coil with four excitation scenarios. Results: The proposed numerical technique proved more conservative than existing MRT-based SAR error quantification methods across all tested scenarios. Its application to validate three state-of-the-art head coils (16Tx/32Rx, 16Tx/80Rx, and 16Tx/128Rx) led to regulatory approval for human head imaging and high-quality functional as well as diffusion MRI results at 10.5T. Conclusion: A numerical alternative to MRT requires only the experimental acquisition of B_1^+ maps for comparison with simulations, enabling the quantification of uncertainty in SAR prediction. This technique was applied to three 16-channel transmit arrays, each used in conjunction with high-channel-count receive arrays for in vivo imaging.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

However, given the finite number of specimens, there is a critical need to move past destructive DNA extraction approaches and to explore non-destructive techniques. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of extracting historical fish eDNA from the ethanol preservative used to store Antarctic museum specimens. We compared a variety of extraction methods, including centrifugation, evaporation, filtration, and precipitation, using ten replicate samples per treatment for statistical analyses. To assess potential differences in preservative-derived eDNA recovery across different filter-feeding taxonomic groups, we included a Bryozoa and two Porifera, i.e., Demospongiae and Hexactinellida. Comparative analyses with tissue biopsies revealed that the total genomic DNA was significantly reduced for non-destructive approaches. However, 10 ml ethanol filtration performed equal to, or in some instances, outperformed tissue biopsies when investigating the historical eDNA of Antarctic fish using a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach, both for the number of species detected (-diversity) and community characterisation ({beta}-diversity). Our findings demonstrate the potential of ethanol preservative as a valuable, non-destructive source of historical fish eDNA from museum-stored filter-feeding specimens.

The annual catchability coefficient, qy , was estimated through the Leslie model; the monthly biomass, Bm , was estimated from the catch per unit effort; Um via the relationship Bm=Um/qy ; and through a biomass accumulation model throughout the fishing season, an approach to the biomass corresponding to the carrying capacity, B[[EQUATION]],y, was obtained. The harvest rate, HR, for each month and year was obtained and the annual maximum sustainable yield, MSYy, derived as HRMSY,y = 0.50, which represents the target biological reference point, BRPtgt. The decrease in population abundance allows for estimates of the recruitment rate, {rho}y, at the beginning of the fishing season and the survival rate, sy, at the end of the fishing season, which represent the remaining reproductive population. From these estimates, a limit biological reference point was computed, described as BRPlim,y = {rho}y/sy = 1, which corresponds to the population replacement level. With these estimates, the Kobe diagram was constructed, in which the biological reference points BRPtgt  and BRPlim,y were incorporated.

To identify interactions that drive ribosomal recruitment of eIF4G/eIF4A-bound Type 2 IRESs, we determined the cryo-EM structure of 48S initiation complexes formed on the EMCV IRES. It revealed that the apical domain I cloverleaf contacts ribosomal proteins uS13 and uS19 via its Id subdomain and that the essential GNRA tetraloop in subdomain Ic interacts directly with the T{psi}C domain of initiator tRNA. Functional assays supported the exceptional role of these interactions for initiation on this IRES.

But the mechanisms of how HSV-1 dynamically modulates host proteins at different infection stages to promote its own survival remains challenging. Here we identified DNA damage response protein RAP80 as a critical target of HSV-1 ubiquitination enzymes ICP0 and UL36USP throughout HSV-1's infection cycle. In early stages, RAP80 inhibits HSV-1 transcription by directly binding to the viral genome, blocking viral protein ICP4 binding to transcription factors. This interaction is regulated by phase separation via an intricate interplay between RAP80 and ICP0/ICP4. As infection progresses, the viral E3 ligase ICP0 degrades RAP80, dissolving phase separation, and allowing the formation of a mature viral replication compartment. In late infection stages, RAP80 is deubiquitinated by the viral deubiquitinase UL36USP, which restores cellular homeostasis and promotes HSV-1 survival. This process involves modulating the R-loop-cGAS-apoptosis pathway. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between viral and host factors and the complex mechanisms used by HSV-1 to subvert host defenses, offering practical implications for the future development of antiviral strategies.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

This widespread RNA cleavage can lead to death of the infected cell via the ribotoxic stress response (RSR). An ongoing challenge is to understand how RNase L's endonuclease activity triggers cell death to benefit the host. To address this question, we used nanopore-based long-read sequencing to show that 3' mRNA fragments in the cell were not fully degraded after RNase L activation and that these fragments were translated by ribosomes. We further asked whether ribosomes on mRNA fragments stall when they reach 3' ends created by RNase L. We used ribosome profiling to capture footprints protected by these ribosomes, which can be identified by their short length (15-18 nt). We found that RNase L activation increased the number of stalled ribosomes at RNase L cleavage sites. Loss of the ribosome rescue factor PELO increased the number of short footprints derived from stalled ribosomes and augmented the RSR.

O. sympatrica and its sympatric sister species exhibit distinct flower shapes, and pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation presumed to be a major barrier between them.

We analyzed previously published RNA sequencing data of right ventricular septal endomyocardial biopsies from HFpEF patients (n=41) with paired clinical, echocardiographic, and outcome data (including mortality and heart failure hospitalizations). We constructed random survival forests with forward stepwise regularization (the \"variable hunting\" method) to determine genes associated with time to first event using a combined end-point of heart failure hospitalization or all-cause death. Selection of candidate forest variables was tested with both random and weighted sampling methods. We identified 33 genes that are predictive of survival in HFpEF. This set includes genes previously implicated in heart failure, including ADAMTSL2, ADRB1, BMP6, and METRNL. Survival forests constructed using these genes outperform those constructed from clinical and hemodynamic parameters alone (out-of-bag C-index 0.894 vs 0.545). Moreover, in survival forests constructed from both gene data and hemodynamic measurements, individual survival genes consistently showed higher variable importance than clinical/hemodynamic parameters.

D.", "abstract": "Background: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies with minimal side effects. Lycopene, a natural carotenoid, has shown potential anticancer properties, yet its efficacy and mechanisms in lung cancer models require systematic exploration. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects of lycopene in both in vivo and in vitro lung cancer models, elucidate its molecular mechanisms, and assess systemic safety. Methods: In vivo, tumor-bearing mice received intratumoral injections of lycopene at varying concentrations (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) to evaluate tumor regression . In vitro, A549 and LLC lung cancer cell lines were treated with lycopene (0-40 M) to assess the ability of clonogenic survival, tumor new cell, cell invasion and promoting apoptosis.Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect related pathways and apoptotic proteins, and target genes were silenced or overexpressed to verify the correctness of the pathways. Systemic toxicity was analyzed through blood biochemical profiling and histopathological examination (HE staining) of major organs at 40 mg/kg. Results: Lycopene significantly reduced tumor volume in mice in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Systemic toxicity assessments revealed no abnormalities in hepatic, renal, or hematological parameters, and organ histology remained unaffected at 40 mg/kg. In vitro, lycopene suppressed colony formation, tumor new cell , cell invasion numbers, and increased apoptosis rates about 60%. Mechanistically, lycopene downregulated phosphorylated PI3K and AKT levels, indicating pathway inhibition. Interference of PI3K gene silencing or overexpression suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway is the main target for lycopene to produce apoptotic effects. Conclusion: Lycopene exerts potent antitumor effects by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway and promoting apoptosis in lung cancer cells, while demonstrating a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses. These findings highlight its potential as an adjunctive therapy for lung cancer management.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Ballem, R.; Andres Camazon, P.; Chen, J.; Calhoun, V.; Iraji, A.", "abstract": "Spatial group independent component analysis (sgr-ICA) has become a crucial method to understand brain function in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, especially in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies. Early studies identified large-scale brain networks using sgr-ICA with lower order (e.g., 20 - 45 components); however, more recent studies have employed higher model orders (e.g., 200 components) to reveal more refined intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), offering a more detailed representation of functional brain architecture. This increased granularity has encouraged researchers to explore even higher model orders to better capture the brain's function. Although previous studies explored higher model orders, small datasets often limited them. In this study, we addressed this gap by assessing an sgr-ICA model with 500 components using a large rsfMRI dataset of over 100,000 subjects. This extensive data set allowed us to provide a robust estimation of fine-grained ICNs. We further assessed diagnostic effects and cognitive performance using whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) of 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls from these ICNs. We also compared the results with ICNs obtained using a lower-order, multi-spatial-scale template. Results demonstrate that our approach yields a large set of reliable and fine grained ICNs, enhancing characterization of schizophrenia related dysconnectivity patterns. Specifically, we observed a relatively large number of ICNs within the cerebellar and paralimbic area. We detected significant hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains, including the basal ganglia and thalamic regions. We also found hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognitive domains, as well as between the sensorimotor and subcortical domains. Our finding revealed that granular ICNs can detect significant FNC differences between cohorts which are missed in larger scale ICNs. This work highlights the capability of higher model order ICA to capture distinct, fine-grained ICNs, enriching our understanding of FNC and serving as a valuable addition to current multiscale ICN templates. The ICNs derived from this study may serve as valuable references for future research, with the potential to improve the clinical utility of rsfMRI and advance the study of psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Causality perception, a core example of this inferential process, enables observers to infer cause-effect relationships, such as whether a moving object causes another to move. Traditionally considered a low-level visual computation, causality perception is increasingly recognized as shaped by top-down dynamics, perceptual history, and individual predictive processing styles. Here, we examined how prior experience and cognitive-perceptual traits shape causal inference in 150 neurotypical individuals, using data-driven clustering to stratify participants along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum. Participants viewed dynamic collision events in which a moving circle contacted a stationary one, followed by variable temporal lags before the second object motion, and judged whether the interaction appeared causal or non-causal. Causality judgments were influenced by both physical timing (sensory-driven) and serial dependence on previous perceptual decisions (prior-driven). Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (HDDM) revealed that SSD-like individuals showed a strong prior bias toward causality, greater serial dependence, and lower decision thresholds, reflecting a prior-dominated perceptual style. Conversely, ASD-like individuals exhibited reduced influence of perceptual history and higher decision thresholds, reflecting a conservative, data-driven style. Crucially, prior bias, serial dependence, and decision-making dynamics were strongly interrelated, revealing a hierarchical structure to perceptual inference across neurocognitive profiles. These findings demonstrate that causality perception emerges from predictive processes operating at multiple timescales and shaped by individual differences in neurocognitive style and perceptual flexibility.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Tactile representations in the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex of rodents (wS1) receive inputs from two distinct thalamic nuclei, the ventro-posterior-medial nucleus (VPM) and the posterior medial complex (POm). Previous work has revealed a sweep-stick code in rat wS1 by using a novel whisker velocity-white noise stimulus. Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit \"stick\" responses from the VPM and \"sweep\" responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4 \"stick\" responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b \"sweep\" responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a \"sweep\" responses result from a temporal integration of \"stick\" information from VPM and POm. Our results put forward a circuit scheme in which fast encoding stick events from VPM allow a fine-tuned texture processing in the cortex, modulated by sweep-responding cells that integrate multi-whisker information.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether cAMP-mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 exhibits hemisphere-specific properties. In recordings with electrical stimulation of CA1 inputs, a subset of recordings in the left, but not in the right hemisphere CA1, exhibited a pronounced cAMP-induced potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). To isolate input specific contributions, we expressed the optogenetic actuator ChrimsonR unilaterally in the CA3/CA2 region of wild-type mice. Light-evoked glutamate release from ipsilateral Schaffer collaterals showed no cAMP sensitivity in either hemisphere, while commissures originating from the right (COR) exhibited cAMP-mediated potentiation of transmission in a subset of experiments. Notably, this effect was absent at commissures originating from the left (COL). The selective presence of the effect prompted us to further investigate the underlying cell population using CA3-specific (G32-4 Cre) and CA2-specific (Amigo2-Cre) driver lines. Recordings from synapses of CA3 COR recapitulated the cAMP-induced potentiation of transmitter release observed in wild-type animals. However, the effect was again restricted to a subset of experiments and was absent in recordings with specific stimulation of CA2 COR. Our results demonstrate a variable cAMP-sensitivity of transmitter release at COR synapses in the left CA1. Altogether, we reveal a hemisphere-specific cAMP-mediated synaptic plasticity at CA3 COR onto CA1, underscoring hidden heterogeneity and lateralization in hippocampal circuit function.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize spatial variation in resting-state HoFC and its relation to dominant natural axes of anatomical, functional, and transcriptomic organization across the human cerebral cortex. We show that the regional distribution of HoFC, from the lowest in association areas (especially limbic) to the highest in primary sensorimotor regions, is preserved across neuropsychiatric disorders in a separate neuroimaging cohort (including schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) despite disease-associated perturbations in magnitude. Regional variation in HoFC is not fully explained by properties of physical embedding or vascular innervation in the brain, suggesting involvement of alternative physiological processes. Furthermore, we find that regions with stronger HoFC are more functionally connected within and across hemispheres at rest, suggesting that homotopic functional coupling is positively associated with brain-wide functional synchrony. Our results collectively suggest that HoFC is inherently aligned with a fundamental natural axis of macroscopic cortical organization and shared global signal--advancing our understanding of the biological correlates of cortical homotopy and suggesting potential mechanisms to investigate in the future.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

Individual LC-NE neurons exhibit diverse axon projections with ipsilateral bias and region preference, but share comparable electrophysiological properties, sensory responses and neural function-related genes' expression. Moreover, population LC-NE neurons display bilaterally symmetrical yet regionally different axon projections and fire synchronously, causing regionally patterned NE release. Along with the regional comparability of NE receptor expression, these enable the LC to tune brain-wide neural dynamics in an inverted-U manner with region difference.

Using a novel animated shapes fMRI task, we observed a functional double dissociation between brain regions that were engaged when forming a prediction for agentic movement - which involved the premotor cortex and the lateral parietal cortex, previously implicated in action observation and mirroring - from those associated with processing feedback for updating abstract priors to guide predictions - which involved the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporoparietal area, and the lateral temporal cortex, previously associated with mentalizing/theory of mind. We observed parallel functional dissociations in the cerebellar areas affiliated with these networks.

Here, using data from a separate experiment, we examined whether these results could reflect altered visual cortical functional connectivity in theta, alpha, and gamma rhythms. We assessed this in a sample of 5-month- old infants (n = 59; 39 elevated familial likelihood of autism) by means of electroencephalography (EEG) when they were watching videos showing social and non-social scenes. Gamma connectivity between midline and far-lateral visual cortex when viewing social scenes was linked to both later autism symptoms and global motion visual cortical laterality we reported in the previous study. This may indicate a shared integrative mechanism underlying social perception and global motion processing. Further, we found that higher midline-to-lateral theta connectivity in the visual cortex when perceiving non-social scenes in infancy was strongly associated with having more autistic symptoms at follow up, but uncorrelated with concurrent motion perception. Our study points to atypical functional connectivity in the visual cortex as a potential early marker of autistic symptoms and highlights a probable link between motion processing and social perception.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

R.; French, C.", "abstract": "Several clinical attempts to use deep brain stimulation applied to nucleus basalis of Meynert to reduce cognitive decline in different types of dementia report inconclusive effects. At the same time, experiments in rodents have largely demonstrated cognitive improvement. The hypothesised basis for this difference was the application of different patterns of stimulation - tonic continuous over multiple sleep-wake cycles in human clinical trials vs intermittent bursts over shorter intervals in animal studies. However, since no systematic testing of the effects of different stimulation patterns applied in different states of vigilance was conducted, it remains unclear what specific attributes of cortical responses are associated with these patterns, and the effect of vigilance state on pattern response. We hypothesised that communication between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets involves frequencies in both low and high ranges, making burst-type intermittent patterns potentially more effective. Therefore we studied preferred frequencies of neuronal synchronization within nucleus basalis as well as between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets in B6 mouse strain (N=9, age 4-6 month) by recording neuronal spiking and local field potentials (LFP) from 2 sites of the nucleus basalis and 4 cortical sites simultaneously across multiple sleep-wake cycles. Spike-field coherence (SFC) analysis revealed natural synchronization tendencies of nucleus basalis - all animals demonstrated significant SFC at delta-theta range and gamma coherence peaking between 57 and 88 Hz (SFC > 95% Jackknife confidence interval at frequency range > 2*bandwidth). SFC between cortical cells and local field potentials of nucleus basalis, which reflects cortical feedback, peaked at delta-theta frequencies. Based on these results we constructed \"nested\" patterns of stimulation that included both delta-theta and individually assessed gamma peak for each animal (N=8). The effects of nested stimulation were compared to the ones of random and tonic (20Hz) stimulation patterns. These patterns of stimulation were applied across multiple sleep-wake cycles to freely behaving animals, and spectral power density in response to stimulation compared between patterns for different states of vigilance. We report significant reduction of delta power during slow wave sleep and theta power in REM for all three patterns. Slow wave suppression was also present during wakefulness. This indicates all patterns may improve levels of alertness but highlights strong likelihood of sleep disturbances in response to stimulation during sleep. Thus, deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis may be counterproductive during sleep. The nested pattern of stimulation alone demonstrated preservation or even enhancement of gamma activity in the cortex while suppressing low frequencies. Broad-band suppression of cortical activity was shown in response to tonic stimulation, and to some extent to the random pattern as well, suggesting that tonic stimulation may be unsuitable for deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": ""}

In addition to its pro-survival role in melanoma, recent studies have shown that MITF expression has important implications for cancer progression and treatment in other cancer types. Nevertheless, studies on the role of MITF in other tissues are scarce. Here, we show that depletion of MITF causes genome instability in non-melanocytic cell lineages, which results in activation of P53, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we show that P53 activation in MITF depleted cells is dependent on LATS2, a key kinase in the Hippo pathway. Finally, we show that this LATS2 mediated upregulation of P53 is ATR dependent.
