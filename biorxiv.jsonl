Compared to common variants, rare variants tend to have larger effect sizes and often directly point out causal genes. These potential benefits make association analysis with rare variants a priority for human genetics researchers. To improve the power of such studies, numerous methods have been developed to aggregate information of all variants of a gene. However, these gene-based methods often make unrealistic assumptions, e.g. the commonly used burden test effectively assumes that all variants chosen in the analysis have the same effects. In practice, current methods are often underpowered. We propose a Bayesian method: MIxture model based Rare variant Analysis on GEnes (MIRAGE). MIRAGE analyzes summary statistics, i.e. variant counts from inherited variants in trio-sequencing or from ancestry-matched case-control studies. MIRAGE captures the heterogeneity of variant effects by treating all variants of a gene as a mixture of risk and non-risk variants, and uses external information of variants to model the prior probabilities of being risk variants. We demonstrate in both simulations and analysis of an exome-sequencing dataset of autism, that MIRAGE significantly outperforms current methods for rare variant analysis. The top genes identified by MIRAGE are highly enriched with known or plausible autism risk genes. MIRAGE is available at https://xinhe-lab.github.io/mirage.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

However, real-world Decision-Making often requires evaluating events that are both extremely unlikely and highly consequential. To address this gap, we developed an experimental and computational framework to quantify how rats detect and adapt to rare (probability <1%) and extreme (deviation from mean >10 standard deviations) outcomes (REE). Using a four-armed bandit task, animals chose between options associated with probabilistic rewards (sugar pellets) or punishments (time-out delays). Depending on the animals choice, REE can occur or not, allowing us to probe how rats integrate information across both common and fat-tailed event distributions. Across subjects, behavior showed restricted diversification (typically two out of four options) and clear sensitivity to REE, expressed as a systematic avoidance of rare and extreme punishments (Black Swans) combined with partial exposure to rare and extreme gains (Jackpots). The dominant behavioral phenotype displayed a near-complete suppression of exposure to Black Swans, whereas exposure to Jackpots remained only moderate. This asymmetric sensitivity came at a cost: these animals accepted smaller frequent gains and larger frequent losses to avoid catastrophic outcomes. To account for these behaviors, we implemented an augmented reinforcement learning model in which REE are weighted separately from frequent events. Fitting this model to individual behavioral data captured subjects decision patterns far better than standard Q-learning, which systematically failed to reproduce the observed asymmetry. The best-fitting model suggests that the rat brain segregates information from the central outcome distribution and the distribution tails, assigning distinct value weights to REE during action selection. This work provides the first evidence that rodents spontaneously adapt their learning strategies to avoid extreme punishments while partially maintaining exposure to rare and extreme gains, suggesting that frequent outcomes are treated separately from rare and extreme ones through different weights in Decision-Making.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

By switching from firing sodium to calcium spikes, these neurons implement a ~180{degrees} realignment between the vector encoded in the neuronal population and the fly's internal compass signal, thus inverting the vector. We show that the calcium spikes rely on the T-type calcium channel Ca-1T, and argue, via analytical and experimental approaches, that these spikes enable vector computations in portions of angular space that would otherwise be inaccessible.

The spatial selectivity of these regions has similarly been argued to be either unique or wholly invariant to face location, contrary to accounts of common 'visuospatial coding' whereby high-level category-selective areas inherit spatial properties from earlier regions. Because early cortical regions (V1-V3) show characteristic retinotopic variations, with greater cortical sampling along the horizontal vs. vertical meridian and in the lower vs. upper field, we examined whether face-selective regions (OFA, pFus, mFus) share these spatial anisotropies, and whether these properties could drive observed variations in face perception. Large-field upright and inverted face stimuli ({+/-}21{degrees} eccentricity) were used for retinotopic mapping and population receptive field (pRF) analyses. While pRFs were considerably larger in face-selective regions than in V1-V3, their size did not vary consistently in the direction of behavioural anisotropies. However, both early and face-selective areas showed higher pRF numbers and a concomitant increase in visual field coverage along the horizontal vs. vertical meridian and in the lower vs. upper field. Variations in face-recognition abilities around the visual field could therefore reflect these sampling differences. We also show that pRF numbers in mFus were greater for upright than inverted faces, which could in part support the perceptual advantage for upright faces. These shared variations in visual field sampling between face-selective and early visual cortex support a hierarchical model whereby the spatial selectivity of higher-level areas builds on that of earlier regions, even for specialised face processing.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Utilizing imaging and molecular approaches, we demonstrate that perforation of target cells upon CTL attack elicits swift K+ efflux followed by NLRP3-dependent activation of proinflammatory caspase-1 and its major substrate, the pyroptotic executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD). Acute target cell death upon CTL attack is gasdermin-dependent and demonstrates morphological and molecular features of pyroptosis, including pyroptotic body formation, cell bloating, plasma membrane rupture, and release of intracellular contents. Perforation of target cells by soluble perforin is sufficient to trigger rapid K+ efflux, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis. By contrast, sustained interaction with CTLs unmasks a delayed apoptotic phenotype in the remaining target cells. Interestingly, exposure of target cells to exogenous supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) recapitulates this apoptotic phenotype, suggesting that soluble perforin and SMAPs play dichotomous roles in target cell death. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for engagement of pyroptotic machinery upon CTL attack, in which perforin itself can autonomously engage programmed cell death (PCD), highlighting the complexity and diversity of the CTL lytic arsenal.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

To date, attempts to explain this heterogeneity have focused on the potential correlation between speciation and extinction rates and particular key traits. However, an often-overlooked explanation is that evolutionary lability, here defined as the rates of trait change, may be a better predictor of speciation and extinction rate heterogeneity than the observed traits themselves. Here, we show how this can be tested by using hidden Markov models (HMMs), which allow for several rate classes associated with speciation, extinction, and transition between trait states across a phylogeny. Using a phylogenetic dataset of 13 angiosperm clades including 10,474 species, we show that higher rates of change between open and closed-canopy biomes is consistently associated with higher lineage turnover rates (speciation + extinction rates) across clades. We demonstrate how HMMs can be leveraged in ways that go beyond their conventional use as null models in diversification analyses, and that comparing different rate classes can unveil novel patterns of biological interest. These patterns result in a shift in focus from static traits to dynamic evolutionary processes and may provide a more comprehensive understanding into how biodiversity is generated and maintained, in angiosperms and other organisms.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The delicate balance of protein phosphorylation is often disrupted in cancers, with hyperactivity of kinases and inactivation of phosphatases driving cell proliferation and survival pathways. PTPRH, a receptor-like protein tyrosine, is deregulated or mutated in certain cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the biological processes that PTPRH is involved in and how they may contribute to tumorigenesis are unknown. Previous studies have linked PTPRH to the regulation of the EGFR pathway but the full extension of this regulation and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We found that PTPRH knockout in NSCLC cells tends to increase the phosphorylation levels of EGFR at the tyrosine residue 1173 (1197), whereas overexpression of PTPRH wild-type significantly decreases phosphorylation. Surprisingly, disruption of the extracellular or intracellular domains of the phosphatase leads to EGFR dephosphorylation in a similar manner. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) experiments demonstrated that PTPRH do not directly interact with EGFR, but rather with NF-{kappa}B, a transcription factor downstream of the EGFR pathway. Besides NF-{kappa}B, BioID revealed 48 novel PTPRH interactors in NSCLC cells, with the strongest associations observed for PTPRH itself, HELZ2, and RFC2. Moreover, we report for the first time that PTPRH is primarily involved in translation and RNA-associated pathways. Guided by RNA sequencing analysis, we observed that overexpression of the phosphatase downregulates multiple oncogenic signature pathways and modulates the gene expression of 34 protein tyrosine phosphatases and 45 tyrosine kinases, EGFR included. Together, these results shed light on the importance of PTPRH in regulating biological and cellular processes and how its inactivation may support cancer progression.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The Paper describes a \"ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif\" in the primate neocortex: 1) 75-150 Hz power peaks in the supragranular layers, 2) 10-19 Hz power peaks in the infragranular layers and 3) the crossing point of their laminar power gradients identifies layer 4 (L4). Identification of L4 is critical in general, but especially for The Paper as the \"motif\" discovery is couched within a framework whose central hypothesis is that gamma activity originates in the supragranular layers and reflects feedforward activity, while alpha-beta activity originates in the infragranular layers and reflects feedback activity. In an impressive scientific effort, The Paper analyzed laminar data from 14 cortical areas in 2 prior macaque studies and compared them to marmoset, mouse and human data to further bolster the canonical nature of the motif. Identification of such canonical principles of brain operation is clearly a topic of broad scientific interest. Similarly, a reliable online method for L4 identification would be of broad scientific value for the rapidly increasing use of laminar recordings using numerous evolving technologies. Despite The Paper's strengths, and its potential for scientific impact, a series of concerns that are fundamental to the analysis and interpretation of laminar activity profile data in general, and local field potential (LFP) signals in particular, led us to question its conclusions. We thus evaluated the generality of The Paper's methods and findings using new sets of data comprised of stimulus-evoked laminar response profiles from primary and higher-order auditory cortices (A1 and belt cortex), and primary visual cortex (V1). The rationale for using these areas as a test bed for new methods is that their laminar anatomy and physiology have already been extensively characterized by prior studies, and there is general agreement across laboratories on key matters like L4 identification. Our analyses indicate that The Paper's findings do not generalize well to any of these cortical areas. In particular, we find The Paper's methods for L4 identification to be unreliable. Moreover, both methodological and statistical concerns, outlined below and in the supplement, question the stated prevalence of the motif in The Paper's published dataset. After summarizing our findings and related broader concerns, we briefly critique the evidence from biophysical modeling studies cited to support The Paper's conclusions. While our findings are at odds with the proposition of a ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif in the primate neocortex, The Paper already has, and will continue to spark debate and further experimentation. Hopefully this countervailing presentation will lead to robust collegial efforts to define optimal strategies for applying laminar recording methods in future studies.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The increasing size and complexity of these models reflects a trend of analyses to include more taxa and more discrete characters. However, as complexity of the models increase, so do the number of potential model structures and number of estimable parameters, making it nearly impossible to consider all modeling options for a given dataset. To overcome this issue, I apply a combination of regularization and parameter sharing optimization to models of discrete character evolution. This allows for the automatic searching and optimization across different model structures without user specification. I test this framework under several simulation scenarios including hidden rates and multiple discrete characters. The results indicate that regularized models significantly outperform traditional approaches, yielding a far lower variance and a nearly tenfold reduction in the overall error of parameter estimates in the most extreme scenarios. I illustrate the power of automatic model selection by revisiting the ancestral state estimation of concealed ovulation and mating systems in Old-World monkeys. Using the dredge algorithm, I discover a previously unexamined model structure which has both better statistical performance and a differing ancestral state reconstruction when compared to default model sets. In general, these results highlight the dangers of an over-reliance on default model sets.

In islets from multiple models of diabetes, gap junction coupling is disrupted, and [Ca2+] synchronization and pulsatile insulin is lost. Functional sub-populations have been identified within the islet that are linked to driving synchronized [Ca2+] and insulin release. These sub-populations can be disrupted under conditions associated with diabetes such as glucolipotoxicity and inflammatory environments, and their loss may drive islet dysfunction. Here we investigated how loss of gap junction coupling influences functional subpopulations under diabetogenic environments. We treated islets with a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and protected gap junction coupling via co-treatment with a Cx36 peptide S293 that was previously shown to specifically prevent a decline in gap junction permeability and synchronized [Ca2+] dynamics. We performed calcium imaging and ChR2 stimulation, analyzed islet [Ca2+] dynamics and the presence of functional sub-populations including hubs and first-responders. 1h or 24h cytokine-treatment disrupted gap junction coupling, which was fully prevented by S293 peptide co-treatment. Treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased the recruitment of [Ca2+] upon ChR2 stimulation, increased the time between first and last responding cells upon glucose stimulation, and reduced the number and consistency of hub cells. When preserving gap junction coupling by S293 during cytokine treatment, the presence and consistency of these sub-populations was only marginally improved. We therefore concluded that while gap junction coupling is important for functional sub-populations to exert their influence on islet function, restoration of gap junctions alone is not sufficient to recover functional sub-populations upon diabetogenic conditions. Thus, preventing a disruption to intrinsic {beta}-cell properties that define functional subpopulations is likely important for preserving these sub-populations during diabetes.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

IDE is known to transition between a closed state, poised for catalysis, and an open state, able to release cleavage products and bind a new substrate.

Our small-angle X-ray scattering analysis and enzymatic assays of an R668A mutant indicate a profound alteration of conformational dynamics and catalytic activity. By integrating coarse-grained MD simulations, our analysis reveals that IDE unfolds its substrates through the coordinated motion between IDE-N and IDE-C, as well as {beta}-sheet formation between IDE and insulin.

Two proposed strategies to address this dual challenge are non-biocidal inhibition of virulence traits (anti-virulence strategy) and manipulation of eco-evolutionary dynamics in bacterial populations to hinder dissemination of antibiotic resistance (anti-resistance strategy). Both strategies require identifying factors involved in bacterial gene expression, fitness and evolution. R-loops strongly influence these traits, as well as fitness of bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance mutations. This makes the enzyme responsible for R-loop degradation, the RNase HI, a promising target for anti-resistance approaches. Interestingly, the involvement of R-loops in gene expression could also make RNase HI a potential target for anti-virulence strategies. In this study, we explored this possibility by investigating the effects of RNase HI deficiency on the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica. We found that the absence of RNase HI alters the expression of genes associated with virulence both at the population and single-cell levels, and both ex vivo and during infection of mammalian cells. Furthermore, we observed that RNase HI depletion causes defects in phenotypes associated with virulence, such as motility and biofilm formation. Lack of RNase HI also reduces the ability of Salmonella to survive within macrophages. However, lack of RNase HI does not significantly affect the invasion of mammalian epithelial cells or their immune response. Overall, our results demonstrate a pleiotropic influence of R-loops on bacterial virulence, suggesting that RNase HI could be a target for anti-virulence strategies. These findings provide a theoretical framework for the development of dual anti-resistance and anti-virulence interventions based on RNase HI targeting.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We recently reported that the developmentally restricted noncanonical WNT receptor ROR2 is upregulated in human RVF in proportion to severity of disease. Here we test the mechanistic role of ROR2 in RVF pathogenesis. Methods: ROR2 was overexpressed or knocked down in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and then characterized using confocal microscopy, RNAseq, proteomics, proteostatic functional assays, and pacing to assess contractile properties. The impact of cardiac ROR2 expression was evaluated in mice by AAV9-mediated overexpression and by AAV9-mediated delivery of shRNA to knockdown ROR2 in a pulmonary artery banded pressure overload model of RVF. ROR2-modified mice were evaluated by echocardiography, histology, and RV protein synthesis and proteasome capacity. Results: In NRVMs, we find that ROR2 profoundly dysregulates the coordination between protein translation and folding. This imbalance leads to excess protein clearance by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) with dramatic impacts on sarcomere and cytoskeletal structure and function. Inhibiting the UPS or restoring chaperone expression is sufficient to partially rescue ROR2-induced structural and contractile deficits in cardiomyocytes. In mice, forced cardiac ROR2 expression is sufficient to disrupt proteostasis and drive RVF, while conversely ROR2 knockdown partially rescues proteostasis and RV structure and function in a pressure overload model of RVF. Conclusions: In sum, ROR2 is a key driver of RVF pathogenesis through proteostatic disruption and, thus, provides a promising target to treat RVF.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

It is one of two known self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphroditic vertebrates, alongside the related Kryptolebias ocellatus1,2. While individuals can be born as primary males, most are born as hermaphrodites3 and some turn into secondary males later in life4. K. marmoratus is exceptionally tolerant of harsh and variable environmental conditions. This includes emersion as well as widely ranging salinities and temperatures5,6,7. Embryos can enter diapause, a state of arrested development, when conditions are unfavourable8,9. Intentional heart stopping by animals is an exceptionally rare phenomenon. Stopping or significantly reducing the heart rate is also known to occur in some animals when in a state of dormancy such as hibernation or diapause10,11. However, an abrupt and complete heart stopping behavior that occurs frequently, causes no harm, and is followed by full recovery, has not previously been reported. We have found a unique ability in K. marmoratus embryos of heart stopping in response to subtle physical disturbances (HSPD), with fast and full recovery. Here, we investigate this behaviour for the first time. This ability begins in the later stages of embryonic development, prior to hatching/diapause. The behaviour of HSPD is then retained during diapause. Anaesthetic treatment with MS222 inhibited the HSPD ability, suggesting the behaviour is not autonomous to the heart but regulated by the nervous system. These results provide new insight into adaptive responses to environmental stressors and contribute to establishing this species as a model organism.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is another form of functional connectivity, reflecting the association between the phase at one frequency and amplitude changes at a higher frequency. Significant PAC differences have been reported for other substance use disorders, but it has not yet been investigated in AUD. We compared frontomedial PAC strength during resting state, eyes closed, in adult participants with severe AUD and age-matched unaffected controls from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA).

These mobile genetic elements can cause mutations through transposition or by promoting structural rearrangements. Stress conditions can amplify TE mobility, either by impairing TE suppression mechanisms or through stress-induced interactions between transcription factors and TE sequences, offering a route for rapid genetic change. As such, TEs represent an important source of adaptability within populations. To investigate the interplay between environmental stress and eukaryotic TE dynamics relevant to infectious disease, we examined how heat stress and host-mimicking medium (RPMI) affect TE mobility in the global human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, using a collection of clinical and environmental isolates. Using a selection-based screen, we captured the mobilization of seven distinct mobile element families, encompassing diverse retrotransposons and DNA transposons, whose insertions conferred antifungal resistance. This includes a novel element, CNEST, which belongs to the CACTA, Mirage, Chapaev (CMC) supergroup. Heat stress at human body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) significantly increased the mobilization of a subset of these TEs, leading to higher rates of acquired antifungal resistance. Whole-genome assemblies revealed that, compared to retrotransposons, DNA transposons were hypomethylated and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the genome, features that may contribute to their frequent mobilization. We further assessed TE-driven genomic changes within hosts using serial isolates from patients with recurrent cryptococcal infections and from isolates passaged through mice. While we observed evidence of TE copy number changes near chromosome ends, we found no indication of TE-mediated alterations near gene-coding regions across any of the serial isolates. Finally, TE mobility was isolate- and strain-dependent, with significant variation even among clonally related strains collected from the same patient, emphasizing the role of genetic background in shaping TE activity. Together, these findings reveal a complex and dynamic relationship between environmental stress, genetic background, TE type-specific epigenetic regulation, and TE mobility, with important implications for adaptation and acquired antifungal resistance in C. neoformans.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We have elucidated the autoinhibited conformation of an ancestral TEC kinase from the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. We demonstrate that PIP3 relieves autoinhibition of MbTEC by displacing its PH domain from an evolutionarily conserved inhibitory interaction with its kinase domain. We also show that a conserved polyproline motif within MbTEC promotes its activation in a kinase-intrinsic mechanism.

Endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) facilitates blood-brain barrier opening and immune cell diapedesis by binding very late antigen 4 (VLA4) on immune cells. We hypothesized that vascular dysfunction persists after stroke and contributes to chronic neuroinflammation and cognitive decline via signaling through the VLA4/VCAM1 axis. We used adult (3-5 month old) and middle-aged (10 month old) C57BL/6J male & female mice and a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. Sham surgery consisted of an identical procedure without occlusion of the artery. We quantified vascular integrity using blood vessel length, pericyte coverage of vasculature, tight junctions, and extravascular fibrinogen leakage by immunostaining. Cognitive testing was performed using both Barnes maze and novel object recognition prior to stroke, and 1 and 6 weeks after stroke, and replicated in both male and female mice. We utilized anti-VCAM1, anti-VLA4 or isotype control antibodies to block VCAM1 or VLA4 function, and then to confirm mechanisms we utilized single cell RNA sequencing on immune and endothelial cells, aptamer-based plasma proteomics, and additional immunostaining for vascular integrity. Mouse brains exhibited signs of persistent vascular dysfunction and loss of blood-brain barrier integrity at 8 weeks after stroke, compared to sham animals. We observed reduced ZO-1 tight junction and pericyte coverage of vasculature, and increased extravascular fibrinogen. Mice with stroke also developed a cognitive deficit in both Barnes maze and novel object by 6 weeks. Treatment with anti-VCAM1 or anti-VLA4 resulted in mice with stroke performing as well as sham mice treated with isotype control antibody on both the Barnes maze and novel object recognition tasks. Anti-VCAM1 and anti-VLA4 both increased expression of blood-brain barrier maintenance genes in brain endothelial cells, while only minimally altering immune cell gene expression. Immune cell infiltration was reduced by anti-VCAM1 but not anti-VLA4 in tissue sections. In contrast to this, both antibodies increased blood vessel length and pericyte vascular coverage. Finally, extravascular fibrinogen was reduced by both antibody treatments in multiple brain regions. Together, our findings establish the VLA4/VCAM1 axis as a promising target to preserve vascular integrity and prevent cognitive decline late after stroke. Our data is consistent with a model where blocking either VCAM1 or VLA4 chronically after stroke promotes new blood vessel growth and maturation and restores the blood-brain barrier to prevent infarct-induced neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Restoring missing ENS neurons by stimulating endogenous neuronal regeneration presents a promising therapeutic approach for ENS disease. To reveal the cellular-molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal regeneration we study a species capable of robust ENS restoration, the zebrafish. For this, we developed a chemogenetic ablation model in zebrafish using the Gal4/UAS NTR 2.0 system for targeted ENS neuron ablation. Spatially and temporally controlled neuronal death was confirmed by morphological changes, quantification of neuronal loss, and TUNEL assays. We observed an acute immune response that normalizes at 1 day of treatment. Quantification of regenerated neurons demonstrated complete restoration of ENS neuron numbers to control levels by 9 days post treatment, with recovery of gut motility. Among the regenerated neurons, nitrergic, cholinergic and VIPergic subtypes showed full recovery, whereas serotonergic neurons only displayed partial recovery, indicating subtype-specific differences in regenerative capacity and/or timing of cell replacement.

A root-uptake plane extracts water from the soil in a two-node (root and leaf) plant model, with gs a function of leaf water potential. Multi-day simulations of a drought and heat wave experiment reproduce observations of anisohydric to isohydric transitions, driven by the balance of soil supply and atmospheric demand {beta}.

This method seeks to identify the truly important predictors by overcoming the correlation structure between variables while controlling the false discovery rate. Here, we study the applicability of the KO procedure on transcriptomic data in a classification setting. We conduct an extensive simulation study using real transcriptomic data to evaluate the performance of the KO framework in the context of high-dimensional classification. We find that the KO framework outperforms widely used variable selection models, and that using KO aggregation to mitigate the effect of KO stochasticity improves stability while maintaining the same power.

Here we demonstrate that hippocampal Ins2 mRNA is higher in females than males, and modulated by diet. To specifically determine how locally-produced insulin influences hippocampal function, we used mice with germline Ins2 knockout (Ins2-/-) and the normal complement of wildtype Ins1 alleles. Compensation from the Ins1 gene ensured normal glucose tolerance, normal insulin sensitivity, normal fasting insulin, and normal body weight under these conditions. Using the Morris water maze, we found that visuo-spatial learning and memory performance of female Ins2-/- mice was significantly impaired relative to wild-type mice, whereas the performance of male Ins2-/- and wild-type mice did not differ. We profiled isolated hippocampi from female Ins2-/- and littermate control mice using RNA sequencing to provide an unbiased analysis of gene expression differences that underlie these behavioural changes.

Because bleomycin induced fibrosis is widely used as an experimental model of SSc, we investigated whether bleomycin selectively disrupts active centromeres and whether such damage contributes to chromosome instability and immunogenic chromatin exposure. Methods: We evaluated centromere integrity and downstream genome damage phenotypes across complementary systems: a bleomycin induced skin fibrosis model in mice, hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts, and primary dermal fibroblasts from patients. Centromeric -satellite copy-number, DNA damage and repair markers, micronuclei, nuclear envelope rupture, and colocalization of centromeric chromatin with antigen presentation were assessed by qPCR, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and histologic analysis. Results: Bleomycin induced skin fibrosis in mice and depleted -satellite repeats. In human fibroblasts, bleomycin generated {gamma}H2AX foci that preferentially colocalized with CENP-A marked active centromeres and produced persistent centromere copy-number loss. Damage signaling required ATM and relied mainly on RAD51 mediated homologous recombination, yet repair remained incomplete. Bleomycin also increased micronuclei, cytoplasmic centromeric foci, and BANF1 marked nuclear envelope rupture, consistent with mis-segregation driven chromatin leakage. CENP-B colocalized with HLA-DRB1 in bleomycin treated fibroblasts, revealing centromere derived antigen presentation signatures. Conclusions: This study identifies active centromeres as vulnerable and incompletely repaired targets of bleomycin induced DNA damage and demonstrates that centromere instability produces mislocalized chromatin capable of engaging antigen presentation pathways.

This multi-technique approach takes advantage of combining average size and shape information from small-angle scattering, peptide site-specific information from NMR spectroscopy, and interpretative power of MD simulations. Our results reveal the intrinsic polydispersity in size of peptide nanodiscs, highlighting the importance of careful interpretation when using averaged experimental parameters. Our consensus model suggests that 22A peptides are predominantly in -helical configuration with a disordered inter-helical orientation around the lipid matrix. The terminal regions of the peptides display greater flexibility relative to the peptide core and an enhanced C-terminal exposure to solvent, which could facilitate interaction with the enzyme LCAT.

In the laboratory, naive mice explore their environment via highly structured trajectories and can learn to localize new spatial targets in as few as a handful of trials. It is unclear how such efficient learning is possible, since existing computational models of spatial navigation require far more experience to achieve comparable performance and do not attempt to explain the evolving structure of animal behavior during learning. To inform a new algorithm for rapid learning of navigational goals, we took inspiration from the reliable structure of behavior as mice learned to intercept hidden spatial targets. We designed agents that generate behavioral trajectories by controlling the speed and angular velocity of smooth path segments between anchor points. To rapidly learn good anchors, we use Bayesian inference on the history of rewarded and unrewarded trajectories to infer the probability that an anchor will be successful, and active sampling to trim hypothesized anchors. Agents learn within tens of trials to generate compact trajectories that intercept a target, capturing the evolution of behavioral structure and matching the upper limits of learning efficiency observed in mice. We further show that this algorithm can explain how mice avoid obstacles and rapidly adapt to target switches. Finally, we show that this framework naturally encompasses both egocentric and allocentric strategies for navigation.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Q.", "abstract": "Neural diversity is required for the brain to generate complex behaviors. During development, neural progenitors are exposed to different combination of transient spatial cues for their identity specification. This identity is then interpreted by their progeny to activate terminal selector genes to become lineage-specific neurons. After spatial cues fade, it remains unclear how progenitors maintain their unique identity so that their progeny express the accurate, lineage-specific terminal selector genes. Using single cell RNA sequencing in Drosophila, we identified a Forkhead domain transcription factor, Fd4, that is exclusively expressed in a single neural progenitor (neuroblast) and its new-born progeny. This neuroblast (NB), named NB7-1, forms at the intersection of the transient spatial cues Vnd (columnar expression) and En (row expression). We show that Fd4 expression overlaps spatial factor expression and terminal selector gene expression, thereby making Fd4 an excellent candidate for bridging transient spatial factors to lineage-specific terminal selector genes. We show that Fd4 is required for expression of terminal selector genes that maintain neuronal identity. Conversely, Fd4 misexpression generates ectopic NB7-1 progeny at the expense of Fd4-negative progenitor lineages. We conclude that Fd4 is continuously expressed in the NB7-1 and its new-born neuronal progeny where it activates terminal selector genes to produce lineage-specific neurons. We propose that Fd4 is a pioneering member of a class of \"lineage identity genes\" that translate transient spatial cues into a long-term lineage identity.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

O.", "abstract": "Kinesin-5 motors are bipolar tetramers that crosslink and slide antiparallel microtubules during mitotic spindle assembly. Fungal kinesin-5 motors, such as Cin8, exhibit bidirectional motility, switching between minus- and plus-end-directed stepping in response to environmental conditions; however, the molecular basis of this directional switching remains unclear. To better understand the origin of this bidirectional behavior, we investigated the motility and ATPase kinetics of two Cin8 dimers, created by fusing the motor domains to a stable coiled-coil domain from kinesin-1. To investigate the role of the proximal neck coiled-coil region in coordinating motor activity, we compared Cin8 dimers that included or lacked the first four heptads of the Cin8 neck-coil domain. By analyzing the stepping kinetics, microtubule residence times, and directional switching dynamics, we found that these Cin8 dimers move processively with a net plus-end directionality along with undirected movements, behaviors that mimic the plus-ended motility state of wild-type Cin8. However, fast minus-ended motility seen in wild-type Cin8 tetramers was not observed in the dimers. The instantaneous velocity distributions and ATPase rates were inconsistent with the undirected movement being solely due to passive diffusion, suggesting that they reflect random bidirectional stepping. Fewer undirected movements were seen on yeast microtubules, their native physiological substrate, compared to on bovine microtubules. Replacing the Cin8 neck-coil domain with a stable coiled-coil led to faster plus-end stepping, fewer undirected movements, a reduction in the microtubule binding duration, and enhanced coupling between ATP hydrolysis and plus-end stepping. Our results suggest that the native Cin8 neck coil confers flexibility between the two motor domains that contributes to bidirectional stepping, and that sustained minus-end movement requires regions outside the motor domain.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Although the enzymatic activity of Rlig1 implies a role in RNA maintenance or repair, its broader molecular context remains insufficiently characterised. Here we identify cellular interactors of Rlig1 using affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry in a HEK293 Rlig1-KO model. Our approach revealed several RNA and DNA surveillance, degradation and repair proteins as well as a diverse set of RNA binding and RNA processing enzymes as potential interactors. Notably, ribosomal proteins were highly enriched, suggesting a link between Rlig1 and the translational machinery. Cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry confirmed that Rlig1 interacts with 80S ribosomes in vitro and preferentially binds the large ribosomal subunit near the 28S rRNA. Polysome profiling corroborated this interaction, as Rlig1 was recruited to ribosomal fractions containing the large ribosomal subunit in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, Rlig1-deficient cells exhibited earlier polysome loss and significantly impaired translational activity compared to their WT counterparts under these conditions. These results highlight a potential novel role for Rlig1 in safeguarding translation during oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

In the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, these organs are called root nodules. While many studies have focused on host traits like plant growth, nodule number, and their structural changes, nodule morphology may also influence rhizobial benefits (e.g., bacterial population size). Here, we investigated how variation in alfalfa nodule morphologies influences the fitness outcome of both partners. Specifically, we measured how host and strain genetic variation influenced 1) nodule branch number, area, and rhizobial fitness at the individual nodule level and 2) the proportion of branched nodules, nodule number, and plant benefits at the whole plant level. From the rhizobial perspective, host identity had a stronger effect on rhizobial fitness, and larger or more branched nodules tend to release more rhizobia. From the host perspective, the proportion of branched nodules was strongly negatively correlated with the total nodule number and positively correlated with host benefit across multiple alfalfa genotypes. However, the strength of the relationship differed among hosts. Together, these results provide insight into the host and rhizobial genetic contributions to nodule morphology and symbiotic outcomes, suggesting a novel direction for further research in legume-rhizobium mutualism.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

This transition requires epithelialization and changes in nuclear architecture. We sought to determine whether the cell and tissue mechanics intrinsic to epithelialization drive pluripotency progression and subsequent lineage commitment to neuroectodermal fate. We demonstrate that naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergoing early differentiation in vitro recapitulate features of epithelialization in the peri-implantation epiblast, specifically apical constriction. We further demonstrate that cell contractility during apical constriction induces a distinct nuclear mechanoresponse, notably enrichment of emerin at the outer nuclear membrane, nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, and the global loss of H3K9me3 heterochromatin which is compensated by H3K27me3. Importantly, these nuclear phenotypes and subsequent neuroectodermal lineage priming require myosin II-mediated contractility, an intact LINC complex, and emerin. We demonstrate that LINC-dependent mechanotransduction through emerin regulates H3K27me3 occupancy on the key early neuroectodermal transcription factor gene, Sox1, implicating a mechanical switch in chromatin mediation of neuroectodermal lineage competence. These results indicate that epithelialization-induced nuclear mechanotransduction poises a critical lineage gene for subsequent expression.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception. We hereby treat this preprint as a form of pre-registration, specifying our hypotheses, experimental designs, and analysis methods before examining whether the preliminary results will be confirmed in a larger sample.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Clinical diagnosis typically depends on tracking gradually developing motor symptoms as the disease progresses, underscoring the need for early detection methods to aid intervention while symptoms are still minor. Inexpensive and widely available imaging modalities such as T1-weighted MRI (T1w MRI) have potential for early PD diagnosis but lack established systematic biomarkers of PD pathology. In this study, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) was trained on 100 predominately early-state PD and 100 control T1w MRIs from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving a classification accuracy of 84.5%. Misclassified subjects were majority unmedicated and particularly early PD (< 3 years since first symptoms). To interrogate the biological basis behind the model's decisions, novel explainability methods were applied to generate regional saliency maps from both PD and control classifications. Regional saliency across subjects correlated best with cognitive and motor scores in nigrostriatal and other subcortical regions, as well as in temporal and insular cortices, indicating changes in these areas were best connected with symptom progression. The model was also sensitive to changes in the left frontal cortex across many subjects, which exhibited the greatest raw saliency magnitude. Pairwise saliency correlation was most pronounced between areas within the same functional network, suggesting the CNN was sensitive to network level changes in structural MRI. These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable 3D CNNs to identify network and regional biomarkers of early PD from T1w MRI.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Polyphenism is thought to promote phenotypic diversification through the gain, loss, and re-evolution of alternative phenotypes. After the origin of a polyphenism, one of the alternative phenotypes often retains the developmental capacity to produce the ancestral trait, thereby permitting the other to evolve rapidly. Yet, little is known about the developmental processes underlying the re-evolution of polyphenic traits and how they may produce phenotypic diversification. Here we address this question by focusing on the caste polyphenism in ant societies, which produces a winged queen caste and a wingless worker caste in a single colony in response to environmental cues. We show, in a hyperdiverse group of ants, that a caste-specific trait called the ocelli (3 simple eyes on the dorsal head) is always present across queen castes but was lost and partially re-evolved multiple times, giving rise to novel patterns (1 ocelli) in the worker castes. Surprisingly, we discovered that a hidden (latent) expression of the ocelli gene regulatory network in worker castes that lost ocelli underlies the partial re-evolution of ocelli in this group. We therefore propose that latent developmental potentials may generally persist across polyphenic systems, including ant castes, and may facilitate the partial re-evolution of novel phenotypic patterns.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

A partial section of the mitochondrial control region was amplified with cetacean - specific primers, sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, and taxonomically assigned with a curated reference database. Nine species were detected; we modelled the three most frequent: Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) (10 detections), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (8 detections), and Rissos dolphin (Grampus griseus) (6 detections). Binomial generalized additive models related presence-absence to bathymetry, distance to shore, longitude, slope, and sea-surface temperature; model performance was assessed with stratified five-fold cross-validation. SDMs explained 17-51% of null deviance and presented high specificity ([&ge;] 0.80). The Pacific white-sided dolphin showed the highest eDNA presence probabilities offshore, beyond the shelf break. Humpback whale eDNA presence probabilities showed hotspots along the shelf break with secondary high-probability patches in near-shore waters. Rissos dolphin eDNA presence probabilities were elevated in offshore zones characterized by steep bathymetric gradients, particularly northwest of the sampled transect. These spatial patterns are consistent with historical visual-acoustic records, suggesting that eDNA-informed SDMs can capture cetacean habitat use.

This addressed research discrepancy of scientific and systematic assessment of population reintroduction in endangered species. Moreover, we proposed key conservation practices and targeted strategies for improving population growth and maintenance: predator control, supplemental feeding, rescue of weak chicks, reducing human disturbance via public engagement, and implementing genetic management to avoid inbreeding.

The arrival of African and North American lineages increased the continents overall species richness but also contributed to a decline in native diversity. Additionally, our models suggest that the negative effect of immigrant lineages on native diversity was strongest immediately after their arrival and initial diversification, but this effect lessened over time.

Using newly developed genetic tools and a strategy for functional replacement of strains within the WildR community, we demonstrate that the WildR isolate B. acidifaciens employs a T6SS to antagonize co-resident Bacteroidales.

The T6SS we identified resides on an integrative and conjugative element (ICE). ICE-seq, a targeted sequencing approach, reveals that the T6SS-ICE is distributed among select Bacteroidales and Muribaculaceae species in the WildR microbiome, between which it appears to be recently exchanged. We also show that transfer of the T6SS-ICE to WildR isolate Phocaeicola vulgatus confers transient colonization benefits in mice, but an eventual fitness cost.

For the analysis, samples of bottom sediments were collected in several rivers of South Sakhalin. I found eight species belonging to three superfamilies of Eutardigrada. For most of those species I obtained data on mitochondrial COI gene and on 18S rRNA, 28 rRNA and ITS-2 sequences in addition to the morphological analysis using light and scanning electron microscopy. The number of tardigrade species known for Sakhalin Island increased from 1 to 9. Among 8 species found during my research one is similar to Dactylobiotus dervizi previously known from Komandorskiye Islands and one to Murrayon hastatus. Other 6 species belonging to the genera Mixibius, Hypsibius, Dianea and Mesobiotus are new for science, yet their formal description is not possible because of the small number of specimens. Inclusion of obtained molecular data in the phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily Hypsibioidea revealed for the first time the presence of the well-supported clade of the enigmatic genus Mixibius and gave possibility to recognise its phylogenetic position as sister clade to the genus Acutuncus within the family Acutuncidae. Two species of the genus Mixibius (M. parvus and M. tibetanus) are transferred into the genus Isohypsibius on the basis of the morphological analysis.

We propose that strategic adaptation operates through hypothesis testing: learners generate candidate hypotheses, discard those inconsistent with feedback, and iteratively refine their actions through practice. A core prediction of this account is an efficiency-flexibility trade-off. In constrained environments, where few hypotheses are viable, learning slows as people eliminate competing hypotheses but supports broader generalization. In unconstrained environments, where many hypotheses are viable, learning accelerates as learners adopt one of many expedient hypotheses but yields poorer generalization. In two reaching experiments (N = 560), we varied the arrangement of target positions to manipulate how tightly the hypothesis space was constrained. As predicted, the constrained group learned more slowly but generalized more - an efficiency-flexibility trade-off that highlights hypothesis testing as a novel process governing human motor learning.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

However, practical limitations to the number of subjects, stimuli, and trials that can be collected prevent individual fMRI datasets from reaching the scale necessary for modern modeling approaches and robust conclusions. Here, we introduce MOSAIC (Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling), a fMRI dataset aggregation framework designed to leverage the richness of individual datasets for computationally intensive modeling and robust tests of generalization. MOSAIC is composed of eight large-scale vision fMRI datasets totaling 93 subjects, 430,007 fMRI-stimulus pairs, and 162,839 naturalistic and artificial stimuli. A shared fMRI preprocessing pipeline and a filtered test-train split minimizes dataset-specific confounds and test-set leakage when aggregating the datasets. Crucially, additional datasets can be integrated into MOSAIC post hoc, allowing MOSAIC to evolve according to the community's interests. We use MOSAIC to show that perceptually diverse stimulus sets consistently improve decoding accuracy and stability, carrying implications for future fMRI stimulus set design. We then jointly train brain-optimized encoding models across subjects and datasets to predict fMRI activity of all visual cortex and even the whole brain. In silico functional localizer experiments performed on these digital twin models can recover subject-specific category-selective cortical regions, thereby validating our approach.

However, accurately estimating protein flexibility using MD remains computationally demanding, especially for large systems and long time scales. Several MD-based resources - including MdMD, the DynamD database, and more recently ATLAS and mdCATH - now provide MD trajectories for thousands of proteins, enabling the development of predictive models. Here, the Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) is introduced as a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-implement linear model for predicting protein flexibility directly from atom coordinates. GDV is a 15-dimensional feature vector that captures local packing and the spatial connectivity of each atom with its nearby neighbors. Trained on a subset of globular-like proteins from the ATLAS database, the GDV model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.828 compared to MD data. The model trained on ATLAS dataset was further evaluated on independent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and cryo-electron microscopy datasets, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the GDV-based approach. A key advantage of the GDV model is that it requires no additional external or experimental data and can be applied in near real time (on the order of 10 seconds) even for large proteins with 20,000 atoms on a standard desktop or laptop. Overall, the results show that a lightweight, fast, and purely coordinate-based model can provide accurate and generalizable predictions of protein flexibility across diverse folds and sizes.

To replicate this information-processing capacity, synthetic biology has developed large-scale circuitry inspired by the fundamental principles of computer science. Within this framework, neuromorphic computing implemented using genetic circuits offers the opportunity to significantly enhance the computational capabilities of single cells. In this work, we establish design principles for implementing neuromorphic computing in living cells by identifying the key feature that enables a chemical reaction network to function as a perceptron: an input-output mapping with a tunable threshold. We demonstrate that four ubiquitous chemical reaction networks, namely molecular sequestration, catalytic degradation, competitive binding, and activation/deactivation cycles, all satisfy this requirement and can be engineered as perceptrons. By layering these perceptrons into multi-layer architectures, we then show how to construct both linear and nonlinear decision boundaries through rational tuning of production rates that encode network weights. As proof of principle, we apply this framework to design neural networks capable of discriminating between healthy and cancer cells based on gene expression data from 19 tissue types. Together, this work formalizes the design principles for engineering genetic circuits as neural networks and establishes a foundation for implementing next-generation cellular computation.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

To identify genes whose knockout activates the stopwatch, we performed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen comparing dropout kinetics of essential-gene gRNAs in cells lacking versus possessing the stopwatch. Two classes of knockouts emerged: one (27/60 top hits) that prolonged mitosis, and another (33/60 top hits) that mildly elevated p53 without significant mitotic defects, indicating that the stopwatch synergizes with mild p53 activation to halt proliferation. Mild p53 elevation lowered the stopwatch complex threshold for daughter cell arrest and slightly prolonged mitosis. Integrated over successive divisions, the cumulative effect of multiple short mitotic extensions triggered stopwatch-dependent arrest. Thus, the mitotic stopwatch endows the p53 network with a durable lineage memory of modest stress, explaining its tumor-suppressive role.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein NF90 as a key mediator of this activity. NF90 interacts with EZH2, but not with other core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), through its RNA-binding modules. Conversely, EZH2 engages NF90 via its intrinsically disordered RNA-binding domain in an RNA-dependent manner. NF90 and EZH2 mutually recruit each other to the AR promoter, where they cooperatively activate AR transcription and enhance downstream AR signaling. This NF90-EZH2 complex is essential for PCa cell growth: depletion of either factor abolishes proliferation, an effect rescued by AR re-expression. Similar to EZH2, NF90 promotes cell-cycle gene expression, is upregulated in advanced PCa, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Collectively, our findings uncover RNA-mediated protein interactions as a central mechanism underlying PRC2-independent transcriptional activation by EZH2 and establish NF90 as a major EZH2 coactivator, a master regulator of the cell cycle, and a promising therapeutic target in advanced PCa.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

As a result, DMD muscles exhibit compromised myofiber integrity and increased susceptibility to mechanical damage. In early disease stages, muscles undergo repeated cycles of degeneration and regeneration; over time, however, this regenerative capacity declines, leading to the gradual replacement of muscle tissue with fat and fibrosis. While several signaling pathways have been identified as deregulated in dystrophic muscle, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this regenerative exhaustion remain to be fully elucidated. To address this, we constructed a comprehensive cellular atlas of human dystrophic muscle using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (Visium HD), capturing the cellular crosstalk within regenerative regions. Cell to cell communication analysis revealed activation of Notch signaling mediated by NOTCH3 in activated satellite cells. Immunostaining confirmed elevated NOTCH3 expression in both DMD patient samples and in the mdx mouse model at late disease stages. Silencing of NOTCH3 in primary myoblasts improved myogenic differentiation, pinpointing NOTCH3-mediated signaling as a contributor to regeneration impairment. To further dissect the dynamics of regeneration and infer the gene regulatory networks governing myogenic differentiation, we integrated paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data from young, adult, and aged mdx mice. This analysis identified GLIS3 upregulation as an additional barrier to effective myogenesis. GLIS3 displayed an overall increase in dystrophic muscles, while silencing experiments enhanced differentiation in myoblasts. Together, our work reveals intrinsic defects in the dystrophic stem cell compartment that emerge during disease progression and hinder the execution of the myogenic program. These findings suggest NOTCH3 and GLIS3 as potential therapeutic targets to enhance regeneration and maintain muscle integrity in DMD.

A.", "abstract": "Predicting the genetic consequences of population decline is a major problem in conservation genomics. Time lags following demographic bottlenecks can delay genomic erosion and make it difficult to determine a population's current and future risk, especially when pre-bottleneck genomic baselines are unavailable. Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) suffered a severe disease bottleneck in the 1980s, resulting in an estimated 99% population decline. However, recent work found surprisingly high genetic diversity and little population structure in current black abalone populations, raising questions of whether genomic erosion has been delayed. To investigate this, we applied ancient DNA methods to pre-bottleneck abalone shells, generating 59 whole genomes including one 34-fold coverage genome from a 1,500-year-old specimen. These data show that heterozygosity, runs of homozygosity, genetic load and population structure remained stable up to and following the bottleneck. Simulations reveal that this stability is consistent with even severe bottleneck scenarios because too few generations have lapsed since the decline. Projections suggest that future genomic erosion may be avoided even in limited recovery scenarios. Following the bottleneck we observe widespread balancing selection at genes with immune function, along with parallel increases of two inversions on separate chromosomes that are in linkage disequilibrium, where the disease bottleneck was most severe. Altogether, these findings explain why genomic change has thus far been limited, outline recovery scenarios that minimize genomic erosion, and identify loci likely that may harbor adaptive variation key to the success of future black abalone populations.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

A.; Torres-Oviedo, G.", "abstract": "We frequently adjust our behaviors in response to environmental changes. This behavioral flexibility requires adequate sensitivity to external stimuli to maintain optimal motor performance under evolving task demands. There is abundant empirical evidence that sensitivity scaling follows Weber's Law. Weber's Law states that the perception of a sensory stimulus is scaled by the magnitude of the background sensory context. However, Weber's Law has so far been assessed only in uni-sensory static tasks, and it remains an open question whether this principle extends to multi-sensory, dynamic motor tasks. To address this question, we assessed somatosensory perception of relative leg motion (i.e., speed differences between right and left legs) in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that sensitivity to differences in leg speed would follow Weber's Law. We estimated participants' sensitivity to speed differences (sensory stimuli) using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks. Participants walked at a testing speed representing distinct sensory contexts: slow speed (low-intensity sensory context), comfortable speed (medium-intensity sensory context), and fast speed (high-intensity sensory context). All groups compared their assigned testing speed against a common reference speed. We found that sensitivity to speed differences followed Weber's Law at both slow and fast non-habitual walking speeds, but this scaling differed when walking near the comfortable walking speed. Moreover, Weber's Law scaling was reproduced by a drift-diffusion model that used only reaction times to quantify sensitivity, indicating that the evidence accumulation process described by the model can account for Webers Law scaling in multi-sensory, dynamic motor tasks, as well as in static, uni-sensory tasks.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We used a classic oddball paradigm and intracranial recordings across various human brain areas. High frequency activities evoked by deviant stimuli in subjects indicate the generation of ASTM trace. Auditory response latencies recorded from the hippocampus, insula, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe showed the early processing of ASTM trace at a pre-attention stage. Moreover, Granger causality analyses showed ASTM trace is processed in hierarchical cortical areas and interactions among this memory process have been clarified. Specifically, bottom-up auditory signals processed by the insula, and auditory regions of the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe at an early stage, then auditory top-down information transmitted from the frontal lobe to the hippocampus, the inferior temporal lobe, as well as insula at a relatively late pre-attention stage of the auditory information processing.

Social conformity, defined as the tendency to adjust judgments to align with those of others, is typically driven by normative (acceptance-seeking) and informational (accuracy-seeking) motives. Thirty adults with ASD and 30 matched neurotypical (NT) adults completed two tasks: a preference rating task indexing normative influence, and a dot-counting task indexing informational influence with monetary rewards. Contrary to our predictions, adults with ASD conformed as much as NT adults in the preference rating task but showed significantly reduced conformity in the dot-counting task. Exploratory analyses indicated that this reduction was driven by a distinct subgroup of nine adults with ASD who never revised their initial estimates despite informative social cues, resulting in poorer accuracy and lower rewards. When this subgroup was excluded, group differences in conformity were no longer evident. These findings suggest that, overall, adults with ASD are as susceptible as NT adults to normative influence but less responsive to informational influence, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between types of social influence and considering individual differences when characterizing social behavior in ASD.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have brought this possibility closer to reality. However, due to fundamental tradeoffs between imaging speed, resolution, SNR, and volume, this goal has remained out of reach. Here we develop a computational method that fuses 3D anatomical information with 2D voltage video data, yielding full time-varying 3D voltage estimates. Our method, termed DENDRO, comprises two steps. In step one, we use the anatomical data to build a microscope model which maps from voltages along the tree to observed fluorescence at the imaging plane. By exploiting local spatial smoothness of the voltage signal, we parameterize the voltage signal using a set of local basis functions, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem and allows us to approximately invert the microscope model. This step leverages spatial but not temporal smoothness of the underlying signal and yields noisy 3D estimates. In step two, we train a lightweight self-supervised neural network to perform spatiotemporal denoising of the inferred voltages. On simulated data, we find that DENDRO is able to recover voltages at high accuracy across an entire dendritic tree. On real voltage movies from hippocampal slices, DENDRO recovers known dendritic phenomena at single trial resolution and millisecond time-scales, and allows visualization of backpropagating action potentials in 3D.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

BTK acts as a key signalling switch that drives platelet activation during thrombosis but is largely dispensable for routine haemostasis. It is an important non-redundant signalling mediator downstream of the GPVI and CLEC-2 receptors, plays a key role in thrombosis with minimal involvement in haemostasis, making it an attractive antithrombotic target. While BTK inhibitors effectively reduce thrombosis, their clinical use has been limited due to off-target effects. Protein degraders may overcome this limitation by enabling the ubiquitin proteasomal system to selectively target and degrade BTK. We here assessed the ability of the BTK degraders NX-2127 and NX-5948, currently in clinical trials for B cell pathologies, to target platelet BTK for degradation. NX-2127 and NX-5948 induced concentration-dependent degradation of BTK in washed platelets, platelet-rich plasma and whole blood. NX-5948 showed no hook effect and outperformed NX-2127 in potency, efficacy, and degradation kinetics. TMT proteomic analysis confirmed selective BTK degradation by NX-5948 with no evidence of major off-target effects. BTK degradation impaired CRP-mediated integrin IIb{beta} activation, P-selectin expression, platelet aggregation and in vitro thrombosis, with PAR-1 mediated platelet function being left intact. Dosing mice with NX-5948 led to efficacious degradation of platelet BTK and impaired CRP-, but not thrombin-, mediated ex vivo platelet function. In vivo, arterial thrombosis was markedly reduced, without an increase in bleeding time.

While the roles of F-actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in autophagy are well established, the contribution of intermediate filaments (IFs) remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the type III IF vimentin in supporting the early steps of starvation-induced autophagy. We demonstrate that starvation triggers a rapid, perinuclear compaction of vimentin IFs, correlating with transient phosphorylation at serine 56 and enhanced overlap with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We reveal that autophagic proteins accumulate at the vimentin/ER interface, physically connecting the autophagosome biogenesis machinery to the vimentin IF network. Knock-out or pharmacological perturbation of vimentin-IFs dynamics using Withaferin-A significantly impairs starvation-induced autophagic flux. Mechanistically, we reveal that vimentin IFs are essential coordinators for the mobilization of endosome-ER-membrane contact sites (EERCS), a critical hub for autophagosome nucleation. Together, our findings uncover a novel role for vimentin IFs as a dynamic cytoskeletal coordinator that spatially organizes membrane contact sites to promote the efficient initiation of autophagosome biogenesis in response to nutrient stress.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Adamts9 deleted male kidneys become highly cystic but remain small without undergoing enlargement, mimicking the human disease Nephronophthisis, while female mice show slow progression of cystic kidneys. Loss of ADAMTS9 resulted in loss of ciliogenesis and loss of ciliary transition zone (TZ) protein TMEM67 cleavage leading to loss of the MKS/B9 module in renal cilia. Functional analysis of all eight ciliopathy patient variants of ADAMTS9 identified to date show loss of the TMEM67-C terminus localizing to the transition zone is a key regulatory mechanism disrupted in ciliopathy patients.

Therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although mAbs such as cetuximab initially block EGFR activity, tumors often develop resistance. Recent findings indicate that sEGF can activate EGFR within intracellular vesicles, promoting intracrine signaling that sustains proliferation despite extracellular inhibition. Here, we investigated the mechanism of intracrine EGFR signaling in the Golgi apparatus using confocal microscopy, FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. sEGF, but not preEGF, bound and induced EGFR dimerization and phosphorylation.

While these innate immune cells are thought to play a pivotal role in controlling the outcome of C. neoformans infections, this critical host-pathogen interaction is more commonly studied in vitro using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) or immortalized macrophage cell lines that differ in ontogeny and phenotype from AMs. In this work, we characterized fetal liver-derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs) as an alternate model to study the earliest stages of C. neoformans infection. Here, we show that the FLAM steady state transcriptome is more similar to primary AMs than peritoneal macrophages and the macrophage cell lines, RAW264.7 and J774, and that FLAMs exhibit distinct transcriptional responses to IFN{gamma} stimulation and C. neoformans infection compared to J774 cells. Specifically, transcriptome profiling and gene ontology analysis indicate that C. neoformans infection of FLAMs, but not J774 cells, increases the expression of canonical glycolytic genes, including Slc2a1, Pgk1, and Ldha, which is accompanied by a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis. Furthermore, activation or inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) activity utilizing dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) and echinomycin, respectively, indicates that the expression of select glycolytic genes in C. neoformans-infected FLAMs is HIF1-dependent.

However, little is known about how or why nutrients modulate expression of late G1 phase cyclins. Here, we investigated the signals that control expression of the late G1 phase cyclin Cln2. We discovered that nutrients modulate expression of Cln2 primarily via post-transcriptional mechanisms that influence Cln2 phosphorylation and turnover. Nutrient mod-ulation of Cln2 protein expression requires a TORC2-Pkc1-MAP kinase signaling axis. Fur-thermore, expression of Cln2 is closely correlated with bud growth and required for bud growth.

We integrated mutation data from five independent studies, including spontaneous mutation-accumulation experiments and multigenerational exposure assays involving cadmium, benzo[a]pyrene, tyre and road wear particles, and varying generational time. In total, we analysed 420 single-nucleotide mutations mapped to the chromosome-scale C. riparius reference genome. Using a Bayesian modelling framework, we tested whether mutation density is (i) randomly distributed, (ii) non-randomly distributed, or predicted by (iii) distance to telomeres and centromeres, (iv) proximity to genes, or (v) distance to repetitive elements. Models were compared using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). We also quantified the proportion of mutations in exons and evaluated the synonymous vs. non-synonymous spectrum using BayesFactor in R. The best-supported model incorporated non-linear effects of genomic position and distance to genes, identifying proximity to coding regions as the dominant predictor of mutation rate. Mutation density increased with distance from genes, indicating strong protection of genic regions. A model including repetitive elements showed nearly equivalent support, suggesting that functional and structural features jointly shape mutational landscapes. Only 9.8% of mutations occurred in exons despite exons representing 22.85% of callable sites, demonstrating marked depletion of exonic mutations. Among exonic mutations, 70.7% were non-synonymousstatistically indistinguishable from the neutral expectation (75%).

Single point mutants to five amino acid residues in the HphA's active site were created to mimic those of HCS and IPMS.

Here, we show that stable knock-down of the protein disulfide isomerase P4HB (also called PDIA1) in prion-susceptible CAD5 cells reduces PrPC levels and results in lower levels of protease-resistant PrP (PrPres), a marker of infectious prions, following infection with two different prion strains. Partial reduction of P4HB activity using the P4HB-selective inhibitor KSC-34 also decreases PrPC levels in uninfected CAD5 cells whereas treatment of prion-infected CAD5 cells with KSC-34 results in higher levels of PrPres. A proportion of P4HB reaches the cell surface where PrPC is located, and a secreted P4HB variant increases PrPres levels in cells.

A genome-wide screen revealed 41 genes significantly depleted during the infection, including those involved in iron and zinc acquisition (fetB, zupT), vitamin biosynthesis (pdxK, cobA), and polyamine metabolism (speB). Functional assays using defined minimal media demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin B6 or putrescine enhanced bacterial growth, validating their contribution to fitness under nutrient-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that E. tarda pathogenesis is driven not solely by classical virulence factors but also by its ability to acquire essential nutrients and adapt metabolically to host-imposed nutritional stress. This study provides the first genome-wide fitness map for E. tarda during soft tissue infection and reveals new targets for therapeutic intervention that disrupt nutrient acquisition systems. These results also emphasize the broader relevance of metabolic adaptation as a determinant of virulence in invasive bacterial infections.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

To ensure experimental reproducibility and maintain cell line integrity, routine monitoring for genomic abnormalities is essential. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays represent a cost-effective and widely accessible method for detecting copy number variations (CNVs) with genome-wide resolution, making them particularly suitable for quality control (QC) in cell culture systems. Despite the established utility of SNP arrays for CNV detection, there remains a lack of comprehensive, user-friendly software solutions that support end-to-end analysis tailored to hPSC line quality assessment. Existing tools are either limited to discrete analysis steps requiring specialized bioinformatics expertise or are proprietary solutions that do not adequately address the specific needs of cell line monitoring. To bridge this gap, we developed an accessible and integrated analysis pipeline for SNP array-based QC of hPSC lines. The pipeline facilitates all stages of analysis - from raw data processing to the generation of interpretable reports - and includes specialized features such as sample-to-reference comparison, a CNV scoring system according to CNV biological impact, single nucleotide variation (SNV) evaluation and identity verification via SNP genotyping profiles, all tailored to hPSC. We benchmarked the pipeline against established methodologies and implemented strategies to enhance CNV detection reliability through expert-guided improvement process.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Its inhibition of glycogen breakdown, suppression of gluconeogenesis, and activation of glycogen synthesis are critical for postprandial glucose disposal. AKT, a serine-threonine kinase and well-established insulin signaling target, regulates hepatic glucose metabolism through transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. However, current knowledge about regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism by AKT largely stems from genetic loss of function models, precluding observation of rapid, transcription-independent effects. Using stable isotope tracing in primary rat hepatocytes, we show that acute pharmacological inhibition of AKT decreases glucose contribution to glucose 6-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose within minutes without significantly affecting total metabolite pool sizes, or changes to glucokinase protein levels or translocation. This was accompanied by a decrease in glucose contribution to glycogen, independent of changes to glycogen breakdown. Together, our results demonstrate that AKT acutely regulates glucose contribution to glycogen and its upstream precursors, suggesting a glucokinase-centered mechanism for directing glucose to glycogen.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

To identify potential combination strategies, we first assessed the ability of dordaviprone/ONC201, an FDA-approved agent, to inhibit PDAC cell and organoid growth. We observed that ONC201 reduced the growth of a broad panel of KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines, and that the expression of mitochondrial protease ClpP was required for this efficacy. Mechanistically, we observed that treatment with ONC201 led to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, causing a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, ONC201 caused ClpP-dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling and concurrent PI3K and mTOR inhibition further enhanced ONC201 growth suppression. ONC201 demonstrated an additive effect when combined with a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor RMC-7977 in PDAC cells and organoids. Finally, PDAC cell lines with acquired resistance to RMC-7977 or KEAP1 loss-driven resistance retained sensitivity to ONC201.

Previous studies have determined that in nearly half of the cases dedifferentiation is associated with the genomic inactivation of SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit belonging to the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (SWI/SNF CRC), suggesting that SMARCA4 loss causes dedifferentiation. Herein, using gene editing, we reveal that when serially passaged in mice, SMARCA4-deficient endometrial cancer cells repeatably and predictably generate heterogeneous admixtures of differentiated and undifferentiated cells, resembling human DDEC. Surprisingly, despite this metamorphosis, SMARCA4 loss does not induce lineage plasticity nor reprogramming to a less differentiated fate. Rather, single-cell sequencing combined with barcoding demonstrated that SMARCA4 loss induces a dysregulated epigenome that allows cells to randomly move through cellular states that are otherwise shared with SMARCA4-expressing well-differentiated cancer cells. This finding was validated using a cohort of patient samples, such that epithelial fate markers (E-CADHERIN) can be detected in morphologically undifferentiated cells. Collectively, this work constitutes the first repeatable model of human dedifferentiated cancer and suggests that histological dedifferentiation is not due to the acquisition of a stem cell-like fate. Rather, undifferentiated tissue emerges due to epigenomic dysfunction concomitant with the arbitrary movement of cancer cells between cellular states.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Cancer-derived polyamines are enriched in extracellular vesicles and promote lipid mobilization via eIF5A hypusination, independent of adrenergic signaling.

Agonist binding to the -opioid receptor is highly sensitive to sodium ions which stabilize an inactive receptor state. Higher efficacy opioid agonists, such as DAMGO and fentanyl, are sensitive to Na+ compared to lower efficacy ligands at the mu-opioid receptor (OR). However, the binding of the highly potent oripavine agonists etorphine and dihydroetorphine are less sensitive to Na+ than expected such that the prevailing models fail to explain their pharmacology. In an attempt to explain this discrepancy, experiments were performed to evaluate the binding properties and G protein activation of the highly potent agonists carfentanil, BU72, etorphine, etonitazene and similarly potent opioid peptidomimetics in comparison to the standard agonists DAMGO, fentanyl, and morphine in the presence or absence of Na+ or K+. In agreement with prior studies on etorphine, several of the superagonists showed minimal affinity shifts and retained high potency in both ionic conditions, whereas conventional agonists DAMGO, fentanyl and morphine displayed enhanced binding and signaling only in K+. These functional parameters were used to determine an intrinsic efficacy value, determined as (/50). Comparison of affinity shifts with intrinsic efficacy gives a negative correlation in which superagonists with the highest intrinsic efficacy are least sensitive to Na+.

D.", "abstract": "To thrive in dynamic environments, plants can use their photosynthetic plastid (chloroplast) organelles to sense environmental changes and relay this information to the cell. This signaling can be initiated within chloroplasts by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2), which can accumulate under stress and initiate retrograde (chloroplast-to-nucleus) signaling, chloroplast degradation, and programmed cell death (PCD). However, the mechanisms driving these signals, and the relationship between gene expression and cellular degradation, are unknown. To understand this physiology, here we use the Arabidopsis thaliana plastid ferrochelatase 2 (fc2) mutant, which conditionally produces chloroplast 1O2 and initiates signaling. We show that the blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is necessary to promote 1O2-induced chloroplast degradation and PCD in the fc2 mutant and that cry2 blocks cellular degradation without affecting bulk 1O2 levels, suggesting that signaling, rather than photo-oxidative stress, has been blocked. Furthermore, a global RNA transcript analysis demonstrated that the impact of the cry2 mutation on retrograde signaling is limited and that the effect of 1O2 on nuclear gene expression and cellular degradation can be uncoupled. Under permissive conditions, fc2 cry2 mutants exhibited constitutive expression of photo-oxidative stress genes, suggesting that cry2 may lead to transcriptional priming to photo-oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrate that this function of CRY2 is independent of blue light-signaling and that CRY2 isoforms lacking canonical blue light signaling capabilities restore 1O2-induced PCD to fc2 cry2. Together, these results reveal a blue light-independent role for CRY2 in chloroplast signaling and stress acclimation pathways.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

In the resulting openly available dataset, we characterized signaling probabilities and directionality across thousands local and long-range cortico-limbic connections over days.

While antibody-mediated protection is still poorly defined, growing evidence highlights a central role for cellular immunity. In particular, cytotoxic cells have emerged as key components to control ASF virus (ASFV) infection. However, the contribution of individual cytotoxic subsets across different virological and immunological contexts is not well characterised. Here, we investigated cytotoxic responses during BA71{Delta}CD2 live attenuated vaccine (LAV)-induced protection and during late-stage lethal ASFV infection, and demonstrated the involvement of different cytotoxic subsets in each scenario. Early increases in perforin-producing CD8{beta} T cells in blood after immunisation coincided with the onset of protection. At later time points, elevated levels of these cells after in vitro ASFV-specific stimulation correlated with survival to lethal challenge, supporting their central role in protective immunity. Additional correlates of protection during recall responses included CD4CD8{beta} cytotoxic T cells, IFN{gamma}-producing cells, and ASFV-specific antibodies, illustrating the multifactorial nature of immunity to ASF. In contrast, pigs with acute ASF exhibited a distinct cytotoxic profile characterised by broad increases across multiple perforin-producing subsets. Although all of them showed reduced susceptibility to ASFV-induced lymphopenia, only perforin-producing NK and {gamma}{delta} T cells correlated with viremia, suggesting their active involvement during late disease. Together, these findings advance our understanding of cytotoxic responses to ASFV and identify cytotoxic T cells, alongside other immune components, as potential correlates of protection that may guide future vaccine development.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we have developed a gene therapy strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies, to correct mis-splicing of both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons using small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) encoded from a single vector.

These interactions form catch and slip bonds depending on the pMHC activity. Coreceptors and bond profiles impact TCR triggering and antigen discrimination. Methods: Built upon our recent correlative analysis of TCR-pMHC catch bond with T cell function, we analyzed 26 pairs of T-cell-pMHC interactions to compare the correlations of their biophysical metrics with antigen-induced T cell responses in two situations: when the coreceptor is prevented vs permitted to bind pMHC. Results: We found that the force-based metrics of TCR bond with pMHC perform better than parameters measured in the absence of force either in situ at the T cell membrane or in fluid phase using purified ectodomain proteins as predictors of T cell activation and thymocyte selection in both cases when the contributions of coreceptors are absent and present. Moreover, CD8 or CD4 co-engagement with pMHC systematically increases these metrics and increases TCR sensitivity and specificity, indicating coreceptor-mediated amplification of, or conversion to, catch-bonds that enhances mechanical tuning of TCR responses. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of force in antigen recognition by the TCR and reveal that parameters derived from the bond profile, especially in the presence of coreceptor, are more informative predictors of T cell activation compared to conventional affinity-based measurements.

By accounting for how rates change in response to electrochemical conditions in a multistate kinetic model of systems with sequential binding sites, this approach demonstrates how the spatial arrangement of sites and transition states, together with rate asymmetries in ion uptake, transfer, and release, manifest in distinct open-channel current and conductance profiles. Varying these properties in model systems reveals a molecular basis for understanding rectification and non-ohmic open-channel flux. Application to more realistic models fit to I-V curves for the Shaker Kv channel demonstrates that these mechanistic trends hold in heterogeneous systems, suggesting a (potentially) transferable paradigm for open channel flux in channels and transporters with two or more sequential binding sites.

Characterization of vascular, amyloid-{beta}, and inflammatory markers were performed for pathological assessment. RESULTS: CVR impairment emerged only when VSMC loss was present in CADASIL mice and at older ages in 5xFAD mice (9-12 months). Amyloid-{beta} deposition occurred earlier than VSMC loss or CVR decline. Neuroinflammation primarily altered baseline cerebral blood flow without affecting CVR or VSMC integrity.

The Positional Burrows--Wheeler Transform (PBWT) is a natural index for these data, supporting efficient phase-aware matching, but current methods typically enumerate all set-maximal exact matches (SMEMs), incurring unnecessary computation when only long matches are of interest. We introduce PBML, a space- and time-efficient algorithm that enumerates all SMEMs of length at least L. Our approach adapts Boyer-Moore style skipping with a forward-backward traversal of the PBWT, yielding an implementation that avoids auxiliary data structures while restricting search to informative long matches. We evaluate PBML under two querying strategies on two haplotype resources. On the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), PBML achieves up to 38.1% faster index construction than -PBWT, 61.7% faster single-threaded queries (with 22% higher peak memory), and a 305.7% multithreaded speedup (with only 9.4% higher peak memory), demonstrating strong scalability at population scale. We further show that, when targeting long SMEMs (L [&ge;] 10,000) on 1KGP, PBML reduces total runtime by 73.3% and peak memory usage by 20% relative to L = 1, while still reporting over 1.15 million long SMEMs genome-wide. Finally, we apply PBML to a biobank from the Tennessee Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative and show that, on chromosome 22, setting L between 500 and 1,000 preserves at least 95% single-query coverage (97-99.8% for batches of 5-20 queries) while reducing SMEM counts by 70-83.8% and cutting query time by 37.6%, with speedups up to 92.9% when L = 5,000 and only very long tracts are of interest.

T.", "abstract": "The makorin (MKRN) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (MKRN1-4) regulates diverse biological processes, including reproduction, neurogenesis, and immune function. The first identified member, MKRN3, is an inhibitor of sexual development that is the site of inherited mutations linked to central precocious puberty (CPP). All makorin proteins share a distinctive cysteine/histidine-rich (CH) domain that has not been previously characterized experimentally. In MKRN3, the CH domain lies between the second C3H zinc finger and the RING domain. The C3H(2)-CH-RING segment appears particularly sensitive to CPP mutations suggesting it may constitute a structure-function unit. Using CD and NMR spectroscopy, we show that the CH domain folds upon coordination of a single Zn2+ ion with picomolar affinity. Spectroscopic and NMR pH-titration analyses identify a CCHC-type metal-binding site, typical of zinc fingers with protein-interaction functions. The NMR structure reveals the CH-domain adopts a canonical {beta}{beta} zinc finger fold, despite atypical ligand spacing and the absence of conserved hydrophobic residues that usually stabilize this type of motif. Thermal denaturation monitored by multiple spectroscopic probes indicates sequential unfolding, with side-chain packing disrupted near 33 C but zinc-stabilized secondary structure persisting to ~63 C, consistent with a molten-globule intermediate at high temperature. The function of the CH-domain remains unknown, but it could play a role in allosterically transmitting information on the RNA-bound state of the preceding C3H(2) domain to the subsequent RING domain. Based on a similar metal ligand spacing to a zinc finger from the protein FAAP20 and AlphaFold modeling, the CH-domain may have a ubiquitin-binding function, but this will need to be verified experimentally as AlphaFold also confidently predicts complexes with unrelated random proteins.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Significant expansion of the production area of protein crops is challenged by the sub-optimal climatic conditions in this region, especially by the increasing probability of year-to-year fluctuation of extreme weather conditions due to global climate changes. To overcome these challenges, development of new climate-resilient varieties suitable for growing under Northern-European conditions are needed. Root architecture and early root development, as well as the availability of efficient root phenotyping technologies are crucial factors of advancing in breeding of adequate varieties. Multivariate models are valuable for integrating multiple correlated traits into the breeding process. Estimation of genetic correlations between traits can potentially improve the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values.To facilitate quantitative genetics studies in this field, we conducted greenhouse rhizobox experiments using faba bean and white clover genotypes, including standard varieties and breeding lines. We report a study of semi-automated, image-based root phenotyping technology in connection with a relatively simple and affordable technology for screening early root development and provide a conceptual pipeline for genomic estimation of breeding values and correlating greenhouse- and field yield data.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

F.; Liu, X.; Zhou, J.", "abstract": "Cell-cell communication networks govern tissue function in health and disease, but existing computational tools rely on static ligand-receptor databases and correlation-based analyses that cannot distinguish direct causal relationships from confounding or indirect associations. We introduce Cell-CLIP (Cellular Causal Learning and Inference Pipeline), a modular framework applying Pearl's causal discovery algorithms to infer directed cell program interaction networks from patient-level single-cell RNA-seq data. Cell-CLIP aggregates noisy single-cell expression into biologically interpretable cell program activity scores, then applies PC (constraint-based) and GES (score-based) causal discovery algorithms to learn directed acyclic graphs representing putative causal relationships. We applied Cell-CLIP to a 176-patient lung atlas (normal, COVID-19, adenocarcinoma) focusing on 14 universal cell programs active across all phenotypes. Hybrid consensus causal discovery (PC and GES union) identified 21 directed edges, yielding a sparse network (11.5% density) dominated by macrophage program hubs. Four edges discovered by both algorithms (Intersection consensus) agree with known biological knowledge, included well-validated biological mechanisms like: CD8/NK differentiation cascades, macrophage sensing-recruitment etc. Quantitative benchmarking against a 40-edge Pearson correlation baseline demonstrated Cell-CLIP's complementary advantages: while correlation showed low specificity (28% of edges truly causal) and sensitivity (52% recall of causal edges), Cell-CLIP achieved 100% specificity by eliminating spurious associations from confounding and indirect paths. Key methodological advances include: correction for confounding by rejecting spurious correlations, detection of masked direct effects via conditional independence testing, inference of causal directionality distinguishing sequential regulatory cascades from co-regulation, and generation of novel predictions for experimental validation. Cell-CLIP provides a hypothesis-generating framework for discovering candidate causal circuits in cell-cell communication that extends beyond correlation-based methods, though inferred relationships require experimental validation due to observational data limitations.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

P.; Parvizi, J.", "abstract": "Background: How different thalamic sites are recruited during seizure propagation remains poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from multiple thalamic sites in patients with focal seizures provide a rare opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of thalamic involvement during human epilepsy. Objective: To characterize the recruitment patterns of mediodorsal (MD) thalamic subregion during seizures and their generalization to the contralateral hemisphere. Methods: We analyzed 119 seizures from 23 patients (12 male, age range: 20-57y) undergoing multisite thalamic recordings. In accordance with current clinical standards, we determined the spatial and temporal features of thalamic seizure activity by visually reviewing intracranial EEG recordings from different seizure types in each individual patient. Results: The procedure of multisite thalamic recordings had no complications. In total, we captured seizures originating from temporal lobes (63%), orbitofrontal (11%), frontotemporal (8%), occipital (8%), lateral frontal (4%), parietal (3%), and cingulate (2%) regions. Seizures were focal (76% in 21 patients), focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC, 9% in nine patients), or only electrographic (15% in six patients). Thalamic engagement was seen in 100% of patients occurring typically early during seizure evolution (83% within 15 seconds of seizure onset). Majority of FBTC seizures (73%) had faster thalamic recruitment, often within the first 5 seconds. The pulvinar (PLV) subregion was the most common first-activated thalamic site, particularly in temporal lobe seizures. Although the MD was involved in most seizures (88.2%), it was rarely the initial or sole thalamic structure engaged and more often followed anterior (ANT) and/or PLV sites. Contralateral propagation occurred in 66% of seizures and was strongly linked to MD involvement: the ipsilateral and contralateral MDs were engaged in about 95% of these cases. When ipsilateral MD engagement was absent, contralateral spread of seizures was uncommon. In majority of seizures (60%) that generalized to the contralateral hemisphere, the ipsilateral MD was involved before or simultaneously with the contralateral cortical sites. Importantly, seizures that first activated the MD originated mainly from the medial temporal lobes, whereas those spreading primarily to the contralateral cortex were mostly neocortical in onset. Conclusions: The thalamic MD subregion was often involved after the other thalamic sites, but the MD sites, along with the massa intermedia connecting the two thalami, were significantly involved when seizures spread to contralateral hemisphere. Our findings suggest that a single thalamic lead capturing both MD subregions may yield important clinical information about laterality, origin, and generalization of seizures.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

While shape is the primary cue in human object recognition, neural networks are more biased towards texture cues. Many tests of shape vs. texture bias have focused on shape recognition from an objects external contour. However, shape information is also conveyed through internal contours, shading, and attached shadows, especially when an object is viewed from noncanonical perspectives. Using models from ShapeNet, we created datasets of 120,000 texture-substituted images of objects from many viewpoints with and without shading and attached shadows. We tested humans and several neural networks ability to classify these objects by both their shape and their texture. Humans were much better at classifying texture-substituted objects by their shape than any network, although these differences were greater when shape was defined only by the external contour than when 3D cues were included. Our findings suggest that networks texture bias is reduced when 3D cues are included in images. We next tested whether the inclusion of 3D cues benefitted humans and neural networks more for images of objects viewed from canonical or noncanonical perspectives. Consistent with earlier research, we found that 3D cues primarily benefitted humans for noncanonical images. For neural networks, the greatest performance gains were for canonical images. These findings suggest fundamental differences in how humans and networks use shading and attached shadows for object recognition. We argue that humans use these cues to infer objects 3D structures while neural networks use them as another surface-level cue like texture.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Glycogen is a major mechanism of short-term energy storage with an emerging role in BAT functionality. Although adipose glycogen levels are low compared to liver or muscle, glycogen turnover increases substantially under metabolic transitions and is required for thermogenic activation. Glycogen synthesis is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme glycogen synthase (GYS1), which elongates glycogen chains through -1-4 glycosidic linkages. Gys1 deletion in adipose tissue impairs its capacity for adaptive thermogenesis, suggesting its role in coordinating glucose and lipid metabolism. It remains incompletely understood how GYS1 is regulated in BAT. To address this gap, we adopted an unbiased approach using proximity-based labeling to map the interactome of GYS1 in brown adipocytes. We fused GYS1 to the biotin ligase TurboID and used mass spectrometry to identify 425 biotin-tagged proteins that putatively interact with GYS1. We confirmed enrichment in glycogen metabolism and identified known glycogen-handling proteins, including glycogenin and glycogen phosphorylase. Gene ontology analysis further revealed enrichment in cytoskeletal remodeling and transcriptional regulation, suggesting previously unrecognized functions for GYS1. We additionally identified novel interacting partners, including CAST, PDAP1, and CCDC102A.

The literature suggests that inhalative byproducts and endocannabinoid signaling can affect processes that may affect anagen stability, and, as hair follicles are metabolically active organs susceptible to oxidative and inflammatory damage, they could be affected as well. Therefore, this study intends to understand whether population-based cannabis exposure behaviors statistically correlate with symptoms characteristic of diffuse shedding when applied to a virtual population. A synthetic dataset of 140 individuals was generated using a Monte Carlo framework parameterized by published trichoscopy-based follicular density values, national cannabis use statistics, and psychometric properties reported for hair loss and dermatologic quality of life measures. Cannabis exposure, density, and SAHL scores were sampled from probability distributions specified by published means, standard deviations, and plausible covariance structures rather than from individual-level patient data. The simulated dataset was then subjected to Pearson correlations, linear regression, and ANCOVA with demographic covariates. Higher cannabis exposure was associated with increased SAHL severity (r = 0.31, p < 0.01) and reduced follicular density (r = -0.38, p < 0.05). Both associations remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment, and female-assigned profiles showed larger effect magnitudes. These associations reflect patterns in the modeled population structure rather than clinical observations, but they parallel mechanistic pathways described in oxidative stress and hair cycle research. As a simulation study, these results cannot establish causality and are limited by underlying assumptions in the source distributions. However, they demonstrate that publicly available data and computational modeling can be combined to generate preliminary hypotheses about how cannabis exposure patterns may align with characteristics observed in telogen effluvium. Future work should integrate empirical biomarkers, longitudinal imaging, and clinical datasets to determine whether these modeled patterns correspond to measurable biological effects.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) represent a promising platform for functional precision oncology, yet systematic pharmacotyping of genomically annotated PDAC PDOs remains sparse. Experimental Design: We established a clinically annotated panel of ten treatment-naive PDAC PDOs spanning well-, moderately-, and poorly differentiated tumors. PDOs were evaluated for morphologic and genomic fidelity and screened against 1,813 clinically relevant small molecules in a high-throughput 384-well format. Drug sensitivities were quantified at the compound and drug-family levels and integrated with histologic grade, pathway-level mutational profiles, and available clinical treatment information. Results: PDOs preserved hallmark tumor features, including glandular organization and subclonal mutational architecture. Pharmacotyping revealed both shared and subtype-specific vulnerabilities. Classical (well/moderately differentiated) PDOs showed enriched mutations in DNA repair, mitotic spindle, and chromatin-regulatory pathways and were preferentially sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, microtubule poisons, and HDAC inhibitors. In contrast, basal (poorly differentiated) PDOs displayed coordinated defects in mitochondrial function, vesicle trafficking, and ubiquitin-mediated proteostasis, at the pathway level, that conferred a previously unrecognized vulnerability to cardiac glycosides. Sensitivities to standard PDAC agents were heterogeneous across models, underscoring the limited predictive value of genotype alone and the need for functional drug testing. Conclusions: This integrated genomic and pharmacologic analysis demonstrates that PDO pharmacotyping identifies biologically grounded, actionable vulnerabilities in PDAC, including novel therapeutic opportunities in basal, chemo-resistant tumors. These findings support PDO-guided functional profiling as a clinically relevant platform for refining drug selection and expanding treatment options for patients with PDAC. Significance: PDAC is dominated by chemoresistance and lacks reliable genomic predictors of therapy response. By integrating high-throughput drug screening with mutation-informed pathway analysis in patient-derived organoids, we identify differentiation-linked therapeutic liabilities, including a previously unrecognized vulnerability to cardiac glycosides in basal PDAC. These results highlight PDO pharmacotyping as a powerful functional complement to genomics for guiding treatment selection in pancreatic cancer.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We proposed previously that VRACs also support influx of O2*- to produce localized cytoplasmic signaling. Methods: We assayed O2*- influx, and guided by changes in mRNA expression (RNAseq) tested multiple phenotypes of cultured LRRC8A knockout (KO) VSMCs. Aortic atherosclerotic burden and inflammation, and mesenteric vascular reactivity were compared between wild type (WT) apolipoprotein E null (ApoE-/-) mice and VSMC-specific LRRC8A KO, ApoE-/- mice. Results: KO cells were less permeable to extracellular O2*-, produced less mitochondrial O2*-, and experienced less oxidant stress (GSH/GSSG, lipid peroxidation, Nrf2 activity) than WT. RNAseq and reporter assays demonstrated reduced pro-inflammatory (NF-{kappa}B and Hif1) transcription. KO cells also under-expressed multiple senescence markers and had longer telomeres. Inflammation causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OCR) to glycolysis (ECAR). Both pathways were less active in KO cells, as was expression of glycolytic enzymes. Mitochondrial membrane potential was lower in KO cells, but ADP/ATP and NADP+/NADPH were unaltered, suggestive of lower energy demand. Consistent with this, proliferation and migration were both reduced in KO cells. Protein-protein interaction analysis of RNAseq (PPI Hub) identified the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Activating phosphorylation of EGFR (Y1068) as well as downstream AKT (S473 and T308) were reduced. Following 15 weeks of exposure to a high fat diet (42%) VSMC-specific LRRC8A-/- and 8A+/-, ApoE-/- mice had less atherosclerotic lesion area, and reduced aortic senescence ({beta}-Gal), inflammation (ICAM, VCAM) and proliferation marker (PCNA) expression. Mesenteric artery vasomotor function was also preserved compared to WT, ApoE-/- controls, and the abundance of MYPT1 and CPI17 was lower in KO vessels. Uptake of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) was significantly reduced in KO VSMCs and similarly impaired by VRAC block in WT cells. Conclusions: Loss of LRRC8A reduces O2*- influx, oxidative stress, inflammation and senescence, lowers energy demand, and in the setting of hypercholesterolemia impairs uptake of oxidized LDL and abrogates atherosclerosis.

Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling.

Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain.

CRISPR-Cas9 excision of the enhancer has no effect in hESCs but reduces SOX2 transcription in NSCs and impairs neuroectodermal differentiation and forebrain specification in teratomas and cerebral organoids.

Two recent reviews point out inconsistencies in both the terminology used to categorise observed behaviour and the robustness of data sets commonly used to justify these hypotheses, underscoring the importance of careful analysis. Agent-based mathematical models can help mitigate some of these difficulties by providing simplified models that allow us to focus on important details and add precision to the processes involved. Here, we introduce such a model that permits us to include key life history differences between chimpanzees and humans including our unique longevity, length of post-menopausal lifestage, shorter birth intervals, and the length of our preferential relationships. To do this, we include explicit age structure, controlling for the length of the interbirth interval and mean adult longevity. By adjusting for these two parameters, we determine the dominant strategy by which males compete for paternities. We show that this change aligns with a shift in the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), which measures the degree of competition required for each available female. We further investigate the dynamics resulting from both paternity uncertainly--caused by multiple mating males obtaining a paternity from a guarded female--and pair-bond breakup. Although several factors likely played a role in the transition to monogamy in humans, our results indicate that a male-biased sex ratio and the subsequent increase in competition for additional paternities was among them.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Clinical trials of patients with hematological malignancies treated with MCL-1 inhibitor monotherapy have revealed dose-limiting toxicity and poor response rates. Therefore, we sought to identify combinatorial treatment approaches to enhance the efficacy of MCL-1 inhibitors with the goal of improving response rates and limiting toxicities. Here, we report the inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I (CI) function as a synthetic lethal partner for MCL-1 inhibition. Co-targeting CI and MCL-1 synergistically reduces the viability in AML cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples in vitro, while significantly prolonging survival in mice bearing PDX AML, indicating the preclinical potential for combinatorial therapy. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale and preclinical evidence for dual inhibition of MCL-1 and CI as a therapeutic strategy, offering a potential path to overcome resistance to single-agent MCL-1 inhibitors and improve outcomes for patients with high-risk AML. Mechanistically, we reveal that CI inhibition induces the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in ATF4 activation downstream of the eIF2 kinase, HRI. The activation of HRI by CI inhibition is dependent on the mitochondrial stress messenger, DELE1. Together, these results indicate that co-inhibition of MCL-1 and ETC CI function has the potential for improving responses in patients with KMT2A-r AML.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Meta-analyses have shown that daily aspirin reduces metastasis in various cancers 3. The biological mechanisms behind the anti-cancer effects of these drugs are an area of intense research interest. Recently, Yang et al found that platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2) inhibits T-cell activity through the expression of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, and that aspirin was able to inhibit ARHGEF1 expression and preserve T-cell functionality and cancer immunity by blocking thromboxane production 4. TXA2 production is inhibited by the effect of aspirin on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, does not inhibit platelet TXA2 production but has shown almost identical efficacy to aspirin in controlled clinical trials 2. Here we show that the enzyme mammalian neuraminidase 1 (NEU-1) is involved in the activation and downstream signaling of the thromboxane receptor in response to TXA2. Both aspirin and celecoxib as well as oseltamivir phosphate (OP) significantly inhibited TXA2-induced NEU-1 activity with subsequently reducing ARHGEF1 expression. This regulation of the TXA2 receptor activation by NEU-1 may explain the contemporaneous results of why both aspirin and celecoxib demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy in the cited trials above despite only aspirin being able to inhibit thromboxane synthesis.

The brain tumor microenvironment actively stimulates glioma invasion through a multitude of cellular, chemical, and biophysical cues. We and others have shown elevated interstitial fluid flow at the tumor border is one such biophysical cue that directly stimulates invasion through tumor-intrinsic signaling and, in other tumor types, priming of cancer-associated stromal cells. It is currently unclear if interstitial flow similarly primes neuroglial cells to promote glioma cell dissemination and can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Here, we show elevated interstitial flow upregulates expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in glial astrocytes and microglia, which drives glioma cell invasion via chemotaxis. Flow-induced expression of glial S1PR3 is tumor-independent and displays a biphasic relationship to fluid shear stress magnitude in vitro and flow rate in vivo. Inhibition of glial S1PR3 in a tissue engineered culture model and orthotopic mouse model abrogates flow-stimulated invasion, demonstrating a tumor-extrinsic approach to limiting glioblastoma progression.

Approach and Results: We utilized Cdh5-CreERT2/Apoe-/-/Rosa26-mTmG lineage-tracing mice to perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of aortic tissues from male, female, and ovariectomized female mice following 12 weeks of high-fat diet. We mapped high-resolution EC fates, identifying distinct transdifferentiation routes into smooth muscle cell (SMC)-like, adipocyte-like, macrophage-like, and fibroblast-like cells. Females exhibited higher overall EC plasticity with a preference for SMC-like and metabolically active adipocyte-like trajectories, contributing to plaque stability. Conversely, male ECs favored inflammatory macrophage-like and stress-responsive fates. Trajectory analysis revealed a novel direct EC-to-adipocyte-like transition that bypasses the canonical endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Gene regulatory network analysis, validated by in vitro knockdown assays, identified KLF2 as a homeostatic brake on transdifferentiation, while CREB5 and ESRRG emerged as critical molecular switches governing the bifurcation between adipogenic and myogenic fates. Ovariectomy in females shifted the transcriptomic landscape toward a male-like, lipid-anabolic phenotype. Conclusions: EC plasticity is a sex-dimorphic process driving differential plaque composition.

D.; Haddara, M.; Alarcon-Martinez, L.; Erdener, S. E.; Dalkara, T.", "abstract": "This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses.

SMZ-1/2 were expressed specifically in spermatogenic germ cells, colocalized with developing FB-MOs from diplotene through spermatid formation, and were redundant for fertility. Loss of SMZ-1/2 abolished MSP filaments, left MOs MSP-negative and morphologically immature, and caused primary spermatocyte arrest.

While various methods have been established to induce persistent AFib in large animals, including electrical, surgical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, each has distinct limitations. The most recent being the device industry no longer providing off-target rapid atrial pacing programs for use in animals. This challenge requires the development of a new accessible model of inducing atrial fibrillation in large animals. Methods Used: We developed a wireless pacing system using a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller (Pico) programmed for variable pacing frequencies. The device is powered by a subcutaneously implanted 9V battery. The Pico's built-in Wi-Fi capabilities enable remote connection and real-time adjustment of pacing frequency output. This protocol describes a prospective study in which swine will undergo chronic right atrial pacing for 3-4 weeks to induce persistent AFib. We tested our device in a domestic swine. Vascular access was established through the left jugular vein and an active fixation pacing lead (Medtronic 5076) was implanted under fluoroscopic guidance in the right atrium. Proper lead positioning and pacing function were confirmed through electrocardiographic monitoring of both atrial and ventricular capture. Preliminary Results: Oscilloscope testing demonstrated frequency and voltage output concordant with the programmed frequencies while real-time adjustments were made through the Wi-Fi interface. A cardiac pacing wire was placed in the right ventricle then relocated to the right atrium and successful pacing with capture was verified using an electrocardiogram. Conclusions: This protocol will provide a system capable of capturing atrial tissue with confirmed wireless power transfer capabilities that has minimal tissue heating and is physiologically safe. Combined with our literature review findings that electrical atrial pacing methods are most effective for inducing persistent AFib, our device provides researchers with the potential for an improved tool for creating large animal models of persistent AFib.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The ChP forms a blood-CSF barrier, which acts as a crucial peripheral-CNS interface and a physical defense against neuroinvasive pathogens. While this tissue is increasingly recognized as a potential entry site for hematogenous pathogens, how orthoflaviviruses overcome the blood-CSF barrier and the corresponding intrinsic immune response in a human model remains critically undefined.

ChP organoids (ChPOs) derived from human inducible pluripotent stem cells were established and determined for susceptibility to a panel of orthoflaviviruses, namely Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Dengue virus (DENV). These viruses exhibited differential susceptibility to ChPOs, with the pathogenic JEV strain being the most infective. Transcriptomic analysis of ChPOs confirmed a robust interferon (IFN) response to JEV infection. Functional studies further demonstrated that antiviral defenses are crucial for controlling virus infection, and that type I IFN responses are superior to the epithelial-restricted type III IFN responses. Critically, despite the productive release of JEV into the CSF-like fluid within the ChP lumen, selective barrier integrity was maintained, confirming a nondestructive transcellular neuroinvasion mechanism across the blood-CSF barrier. This study highlights a valuable in vitro platform and its potential for studying virus neuroinvasion at the blood-CSF barrier.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "In many low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, the global regulator Spx helps maintain thiol homeostasis during disulfide stress, when protein thiols form aberrant disulfide bonds that can lead to misfolding and oxidative damage. Spx-dependent gene expression is triggered when an intramolecular disulfide bond forms between two cysteines in its redox switch. Surprisingly, some Spx functions persist even in the absence of an active redox switch, highlighting the need to better understand the physiological significance of maintaining this regulatory feature. Here, we utilize a spxC10A mutant that encodes a redox-insensitive Spx variant to study the role of the Spx redox switch in Staphylococcus aureus. We show that the spxC10A mutant is hypersensitive to diamide-induced disulfide stress and exhibits widespread transcriptional dysregulation of genes that contribute to thiol maintenance and disulfide repair. Remarkably, the spxC10A mutant rapidly adapts to disulfide stress by increasing its intracellular pool of L-cysteine (L-Cys) through enhanced uptake, which helps restore a reduced intracellular environment. However, during this process increased L-Cys inadvertently depletes cytosolic Fe(II), leading to growth inhibition of the spxC10A mutant. Finally, we show that the Spx-dependent control of intracellular L-Cys is critical for S. aureus survival when it encounters human neutrophils. Overall, these findings suggest that staphylococcal adaptation to disulfide stress through intracellular L-Cys accumulation imposes significant fitness costs that S. aureus overcomes by rapid regulatory control of thiol homeostasis through a functional Spx redox switch.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The microbial factors that can subvert this defence reaction remain poorly understood. While many microbes have been found to increase host intestinal peristalsis, Pseudomonas entomophila infection in Drosophila melanogaster leads to infection-induced defecation blockage, particularly in females. Here, we show that this phenotype is driven by a secreted, thermosensitive protein regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Proteomic comparison of the {Delta}gacA mutant, which does not inhibit defecation, and the avirulent {Delta}hfq mutant lacking RNA chaperon Hfq, which still triggers the phenotype, identified pore-forming toxin Monalysin as one of the candidate factors required for inhibiting defecation. Consistently, the Monalysin-deficient mutant was unable to inhibit defecation. Hence, Monalysin besides causing intestinal damage, has a previously unknown role in suppressing defecation and potentially pathogen expulsion. Overall, our study identified a bacterial factor that rapidly reduces defecation frequency, consistent with transient suppression of intestinal transit, thus advancing our understanding of pathogen strategies used to subvert host defences.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We detected numerous configurations of such systems in bacterial genomes, involving ~30 different protein effectors predicted to respond to TIR-produced immune signals. We experimentally verified 15 new TIR-containing systems, showing that they provide defense against phages through effector protein domains not previously known as associated with immunity. Further biochemical analyses revealed bacterial Thoeris systems that generate 2'cADPR, an immune signaling molecule central to plant immunity. We also discover multiple types of Thoeris that drive antiphage defense via canonical cADPR, a signaling molecule known to mediate human innate immunity.

The development and testing relied on 1,077 Gram stain images of varying sizes, originating from different laboratories and captured using diverse microscopes at different points in time, resulting in differences in image quality, scaling, color balance, and the presence of artifacts. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing subsets, with the split performed in a stratified manner so that each object group was proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. Preprocessing involved computer vision techniques to improve contrast and color balance, detect contours and object borders, and implement filtering mechanisms to remove unwanted artifacts. Morphological analysis of shapes was then performed to extract parameters characterizing each contour. Next, human-like classification criteria--based on gradient, morphological features (e.g., shape, size) and spatial arrangement that mimic microbiologists visual assessment--were established, achieving around 92% accuracy in image classification without using machine learning (ML) methods. However, any further improvements turned practically impossible, prompting the use of ML methods. Thus, building on pre-obtained features, a random forest ML algorithm was employed to further refine the criteria, with three models trained and tested successively. Overall, the ML solution was significantly more accurate, reaching 99.9% accuracy in classifying the images into one of the aforementioned groups.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that phages harbored by environmental bacteria can be exploited for programmable synthesis of functional eDNA superstructures. We designed a 112-nucleotide circular template (T1) and used it to direct rolling circle replication (RCR) of G-quadruplex (GQ) motifs in Shewanella oneidensis and Bacillus subtilis. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, prophage activation triggered cell lysis and subsequent extracellular DNA synthesis, producing multimeric GQ concatemers that self-assembled into distinct morphologies: spherical structures ([&le;]10 m) in S. oneidensis and wire-like structures (>50 m) in B. subtilis. Real-time monitoring using fluorescent reporter strains revealed that DNA synthesis occurred predominantly after bacterial lysis, coinciding with prophage replication. The resulting DNA superstructures exhibited peroxidase activity through GQ-hemin DNAzyme formation and enhanced the electrochemical properties of S. oneidensis biofilms, showing a 3-fold increase in current density.

Recently, oxygen production under anoxic conditions was demonstrated, raising the hypothesis that this activity can sustain oxygen dependent ammonia oxidation. In the work presented here, Nitrososphaera viennensis produces high amounts of oxygen in anoxia in dependence of nitrite but not ammonia. Rather than conferring a physiological benefit, oxygen production impaired recovery from anoxia. Produced oxygen is mostly not consumed and therefore cannot sustain ammonia oxidation in the absence of external oxygen. Instead, it is tightly linked to the amount of available redox equivalents. These observations indicate that oxygen production represents a general physiological strategy for alleviating the potential accumulation of reactive intermediates in the ammonia oxidation pathway, analogous to nitrifier denitrification in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

EPIPs induce a helper phage--HerbertWM, a Mycolicibacterium aichiense prophage--upon infection. Genomic sequencing of thirteen isolates revealed a notably small genome size and high sequence similarity between EPIPs, suggesting they are a distinct class of phage satellite. EPIPs were categorized into groups based on Virus Intergenomic Distance Calculator similarity scores, gene content, and synteny. Gene content is largely conserved across the isolates, though EPIPs notably lack capsid proteins, tail proteins, and holins, suggesting EPIPs hijack the machinery of HerbertWM to replicate, assemble, and lyse the host. Furthermore, the unique gene content of EPIPs compared to other phage satellites, particularly the presence of a tape measure protein and absence of antirepressors, suggests they may exhibit unique mechanisms of assembly and prophage induction. Transmission electron microscopy of EPIPs reveals that they not only feature smaller capsids compared to HerbertWM, but that they feature longer tails of variable length, further suggesting a unique mechanism of tail hijacking that the tape measure protein may facilitate. Additionally, greater EPIP protein similarity to prophage proteins as opposed to free phage proteins suggests a functional or evolutionary relationship may exist.

Viruses, as integral part of microbial communities, are known to influence diatom bloom dynamics and can even terminate blooms. However, the three-way interactions between diatoms, their viruses and associated bacteria remain poorly resolved. In this study we examined how infection of the toxigenic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia galaxiae by its ssRNA virus PnGalRNAV reshapes host physiology, microbiome structure and organic-matter processing in non-axenic batch cultures. With an integrated transcriptomics and microscopy-based approach, we investigated the response of the bacterial community to dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by viral lysis of diatoms and observed a significant increase of Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteriodetes) suggesting a specialized role in utilizing DOM released due to viral lysis. Despite overwhelming viral RNA, bacterial metatranscriptomes revealed upregulation of polysaccharide-degradation associated genes, indicating active utilisation of virus-derived diatom glycans. Host transcripts showed broad repression of photosynthesis, silicon metabolism and core biosynthetic pathways, alongside induction of heat-shock and other stress-related genes, consistent with a senescence-like state. Our results demonstrate that PnGalRNAV infection speeds the termination of P. galaxiae growth, rapidly converting a productive diatom culture into a detrital DOM-rich environment that selects for specialised polysaccharide degraders and redirects carbon through the viral shunt. Infected cultures reached senescence much sooner than uninfected ones, suggesting that the ssRNA virus of Pseudo-nitzschia galaxiae can shorten bloom duration and accelerate nutrient recycling, with implications for coastal biogeochemistry. By integrating spatially resolved microscopy with community and metatranscriptomic profiling, this study links microbial composition, localization, and functional activity during diatom viral lysis.

Here, we explored single-domain antibodies (sd-Abs) as enzyme-directed inhibitors of {beta}-lactamases. A library of sd-Abs was screened, and two candidates, B2 and B5, were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Both sd-Abs inhibited BlaMab-2 activity in E. coli expression systems, following a competitive inhibition mechanism, with B2 consistently displaying stronger potency (Ki {approx} 1.5 M) than B5. Remarkably, B2 also demonstrated broad inhibitory activity against KPC-2, VIM-2, and OXA-48, while B5 showed an alternative inhibition profile, including uncompetitive characteristics against VIM-2 and OXA-48. Comparison with clinically deployed inhibitors revealed that the Ki values of B2 and B5 are of the same order of magnitude, or superior in some cases, highlighting their therapeutic promise. Our findings establish sd-Abs as a versatile platform for the inhibition of diverse {beta}-lactamases, with B2 emerging as the most broadly effective candidate.

We found that Trr1 is required for growth of C. albicans at human body temperatures, hyphal growth regulation and management of oxidative and cell wall stress. Its depletion sensitizes C. albicans to AmphotericinB and to an echinocandin. TRR1-depleted cells have lower cell wall glucan content.

Using polymyxin as a representative, bulk RNA-seq showed canonical envelope- and efflux-centred responses but obscured underlying heterogeneity. Single-cell profiling resolved these averages into discrete subpopulations whose abundances shifted with concentration and time. Specifically, in early time an envelope-stress programme predominated survival at the low concentration, whereas an outer-membrane repair/efflux programme dominated survival at the high concentration. These patterns revealed structured and time-resolved heterogeneity, highlighting an ingenious bacterial stress responsive strategy. Through trajectory inference, we further revealed a concentration-dependent bifurcation of cell fates: low-concentration treated cells detoured through a transient stress state and rejoined growth, whereas high-concentration treated survivors diverted into a slow-growing, tolerant branch. Perturbing marker genes from these programmes altered fitness eventually and rapidly increased permeability, depolarisation and reactive-oxygen burden, linking state to survival capability.

Furthermore, in mice, blocking TGF{beta} signaling disrupted the induction of FGF23 in mice on a high phosphate diet, resulting in disrupted downstream endocrine control of phosphate homeostasis. Together, these findings reveal a role for TGF{beta} signaling in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis in osteogenic cells through regulation of cellular phosphate uptake, which in turn contributes to the maintenance of organismal phosphate homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Results revealed that RNase 2 is key for maintaining cell homeostasis. Lacking RNase 2 induced the expression of stress-response markers under basal conditions and abolished the antiviral response of cells exposed to ssRNA40. In contrast, the up-regulated genes in WT macrophages participate in pro-inflammatory signaling response through TLR8-dependent pathways and antiviral immunity, with activation of MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways. Complementarily, we identified five top tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) in response to ssRNA40 related to RNase 2, showing a preferential cleavage sites at CA and uridine rich regions of anticodon loops.

This strategy suppresses leakage by approximately 3- to 18-fold relative to single blocking configurations in full Cascade reactions, while preserving rapid detection (10 min), achieving single-copy sensitivity, and enabling quantitative detection. When paired with a competitive guide RNA decoy, the system further reduces background signals without affecting true target detection. Finally, we demonstrate robust Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection from whole blood in under 40 minutes including the sample purification and extraction.

Analyzing 43,213 plasmids and 29,161 chromosomes, we reveal plasmids as an underestimated reservoir and vehicle for T6SS diversification. We identified 405 complete plasmid-encoded T6SSs and 929 orphan islands containing hcp, vgrG, and/or PAAR genes, often independent of full systems. Plasmid-encoded T6SSs are biased toward large replicons, frequently megaplasmids, with distinct stability and mobility traits: orphan island plasmids are enriched in conjugation modules, whereas complete systems rely on partition and toxin-antitoxin maintenance. Phylogenomic analyses show some plasmid lineages stably integrating T6SSs as core traits, while others undergo recurrent acquisition and diversification. Comparative and ancestral analyses indicate pervasive bidirectional transfers between plasmids and chromosomes, mediated by insertion sequences. The presence of near-identical homologs across compartments underscores the capacity of plasmids to transcend phylogenetic barriers and propagate these nanoweapons. Together, our results identify plasmids as dual evolutionary actors in T6SS ecology: short-term vectors that enable rapid horizontal spread, and long-term reservoirs that foster stabilization and adaptive diversification.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding and many non-protein coding genes in the genome. Pol II transcription termination is crucial for mRNA maturation and, when disrupted, can lead to altered mRNA processing and mRNA export. Termination involves two intertwined processes: pre-mRNA cleavage and Pol II release from the DNA (disassociation). Despite its importance, the exact mechanisms underlying Pol II disassociation from the DNA remain poorly understood. Moreover, under certain cellular stress conditions, there is a partial failure of cleavage, leading to a shift of the position of disassociation further downstream, a phenomenon known as run-on transcription. We performed the first-ever systematic analysis of Pol II termination across cell types and species and provide novel insights into the mechanism of disassociation. Using a probabilistic mixture model to quantify Poll II dynamics across an entire gene body from nascent RNA sequencing data, we discovered that genes have two types of conserved regions near the disassociation site: one characterized by a T-rich region upstream of disassociation, and another characterized by a GC-rich region surrounding disassociation. Strikingly, the GC-rich disassociation regions have more accessible chromatin and higher levels of phospho-threonine 4 on the CTD of Pol II. Additionally, we find that upstream T-rich genes are preferentially affected by perturbations that alter disassociation, including heat-shock, viral infection, kinase inhibition, and arsenic treatment. Thus, our work has determined there are two types of Pol II disassociation regions, which are differentially affected by perturbation of cellular homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the association of multidrug resistance (MDR) and CRISPR-Cas in septicemic K. pneumoniae, along with comparative analysis of CRISPR-positive global K. pneumoniae. Methods- Archived K. pneumoniae from septicemic neonates (2008-2020) were assessed for CRISPR-Cas system, cas gene expression and correlation with ARG carriage. Whole-genome sequencing was performed and diversity of spacers, protospacers adjacent motifs (PAMs), targeted plasmids, were evaluated. Comparative analyses were performed for CRISPR-positive global K. pneumoniae. Results- Twenty-five percent of study K. pneumoniae possessed complete type I-E* CRISPR-Cas comparable to 22% of global K. pneumoniae, which were distributed equally to type I-E & I-E*. CRISPR-positive study strains (83%) were MDR, and exhibited no significant association of CRISPR-Cas with MDR phenotype. Spacers noted in non-MDRs were diverse, showed increased average count and identified more diverse PAMs compared to spacers from MDR strains. Plasmids harboring ARGs such as blaNDM, blaCTX-M, qnrS1, mcr-8, etc. were frequently targeted by spacers from non-MDRs. Presence of CRISPR-Cas system in epidemic MDR clones such as ST14/15/23 in I-E* (local, global) and ST147 in I-E (global), indicated a lineage-specific association with CRISPR-Cas subtypes. Conclusion- This study demonstrated the co-existence of CRISPR-Cas systems within both MDR and non-MDR K. pneumoniae, with no significant correlation with either group. However, presence of diverse spacers in non-MDR strains that identified more PAMs and targeted ARG-bearing plasmid implied role of CRISPR-Cas system in limiting ARG acquisition.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We developed a simplified, low-cost protocol using a tetracyline-inducible (TET-on) NGN2 system in minimal media to generate cortical neurons in as little as 6 days. Methods: KOLF2.1J hiPSCs were stably transfected with a TET-on NGN2 cassette using the nonviral PiggyBac system and induced with doxycycline in Essential 6 media. The impact of adding the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, during doxycycline induction to enhance neurogenesis to was evaluated with immunocytochemistry (ICC) and RT-PCR. Following induction neurons were matured and characterized with ICC for mature neuronal markers and by multielectrode array recordings for functional network activity. Results: DAPT markedly improved conversion efficiency, reducing non-neuronal cells and increasing pan-neuronal TUJ1 expression. Resulting neurons expressed cortical markers and matured into functional glutamatergic neurons. MEA recordings showed spontaneous activity by day 14 and synchronous network firing by day 35. Secondary PB transfection enabled Td-Tomato labelling of KOLF2.1J:pB-TO-NGN2 hiPSCs, allowing 24-hour live imaging of neurite outgrowth.

R.; Grigorieff, N.; Ralser, M.; Berman, J.; Bassilana, M.; Arkowitz, R. A.", "abstract": "Treatment failure rates for fungal infections cannot be explained simply by increased rates of drug resistance. Antifungal drug tolerance, the ability of a susceptible isolate to grow in the presence of inhibitory drug concentrations, relies upon a broad set of stress response pathways and can contribute to antifungal drug treatment failures. As the physical properties of the cytoplasm are critical for diverse cellular processes, we investigated whether cytoplasmic mesoscale fluidity is linked to antifungal tolerance, taking advantage of a fluorescent microrheological probe. Here, we show either using fluconazole, a common drug that inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, or mutants in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, that cytoplasmic fluidity decreased and could be reversed upon drug removal. Reducing ribosome concentration decreased drug tolerance and restored cytoplasmic fluidity, highlighting a link between tolerance and cytoplasmic crowding and/or viscosity. However, growth in fluconazole did not increase ribosome concentrations; rather growth in fluconazole increased the number of dormant, hibernating ribosomes, cytoplasmic protein concentration, viscosity and condensate formation. Specifically, growth in fluconazole resulted in a substantial increase in processing bodies (P-bodies), whose presence correlated with azole tolerance. Furthermore, we found a substantial increase in cell-cell heterogeneity in all biophysical, biochemical and molecular outputs analyzed. Together, our results reveal that changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm occur in response to antifungal drug and suggest that these changes, as well as increased cell-cell heterogeneity, are crucial for survival in fungistatic drugs.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

The responses of Foz to these compounds exhibited notable variations, which may be attributed to the structural differences among the autotoxins. The autotoxic compounds differentially enhanced the key pathogenic traits of Foz. Syringic acid was the most effective stimulant of mycelial growth and cell wall-degrading enzymes activity, concurrently boosting mycotoxin production via upregulating FUB3 gene expression. Ferulic acid was the most potent promoter of sporulation and biomass accumulation, whereas 7-Hydroxycoumarin most effectively stimulated conidial germination.

Despite the myriad of biotechnology applications that arose from characterization of the lac system, the explanation for the importance of a functional lac operon in normal bladder colonization by uropathogenic E. coli remains unknown given that the prototypical substrate, lactose, is not normally known to be readily available within the urinary tract. Here, we identified a unique uropathogenic clinical isolate (5.3r) that has a two codon deletion in the LacY permease, leading to impaired {beta}-galactoside metabolism and attenuation of development of critical intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in which UPEC replicates to high numbers, and then disseminates during urinary tract infection. Further, we show that expression of a functional lacY permease gene is sufficient to rescue defects in IBC size and number in 5.3r. In addition, we demonstrate that UPEC are able to utilize the disaccharide galactose {beta}-1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (LacNAc) -- which appears as the terminal glycan in a subset of the glycoproteins that decorate the apical surface of bladder epithelial cells -- as a sole carbon source in a lac system dependent manner.

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN(H)) has emerged as an orthogonal redox cofactor to address this challenge, yet strategies remain elusive for creating NMN(H)-specific enzymes that no longer interact with the cellular NAD(P)/H pools. Previous designs avoided perturbing the most ancient and conserved GxGxxG motif in Rossmann fold enzymes, the root cause of persistent NAD(P)/H recognition. Herein, we demonstrated that this motif, though long considered essential, is in fact mutable to yield active NMN+-specific enzymes. This is implemented on two unrelated model enzymes chosen to garner orthogonal reducing power from either the cheap electron source phosphite or glycolysis. On phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH), variants NRC-01 and NRC-02 eliminated electron leaking to numerous NAD(P)H-dependent side reactions in whole cells and crude cell lysates while driving NMNH-dependent biotransformation with ~240-fold higher productivity than existing catalysts. On glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA), variant RSQ featured a ~2.9x104-fold cofactor specificity switch to NMN+ from NAD+.

Pathogens such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, transmitted by Aedes mosquitos, can cause severe health outcomes ranging from acute febrile illness, chronic joint pain, to birth defects and even death. Evaluating the future risk of human population exposure is therefore crucial as large outbreaks could overwhelm healthcare systems. Europe, one of the fastest warming regions globally, harbours the competent mosquito vector Aedes albopictus in over 20 countries, making tropical Aedes-borne viruses an increasing threat to the continent, which has already experienced local outbreaks over the past two decades. Here we use an ecological niche modelling approach to assess past, present, and future risk of human population exposure to dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in Europe. Our results show that recent climate change has already increased the potential exposure to these viruses, particularly across the Mediterranean basin, which is a current hotspot for local outbreaks. Major metropolitan areas in Spain, France, Italy, and Croatia are by now located in at-risk areas, and this risk is projected to intensify and expand northward by mid-century. Under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, European areas ecologically suitable for Aedes-borne virus circulation could increase by up to ~70%, leading to an additional ~50 million people living in areas at risk by the end of the century.

Previous research described that non-muscle myosin II (NMII) of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell migration and metastasis, is overactivated in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanomas. Since the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BMi) is the current standard of care, we investigated if and how NMII activity is regulated during adaptation to BMi. Here, we find that most dedifferentiating BMi-resistant melanomas overactivate NMII compared to their parental counterparts. NMII activity generally increases during the first 2 weeks of BMi treatment, and it is followed by elevated total NMII levels due partly to transcriptional modulation. Although ERK activity rebounds with similar kinetics, NMII overactivation is not prevented by ERK inhibition but by blockade of ROCK. In melanomas that hyperdifferentiate during adaptation to BMi, NMII activity is not increased upon BMi treatment due, in part, to MITF. We also find that co-targeting NMII along BMi in some melanomas reduces survival of drug-tolerant persister cells, which would delay the development of resistance. Therefore, our study identifies elevated NMII activity as a potential marker of adaptation to MAPK in some melanoma subpopulations, and also provide an approach to delay the emergence of resistance to MAPK-targeted therapy.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We investigated space-use strategies of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), a large-herd forming species and ecological engineer listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, in a structurally heterogeneous landscape dominated by native vegetation remnants and industrial-scale farms under a legal regulatory framework of agricultural lands, private nature reserves and a national park. Using high-resolution GPS telemetry, we tracked 12 herds across this landscape from 2019 to 2022. Home ranges were estimated using multiple methods (AKDE 95%, KDE 50/95%, MCP 50/95/100%). Landscape composition was classified using MapBiomas land cover data. The herds with the largest ranges (up to 22,166.96 ha) occupied only native vegetation areas, with >99% natural cover, while herds with the smallest ranges (as low as 1,708.72 ha) occurred exclusively in agricultural areas (with >66% anthropogenic cover), and herds in mixed landscapes, composed of agricultural fields intermixed with patches of native vegetation, had ranges between both these extremes. Differences in range size and landscape cover patterns reflect behavioral plasticity in response to matrix configuration, crop availability, and native habitat structure. Our results reveal that landscape configuration and matrix permeability, not habitat amount alone, govern spatial responses in WLPs. Native vegetation patches (Legal Reserves and Permanent Preservation Areas) within crop mosaics functioned as key anchors for herd persistence outside protected areas, reinforcing the idea that such matrices can be conservation assets. Importantly, herds inhabiting agricultural areas exhibited spatial range contraction, which led to conflict with farmers due to their feeding on crops. Increasing peccary occupation in such landscapes is a growing conservation challenge in regions undergoing rapid agricultural expansion. Our work on the movement ecology of a species usually considered as requiring extensive areas of native vegetation indicates its resilience in landscapes dominated by humans.

We conducted a landscape-scale manipulation, planting seeds and seedlings from historically hotter and drier source populations into climate-threatened populations of the common yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus) and tracked change in genomes, phenotypes, and fitness. Within the first three generations, source alleles introgressed into half of the target populations. Assisted gene flow increased fitness in one experimental block of populations and slightly decreased fitness in a second block. Fitness increases were associated with flowering earlier and producing fewer trichomes. Greater fitness changes occurred in populations where seeds rather than seedlings were introduced. Both the amount of introgression and fitness changes were heterogeneous between years, suggesting that temporal fluctuations in climate likely impact initial introgression and success of assisted gene flow. Initial increases in ancestry from source populations was low across the genome, limiting concerns of gene swamping. Our results are generally consistent with theoretical models, and provide cautious optimism for an often-maligned conservation strategy.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

In fact, different interpretations of the role of concurrently expressed signals predict that the correlation of their elaboration across species should be positive, negative or absent, all three possibilities have been supported by studies of different avian groups. In this context, we analysed the interaction between plumage and song elaboration in the passerine family Fringillidae (finches). We used a two-scale approach and studied this association both at the family level and in more detail within the genera Crithagra and Spinus. At both scales, we determined colour elaboration (defined by the number of plumage colour patches in each species and their contrast) and established its association with three aspects of vocal elaboration: energy investment (song length and rate of syllable production), song complexity (repertoire index) and vocal performance (vocal deviation). We found an absence of association between colour elaboration and the three evaluated aspects of song elaboration at both scales, which has been the most frequent result in other avian groups. At first glance, this result appears to be partially discordant with previous findings in finches, but considering these studies together this might not necessarily be the case. We also confirmed that finches have complex songs and a remarkable vocal performance compared to other families of passerines. Considered together, our results suggest an independent evolution of colour and the notable vocal elaboration present in finches.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here we examine two sources of error: (1) statistical bias in the estimators themselves, and the (2) structural bias introduced by how small trees are handled in likelihood calculations. For the Yule process, we re-derive the expected bias of the standard estimator, showing that the estimator {lambda} underestimates true {lambda} by a factor of (n-2)/(n-1). Extending to the general birth-death model, we use symbolic regression to find functional forms that minimize the bias in both {lambda} and . The best-performing correction for {lambda} is similar to the Yule result, while the bias in  depends on both turnover ({lambda} + ) and the extinction fraction (/{lambda}). Applying these corrections substantially improves the fit between the estimated and generating values. When these corrected estimators are used to derive other diversification-related parameters, turnover is nearly unbiased, but net diversification ({lambda} - ) remains systematically underestimated, particularly at larger values, due to the slight overestimation of . On the whole, these results clarify the statistical and structural sources of bias in diversification rate estimation and provide a general framework for improving inference under birth-death models.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Mutations in OCRL lead to a rare human genetic disorder, Lowe syndrome (LS) that affects the eye, kidney and brain. OCRL is widely expressed in cells and is localized to multiple organelles, including the plasma membrane, endosomes, Golgi and lysosomes. Although multiple defects in the endo-lysosomal system have been reported in OCRL depleted cells, the primary site of action of OCRL is unclear. Here we present a Drosophila nephrocyte model of LS; depletion of Drosophila OCRL (dOCRL) manifests with defects in endocytic uptake, altered endosomal compartments as well as expanded but dysfunctional lysosomes. Reconstitution of dOCRL depleted nephrocytes with a lysosome targeted version of the enzyme rescues not only the lysosomal defects but surprisingly also defects in endosomal structure and function. These findings suggest that the primary defect in LS cells is likely to be altered lysosome structure and function. Therefore, regulation of PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis at the lysosome membrane by OCRL is critical to homeostasis of the endosomal system.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here, using high-density 3D single-molecule light-field microscopy combined with novel spatiotemporal analysis pipelines, we track SOX2 and NANOG dynamics in live cells. Despite lower protein abundance, NANOG displays a similar chromatin bound fraction to SOX2. This arises partially because, while both TFs undergo frequent transient non-specific binding interactions (~0.5-0.7s), NANOG exhibits more stable specific binding (~25s vs ~16s). Both TFs also assemble into phase-separated domains of ~400 nm containing both freely diffusing and chromatin-bound proteins, which further influences their dynamics. Strikingly, NANOG's protein-protein interaction domain markedly increases chromatin residence time (>5-fold) and the size of these phase-separated domains. Our work uncovers how NANOG and SOX2 stabilise gene regulatory networks that maintain naive pluripotency while providing quantitative pipelines for dissecting spatiotemporal TF dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We show that in Tetrahymena, loss of SPEF1 destabilized the central pair throughout the cilium length, producing gaps in the microtubule lattice, loss of proximal microtubule portions, and loss of lateral projections. While both central microtubules were affected, C1 suffered more damage than C2 and the defects were already apparent during ciliary assembly. Tetrahymena cells lacking SPEF1 had fewer cilia, which contained an excessively dense ciliary matrix and abnormal densities on the doublet microtubules. Although SPEF1 loss visibly affected only the central microtubules, it localized to all stable microtubules in the cell, both ciliary and non-ciliary. Within cilia, SPEF1 was enriched near the distal tip, but was also present throughout the middle segment, where it was more concentrated along the central than the outer doublet microtubules. In live cilia, SPEF1 particles were mostly stationary and turned over slowly, some diffused but none moved by IFT. We propose that SPEF1 acts as a stabilizer of central microtubules in both the middle and distal segment and its activity contributes to central microtubule assembly.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Patients with SSc may suffer from painful digital ulcers due to endothelial cell dysfunction and excessive extracellular matrix production through fibroblast activation, leading to skin fibrosis. To better understand the crosstalk between fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the context of SSc, we developed 3D vascularized skin organoids using SSc-derived fibroblasts from two patients. After several morphological and molecular characterizations of healthy and pathological skin organoids, we demonstrate, for the first time, that SSc patient-derived fibroblasts can trigger structural abnormalities in skin organoids that emulate some features of the disease: the vasculopathy characterized by the formation of giant capillaries and the early fibrosis associated with cytokine and chemokine secretions. It appeared that SSc-derived fibroblasts play a major role in the vascular specificities of this disease, highlighting an interesting crosstalk between these cell populations. Therefore, these SSc-fibroblast containing skin organoids may enable to gain a deeper insight into the physiopathology of SSc and provide an alternative model to animal testing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Both translational science efforts to better understand the physiology of gamma delta T cells and clinical research concerning the applications of gamma delta T cell immunotherapy require successful gamma delta T cell expansion techniques. Building on prior methods and recent innovations, in this study we optimized in vitro methods for rapid and efficient expansion of Vdelta1+ T cells from stimulated PBMCs. CD3-stimulated PBMCs from rhesus macaques in the presence of phospho-vitamin C (pVC) and IL-15 achieved up to a 6561-fold expansion (average 2559-fold) increase of Vdelta1+ T cells after 9-day culture. Comparable expansion was obtained with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMCs, achieving up to 7574-fold expansion (average 2040-fold) increase when IL-7 and IL-18 were added alongside IL-15 and pVC. Notably, inclusion of pVC significantly enhanced the expansion of Vdelta1+ T cells in both stimulation conditions. These results provide optimized conditions for scalable in vitro expansion of peripheral blood Vdelta1+ T cells from nonhuman primates, supporting downstream applications in immunophenotyping, functional assays, and preclinical modeling of gamma delta delta T cell-based immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

This study set out to characterize a novel 69 amino acid miP encoded by a smORF located within the coding sequence of the FERM domain containing kindlin-3 transcript (miP-FERMT3). Methods: Confocal microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of miP-FERMT3 in endothelial cells and its interaction partners were determined by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. RNA sequencing identified transcriptional alterations induced by miP-FERMT3 overexpression. Cell proliferation and cell cycle stages were assessed by live cell imaging, EdU incorporation and flow cytometry, while senescence was examined by senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase staining, live cell imaging and RT-qPCR-based measurement of telomere length. Results: In endothelial cells miP-FERMT3 localized mainly to centriole subdistal appendages, where it interacted with proteins involved in ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent protein catabolism, including PSMD9, CUL2 and TRIM8. Consistent with these interactions, cells expressing miP-FERMT3 exhibited increased global protein ubiquitination, enhanced centrosomal neddylation and elevated proteasomal activity. MiP-FERMT3 also promoted the nuclear accumulation of p53, which subsequently repressed FOXM1 expression, leading to the downregulation of genes required for cell-cycle progression and upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle inhibition, resulting in cell-cycle arrest. Cells expressing the miP also demonstrated multiple hallmarks of cellular senescence, including enlarged size, DNA damage, increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity, telomere shortening and paracrine pro-inflammatory activation of naive endothelial cells. Analyses of independent murine and human transcriptomic and proteomic aging datasets further revealed that FERMT3 expression and protein abundance increase with age. Conclusions: These findings identify miP-FERMT3 as a novel regulator of protein catabolism and p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in endothelial cells. Given the aging-associated upregulation of FERMT3 in mouse and human endothelial cells, increased miP-FERMT3 expression may contribute to the onset of vascular senescence as a hallmark of aging.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

Here we use high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy and live imaging to investigate the differential contributions of {beta} -tubulin isotypes (TBB-1 and TBB-2) to assembly and function of acentrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. By combining strains with altered {beta} -tubulin isotype composition with mutations affecting microtubule-crosslinking motor KLP-18 and/or mutations affecting katanin-mediated microtubule severing, we show that TBB-1 and TBB-2 make distinct contributions to promoting spindle bipolarity. Further, by measuring multiple spindle features in wild-type and {beta}-tubulin isotype substitution strains, we reveal contributions of isotype composition to spindle morphology, kinetics of anaphase chromosome separation and maintenance of spindle structural integrity under stress. Together, our data support a model in which {beta} -tubulin isotype composition helps to maintain a balance between microtubule crosslinking and severing activities during oocyte meiosis. We further propose that this balance is crucial for establishing spindle bipolarity, maintaining spindle structures, and modulating the dynamics of chromosome separation.", "date": "2025-12-03", "journal": ""}

We investigated spatial patterns of ubiquitination in human skin, discovering specific ubiquitin linkages located within the hair follicle and epidermis. To create a comprehensive physiological profile of the ubiquitinated proteins within the skin, we profiled healthy skin and CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS) skin tumours through di-glycine remnant immunopurification proteomics, enabling identification of 1605 ubiquitin sites across 731 proteins. The healthy cutaneous ubiquitinome comprised substrate classes including keratins, S100 proteins and histones. Predictive upstream enzyme analysis ranked the most frequent E3 ligase as NEDD4, and the most frequent deubiquitinases included USP7 and CYLD. Analysis of the CCS tumor ubiquitinome, characterized by catalytically inactivated CYLD somatic mutations and prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion, identified 251 differentially ubiquitinated sites compared to healthy skin. The CCS ubiquitinome was enriched for cell division and differentiation proteins, including predicted CYLD substrate insulin receptor (INSR). Secretome analysis of INSR knockdown CCS primary cells revealed reduced secretion of basement membrane proteins, particularly COL7A1.

As a result, mitochondrial content and oxidative phosphorylation decline sharply across multiple tissues, leading to early mortality, with no effective treatments currently existing. In this study, we demonstrate that activating AMPK markedly suppresses BNIP3/NIX-dependent mitophagy and restores mitochondrial respiration in FBXL4-deficient cells. Using both fibroblasts derived from MTDPS13 patients and a chemically-induced in vivo model, we show that small molecule AMPK activation inhibits BNIP3/NIX-mediated mitophagy and recovers mitochondrial content.
