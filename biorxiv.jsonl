Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity and establishing a predictive model is highly relevant for future agriculture under changing climate. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of leaf width plasticity in a tobacco MAGIC population across four different environments. Environmental changes not only resulted in differences in leaf width mean but also in leaf width plasticity. A total of 45 QTL were identified, including 14 QTL for leaf width mean and 43 for leaf width plasticity, with 12 overlap. Changes in the environment affected the magnitude of several QTL, thereby influencing phenotypic plasticity. We identified a QTL, qLW14, associated with leaf width plasticity and leaf width mean at Zhucheng, but had no significant impact at Guiyang, indicating that changes in the environment contributed to variations in leaf width plasticity. By integrating genetic diversity, environmental variation, and their interactions into a unified model, we were able to build a model for cross-environment predictions, and improved prediction accuracy by 7.2%. Overall, this study reveals complex genetic basis involving multiple alleles, and genotype interactions underlying variations of leaf width mean and plasticity. These findings contribute to assessing the role of plasticity in responding to climate or other environmental changes.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "More than four decades ago, Gibbon and Balsam (1981) showed that the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning in pigeons is directly related to the informativeness of the conditioning stimulus (CS) about the unconditioned stimulus (US), where informativeness is defined as the ratio of the US-US interval (C) to the CS-US interval (T). However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different C/T ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the C/T ratio, and the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness is similar to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to T, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1/T). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats overall response rates (during the CS and inter-trial interval) which was directly proportional to the overall rate of reinforcement in the context (1/C). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of these observations across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Soluble TNF (sTNF-) increases IRD at cluster cores but decreases it at rims via receptor reorganization. Reducing IRD through membrane tension, zafirlukast, actin depolymerization, or cholesterol depletion suppresses sTNF signaling, whereas increasing IRD by lowering membrane tension or exposing cells in a 3D gel-like microenvironment triggers ligand independent activation.

We show that before the formation of germ layers, the chromatin and transcription states of cells are uncoupled, and become progressively connected during gastrulation and somitogenesis. Silencing of key developmental genes is achieved by local spreading of repressive chromatin as development proceeds. We use a joint analysis of transcription factor (TF) expression and chromatin states to predict lineage-specific activators and repressors and identify a subset of TFs that are themselves epigenetically regulated.

While metrics such as pAE and ipTM have been shown to be useful filters for experimental success, there is no evidence that they are suitable for ranking, particularly for antibody sequence designs.

F.; Sompolinsky, H.", "abstract": "A major challenge in neuroscience is reconciling idealized theoretical models with complex, heterogeneous experimental data. We address this challenge through continuous-attractor networks, which model how neural circuits represent continuous variables such as head direction or spatial location through collective dynamics. Classical continuous-attractor models rely on continuous symmetry in the recurrent weights to generate a manifold of stable states, predicting tuning curves that are identical up to shifts. However, mouse head-direction cells exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their responses, seemingly incompatible with this classical picture. We demonstrate that mammalian circuits could nevertheless rely on the same dynamical mechanisms as classical continuous-attractor models. We construct recurrent neural networks directly from experimental head-direction tuning curves that exhibit quasi-continuous-attractor dynamics, then develop a statistical generative process quantitatively capturing the structure of tuning heterogeneity. This enables large-N analysis, where we show through dynamical mean-field theory that these networks become equivalent to classical ring-attractor models, with Mexican-hat interactions and continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, leading to bump states. In the seemingly disordered weights, the continuous symmetry essential to classical models is reflected through eigenvalue degeneracies, positioning spectral structure as a target for detecting continuous-attractor circuits in connectome data. We extend this framework to two-dimensional symmetries, constructing grid-cell models that similarly reduce to classical toroidal attractors. Our work demonstrates that the dynamical mechanisms of classical continuous-attractor models may operate not only in small brains or idealized systems but also in complex mammalian circuits.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

For mutagenesis methods, an ideal goal is to reach the efficiency of 100%. Towards this goal, we have recently taken the first step by adopting an innovative strategy via primer pairs with 3-prime overhangs and developing P3 site-directed mutagenesis, with an average efficiency of ~50%. As the second step towards the ideal goal, we report here P3a site-directed mutagenesis with an efficiency reaching ~100%. We systematically evaluated this new method by engineering >100 point mutations and small deletions (or insertions) on >20 mammalian expression vectors encoding various epigenetic regulators and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. As all known mutagenesis methods are limited to point mutations and small deletions/insertions (up to a dozen nucleotides), a technical problem is how to carry out cassette mutagenesis for replacement, deletion or insertion of large DNA fragments. The high efficiency of P3a mutagenesis and the handshaking feature of primer pairs with 3-prime overhangs inspired us to adapt this new method for seamless cassette mutagenesis, including highly efficient epitope tagging and untagging, deletion of small or large DNA fragments (up to 5 kb) and insertion of gene fragments (up to ~0.4 kb), LoxP sites and sequences encoding degrons, sgRNA and tigRNA.

G.", "abstract": "Variation in the structure and composition of host-associated microbial communities often parallels patterns of phylogenetic divergence between hosts. This pattern is generally known as phylosymbiosis and there is great interest in understanding how such patterns emerge from fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes. Understanding of this phenomenon relies initially on quantifying phylosymbiotic signals from across a broad range of host taxa. Quantifying signals of phylosymbiosis is typically achieved by calculating how congruent a host's phylogenetic tree is with a dendrogram that represents patterns of dissimilarity in their associated microbial communities. To statistically assess the degree of congruence, several studies have constructed null models using a Monte Carlo approach to randomly sample trees. Although this approach is becoming more common, it has several features that warrant benchmarking to advise its further use. This approach relies on quantification of congruence between a host's phylogenetic tree its microbial community dendrogram. Therefore, it is important to establish how choice of congruence metric influences null model-based inferences. Furthermore, phylosymbiotic signals may manifest at different scales of host divergence, and it is important to establish the extent of host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect a phylosymbiotic signal. To help improve our study of phylosymbiosis, here I examine how power and type 1 error (false positive) rates associated with this approach varies with choice of congruence metric and host phylogenetic coverage. Furthermore, I examine variation in sensitivity given uncertainty in tree estimation, as well as how well null congruence models align with expectations of community assembly that is completely neutral with respect to host phylogeny. I generally found that model performance increased rapidly with increasing tree sizes, suggesting lower limits on the host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect phylosymbiotic signals with this approach. Furthermore, I found several notable variations in performance between congruence metrics, which translated into different inferences regarding signal detection.

Under the phylospecies concept, species are delimited by apomorphies, which are difficult to establish when characters are not discrete. In the present study, we address these challenges in the Australian land snail genus Thersites (family Camaenidae), where accepted species exhibit a scarcity of discrete distinguishing characters and differ in a limited range of continuous characters according to prior taxonomic studies. We integrate analyses of genome-scale molecular data with evaluations of several continuous, qualitative, and discrete morphological characters derived from landmarks to delineate species through detecting apomorphies. We found that dimensions of shell and genitals overlapped considerably among the currently accepted species. These overlaps may indicate morphospace saturation, which may affect species delineation through the gen-morph species concept. Statistical methods, such as Dunn's test, failed to consistently delineate monophyletic taxa. Additionally, we could not derive apomorphies from discretized landmarks for the prevalence of outlier specimens. However, applying the Kruskal-Wallis test at certain nodes of the tree revealed significant differences in certain continuous characters. We propose that these inferred differences represent apomorphies. Ultimately, our results suggest that of the four species currently accepted, both T. mitchellae and T. novaehollandiae should be synonymized as T. novaehollandiae is paraphyletic with respect to T. mitchellae. In addition, T. darlingtoni nests within the T. richmondiana lineage, and both taxa are also considered synonyms. Distinct character states of the umbilicus support the existence of two independent lineages. One with an open (T. sp1 + T. sp2) and one with a closed umbilicus (T. novaehollandiae + T. richmondiana).

We found that neuronal activity in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) can be effectively suppressed both in vitro and in vivo using the inhibitory DREADD by its ligand deschloroclozapine (DCZ). By establishing a high-throughput system for recording and analyzing their vocalizations, we systematically assessed the effects of DREADD-mediated suppression on song behavior. Inhibiting HVC in zebra finches led to a reduction in song production number for approximately 90 min and altered phonological features over a longer time course. Notably, the concentration of DCZ required to induce robust effects on song behaviors was higher than doses typically used in mice. Furthermore, suppression of HVC or Area X in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) produced a distinct effect on song features, suggesting species-specific responses to chemogenetic intervention.

SA187 inoculation led to marked increases in biomass, primary root length, and lateral root density, with growth-promoting effects becoming more important with the severity of nitrate limitation. Analyses suggested enhanced nitrate uptake and improved nitrogen partitioning as indicated by reduced shoot carbon:nitrogen ratios. Transcriptomic profiling identified SA187-driven reprogramming of host gene expression, including the induction of high-affinity nitrate transporters (HATs) and hormone-responsive pathways. Functional analyses confirmed that the growth-promoting effect of SA187 required both ethylene signaling and specific HATs. The ein2, nrt2.5, and nrt2.6 mutants failed to show SA187-induced growth promotion, and expression analysis revealed that NRT2.5 was regulated downstream of ethylene signaling, while NRT2.6 was partially independent. These findings position SA187 as a conditionally beneficial endophyte that can improve plant growth through coordinated, context-dependent regulation of nitrate uptake and allocation.

Combining these data with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and present-day aridity indices, we investigate, from a spatio-temporal perspective, how intraspecific genetic variation relates to aridity. Inference of past effective population size revealed a sharp decline in the late Pleistocene, coinciding with regional aridification and potentially reflecting changes in connectivity during dry periods. Current population structure followed a pattern of isolation by distance and mirrored the aridity gradient. Genotype-Environment Association analyses identified SNPs and genes significantly associated with aridity and genetically differentiated among populations, with functions related to water and energy conservation - as expected under arid conditions - as well as neurotransmission.

However, the location of the central pattern generator (CPG) and the sensory feedback orchestrating this process remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we identify a novel pair of multidendritic mechanosensory neurons (mdn-LO) in the lateral oviducts that express the mechanosensitive channels TMC (transmembrane channel-like protein), PPK (pickpocket), and Piezo. We demonstrate that TMC is essential for ovulation coordination: tmc mutation or neuron-specific knockdown increases egg-jamming at the junction between the lateral and the common oviduct, while ppk or Piezo single mutants reduce egg-laying without causing jamming. Calcium imaging reveals that mdn-LO neurons are rhythmically activated by oviduct contractions, and chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons triggers muscle contractions. Trans-Tango and GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners) analyses show that mdn-LO neurons form synapses with female-specific insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)-expressing oviduct motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion. Activating either mdn-LO or ILP7 neurons induces egg-jamming, indicating their roles within a CPG network. Whereas the ILP7 neurons are likely to coordinate oviduct muscle contractions using glutamate, we found that the co-localized ILP7 affects the rate of ovulation, but plays no role in egg jamming. Importantly, the ILP7 neurons exhibit spontaneous rhythmic calcium oscillations, which are regulated by the mechanical feedback generated by egg movement in the oviduct. This novel circuit, including the TMC-expressing mdn-LO neurons and a set of ILP7 neurons, organizes an innate behavior by coupling strategic sensory information and a CPG to ensure bilateral coordination of oviduct contractions to prevent egg jamming during oviposition.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

However, in vivo experiments on mouse tibiae under cantilever loading revealed new bone formation exclusively on the anterolateral side, despite the opposite posteromedial surface experiencing comparable magnitudes of these stimuli. This indicates that individual stimulus magnitude is insufficient and suggests an interactive mechanism among them. To investigate this, a poroelastic finite element model was developed to quantify the combined effects of load-induced fluid velocity and pore pressure. Tensile loading generated negative pore pressure, stretching osteocyte processes, while compressive loading produced positive pore pressure, compressing them. Since fluid flow exerts drag forces that also stretch osteocytes, the combined effect of flow and negative pressure on the tensile side was hypothesized to enhance mechanotransduction and trigger osteogenesis. Four potential stimuli were evaluated: dissipation energy density arising from (i) pore pressure, (ii) fluid velocity, (iii) their non-interactive sum, and (iv) their interaction. Comparison with in vivo data showed that only the interactive dissipation energy density accurately predicted both the spatial pattern and rate of new bone formation under high, low, and rest-inserted loading regimes. These results establish that the interaction between fluid velocity and pore pressure, rather than their independent contributions, governs load-induced osteogenesis.

MwC provides a more accurate representation of cortical activity flow than classical edge-based metrics and reveals that metabolically active hubs align with higher-order cognitive networks. Transcriptomic and synaptic imaging data demonstrate that these hubs exhibit increased synaptic energy turnover, linking activity-driven centrality to the molecular architecture of signaling.

Many cytoplasmic RNA viruses also harbor poly(A) tails on their genomic RNA and mRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infection causes cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) activity to become limiting, which preferentially destabilizes short-tailed host mRNAs, occurring before the action of virally encoded mRNA-decay factor nsp1. In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70-80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening. Our findings suggest poly(A)-tail length is an arena of host-virus conflict, in which preserving tail lengths of viral mRNAs promotes their cytoplasmic dominance.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we engineered the clinically relevant W690C mutation into C. elegans lmd-3 gene, the human NCOA7 ortholog, to establish a valuable in vivo POI model. The mutation severely compromises LMD-3 protein stability and expression, leading to a profound collapse in reproductive capacity driven by germline apoptosis. We demonstrate that this defect drives catastrophic autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction, blocking degradation and causing proteotoxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Crucially, we define this pathology as a functional B12 deficiency and show that mecobalamin (meCbl) supplementation successfully restores proteostasis.

It also limits spontaneous- and virus-induced innate immune responses by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine and type-I interferon (IFN-I) production. Some viruses escape SAMHD1 restriction by utilizing SAMHD1-mediated innate immune suppression to establish effective infection through viral antagonism. Our previous studies showed that SAMHD1 is a proviral factor facilitating replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in human macrophages, monocytic THP-1 and epithelial-like HEK293T cell lines by suppressing IFN responses. However, it is unclear about the function of SAMHD1 in lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report that SAMHD1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by enhancing endogenous expression of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1) and HNF1{beta}. Using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and lentiviral vectors, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated viral entry was suppressed in Calu-3 cells with SAMHD1 knockout (KO). SAMHD1 KO repressed ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells at mRNA and protein levels. Functional analyses revealed that HNF1 and HNF1{beta} were crucial for the endogenous ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells. Additionally, SAMHD1 KO led to a reduction in the expression levels and ACE2-promoting function of HNF1 and HNF1{beta}. Inhibition of IFN antiviral response by baricitinib, a Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK 1/2) inhibitor, did not revert the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in SAMHD1 KO Calu-3 cells. Our findings demonstrate that SAMHD1 facilitates HNF1-mediated ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells via a novel mechanism beyond its IFN-suppressive function.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations.

Here, we report the critical role of CNOT3, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, in regulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) function in adult hematopoiesis. We observed that Cnot3 mRNA is highly expressed in HSCs and CNOT3 ablation in the murine Cnot3 conditional knockout mouse model resulted in anemia, reduced bone marrow cellularity and enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen. Deletion of Cnot3 resulted in the early expansion of immunophenotypic HSCs which were then progressively lost over time.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of HSPCs revealed disruptions in lineage development and loss of HSCs.

The use of colorimetric cell viability assays to ascertain the potential cytotoxicity of iron oxide nanoparticles have highlighted conflicting results in various in vitro models, because of spectrophotometric interference. Attempts to resolve this confounding factor to reveal accurate measurements have been insufficient. To address this interference issue, we tested three control methods (readout correction, plate transfer, and above-plate reading) on in vitro cytotoxicity measurements via Neutral Red Uptake (NRU), Resazurin, and MTT assays, of iron oxide and magnetite nanoparticulate exposure on SK-N-SH and IMR-32 human neural cell lines. We observed varying degrees of interference based on cell line, nanoparticle type, exposure time, assay type, and the readout method (colorimetric or fluorometric). The readout correction method did not remove interference completely, the plate transfer method tended to cause overestimation of cell viability beyond the original interference, and fluorescence readings from above the plate were less sensitive than the conventional bottom reading. The Resazurin assay with fluorometric readout presented no interference in most conditions investigated in this work, therefore presents advantages over both colorimetric assays and interference control methods. It is recommended to forego colorimetric assays in future studies of nanoparticle cytotoxicity as they are more susceptible to interference.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

To investigate potential hepatic effects, we examined the metabolic impact of F6H8 exposure in human HepaRG hepatocytes across a broad concentration range representing short- and long-term exposure scenarios. Untargeted metabolic profiling by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOFMS) was performed on intracellular extracts and extracellular media. F6H8 induced pronounced, concentration-dependent metabolic alterations, many of which exhibited non-monotonic responses.

We found that hair cell size began to decrease from 10 months of age, before hearing loss was detectable. This structural change was associated with a significant decrease in the total current response and a distinct reduction in the expression of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel currents (IK,f). However, the magnitude of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) currents at the hair cell stereociliary bundles remained unaffected. This observation challenges the common conception that stereocilia are the most fragile component of sensory cells in aging.

Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression.

We performed electrophysiological recordings of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and microdialysis measurements of 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Experiments were designed to collect the results over a long duration, i.e. 4-5 hours after the injection. Levels of the pro-neuroplastic factors PSD-95 and Synapsin-1 in the DRN were also assessed, as was cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG). 5-HT neuron mean firing rate was unmodified within the 2 h that followed ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), but strongly (90%) increased in the 2-5 h time bin, an effect abolished by lesioning the mPFC or administering the mTOR inhibitor Torin-2. A similar kinetics was found for hippocampal 5-HT release. Synapsin-1 and PSD-95 mRNA transcriptions were enhanced at 2 h, and PSD-95 protein levels appeared to peak at 24 h. Finally, DG mitogenesis was enhanced 48 h post-injection, an augmentation suppressed in 5-HT-depleted animals.

We found that behavior improvements after learning were associated with increased neuronal selectivity in both V1 and PPC. The increased selectivity in PPC was mainly driven by neurons preferring the rewarded go stimulus, while, in V1, neurons increased their selectivity for both the rewarded go and unrewarded no-go stimulus. Furthermore, feature preference was robust in V1 neurons but reorganized in PPC after learning. Finally, feature preference was preserved across contexts in V1 but not in PPC after learning, where many neurons switched their preference to the rewarded feature during active task engagement.

We address the question of bi-directional influences between VWM and the oculomotor system, here with a focus on corrective saccade biases. 20 participants had to memorize a color hue and later discriminate it from another hue from a different (Easy condition) or the same color category (Difficult condition). Between encoding and test, they performed a gaze-contingent saccade task where, mid-saccade, the position of items shifted, introducing an artificial saccade error, and the color of a distractor neighboring the target changed to a color (mis)matching the memorized one. VWM performance was higher in the Easy compared to the Difficult experimental block, reflecting the successful manipulation of task demands. Corrective saccade biases towards the distractor occurred more frequently when it matched memory content compared to when it did not, replicating previous findings. Importantly, they also occurred more in the Difficult experimental block, which required stronger VWM representations than the Easy condition.

We identified 177 phosphopeptides with significantly altered abundance in HD-iNs, mapping to phosphoproteins associated with key signaling pathways known to be affected in HD, such as splicing and autophagy.

Although mutations in ATP1A3 are known to cause severe neurological disorders, the specific kinetic features of a3 that underlie its functional specialization remain incompletely understood. Here we employed biophysically detailed models of stretch receptor neurons, grounded in patch-clamp recordings of the a3-isoform current and spiking responses, to dissect the contribution of isoform-specific pump kinetics to firing behavior. Substitution of a1 for a3 abolished the ability to sustain long spike trains and reduced high-frequency entrainment, whereas a3-preserved prolonged discharges and faithful responses to vibratory stimuli. Remarkably, even halved pump density a3 50% preserved superior excitability compared to mixed expression (a 50%/a1 50%), indicating that kinetic profile rather than pump quantity determines firing capacity. Hybrid models revealed that Na; affinity is the decisive factor: retaining the low Na; affinity of a3 preserved excitability, while introducing a1-like voltage or ATP dependence produced only minor effect on simulated neuron discharge. These findings establish a mechanistic explanation for the selective expression of a3 in muscle spindle afferents and other neurons with high-frequency demands, and help to explain why a1 cannot compensate in ATP1A3-linked diseases. More broadly, they highlight the principle that isoform specialization of the NKA is not redundant but tuned to the discharge requirements of distinct neuronal populations.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Epigenetic dysregulation and abnormal kinase signaling are key factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet no existing treatment targets both. We introduce a dual-targeting strategy that inhibits the histone methyltransferase G9a and the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3B;-two synergistic drivers of neurodegeneration-using a single CNS-penetrant small molecule. This report covers the rational design, synthesis, and preclinical testing of T2 as a new therapeutic candidate. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling and medicinal chemistry refinement led to a focused library of dual inhibitors, with T2 standing out due to its balanced potency against both targets, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, low off-target effects, and a favorable safety profile. In the SAMP8 mouse model of late-onset AD, T2 markedly improved memory, restored social behaviors, and increased synaptic complexity. Molecular studies showed that T2 treatment lowered tau phosphorylation, the AB;42/40 ratio, and neurofilament light chain levels, while boosting neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory pathways. Multi-omics analyses indicated that T2 causes widespread transcriptional and proteomic changes, activating synaptic plasticity genes (like Arc and Nectin3), reducing ferroptosis and senescence-related pathways, and altering chromatin accessibility. Electrophysiological tests confirmed the restoration of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Overall, these results support dual G9a/GSK-3B; inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach for AD, with T2 emerging as a strong candidate for further therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that deletion of Shp1 and Shp2 in the MK/platelet lineage in mice using the Pf4-Cre transgene/loxP system impairs megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. However, we also observed unexpected phenotypes including a motheaten-like phenotype in Shp1-deficient mice and severe myelofibrosis in mice lacking both phosphatases. To determine whether these were lineage-specific effects, we utilized the Gp1ba-Cre transgenic mouse to delete loxP-flanked Shp1 and Shp2 in mice. Bone marrow-derived MKs from these mice expressed approximately 20-25% of Shp1 and Shp2, whereas platelets contain 5-10% of each phosphatase compared with controls. Minor MK/platelet defects were observed in mice lacking either Shp1 or Shp2 alone, however mice lacking both Shp1 and Shp2 exhibited macrothrombocytopenia, mild bleeding following tail injury, and impaired GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation and Syk phosphorylation, associated with reduction GPVI and integrin alpha2 subunit expression. Reduced Shp1 and Shp2 expression resulting in a significant reduction in ploidy, a block in MK maturation and proplatelet-producing MKs. Tpo-mediated Ras/MAPK signaling was reduced in Shp1/2-deficient MKs. Treatment of MKs with structurally distinct Shp2 allosteric inhibitors recapitulated key aspects of the Shp2-deficient phenotype, including aberrant megakaryopoiesis and reduced Mpl signaling.

Current methods for producing protein isolates from leaves include partially or fully denaturing conditions, diminishing protein solubility and functionality. Here, we characterize the performance of a multi-stage, membrane-based green biorefinery concept capable of producing a native protein product from clover grasses devoid of attributes such as green color and grassy smell/taste. By sampling at each step along the process, we obtain insights on the fate of proteins and pigments over each unit operation. The process efficiently removes green pigments (>99.9%), when comparing the product stream with the initial feed stream, based on UV/Vis analysis. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, two complementary quantification strategies, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, this can particularly be ascribed to a very selective retention (>99%) of unwanted membrane-associated and pigment-binding proteins in the first-stage filtration. In the second-stage filtration and subsequent diafiltration stage, residual unwanted proteins, fragments, and pigments are efficiently washed out while retaining the overall protein composition. The product maintains the high RuBisCO content of green juice and is furthermore enriched in proteins with known antioxidant properties while depleted in known food allergens.

To investigate this, we constructed high-temporal-resolution reference wall motion data using electromechanical (EM) simulations on five patient-specific atrial geometries with a history of atrial fibrillation. We then generated temporally downsampled datasets to emulate clinical frame rates (10, 20, and 40 frames per cycle) and performed CFD simulations to isolate the effects of temporal undersampling on hemodynamic metrics. The focus was placed on kinetic energy, KE, and residence time, TR, particularly in the left atrial appendage (LAA), where thrombosis is most likely to occur. We employed an immersed boundary method to prescribe the wall motion and computed blood TR through a passive scalar transport equation. Results indicate that while global LA hemodynamic indices showed relatively modest sensitivity to frame rate (errors <15%), LAA TR was substantially affected, with 10-frame reconstructions overestimating TR by up to 43% compared to reference values.

Increased protein synthesis and sarcomere reorganization are crucial elements of cardiac remodeling under such conditions. The muscle-specific nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha isoform (skNAC) is a protein essential for proper sarcomere organization during development. However, its role in hypertrophy and heart failure in adults remains unexplored. We investigated the function of skNAC in pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and heart failure. METHODS: skNAC expression was assessed in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) stimulated with phenylephrine, in human cardiac biopsies, and in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or angiotensin II infusion. The impact of siRNA-mediated skNAC silencing was evaluated in NRVMs, while constitutive and inducible cardiomyocyte-specific skNAC knockout mouse models were generated to examine the long-term effects of skNAC deletion under both basal and TAC conditions. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and proximity ligation assay were used to assess skNAC localization and interactions, while electron microscopy was employed to analyze the consequences of skNAC deletion on cardiomyocyte ultrastructure. RESULTS: skNAC expression was reduced in phenylephrine-treated NRVMs and in mice subjected to TAC or angiotensin II, due to decreased expression of the RNA-binding proteins Rbm24 and Rbm20, which regulate skNAC pre-mRNA splicing. Consistently, skNAC expression inversely correlated with cardiac hypertrophy and NT-proBNP levels in humans. Cardiomyocyte-specific skNAC deletion generated basal hypertrophy, severe systolic dysfunction, and premature death, which were further exacerbated by TAC surgery, leading to rapid dilated cardiomyopathy and lethality. skNAC strongly colocalized with ribosomes, and its deletion caused sarcomere disorganization and an autophagic response. Conversely, skNAC overexpression prevented phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in NRVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that skNAC is essential for preserving sarcomere integrity and cardiomyocyte homeostasis. Its downregulation drives pathological remodeling and heart failure, positioning skNAC as a promising therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

In humans, loss of this anticodon modification due to mutations in CTU2 (cytosolic thiouridylase 2) causes DREAM-PL syndrome, a severe congenital disorder often leading to early postnatal death. However, the mechanisms by which loss of tRNA thiolation drives pathology remain unclear. Here, we show that loss of CTU2 triggers significant cellular proteostasis defects in patient cells and model cell lines. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that the pathogenic CTU2L63P mutation destabilizes the CTU1/CTU2 complex and abolishes tRNA binding and thiolation. Acute loss of CTU2 caused codon-specific ribosome pausing at A-ending codons decoded by thiolated tRNAs, and decreased ribosome occupancy of A-rich transcripts in a dosage-dependent manner. Codon-biased mRNAs transcribed from genes critical for ciliogenesis are predicted to be most affected, linking their reduced translation to DREAM-PL etiology in humans. Surprisingly, Ctu2L63P mice display severe thiolation defects, but develop normally, are viable and fertile.

Elucidating how the healthy central nervous system (CNS) differentially encodes objective stimulus intensity and subjective experiences of pain perception may offer key insights into the central mechanisms contributing to chronic pain. Functional MRI (fMRI) combined with controlled noxious stimulation provides a powerful means to explore neural representations of nociception and pain perception. Here, we applied noxious heat at three intensities (46 {degrees}C, 47 {degrees}C, 48 {degrees}C, 8 trials each randomized) to the right forearm of 28 healthy women during simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI to investigate how distributed corticospinal activity and connectivity encode stimulus intensity and subjective pain. Activity increased with stimulus temperature across regions involved in pain processing--including somatosensory, motor, prefrontal, insular, and subcortical areas--as well as in the ipsilateral dorsal and ventral spinal cord. Spinal-brain functional connectivity was observed between the right dorsal horn and pain-related brain regions such as primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and was positively associated with individual pain ratings. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that multivoxel activation patterns in the brain and spinal cord, as well as corticospinal connectivity patterns, reliably tracked stimulus temperature, while only subsets of cortical regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices) encoded subjective pain. Notably, spinal cord representations were primarily organized by stimulus temperature rather than perceived pain intensity. These findings demonstrate that simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI combined with multivariate modeling can identify sensory and perceptual components of nociceptive processing across the neuroaxis. Such approaches advance mechanistic understanding of pain and may inform the development of CNS-based biomarkers for chronic pain assessment and intervention.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Osmoregulation is an essential process in all living organisms. For aquatic organisms, such as freshwater fishes whose natural environment is hyperosmotic, specialized cells, called ionocytes, are present in the skin during developmental stages and contribute to the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. Such cells are known to proliferate in response to osmotic stress, but the molecular mechanism by which that process is regulated remains poorly characterized. In this study, using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that cutaneous ionocytes in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) express serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by co-labeling with other known ionocyte markers, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase, Concanavalin A and Mitotracker. Furthermore, by quantifying ionocyte number through early stages of development, we implicate 5-HT2A receptors in initiating ionocyte proliferation. Exposure of zebrafish embryos and larvae to acidic pH, or exogenous 5-HT, increased the number of cutaneous ionocytes. The effects of both stimuli were abolished in the presence of the 5-HT2A receptor-specific antagonist, ketanserin. Moreover, activation of 5-HT2A receptors led to increased detection of ionocytes with phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), a key regulator of cell division and differentiation linked with 5-HT2A. We used tetrabenazine, an inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (vmat2) and 5-HT storage, to deplete potential sources of 5-HT. Tetrabenazine treatment in fish exposed to acidic pH reduced ionocyte proliferation, implicating an endogenous source of 5-HT in regulation of ionocyte populations.

Alanine substitution of arginine and lysine residues in the Nuc domain can abolish trans cleavage while modestly reducing cis cleavage.

The AFWSE model was compared to standard machine learning methods, specifically, logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks, demonstrating consistently better predictive validity and accuracy.

Leveraging the increasing availability of publicly accessible bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, we developed an integrated analytical framework to identify genes selectively enriched in BMECs compared to endothelial cells (ECs) from other tissues. To address the substantial batch effects inherent to multi-source bulk RNA-seq data, we combined two differential expression strate- gies, rank aggregation methods, and extensive quality controls. Our analysis incorporated EC samples from 16 different tissues and employed robust statistical workflows to mitigate technical confounders while preserving biologically mean- ingful signals. Validation using known BBB markers and independent proteomic evidence confirmed the reliability of our approach. We present Brendo (Brain Endothelial Open Resource), an open-access web platform providing searchable, filterable, and downloadable data on differentially expressed genes in BMECs. Brendo enables an in-depth exploration of brain endothelial gene expression and offers broader applications across vascular biology by supporting cross-tissue EC com- parisons. The workflow described is adaptable to other biological contexts, promoting the systematic reuse of public bulk RNA-seq datasets for target discovery.

High rates of treatment resistance and heterogeneous pathophysiology pose significant challenges to traditional single-target drug discovery. To address this, we applied the CANDO platform to identify repurposable drugs for schizophrenia using a multitarget strategy. The platform evaluates how compounds interact with the entire human proteome, generating interaction signatures that capture a compound's effect across all targets. By comparing these signatures, CANDO computes compound similarity scores and enables consensus prediction of novel therapeutics. Benchmarking experiments across all indications and specific to schizophrenia demonstrated that CANDO significantly outperformed controls across multiple evaluation metrics, recovering known drug indication associations with orders of magnitude better accuracy. Using prediction methodology validated through benchmarking, we generated a ranked list of re-purposable compounds. Literature review confirmed clinical or biochemical evidence supporting 25 top ranked drug candidates, including phenothiazine and benzamide antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. We identified protein targets with the highest likelihood of interaction with these top drugs and assessed prediction quality through overlap analysis with gold standards, showing significantly better concordance with established schizophrenia related biology than controls. Among these protein are corroborated targets such as canonical neurotransmitter receptors, dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic, as well as monoamine transporters, tyrosine aminotransferase, and lysine specific histone demethylase 1A. Enrichment of calcium-binding proteins among the phenothiazine antipsychotic triethylperazine's top predicted targets highlights a potential role for dysregulated calcium signaling, including calmodulin-CaMKK2 pathways, in schizophrenia pathology and treatment response. Another phenothiazine antipsychotic, triflupromazine, binds the serotonin transporter in addition to its canonical dopamine D2 receptor interaction, warranting further research into its potential effects on depressive symptoms. These findings demonstrate the utility of the CANDO platform in elucidating multitarget pharmacological mechanisms and accelerating the identification of effective repurposable treatments for schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

However, the rate of complete remissions is relatively low, and resistance remains a significant clinical challenge, underscoring the need for novel combination strategies. To identify compounds that enhance the activity of BTKi and overcome resistance, we conducted a high-throughput screen of 1,695 compounds using a previously developed MZL model of acquired resistance to BTK and PI3K inhibitors derived from the Karpas1718 cell line. Thirty-three compounds showed single-agent anti-proliferative activity in the nanomolar range, both in the Karpas1718-resistant and parental cells. Based on their clinical potential in combination with BTKi, seven compounds were selected for further validation. The polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor rigosertib emerged as a top candidate, showing strong activity in both parental and BTKi-resistant cell lines. Combination treatment of rigosertib and BTKi zanubrutinib resulted in broad transcriptomic changes, characterized by the downregulation of pathways involved in B-cell activation, proliferation, and BCR signaling. Mechanistically, the combination reduced phosphorylation of key BCR pathway components and inhibited NF-{kappa}B nuclear translocation. These findings suggest that PLK1 inhibition can overcome BTKi resistance by further inhibiting BCR signaling through the canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway. Therefore, the dual pharmacological inhibition of BTK and PLK1 is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with MZL and warrants further preclinical and clinical investigations.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Computational AOPs (cAOPs), constructed using existing toxicological data, can accelerate the early stages of AOP development, which is often a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. In this study, an integrative network-based framework was developed to construct cAOPs, with a particular focus on elucidating the toxicity of organic mercury in fish. First, 124 organic mercury compounds, corresponding fish-specific toxicity endpoints, and proteins were curated from CTD and ECOTOX. Next, molecular docking investigations were performed to determine novel molecular interactions with 16 zebrafish protein orthologs. Subsequently, the toxicity endpoints, including the identified molecular interactions, were standardized and harmonized using data from AOP-Wiki, Gene Ontology, and MeSH. These endpoints were integrated with event relationship information from AOP-Wiki and published literature to construct an organic mercury-associated toxicity network comprising 197 nodes and 243 edges. Thereafter, node- and edge-level filtration criteria were designed based on AOP definitions and utilized to identify biologically relevant pathways within the toxicity network. Further, these pathways were ranked based on their novelty with respect to existing AOPs within AOP-Wiki. Finally, based on extensive evidence from published literature, four top-ranked novel pathways that describe binding with glutathione peroxidase or alterations in metallothionein levels leading to neurologic manifestations or dysbiosis in fish were proposed as cAOPs. Overall, this study presents an integrative network-based framework for constructing cAOPs applicable to diverse contaminants and species, supporting New Approach Methodologies for toxicological risk assessment.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Utilizing chromatin accessibility genomics, we found that Drosophila NF-{kappa}B (Relish) can restrain nutrient-dependent metabolic transcriptional programs that control cellular catabolism of energy substrates, divergent from the protein's canonical role as a transcriptional activator. NF-{kappa}B/Relish restricts chromatin accessibility through modulating histone acetylation at metabolic target gene loci, which restrains metabolic gene transcription and blocks excessive activation of nutrient-dependent metabolic programs. Targeted genetic screening revealed that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) interacts with NF-{kappa}B/Relish at NF-{kappa}B DNA regulatory motifs to limit chromatin accessibility and repress metabolic transcriptional programs.

P.", "abstract": "Primates exhibit remarkable flexibility in coordinating gaze angle, spatial attention, and motor goals, such as fixating on one point, attending to another, and planning a reach toward a third. Neuronal reference frames are critical for these behaviors. We investigated relative-location tuning in macaque monkeys, where the reference frame was defined by the relative positions of two objects in a scene rather than their absolute coordinates. Single neurons were recorded from five frontal cortex regions: dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), supplementary motor area (SMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFdl), and frontal eye field (FEF). In each trial, the monkey viewed two food pellets, one in a stationary feeder and another in a feeder attached to a moving robot, which served as an attention attractor. By task rule, the monkey could obtain only one pellet. A significant proportion of neurons in all five regions showed spatial tuning based on the relative positions of the two feeders (~35-65%, depending on the area). For instance, some neurons were more active when one feeder was positioned to the right of the other. In PFdl and FEF, most relative-location neurons primarily encoded the monkey fixation on the relatively left or right feeder. In SMA, PMd, and PMv, some neurons reflected fixation, but more encoded whether the relatively left or right feeder was the attention attractor (independent of gaze) or the reach target. Relative-location tuning was more prevalent when both feeders were task-relevant, such as when the monkey attended to one feeder while planning a reach to the other. Relative-location neurons could contribute to computing object-based reference frames or allocating spatial information-processing resources across attentional, oculomotor, and skeletomotor behaviors. They also suffice to explain gaze-dependent reach-related activity without contradicting theories of visually guided reaching, which predict gaze invariance.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

In male Drosophila, threat displays flexibly combine wing displays with rapid turns and charges. Here we identify two brain modules downstream of a superordinate threat command center. Each contains two neurons that combinatorially generate threat-specific appendicular movements: one comprises two descending neurons synergistically controlling wing threat; the other contains two interneurons that antagonistically control turns and charges. Within-module neuronal coactivation evokes appendage-specific actions recapitulating those evoked by the upstream center. These data uncover a hierarchical combinatorial circuit that coordinates wing and leg movements during a terrestrial social display.

The 2048-bit fingerprints encode substructural information relevant to passive diffusion without requiring explicit physicochemical descriptors. The model, trained on experimentally annotated BBB datasets using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, achieved strong predictive performance (cross-validated ROC-AUC = 0.897 +/- 0.019; validation ROC-AUC = 0.932). External testing on literature-reported CNS-active compounds (Caffeine, Diazepam, Dopamine, and Levodopa) confirmed biological consistency: highly lipophilic drugs were predicted as BBB+, while polar molecules dependent on carrier-mediated transport were predicted as BBB-. The fingerprint-based model thus captures underlying permeability mechanisms through data-driven substructure learning.

Recent human proteome co-regulation mapping has revealed a distinctive co-expression pattern between Pex11{beta} and components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex at the peroxisome-mitochondria interface. In neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mitochondrial dysfunction is primarily associated with impairments in the respiratory chain complexes, particularly Complex II. However, the role of Pex11{beta} in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in these two disease conditions remains largely unexplored. In this study, using both in vitro and in vivo models, we identify Pex11{beta} as a critical modulator of mitochondrial dynamics, influencing the balance between fission and fusion. Through targeted knockdown and overexpression experiments, we demonstrate a direct link between Pex11{beta} level and mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated by transcriptional dysregulation of nuclear-encoded Complex II and mitochondrial fusion genes. Restoration of Pex11{beta} expression, along with Complex II and fusion gene level in striatal brain via a peroxisome proliferator and chemical chaperone, significantly alleviates motor and cognitive deficits in 3-NP-induced HD mouse model indicating better mitochondrial health in striatal brain. Furthermore, in silico analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a critical transcription factor governing the co -expression of Pex11{beta} and Complex II genes.

Previously generated CG2135-/- flies recapitulated several hallmark features of MPS VII, despite retaining approximately 30% residual {beta}-GUS activity contributed by CG15117. To assess the consequences of complete loss of {beta}-GUS, we now generated CG15117-/- flies using CRISPR/Cas9 and subsequently established CG15117-/-;CG2135-/- double knockout (DKO) flies. Phenotypic assessment revealed differences in susceptibility to starvation, lifespan, and locomotor function, with DKO flies exhibiting more severe impairments than either single knockout flies. Notably, CG15117-/- did not show any significant defect in lifespan or locomotion, except under starvation conditions. Consistent with our earlier finding in CG2135-/- fly brains, ATP depletion in DKO fly brains became evident only after 45 days of age, failing to explain the locomotory defects observed in earlier ages. Interestingly, analysis of muscles of 30-day-old CG2135-/- and DKO flies revealed abnormal mitochondrial accumulation with autophagy defect and severe ATP depletion. Consequently, these defects led to locomotor impairment driven by apoptotic muscle degeneration.

Expression of the amt1+ gene increases under nitrogen starvation as well as in the TORC1-deficient mutant tor2-287, suggesting the negative regulation of amt1+ by TORC1. This regulation depends on the GATA transcription factor Gaf1, whose phosphorylation is regulated by Ppe1 and PP2A phosphatases. Ppe1 is required for the nuclear accumulation of Gaf1, partly contributing to the controlled expression of amt1+. On the other hand, PP2A phosphatase is essential for the amt1+ induction upon starvation, indicating distinct roles for Ppe1 and PP2A in Gaf1 regulation. Nitrogen starvation also promotes the plasma membrane translocation of Amt1 and Amt2 in a manner dependent on the Tsc-Rhb1 pathway.

Does retinotopic cortex represent visual information in an allocentric or retinocentric reference frame? Here, we investigate which reference frame the brain uses by dissociating allocentric and retinocentric reference frames via a head tilt manipulation combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen participants completed between 1728-2880 trials during which they briefly viewed (150 ms) and then remembered (1500 ms) a randomly oriented target grating. In interleaved blocks of trials, the participant's head was either kept upright, or tilted by 45 degee using a custom rotating chinrest. The target orientation could be decoded throughout the trial (using both voltage and alpha-band signals) when training and testing within head-upright blocks, and within head-tilted blocks. Importantly, we directly addressed the question of reference frames via cross-generalized decoding: If target orientations are represented in a retinocentric reference frame, a decoder trained on head-upright trials would predict a 45 degree offset in decoded orientation when tested on head-tilted trials (after all, a vertical building becomes diagonal on the retina after head tilt). Conversely, if target representations are allocentric and anchored to the real world, no such offset should be observed. Our analyses reveal that from the earliest stages of perceptual processing all the way throughout the delay, orientations are represented in between an allocentric and retinocentric reference frame.

However, most studies have focused on single substances in isolation, making it difficult to directly compare shared and distinct network computations and limiting their generalizability, given that many individuals engage in polysubstance use. Here, we introduce an explainable, connectivity-based multiclass classification framework that models distributed brain network organization to delineate both shared and substance-specific mechanisms of addiction. This design enables direct comparison among cannabis users, alcohol users, and controls, revealing network computations that uniquely differentiate each group. Using functional connectivity features from cue-induced craving tasks, we classified cannabis users (n=166), alcohol users (n=101), and healthy controls (n=238), achieving high out-of-sample accuracy (87% for cannabis, 69% for alcohol, and 73% for controls). Functional connectivity-based models consistently outperformed activation-based models, highlighting the importance of inter-regional network properties for biomarker development. Network analysis further revealed dorsal prefrontal, cingulate, and precuneus hubs consistent with meta-analytic craving networks and substance-specific connectivity motifs enhanced prefrontal coupling in cannabis users and greater insular-striatal integration in alcohol users. These results demonstrate that distinct network configurations define different substance-use profiles, advancing interpretable biomarkers for addiction neuroscience.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

However, the relationship between STDP and memory is not fully understood. Previously, an important advancement in understanding the relationship between spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and memory was made through cortical simulations. The proposed memory items, polychronous groups (PGs), combined the network anatomy with precise spike-timing relationships between the connected cells of the network. However, there are some challenges with this previous work. It is unclear how different STDP rules would impact the PG results and if the PG results are complementary with purely spike-pattern defined memory items called cell ensembles (CEs). Lastly, it is unclear how these results are affected by changes in network connectivity. We address these challenges by comparing the PGs and CEs detected in spiking neural network simulations of cortical and hippocampal CA1 networks with two different STDP rule implementations. We show that the PG and CE results differ greatly for the two different STDP rules and for the cortical and CA1 networks. Our results show an important disconnect between anatomically defined and spike-pattern defined memories in spiking neural network simulations illustrating that care must be taken when drawing conclusions on the relationship between STDP and memory in simulation studies.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

While this paradigm has been shown to be associated with epigenetic de-aging, the dynamics of this process have remained unclear. Here, we used overexpression of the two reprogramming factors SOX2 and cMYC to generate iNSC from erythroid progenitors of donors ranging from neonatal to 101 years of age. Using an epigenetic clock algorithm, we corroborated our previous finding that iNSCs generated from aged donors show pronounced epigenetic de-aging, preserving around 13 % and 5 % of the original donor age at low and high passages, respectively. Studying the dynamic of epigenetic de-aging during iNSC conversion across time, we found that this process is largely protracted, continuing for several weeks and even beyond forced neuronal differentiation of iNSCs. Transcriptomic differences between young and old donor-derived iNSCs dissipate with extended time in conversion, too. Concordant with this observation, established iNSC lines lack age-associated cellular hallmarks, similar to induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. Interestingly, time course analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data revealed that acquisition of a bona fide NSC signature extends greatly beyond the time point when proliferative PAX6-positive iNSCs emerge. The unexpected slow dynamics of these processes makes iNSC conversion an attractive model for dissecting the mechanisms underlying somatic transdifferentiation and de-aging.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

These channels are modulated by multiple agents and are known binding sites for neuroactive steroids (NAS) including allopregnanolone (AlloP). Using erastin, an agent that promotes VDAC activation by preventing inhibition by tubulin, we assessed the impact of VDAC activation on hippocampal function. Brief erastin administration had no effect on basal transmission but completely inhibited induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of rat hippocampal slices. This LTP inhibition was prevented by VBIT-4, an agent that inhibits VDAC oligomerization. VDAC-mediated LTP inhibition was also prevented by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, downstream effectors of VDACs, but not by inhibition of cGAS-STING, narrowing the neuroinflammatory pathways involved. Similarly, effects of erastin were prevented by AlloP and at lower concentrations by its unnatural enantiomer (ent-AlloP), an agent that unlike AlloP has little effect on GABAA receptors. Erastin also inhibited memory formation in a hippocampal-dependent form of one-trial learning and these effects were prevented by VBIT-4 and ent-AlloP, but not by a non-sedating dose of AlloP. These results have relevance for understanding the role of VDACs as mediators of neuronal stress and for the further development of NAS as neurotherapeutics and modulators of cellular stress.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

This condition profoundly affects the quality of life and reproductive health of nearly 200 million women of reproductive age worldwide and poses significant clinical challenges due to lack of diagnosis tools and effective treatment. Peritoneal macrophages play a central role in promoting the initiation and progression of EMS. Bioinformatics studies have indicated that the STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING) was downregulated in the macrophages in EMS, and this influenced their polarization and functional. However, the specific contribution of STING pathway alterations to EMS pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We integrated scRNA-seq data from EMS patients and healthy controls-including lesions, eutopic endometrium, non-lesional tissue, and peritoneal fluid from EMS patients and healthy controls(n = 19,291 total samples)-to analyze macrophage STING expression and function. Mouse EMS model was generated by injecting uterus fragments into WT or STING-/- mice. Peritoneal fluid was collected and macrophage proportions and subtypes were assessed via flow cytometry. Macrophages were depleted in STING-/- mice prior to EMS induction to evaluate their role in disease progression. In vitro, hemin was used to treat macrophages to investigate how heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) modulates the STING pathway, assessed through immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescence. Results: Bioinformatic analysis revealed that macrophages within the EMS lesions are primarily derived from peritoneal macrophages and exhibit decreased STING expression, which correlated negatively with HO-1. STING-/- mice developed more numerous and larger EMS lesions, accompanied by a decreased proportion of large peritoneal macrophages and an increase in small peritoneal macrophages. A marked elevation in M2-type macrophages within the lesions was detected in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin-induced HO-1 suppressed STING pathway activation in macrophages. Mechanistically, HO-1 inhibited the translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, thereby suppressing STING signaling and facilitating EMS. Conclusion: Macrophages are essential for lesion formation in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin promotes EMS progression via HO-1-mediated suppression of the STING pathway. Our findings identify the heme-HO-1-STING axis as a key immunomodulatory pathway in EMS and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Among the lesser-known yet prevalent pathogens affecting them are Trypanosoma parasites, which remain poorly studied, particularly in terms of taxonomy and molecular diversity. In Colombia, one of the most amphibian-rich countries globally, no prior studies had addressed the molecular identification of Trypanosoma species in anurans. This study aimed to strengthen the taxonomy of these parasites by integrating morphological, morphometric, and molecular analyses. A total of 434 amphibian samples from the GERPH biological collection were examined microscopically, with 92 testing positive for Trypanosoma. Thirteen morphometric and eleven categorical variables were used to characterize the parasites, leading to the identification of twelve distinct morphotypes through qualitative classification and multivariate analysis. Of the positive samples, 48.9% exhibited more than one morphotype, with morphotypes I, II, and III being the most widespread and generalist. To explore molecular diversity, DNA from 76 individuals positive by microscopy was analyzed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene, yielding nine molecular lineages in 38 single-infection cases. Five morphotypes were successfully linked to molecular lineages, enabling barcode associations that facilitated the description of a new species, the expansion of the known range of Trypanosoma tungarae, and the identification of a potential species complex. This study highlights the importance of integrating morphological and molecular tools to elucidate parasite taxonomy and host-parasite relationships, underscoring the need for further research into vector ecology, molecular barcoding, and in vivo isolation methods to understand Trypanosoma diversity in amphibians.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Entry of herpesviruses into cells requires coordinated action of multiple viral glycoproteins, including gH/gL and gB which comprise the core fusion machinery conserved in herpesviruses. The gH/gL heterodimer activates the gB fusion protein, triggering its refolding from a prefusion to a postfusion form to drive membrane merger. The cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of gB is proposed to act as an inhibitory clamp that stabilizes the prefusion state, with interactions between gH and gB CTDs destabilizing this clamp. We previously found that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1) gB homologs are functionally interchangeable but mediate reduced fusion when coexpressed with heterotypic gH/gL. To map the regions of gB responsible for species-specific interactions, we generated HSV-1/SaHV-1 gB chimeras by swapping ectodomain, membrane-proximal region (MPR), transmembrane domain (TMD), and CTD segments. Our results show that homotypic CTD interactions alone are insufficient to trigger fusion, suggesting that gH/gL contacts the ectodomain of gB. We show that the HSV-1 gB CTD is hyperfusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 CTD, whereas the HSV-1 MPR is hypofusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 MPR. Together, these findings suggest that functional interaction between gH/gL-gB occur on both sides of the membrane and that gB maintains a balance between promotion and restraint of fusion through coordinated contributions of its domains.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Stable hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers offers a scalable, non-invasive method to assign breeding origin, but current applications are limited by the absence of shorebird-specific calibration equations, which associate feather isotope values with environmental isotope gradients (isoscapes), and by longitudinal isoscape bands in the Arctic that result in diffuse origin estimates across broad, heterogeneous regions. We evaluated the utility of alternate calibration equations and the incorporation of occupancy-based informative priors for improving breeding origin assignments. Specifically, we analyzed feather isotope data from hatch-year semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) captured at staging sites in the Canadian Maritimes, as well as known-origin Arctic samples, to compare calibration equations from different reference datasets and test priors derived from eBird habitat occupancy predictions. We demonstrate that Arctic samples of known origin largely align with calibration equations based on broad passerine datasets, although incorporating Arctic samples into the calibration may correct for a marginal westward bias in origin estimates. Using occupancy-based priors that reflect habitat preferences increased precision by 18.8%, identifying hotspots within otherwise expansive isotopic bands. We highlight the validity of existing reference datasets with broad geographic coverage and demonstrate the value of informative priors to refine origin estimates.

We evaluate two established multicellular models, the coupled Cha-Noma model of the mouse {beta}-cell network, and the Riz human model. Prior work with these two models suggest that the Cha-Noma model involves minimal intrinsic heterogeneity and therefore bursts with highly synchronized activity, whereas heterogeneity in the Riz model prescribed from in vitro patch-clamp results in highly unsynchronized behavior of the coupled network. We hypothesize that adjusting the number of bursting cells in both model formulations may invoke more physiologically realistic network coordination. We applied a categorical sensitivity analysis to establish which parameters are most important for determining bursting in single cells of the Riz model. We also introduced new heterogeneity (based on single-cell gene expression) in parameters that had previously been treated as invariant among {beta}-cells. We hypothesized that introducing heterogeneity in the small conductance Ca2+ K+ channel in particular could promote a higher proportion of bursting cells. Lastly, both models fail to incorporate the influences of non-{beta}-cells.

K.; Regan, S.", "abstract": "Background: Deciduous woody perennials, such as hazelnut, undergo winter dormancy to protect sensitive tissues, such as flowers, from harsh conditions. The reproductive success of the tree is dependent on the release of dormancy under favorable conditions. To bloom, the tree must first experience a certain amount of chilling, followed by a certain amount of warmth. With global warming, many trees risk not being able to accumulate enough chilling to release dormancy. Also, when trees accustomed to warm climates are brought into cold climates, they might bloom prematurely at the first sign of spring, and risk freezing damage. The latter is the case for hazelnut, recently adopted as a crop in Ontario, Canada. The present study investigates the hormonal regulation of dormancy in hazelnut male flowers (catkins) by generating hormone profiles in early and late-blooming accessions throughout the dormant season. Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin, cytokinin (CTK), their metabolites, as well as the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), were measured. Results: ABA decreased with dormancy progression, while GA increased. This correlation implies ABA is primarily responsible for dormancy maintenance in catkins and GA works antagonistically to ABA. Indeed, the ABA/GA ratio steadily decreased throughout dormancy. For the first time, CTKs have been reported to steadily increase during dormancy. Auxin and ethylene appear to primarily play a role in the onset of dormancy. Interestingly, early blooming accessions failed to accumulate the auxin conjugate, IAA-Asp and had higher ACC levels throughout most of dormancy. Conclusions: Cumulatively, the present study has generated the most comprehensive hormone profile in dormant flowers of deciduous woody perennials and has identified potential strategies for the delay of bloom in hazelnut catkins through the manipulation of hormones.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Using quantitative live imaging, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, and genetic analysis, we identified mechanisms distinguishing thermotolerant from thermosensitive tomato cultivars. HT accelerates pollen activation by increasing cell rupture in thermosensitive Heinz, whereas thermotolerant Tamaulipas and Nagcarlang maintain pollen tube integrity and elongation. Germination triggers broad transcriptional reprogramming, but corresponding proteomic changes are modest. We identify four pollen-expressed RALF peptides and show that RALF1, RALF3, and RALF4 repress germination at control temperature but signaling is antagonized by HT. Loss of SlRALF1 enhances pollen tube integrity at HT in Heinz but delays successful germination in Tamaulipas, revealing cultivar-specific tuning of individual RALF function.

Cholinergic interneurons (CIN) of the striatum, known to express multiple peptide receptors also co-expressed the corresponding and functionally opposing receptors angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) for Ang II and mas receptor (MasR) for Ang 1-7 . Accordingly, the conditional, semi acute ablation and/or local pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 increased the frequency of acetylcholine (ACh) bursts, reduced the amplitude of dopamine (DA)-modulated pausing of CIN activity, and disrupted the temporal coordination of extracellular levels of ACh and DA during burst events. Further, ablation of ACE2 in the DLS biased directional movement and impaired motor skill learning.

However, an alternative perspective, drawing from ecological psychology and embodied cognition, suggests that perception, decision, and action are interconnected in a cycle. Perception is an active process where information is gathered from the environment through actions that sample task stimuli. The sampling behavior of an animal reflects its internal state and serves as inputs that influence the decision-making process. To examine this framework, we trained rats on a visual stimulus detection task with three luminance levels. Our findings indicated that the time rats spent actively sampling the stimuli correlated with their success in detection, regardless of the cue's luminance. Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) showed that cue luminance primarily affected the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), while active sampling specifically influenced the decision threshold. These results suggest that perceptual decisions are reliant on active cue sampling, supporting the notion that actions and decisions are co-regulated. We also identified significant sex differences: female rats spent more time sampling the cues than male rats. Additionally, males took longer to act after making errors, possibly due to less efficient sampling behavior. These performance differences were linked to negative influences of sampling time on drift rates in females, but not in males. This divergence in the relationship between active sampling and DDM parameters is further support for a sex difference in choice impulsivity.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

We found that these ANN instances vary significantly from one another. Critically, ANN instances showed consistent variation in their alignment with specific human subjects. This consistency in alignment between ANN instances and humans extended across behavioral metrics, indicating that an ANN instance mimicking an individual on one metric also does so on others.

To directly assess this, we used a genetic approach to generate pigmented mice deficient for both Abca4 and Cfd, an essential serine protease for alternative pathway initiation and amplification. Complement protein analysis revealed increased total C3 immunolabeling in the RPE and choroid of Cfd-/- mice, while C3d deposition at the RPE basal labyrinth and apical microvilli was markedly reduced, consistent with impaired alternative pathway activity. Western blotting confirmed altered C3 fragment profiles in Cfd-/- backgrounds, supporting a constitutive role for the alternative pathway in RPE complement activation. However, loss of Cfd did not prevent lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE of Abca4-/- mice. Under light-induced stress, we unexpectedly observed a modest attenuation of outer nuclear layer thinning in Abca4-/- that was unchanged by Cfd loss, which independently also showed a comparable rescuing effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that while the alternative pathway is a major driver of complement activation in the RPE and contributes only modestly to photoreceptor degeneration under light stress, its inhibition is insufficient to alter lipofuscin accumulation in pigmented Abca4-/- mice.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Monozygotic (MZ) twin pedigrees provide a powerful model to investigate de novo mutations (DNMs), however, comprehensive, haplotype-resolved analyses of structural variation (SV), allele-specific inheritance in complex regions, and DNA methylation in diploid human genomes remain limited. Here, we generated complete, haplotype-resolved T2T assemblies for two female twins (C33 and C35) from a Han Chinese pedigree by integrating complementary, state-of-the-art sequencing technologies. The resulting T2T-C33 and T2T-C35 assemblies are highly contiguous and complete, with Genome Continuity Inspector (GCI) scores of 74.94 (maternal) and 77.94 (paternal), and consensus quality values (QV) >75 (k = 21). We comprehensively cataloged 62 inter-twin single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 15 small indels, and identified both shared and private DNMs, revealing nascent genomic divergence between the MZ twins. Focused interrogation of complex regions uncovered pronounced haplotype-specific length polymorphisms and structural heterogeneity within centromeric higher-order repeat (HOR) arrays. Notably, we observed extensive HOR copy-number variation between haplotypes, including a large copy-number difference on maternal chromosome 18, underscoring dynamic HOR array evolution even among genetically identical individuals. Concurrently, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling delineated allele-specific epigenetic variation that may contribute to phenotypic discordance. Together, these high-quality, diploid T2T genomes from a Han Chinese pedigree provide a valuable resource for population-aware genomics and reveal fine-scale, haplotype-specific divergence in MZ twins.

Here, we investigated how social relationships shape foraging decisions and outcomes in wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) using automated RFID feeding stations where two birds could perch, but only one could feed with the other queueing behind (\"dyadic events\"). Bonded social partners (pair-bonded mates and direct kin) engaged in these dyadic events more frequently and coordinated their visits, as shown by shorter dyadic arrival latencies. Bonded partners also showed higher social tolerance, with feeding individuals benefitting from increased food intake when their partner was present, while queuing individuals accepted short-term opportunity costs to remain with them. For juveniles, queuing with parents promoted social learning about feeder use. These findings show that social relationships influence decision-making and foraging performance in the wild, revealing both benefits and costs of maintaining close bonds. Short-term effects on foraging success may therefore contribute to long-term fitness advantages of strong social relationships.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that two alleles, Pm3d and Pm3e, provide resistance against the majority of isolates worldwide, by each recognizing two AVR effectors from powdery mildew, thereby lowering the risk of resistance breakdown. While Pm3d recognizes two closely related RNase-like AVR effectors, Pm3e detects two structurally diverse AVRs, including an effector belonging to a large, uncharacterized protein family with a novel structural fold. Using chimeric Pm3 NLRs, we identify specificity-defining polymorphisms of Pm3d and Pm3e against their diverse effector targets.

This is because cell size sets the scale for all subcellular components and drives changes in the composition of the proteome. Given that large and small cells differ in their biochemical composition, we hypothesize that they should also differ in how they respond to signals and make decisions. Here, we investigated how cell size affects the susceptibility to cell death. We found that large cells are more resistant to ferroptosis induced by system xc- inhibition. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. This process is opposed by cysteine-dependent lipid peroxide detoxification mechanisms. We found that larger cells exhibit higher concentrations of the cysteine-containing metabolite glutathione and lower concentrations of membrane lipid peroxides, compared to smaller cells. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the fact that larger cells had lower concentrations of an enzyme that enriches cellular membranes with peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids, ACSL4, and increased concentrations of the iron-chelating protein ferritin and the glutathione-producing enzymes glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase. Taken together, our results highlight the significant impact of cell size on cellular function and survival, revealing a size-dependent vulnerability to ferroptosis that could influence therapeutic strategies based on this cell death pathway.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Information theory showed that short-pulse response is highly specific to the stimulating ligand, comparable to that under long-term stimulation. Macrophages were mainly sensitive to the duration of cytokines, and the dose of pathogen ligands. Stimulus duration altered the ranking of response strengths among different pathogenic ligands.

Whether RAD52 anneals two complementary ssDNAs on the same ring in cis, or between two ring- ssDNA complexes in trans, is unknown. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of Mgm101, a RAD52 homolog from yeast mitochondria, in complexes with ssDNA, a duplex intermediate of annealing, and B-form dsDNA product. In all states, Mgm101 forms a closed nonadecameric ring that binds the backbone of the first ssDNA at the base of the narrow groove. The second complementary strand binds directly on top of the first to form an extended, unwound, and circular duplex intermediate of annealing. A third complex captures apparent B-form DNA product bound to a novel beta-hairpin motif located on top of the Mgm101 ring, above the primary DNA-binding groove. Mass photometry and native mass spectrometry confirm and further elucidate the complexes formed in solution. Altogether, our data reveal the full SSA pathway of Mgm101 and suggest it anneals two complementary ssDNAs on the same ring in cis.

This can occur via multiple mechanisms, including upregulation of placental growth factor 2 (PlGF-2), an alternative ligand for VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and neuropilin receptor 1 (NRP1). Activity of both growth factors is mediated by interactions with multiple receptors and extra-cellular matrix components, which complicates efforts to understand their contributions to cancer progression. To complement existing antibodies, we discovered those blocking interactions between PlGF-2 or VEGFA and their shared NRP1 receptor in the presence of heparin. Limiting angiogenesis to promote vascular normalization is one mechanism of anti-VEGF protection; here, anti-VEGFA antibodies blocking interactions with VEGFR1 and NRP1 reduced HUVEC tube formation in a physiological angiogenesis model. By contrast, antibodies binding PlGF-2 or VEGFA to block NRP1 significantly reduced proliferation of Caki-I kidney carcinoma cells in vitro, indicating this receptor mediates additional effects. Interestingly, one antibody exhibited dual-reactive binding to VEGFA and PlGF-2, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent PlGF-driven VEGF-resistance.

Here, we refine our understanding of the iad pathway using bacterial genetics, metabolomics, and isotope tracing to assign roles to individual Iad pathway enzymes and show that IadDE, though resembling a Rieske dioxygenase, functions instead as a monooxygenase that initiates catabolism via a novel intermediate.

The optimized derivative GM47-1 targets MmpL3, disrupting cell wall integrity, inducing ATP leakage into the extracellular milieu, and uncoupling respiration, predominantly through the cytochrome bcc:aa3 branch. Further chemical optimization resulted in a new derivative exhibiting a nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration, with potent activity against intracellular Mabs and in a zebrafish model of infection. This study offers a promising scaffold for future therapeutic development and highlights the utility of this approach as a rapid assay platform for identifying bactericidal compounds against Mabs.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Microbial keratitis, infection of the cornea, cause by ExotoxinU (ExoU) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a poor clinical outcome and response to antimicrobials. ExoU, a phospholipase, is secreted directly into host cells, causing their lysis. A screen of 3,034 FDA-approved compounds identified zinc pyrithione (Zp), bismuth subcitrate (Bis), and polymyxin B (Pol) as lead inhibitors of ExoU selectively inhibiting it without affecting human PLA2s or bacterial viability. The compounds have distinct inhibitory mechanisms: Zp disrupted ExoU oligomerization and protein stability; Bis impaired phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent membrane association; Pol directly inhibited catalysis via its lipid-peptide architecture. Compound combinations enhanced ExoU inhibition in vitro to nanomolar concentrations. In mammalian cells, Bis and Pol promoted lysosomal trafficking and degradation of ExoU. Using a high-throughput microscopy platform, we screened 53 P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates, confirming broad efficacy of these inhibitors in exoU strains. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in ex vivo porcine corneas, Galleria mellonella, and in vivo mouse keratitis models. Topical delivery of ExoU inhibitors, particularly in combination, significantly reduced corneal opacity, ulceration, and stromal damage in porcine corneas without affecting bacterial load. In Galleria, compound combinations significantly maintained larval health, improved larval survival and delayed mortality. In a mouse eye infection model, combinatorial treatment reduced disease severity and preserved tissue viability without altering bacterial burden. These findings validate ExoU as a druggable virulence factor and support the repurposing of these compounds as an anti-virulence strategy for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections in humans and veterinary medicine.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

We reveal that, unlike traditional donor-to-recipient delivery, Nanotube-dependent Plasmid exchange (NPex) operates bidirectionally, enabling both plasmid donation and, to a lesser extent, plasmid acquisition. By identifying a Bacillus subtilis natural isolate deficient in NPex, we discovered a prophage-encoded factor, YokF, that blocks plasmid transmission, chiefly acting within the donor cell to inhibit plasmid donation. YokF is a nuclease that localizes to the membrane, where it interacts with a nanotube component to selectively impede plasmid transfer through degradation. Importantly, YokF homologs from various bacterial species were found to exhibit anti-NPex activity. Given their prevalence in Gram-positive bacteria, we propose that YokF homologs represent a conserved family of NPex gatekeepers that restrict plasmid flow within bacterial communities.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we used zebrafish, a vertebrate species with exceptional regenerative capacity, to identify chemically induced mutations that alter regeneration-associated gene activation. Transgenic zebrafish with a permissive promoter and EGFP cassette inserted in the vicinity of the pro-regenerative factor gene fgf20a were mutagenized, and larvae homozygous for ENU-induced mutations were assessed for disruptions in fgf20a-directed reporter gene expression following fin fold amputation. One line was identified with heritable, elevated fgf20a:EGFP presence in the absence of experimental injury, localized to regions of fin fold tissue undergoing degeneration. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) identified a mutation within exon 72 of the fraser syndrome 1 (fras1) gene, mutated in patients with inherited skin disease. fras1 mutant larvae spontaneously displayed elevated expression of other known injury/regeneration-responsive reporter lines in fin fold, and zebrafish crispants for homologs of other genes mutated in human developmental diseases also displayed regeneration-associated gene expression in regions of dysmorphology. Tempering Fgf signaling by transgenic expression of a dominant-negative Fgf receptor in fras1 mutants exacerbated the disease phenotype.

Climate change can also reduce the nutritional value of food resources, causing malnutrition, which can lead to impaired immunity and disease vulnerability. However, despite these associations, no experiments have tested how dietary manipulations and temperature variations interact to drive the effects of pathogenic infections. In this work, we conducted laboratory experiments with the model insect Drosophila melanogaster to test these effects. Results: Virgin flies raised on low-carbohydrate diets exhibited improved post-infection survival rates and more resilience to pathogen burden compared to those reared on standard or high-carbohydrate diets. However, such a survival advantage of the low-carbohydrate diet was lost in mated individuals. Notably, temperature stress decreased survival rates in flies only when they were reared on a standard diet. This effect was not observed in flies raised on high- or low-carbohydrate diets, indicating that the impact of temperature on infection responses might depend on diet. Besides, flies developing on a low-carbohydrate diet showed greater fertility at ambient temperatures than those on other diets, indicating an apparent lack of fitness costs associated with improved post-infection response. Also, high-carbohydrate diets conferred greater resistance to starvation, suggesting differences in resource allocation among somatic maintenance tasks that could increase vulnerability to pathogens. Conclusion: Overall, these findings imply a complex interaction between diet, temperature, and fitness traits that influences variation in infection responses. As many organisms around the world face environmental warming and poor diets, examining these patterns and processes can provide a deeper understanding of variations in health and disease responses amid a changing climate.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we directly sequenced individual gametes from sperm samples of 14 donors (aged 28-62) using highly accurate PacBio long-read sequencing to identify de novo retrotransposition events without familial inference. We developed a \"self-alignment\" strategy using personal genome assemblies that enables high-precision, single-read detection of de novo MEIs. Using this method, we identified 51 de novo Alu insertions, revealing 7-fold variation in Alu retrotransposition rates between individuals (0.023 to 0.17 insertions/gamete). We found a significant increase in Alu activity with paternal age, yielding an additional 0.003 insertions/gamete/year, of additional paternal age, representing a direct observation of age-associated increases in structural variant (SV) mutation rates. These active Alu elements are predominantly comprised of the evolutionarily young AluYa5 and AluYb8 subfamilies and bear characteristic molecular signatures of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Our population-averaged rate of 7.4 insertions per 100 gametes aligns well with previous population genetic estimates, validating both direct observation and population approaches for estimating de novo MEI rates.

Both in a diurnal and a cross-sectional cohort, we observed that cfDNA levels and cellular contributions show lower variability within than between individuals. Hematopoietic lineages are the dominant cfDNA sources, with interindividual variability particularly evident in granulocyte contributions. Demographic factors such as sex, age and body mass index (BMI) contribute to changes in the contribution of various blood cell types, and cfDNA concentrations are 1.6-fold higher in early morning collections (P = 1.8 x 10-5). By integrating cell-type-specific cfDNA methylation, fragment size and dinucleotide end motif information, we demonstrate distinct associations of these characteristics with specific cell types. Granulocyte-derived fragments showed a consistent enrichment in mononucleosomal sizes (P = 3.5 x 10-54) and CC end motifs, while also cfDNA from non-hematopoietic cells exhibited distinct size and end-motif profiles. In addition, we observed hypomethylated DNA to be associated with shorter fragment sizes and altered end-motif frequencies, emphasizing interactions between DNA methylation, nuclease activity and chromatin context in shaping cfDNA features. Together, our results provide a view on processes and cell types involved in cfDNA biogenesis in healthy individuals.

Despite ongoing investigations into the interplay between these contrasting protein groups, existing reports suggest that the presence of \"functional\" fibrillar proteins can accelerate amyloid growth via a crowding effect. In this study, we report a counterintuitive outcome, demonstrating that silk fibroin inhibits amyloidogenic aggregation of -synuclein protein. Our findings reveal that although the fibrillar aggregation of both proteins - individually and in mixtures - remains affected by environmental factors such as concentration and temperature, silk fibroin significantly alters the rheological behavior of the mixed solutions. Our structural and kinetic analyses reveal that silk modifies the structural transitions and self-assembly dynamics of -synuclein through macromolecular crowding and non-specific interactions that eventually suppressed the amyloidogenic aggregation of the -synuclein. Notably, when nanofibrillar amyloidogenic assemblies are forced to form in the presence of silk, they exhibit a markedly increased susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, a phenomenon not observed with pure -synuclein fibrillar constructs.

Here, we describe a scalable approach to generate human liver spheroids with self-organized, lumen-containing vascular networks and demonstrate their use as building blocks for fabricating vascularized tissue layers. Spheroids were formed from HepaRG liver cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The inclusion of MSCs prevented spatial segregation of hepatic and endothelial compartments and enabled endothelial network formation. We present two media that are suitable for culturing these spheroids: a serum-reduced medium and a defined serum-free medium containing GibcoTM KnockOut serum replacement. These media supported the long-term maintenance of hepatocytes in a metabolically active, relatively mature state, as well as the persistence of endothelial networks. Endothelial cell identity and organization were confirmed by VE-cadherin and ICAM-2 immunostaining and by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed adherens junctions and luminal morphologies consistent with a capillary-like organization. Spheroid-derived HUVECs established anastomoses with external endothelial channels in microfluidic devices. Moreover, endothelial sprouts emerging from the spheroids formed inter-spheroid connections within permissive hydrogels (fibrin or collagen-methylcellulose), a process that depended on the inter-spheroid distance. Finally, we demonstrate the fabrication of planar tissue layers with vascularly interconnected spheroids.

Methods: We analyzed 314 multicolor fundus images from 169 patients. Images were preprocessed using an enhanced Retinex algorithm and segmented into three concentric macular zones: Zone 1 (fovea, central 1.5 mm diameter), Zone 2 (parafovea, 1.5-2.5 mm ring), and Zone 3 (perifovea, >2.5 mm radius). A multi-output convolutional neural network (AttCatVgg-Net), based on VGG-16 and enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), was trained to simultaneously perform three-class cataract classification (normal to mild, moderate, severe) and visual acuity (VA) regression. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and regression metrics. Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman correlation test. Results: For cataract grading, the integrated model using all wavelengths and zones achieved 92.5% accuracy, 94.7% area under the ROC curve (AUC), and a 92.1% F1-score. The green channel alone achieved 90.1% accuracy and 0.93 AUC, while the red channel yielded lower performance (76.3% accuracy, 0.83 AUC). Among anatomical zones, Zone 1 (fovea) and Zone 3 achieved 84.3% and 84.71% accuracy and 0.88 and 0.89 AUC, respectively, whereas Zone 2 underperformed (60.41% accuracy, 0.71 AUC). For visual acuity prediction, the full model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1181 and a coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.7759. The green channel demonstrated the strongest correlation with actual VA (correlation coefficient = 0.823, p < 0.001), followed by green-red (0.817) and blue (0.809). The green channel also achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.0369) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.1920), outperforming other channels.

In our proposed model we used TAC 2017 Dataset, which has Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) data for the classification ofdrug-drug interaction. TAC 2017 Dataset has various types of information which are related to drugs and their interactions. Our method uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform the textual descriptions ofside effects for DDI into numerical feature vectors, followed by a Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, BioBERT, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms to predict the potential interactions between drug pairs. One of the key strength of the Random Forest approach is its ability to provide feature importance scores, which allows us to interpret which side effects are most influential in predicting drug interactions. The key advantage of Gradient Boosting is its high predictive performance combined with interpretability. It is able to handle complex, structured data efficiently. Additionally, the model's decisions are more transparent, which is necessary in the biomedical domain. The advantageof SVM is its ability to handle high-dimensional data, capture complex non-linear interactions using kernel functions, and generalize with datasets, making it robust to over-fitting. BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) is advantageous for DDI prediction due to its biomedical domain knowledge, contextual understanding of complex drug-related texts.These method captures the relevance and importance of each side effect of multi drugs and also generate pairs of drugs from the dataset.

E.", "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and millions globally. Although curative therapies, such as stem cell transplant and gene therapy, are available, their application is limited by high cost and donor availability. Consequently, drug therapy remains the most feasible treatment option for the majority of patients with SCD. To date, only four drugs have been approved by the FDA, but none of these treatments comprehensively address all SCD-related symptoms or crises, suggesting the pressing need for developing new drugs. Several high-throughput screening campaigns have been performed for SCD drug discovery based on the in vitro sickling of red blood cells (RBCs) and they have identified several hits. However, it is challenging to replicate the organ-specific oxygen level and physiological deoxygenation time in these in vitro RBC sickling assays. Furthermore, these assays do not consider the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the identified drugs, which are essential to determine whether the drugs can provide robust and sustained efficacy in treated patients with SCD. To address these technical gaps, we have developed a computational platform to perform post-screening analysis of potential anti-sickling agents. This platform sequentially combines PK/PD models with a kinetic model of RBC sickling, enabling efficient prediction of the dosage-dependent therapeutic efficacy of various anti-sickling agents based on patient-specific hematological factors and organ-specific oxygen levels. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated platform by showcasing the therapeutic efficacy of two FDA-approved drugs, Hydroxyurea (HU) and voxelotor. Next, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of two potential anti-sickling agents under clinical trial, namely Bitopertin and osivelotor. Our findings suggest that Bitopertin exhibits anti-sickling effects that are considerably less pronounced than those of HU and voxelotor. On the other hand, osivelotor can achieve similar anti-sickling effects as voxelotor with significantly lower doses due to its improved PK properties. Furthermore, we show the versatility of the proposed platform in predicting the anti-sickling effect of multi-agent therapies and evaluate the consequences of drug noncompliance. In particular, our analysis indicates that noncompliance with voxelotor may result in rapid increases in RBC sickling, whereas osivelotor is likely to mitigate noncompliance-induced adverse effects due to improved PK properties. We further quantify the relationship between drug dosage and the duration of noncompliance that leads to loss of therapeutic efficacy for voxelotor and osivelotor, providing guidance for optimizing dosage strategies to reduce the risk associated with noncompliance. In summary, our in silico platform serves as a valuable tool for post-screening analysis of potential anti-sickling agents by considering their PK and anti-sickling efficacy under patient-specific hemoglobin level and organ-specific oxygen level, thereby gaining insights into their potential therapeutic efficacy alone or in combination before clinical trials.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

Using a family of red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) as a case study, we reveal that flexibility in specific regions of their structures correlates with function. Specifically, as quantum yield increases, the side of the {beta}-barrel closest to the chromophore phenolate moiety becomes more rigid, while the opposite side, closest to the acylimine group, gains flexibility. Notably, the phenolate face corresponds to a mutational hotspot frequently targeted in directed evolution campaigns aimed at enhancing brightness, underscoring its functional significance.

In this work, we present allosteric ligand/aptamer complexes, coupled to biocatalytic reaction modules composed of enzymes, DNAzymes, or transcription machineries, regulating the catalytic and transient functions of these frameworks. This principle is exemplified by the assembly of ligand/aptamer subunits supramolecular complexes that allosterically stabilize the Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme, allowing its ribonucleobase cleavage activity, promoting the formation of transcription templates that yield RNA products, and modulating the assembly of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit thrombin-induced coagulation. Specifically, melamine (Mel)/aptamer subunits complexes allosterically stabilize the assembly of Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme strands for substrate cleavage, the formation of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and the stabilization of a transcription template encoding the Malachite Green (MG) RNA aptamer. Furthermore, coupling an enzyme that depletes the ligand/aptamer complex, which allosterically stabilizes the biocatalytic reaction module, demonstrates the dissipative and transient operation of the catalytic system. This concept is illustrated by the adenosine (Ade)/aptamer subunits supramolecular complex, which stabilizes thrombin aptamer subunits to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogenesis, and promotes the formation of an active transcription template for RNA synthesis. In the presence of adenosine deaminase (ADA), Ade is transformed into inosine, which lacks affinity for the aptamer subunits, thereby degrading the Ade/aptamer assemblies and depleting the allosteric complexes. The temporal disassembly of these allosteric stabilizing complexes leads to the transient inhibition of thrombin-induced coagulation or to the transient operation of a transcription machinery.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Herbarium collections are a vast but underutilized resource for ancient DNA research, containing over 400 million specimens with detailed metadata and spanning centuries of global biodiversity. Understanding patterns of DNA preservation in natural collections is crucial for optimizing ancient DNA studies and informing future curation practices. We analysed genomic data for 573 herbarium specimens from six plant species from the genera Hordeum and Oryza collected from the Americas and Eurasia over 220 years using standardized laboratory protocols and shotgun sequencing to quantify DNA degradation and elucidate factors that accelerate it. We find significant age-dependent DNA fragmentation rates, indicating temporal degradation processes not detected in prehistoric samples. In our analysis, DNA decay rates in herbarium specimens were almost eight times faster than in moa bones, reflecting fundamental differences in tissue composition and preservation environments. Environmental conditions at the time of specimen collection emerged as the major determinants of post-mortem mutation rates, with temperature being the dominant driver of cytosine deamination. We find no effect of sample storage on DNA degradation. These findings provide insights into how climatic origin, preservation environment, taxonomic identity and age influence DNA preservation while highlighting opportunities for improving institutional preservation practices. Due to standardized preservation conditions, museum collections can provide better insights into DNA degradation over time than archaeological and paleontological samples.", "date": "2025-10-26", "journal": ""}
