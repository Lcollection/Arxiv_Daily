Here, we describe the formalization of existing and new metrics of unit quality and comparison, then build upon these to automate the creation of a consensus output from multiple analyses. We validated our package against synthetic and real ground truths. Compared to individual analyses, our package increased the yield and quality of correct units (doubling the yield of Purkinje cells in our recordings) and, crucially, eliminated numerous incorrect units that were impossible to identify in a single analysis.

M. P.; Manoharan, L.; Hilts, A. S.; Bagnoud, A.; Alves, R. J. E.; Jones, C. M.; Kerou, M.; Sousa, F.

Characterizing the microbial functional guilds driving these processes is crucial for understanding ecosystem functioning and predicting their responses to environmental changes. Standard sequence-based characterization methods often reveal only a limited fraction of their diversity in nature because of their low relative abundance, the insufficient sequencing depth of traditional metagenomes of complex communities, and limitations in coverage of PCR-based assays. Here, we developed and tested a targeted metagenomics approach based on probe capture and hybridization to simultaneously characterize the diversity of multiple key metabolic genes involved in inorganic N and CH4 cycling. We designed comprehensive probe libraries for each of the 14 target marker genes comprising 264,000 unique probes. These probes were used to selectively enrich the target genes in shotgun metagenomic libraries. In validation experiments with the mock communities of known microorganisms, targeted metagenomics yielded gene profiles similar to those of the original communities. Only GC content had a small effect on probe efficiency, as low GC targets were less efficiently detected than those with high GC, within the mock communities. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the marker genes obtained using targeted or traditional shotgun metagenomics from agricultural and wetland soils were significantly correlated, indicating that the targeted approach did not introduce significant quantitative bias. In addition, using archaeal amoA genes as a case-study, targeted metagenomics identified substantially higher taxonomic diversity and a larger number of sequence reads per sample, yielding diversity estimates 28 or 1.24 times higher than shotgun metagenomics or amplicon sequencing, respectively. Notably, shotgun metagenomics detected only three out of the 84 amoA gene phylotypes detected using targeted metagenomics. Our results show that targeted metagenomics complements current approaches to characterize key microbial populations and functional guilds in biogeochemical cycles in different ecosystems, enabling more detailed, simultaneous characterization of multiple functional genes.\n\nManuscript contribution to the fieldMetagenomic sequencing often yields limited numbers of sequences of rare microbial taxa or functional genes, preventing in-depth analyses of specific populations and functional groups. Amplicon-based approaches enable the higher diversity coverage of target populations, but the drawback is the difficulty in designing unbiased primers that cover the highest intra-group diversity. Targeted metagenomics overcomes these challenges and results in similar community structure as traditional amplicon sequencing, while expanding the sequence space in a less biased metagenomic-based approach. Therefore, targeted metagenomics is an invaluable tool for studying the diversity of specific populations within complex natural microbiomes. Here, we present and evaluate a probe library designed for targeted metagenomics of nitrogen and methane cycling genes in complex communities.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

A set of highly interconnected cortical regions known as the default mode network (DMN) exhibits selective vulnerability to both functional decline and amyloid beta (Ab) plaques in early AD. One possibility is that early Ab accumulation in the DMN drives vulnerability. However, it is unknown whether there is something intrinsic to neuronal projections within the DMN that biases these circuits towards dysfunction. Here we directly test this hypothesis using long-term recordings of the spiking activity of ensembles of single units in freely behaving mice characterized by global cortical and hippocampal Ab burden (APP/PS1). Specifically, we track the interactions of a population of neurons within a DMN region and two additional populations that comprise monosynaptic targets, one within and the other outside the DMN. In addition, we record single neurons in hippocampus and examine interactions between the in-DMN and out-DMN cortical circuits triggered on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, stereotyped hippocampal events that contribute to memory consolidation in the cortex. We examine the statistics of local activity as well as inter-regional communication in a region, genotype, and brain-state dependent manner. Our data reveal dysfunction restricted to the in-DMN projecting circuit. In contrast, communication along neuronal projections that originate in the DMN but target an out-DMN population is equivalent in APP/PS1 and WT mice. Circuit dysfunction is most evident throughout sleep, and particularly disrupted within sharp-wave ripples. Summarily, our results indicate that, even in the face of transgene overexpression and widespread Ab, there is distinct intrinsic and selective vulnerability. This vulnerability to amyloidosis is circuit-specific and conditioned on target, and neither source nor amyloid burden. These data raise the possibility that neuronal function in the DMN is not universally vulnerable; DMN subnetworks whose interactions involve targets outside the DMN may be resilient to Ab.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

With sample-specific contexts, contextualization enables sample-specific models and even generalizes at test time to predict network models for entirely unseen contexts. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood Selection) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, using copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics as model context. Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation.

J.", "abstract": "Body size, especially body mass, is the key to understanding many biological properties. The scaling approaches and volumetric-density (VD) approaches are often employed to estimate the body masses of extinct amniotes. Precise skeletal reconstruction represents a pivotal step in all VD approaches, while the ribcage serves as one of the key determinants of thoracic shape and volume. Although being extensively investigated in physiological studies, the ribcage restoration remains poorly discussed during skeletal reconstruction. This study proposes one possible programme of skeletal reconstruction of extinct amniotes in 2D environments, focusing on the restoration of ribcage cross-sections. One recent VD approach, the cross-sectional method (CSM), was utilized to integrate the restored cross-sections into volume, therefore the workflow proposed here serves as a supplementary guideline of the application of the CSM in paleontology. Following this programme, a uniform set of reconstruction criteria was proposed for plesiosaurs, a clade of Mesozoic marine reptiles. Twenty-four plesiosaur models were created, then multiple regression models (Ordinary Least Squares, OLS; and Phylogenetically Generalized Least Squares, PGLS) based on them were employed to investigate the performance of various skeletal elements as size proxy. Despite the high disparity of their body plans, the trunk length and dimensions of dorsal vertebrae were found to be the most robost proxy for volume in plesiosaurs. The hybrid approach applied in this study, which incorporates VD estimates created under the same criteria as scaling samples, mitigates previous critiques focusing on inconsistent standards and inadequate taxonomic coverage. It allows fast and convenient body volume estimation for numerous individuals, even when only fragmentary fossil materials are available. The volumetric formulae for plesiosaurs can accommodate the size diversity of most taxa, except for some extremely giant pliosaurs, the largest of which might reach or exceed 20 metric tons in body mass. To demonstrate the utility of the formulae provided in this study, the body volumes of 113 plesiosaur taxa was estimated, and the branch-specific rates of size evolution computed from the data were mapped onto a plesiosaur phylogeny for visualization.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Most metabolic processes cycle with a 24-hour rhythm, but the extent to which the microbiome influences metabolite cycling under different conditions, such as variations in dietary composition, remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized high temporal resolution metabolite profiling of the Drosophila gut to investigate the role of the microbiome in metabolite cycling. We find that the microbiome increases the number of oscillating metabolites despite the previous finding that it dampens transcript cycling in the gut. Time restricted feeding (TF) also promotes metabolite cycling and does so to a larger extent in germ-free flies, thereby increasing cycling in these flies to levels comparable to those in microbiome containing flies. Enhancement of cycling by the microbiome depends upon a circadian clock, which also maintains phase in the face of changes in the microbiome. Interestingly, a high-protein diet increases microbiome-dependent metabolite cycling, while a high sugar diet suppresses it. Gene Ontology identifies amino acid metabolism as the metabolic pathway most affected by changes in the gut microbiome, the circadian clock and timed feeding, suggesting that it is subject to regulation by multiple inputs. Collectively, our observations highlight a key role of the gut microbiome in host metabolite cycling, and reveal a complex interaction with internal and external factors.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

While DRC supplementation offers a means to modulate the microbiome therapeutically, its effectiveness is often limited by the microbial community's complexity and individual variability in microbiome functionality. We utilized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from the AGORA collection to provide a system-level overview of the metabolic capabilities of human gut microbes in terms of carbohydrate trophic networks and propose improved therapeutic interventions, based on microbial community design. Our study inferred the capability of AGORA strains to consume carbohydrates of varying structural complexities -including DRCs- and to produce metabolites amenable to cross-feeding, such as SCFAs. The resulting functional database indicated that DRC-degrading abilities are rare among gut microbes, suggesting that the presence or absence of specific taxa can determine the success of DRC-based interventions. Additionally, we found that metabolite production profiles exceed family-level variation, highlighting the limitations in predicting intervention outcomes based on gut microbial composition assessed at higher taxonomic levels. In response to these findings, we integrate reverse ecology principles, network analysis and GEM community modelling to guide the design of minimal yet resilient microbial communities to better guarantee intervention response (purpose-based communities). As a proof of principle, we predicted a purpose-based community designed to enhance butyrate production when used in conjunction with DRC supplementation, that displays resilience under nutritional stress, such as amino acid restriction. We further seeded the identified purpose-based community into modelled human microbiomes previously demonstrated to accurately predict SCFA production profiles. The analysis confirmed that such intervention significantly promotes butyrate production across samples, with those that presented a comparatively lower butyrate production pre-intervention displaying the largest increase in butyrate production after seeding.

Here, we present a theoretical framework for iteroparous species that integrates Nb into the stochastic recruitment process of the number of adults (N) by modeling individual-level relationships between adult females and their offspring. We partition recruitment variation into parental, non-parental, and environmental components, and show that demographic stochasticity arising from non-Poisson reproduction, summarized by Nb, can amplify environmental variance. Assuming an equal sex ratio and no sex-specific variation, we derive an approximation linking Nb to this amplification when Nb/N < 0.1. For instance, Nb < 42 can increase recruitment variance by more than 5%. A key advantage of this approach is that Nb can be estimated from genetic data collected from a single cohort, making it applicable in data-limited or conservation-priority systems. Our framework highlights a distinct causal pathway by which increased reproductive variance contributes to demographic variability and extinction risk, especially in species where both Nb and Nb/N are small.

While the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) supports memory consolidation through sharp-wave ripple (SWR)-associated reactivation of spatial representations, it lacks direct connectivity with key emotional centers such as the amygdala. In contrast, the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is anatomically and functionally embedded within the emotional network. How the dHPC and vHPC coordinate during sleep to support the consolidation of complex contextual and emotional experiences remains unclear. Here, we used simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the dHPC and vHPC in rats performing a spatial alternation task under opposite emotional valence and during subsequent sleep. We show that dorso-ventral neuronal assemblies better disambiguate the between valence than isolated dorsal or ventral assemblies. During non-REM sleep, coordinated SWRs orchestrate assembly reactivation across the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis following both aversive and rewarding experiences; however, reactivation after aversive trials more closely mirrors the original neural patterns. This enhanced fidelity is driven by the heightened recruitment of shock-responsive neurons of the ventral hippocampus into coordinated SWRs.

We find that the oscillatory activity in the 20 second pre-ictal period is significantly different compared to the oscillatory activity in the absence of SLA or to a more distant period from the ictal event. A classification algorithm revealed that the oscillatory dynamics, particularly in the CA1 subregion, can predict the emergence of an ictal event with high accuracy. Furthermore, oscillatory activity is differentially modulated by anti-epileptic drugs in the different hippocampal subregions. We found that diazepam and carbamazepine modulated the oscillatory activity significantly greater in the CA3 and DG subregions, compared to CA1. Imaging of neuronal activation in the ex vivo model of seizure-like activity, using the Fos protein as an activity marker, revealed a similar subregion-dependent differential modulation following diazepam and carbamazepine perfusion. Therefore, while oscillatory activity in the pre-ictal period in the CA1 subregion can better predict the emergence of ictal events, anti-convulsant drugs have a stronger effect in oscillatory activity in the CA3 and DG subregions.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the Drosophila clock and hygrosensation mutants lack rhythmic activities during and after humidity entrainment, indicating that the core clock components and hygrosensors are essential to circadian entrainment.

T.; Ling, S.", "abstract": "Navigating around the world, we must adaptively allocate attention to our surroundings based on anticipated future stimuli and events. This allocation of spatial attention boosts visuocortical representations at attended locations and locally enhances perception. Indeed, spatial attention has often been analogized to a 'spotlight' shining on the item of relevance. Although the neural underpinnings of the locus of this attentional spotlight have been relatively well studied, less is known about the size of the spotlight: to what extent can the attentional field be broadened and narrowed in accordance with behavioral demands? In this study, we developed a paradigm for dynamically estimating the locus and spread of covert spatial attention, inferred from visuocortical activity using fMRI in humans. We measured BOLD activity in response to an annulus while participants (4 female, 4 male) used covert visual attention to determine whether more numbers or letters were present in a cued region of the annulus. Importantly, the width of the cued area was systematically varied, calling for different sizes of the attentional spotlight. The deployment of attention was associated with an increase in BOLD activity in corresponding retinotopic regions of visual areas V1-V3. By modeling the visuocortical attentional modulation, we could reliably recover the cued location, as well as a broadening of the attentional modulation with wider attentional cues. This modeling approach offers a useful window into the dynamics of attention and spatial uncertainty.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Such trial-to-trial response variabilities are often treated as noise and addressed by simple trial-averaging to obtain the stimulus-driven response, though this approach is insufficient to fully remove the response variability. More importantly, response variability may primarily be caused by non-sensory factors, particularly by variations in cortical state. Here we recorded and analyzed neuronal spiking activity in response to natural images from areas 17 and 18 of cats, along with local population neuronal signals, i.e. local field potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit activity (MUA). Single neurons showed highly varying degrees of trial-to-trial response variability, even when recorded simultaneously. We used a variability ratio (VR) measure to quantify the trial-wise differences in neural responses, and two cortical state indicative measures, a global fluctuation index (GFI) calculated using MUA, and a synchrony index (SI) calculated from LFP signals. We propose a compact convolutional neural network model with parallel pathways, to capture the stimulus-driven activity and the cortical state-driven response variabilities. The stimulus-driven pathway is comprised of a spatiotemporal filter, a parametric rectifier and a Gaussian map, and the cortical state-driven pathway contains temporal filters for MUA and LFPs. The model parameters are fit to best predict the spiking activity of each neuron. The fitted model performed with a significantly higher accuracy in predicting neural responses compared to a basic model with a stimulus-driven pathway alone. The neurons with higher response variability benefited more from the cortical state-driven pathway compared to less variable neurons. These results show that different neurons may differ greatly in their variability and in the degree of their relationship to indicators of cortical state fluctuations.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS) catalyzes the enantiospecific formation of R-benzylsuccinate from toluene and fumarate, initiating anaerobic toluene degradation. In this study, we present a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism using classical molecular dynamics and multiscale modelling (QM:MM). We describe the potential energy surface of the reaction, confirming the previously postulated mechanism. However, the multiscale character of our model allowed to elucidate the origins of several experimentally observed catalytic phenomena, such as the inversion of the configuration of the benzylic atom upon C-C bond formation, syn addition of the abstracted H atom back to the benzylsuccinyl radical, or kinetic isotope effects in the range of 1.7-2.1. The obtained model is supported by microkinetic analysis and was able to explain and quantitatively predict the strict R-enantioselectivity of BSS, which is not enforced by the binding orientation of the fumarate, but by dynamic kinetic behaviour of toluene in the active site leading to faster production of the R-enantiomer. We were also able to explain the experimentally observed slow H/D exchange in the product during incubation with BSS in D2O, confirming the partial reversibility of the reaction.

In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed ~15 million complete genomes and nearly ~8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many of the SAVs that went on to reach high frequency could be detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected at a median of 3-22 months prior. Additionally, we found that genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level can also be observed in the intrahost diversity of infections. Application of machine learning models allowed us to learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage between mutations (r2=0.53-0.67), pointing to epistasis being an important determinant in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results highlight the predictive power of intrahost diversity data, and document the evolutionary forces shaping the fitness of mutations.

However, the assembly mechanisms associated with the other abundant and ubiquitous, anionic, stress-response regulating polymer, polyphosphate (polyP), is less understood. Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from E.coli to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and dissolving in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent dissolution or spontaneous aggregation, respectively. On the other hand, the CytR variants form only liquid-like but metastable droplets with DNA which dissolve within a few hours. Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects. Our findings reveal how polyphosphate can more efficiently discern conformational heterogeneity in the starting protein ensemble, its structure, and compactness, with broad implications in assembly mechanisms involving polyP and stress response in bacterial systems.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveals that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF and NF-{kappa}B pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of Il6 and Tnf. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of {beta}-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition.

Despite their biological importance, their presence and function in human placental tissue remain poorly understood, particularly in pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy associated with oxidative stress and altered lipid homeostasis. This study profiled both dietary and non-enzymatic oxysterols in third-trimester human placentas from healthy term pregnancies and those complicated with preeclampsia, delivered at term or preterm and term. Findings indicate significantly higher oxysterol levels in preeclamptic placentas, particularly for 7-ketcholesterol (7-Keto) and 5,6{beta}-cholestanetriol, (Triol) regardless of gestational age. 5{beta},6{beta}-epoxycholesterol (O'Callaghan, Woods, & O'Brien, 2001) was higher in term preeclampsia, while total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in preeclamptic placentas. Correlation analyses revealed distinct associations between oxysterols, cholesterol, and total fat content, indicating unique oxidative signatures in preeclamptic pregnancies. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that altered oxysterol profiles may reflect oxidative stress and placental dysfunction. While causality cannot be inferred, oxysterol profiling may hold potential as a complementary biomarker strategy for identifying pregnancies at risk of adverse outcomes.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Peak-to-trough ratio (PTR) is a technique for studying microbial growth dynamics, calculated using the ratio of replication origin (ori) copies to that of the terminus (ter), as originally defined by whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS presents significant challenges in terms of expense and data analysis complexity due to the presence of host DNA in the samples. Here, we used multiplexed PCR with fluorescent probes to estimate bacterial growth rates based on the abundance of ori- and ter-adjacent loci, without the need for WGS. We establish the utility of this approach by comparing growth rates of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strain HM86 by WGS (PTR) and qPCR to measure the equivalent ori:ter (O:TPCR). We found that PTR and O:TPCR were highly correlated and that O:TPCR reliably predicted growth rates calculated by conventional methods. O:TPCR was then used to calculate the in situ E. coli growth rates in urine, bladder, and kidneys collected over the course of a week from a murine model of urinary tract infection (UTI). These analyses revealed that growth rate of UPEC strains gradually increased during the early stages of infection (0-6h), followed by a slow decrease in growth rates during later time points (1-7 days). This rapid and convenient method provides valuable insights into bacterial growth dynamics during infection and can be applied to other bacterial species in both animal models and clinical infections.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a split-GAL4 library composed of genetic driver lines, which we generated via editing the genomic locus of lineage-specific transcription factors and demonstrate that we can use this library to specifically target most individual neuronal hemilineages in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) throughout development and into adulthood. Using these genetic driver lines, we found striking morphological changes in neuronal processes within a lineage during metamorphosis. We also demonstrated how neurochemical features of neuronal classes can be quickly assessed. Lastly, we documented behaviors elicited in response to optogenetic activation of individual neuronal lineages and generated a comprehensive lineage-behavior map of the entire fly VNC.

They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multi-type birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multi-type birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this paper we present a method which infers these multi-type trajectories with minimal additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously-published set of MERS-CoV genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir.

Research using this novel approach has focused on proteins (typically 50 residues in length or greater), while multi-conformation prediction of shorter peptides has not yet been explored in this context.

De novo structure predictions were accompanied by structural comparison analyses to assess prediction accuracy. We found that the prediction of conformational ensembles of peptides with AF2 varied in accuracy versus NMR data, with average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) among structured regions under 2.5 [A] and average root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) differences under 1.5 [A] for the entire set of 557 peptides.

In response to harmful stimuli, a desirable outcome for the tooth is the formation of tertiary dentin, a protective reparative process that generates new hard tissue. This reparative dentinogenesis is associated with significant inflammation, which triggers the recruitment and differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Previously, we have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB, key mediators of neural functions, are activated during the DPSC-mediated dentin regeneration process. In this study, we further define the role of inflammation in this process and apply stem cell engineering to enhance dentin regeneration in injured teeth. Our data show that TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs rapidly increase during odontogenic differentiation, further amplified by inflammatory inducers and mediators such as TNF, LTA, and LPS. An in vivo dentin formation assessment was conducted using a mouse pulp-capping/caries model, where CRISPR-engineered DPSCs overexpressing BDNF were transplanted into inflamed pulp tissue. This transplantation significantly enhanced dentin regeneration in injured teeth. To further explore potential downstream pathways, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of TNF-treated DPSCs, both with and without TrkB antagonist CTX-B.

Using three different approaches, we show that mature mucocysts, poised for exocytosis, are non-acidic. Nonetheless, a specific V-ATPase a-subunit is targeted to mucocysts and is indispensable for mucocyst biogenesis and secretion. Consistent with this, immature mucocysts in the cytoplasm appear to be transiently acidified.

However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesise that abnormal elevation of islet NAD, via activation of NAMPT, plays a key role in driving islet autoimmune processes in T1D, and that conversely, NAMPT inhibition may be an attractive therapeutic approach for T1D. Methods: Islets were isolated from non-diabetic CD1 mice or obtained from human islet donors and exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail (IL-1{beta}, TNF and IFN{gamma}) +/- NAMPT inhibitor. Beta-cell function was determined by static glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Islet apoptosis was determined by caspase 3/7 activity. Islet cell differential gene expression was assessed via bulk-RNA sequencing. Diabetes was induced in CD1 mice via multiple low dose streptozotocin (MLDS) injection. MLDS mice were then administered FK866 (10 mg/kg; IP) or saline equivalent for 16 days. Ambient blood glucose was measured every 2-3 days. Beta-cell function was assessed by measurement of serum insulin and c-peptide levels. Insulin content was assessed by flow cytometry. Intra-islet immune cell infiltration, as well as immune cell proliferation and cytokine production were assessed via flow cytometry. For migration assays, islets were isolated from BALB/c mice dispersed and reaggregated into reformed islets. CD8+ cells were isolated from splenocytes derived from NY8.3 NOD mice migration of immune cells was assessed using a transwell culture protocol. Results: NAMPT inhibition with FK866 or compound 17 protected mouse and human islets against cytokine-mediated beta cell dysfunction and death. RNAseq revealed that inhibiting NAMPT blocked pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated gene expression linked to pro-inflammatory responses and leukocyte migration. FK866 improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in MLDS mice. FK866 also reduced proportions of islet-residing TNF producing CD4+T-cells and F4/80+macrophages, proliferation of spleen-derived CD4+ and CD8+T-cells, and proliferation of islet-derived CD4+T-cells and F4/80+macrophages. Finally, FK866 was able to block pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated migration of cytotoxic CD8+T-cells into reformed islets. Conclusions: This data supports a key immunomodulatory role for NAMPT in islet autoimmunity. NAMPT inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for T1D.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

There exists a dire need for new treatments, especially those that synergize with our existing arsenal of antibiotic drugs, to help overcome the gap in antibiotic efficacy and attenuate the development of new antibiotic resistance in the most dangerous pathogens. Quorum-sensing systems in bacteria drive the formation of biofilms, increase surface motility, and enhance other virulence factors, making these systems attractive targets for the discovery of novel antibacterials. Quorum-sensing inhibitors (QSIs) are hypothesized to synergize with existing antibiotics, making bacteria more sensitive to the effects of these drugs. In this study, we aimed to find the synergistic combinations between the QSIs and known antibiotics to combat the two deadliest hospital infections - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We mined biochemical activity databases and literature to identify known, high-efficacy QSIs against these bacteria. We used these data to develop and validate a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model for predicting QSI activity and then employed this model to identify new potential QSIs from the Inxight database of approved and investigational drugs. We then tested binary mixtures of the identified QSIs with 11 existing antibiotics using a combinatorial matrix screening approach with ten (five of each) clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Amongst explored drug combinations, 22 exhibited a synergistic effect. Although no mixture inhibiting all the strains was found, piperacillin combined with curcumin, ketoprofen, indomethacin, and piroxicam demonstrated the broadest antimicrobial action. We anticipate that further preclinical investigation of these combinations of novel repurposed QSIs with a known antibiotic may lead to novel clinical candidates.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Its formation depends on the enamel organ (EO), a specialized epithelial structure derived from oral epithelium. How uniform oral epithelium differentiates into diverse EO cell types remains unclear. While p63, an ectodermal development master regulator, is essential for dental placode formation, its specific roles in EO development have been obscured by early arrest in p63 knockout mice. Using single-cell RNA sequencing from mouse incisors, we show p63 expression across all EO cell types with both shared and distinct functions. Through trajectory reconstruction, we identify its role in regulating both amelogenic (AmG) and non-AmG lineage commitment during EO development. Comparative transcriptome analyses reveal that p63 regulates the Krt8-to-Krt5 transition during AmG cell differentiation, paralleling its function in skin development. This parallel is reinforced by comparative motif discovery showing shared transcription factor usage, particularly p63 and AP-2 family members. Chromatin accessibility analyses further illustrate that p63 mediates this transition through chromatin landscape remodeling. These findings demonstrate that p63 co-opts the Krt8-to-Krt5 transition mechanism from skin development for EO formation.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Severe hearing loss can be treated with cochlear implants (CIs), but how the brain adapts to electrical hearing remains unclear. This study examined adaptation to unilateral CI use in the first and seventh month after CI-activation using speech comprehension measures and EEG recordings, both during passive listening and an active spatial listening task. We here provide electrophysiological evidence for a longitudinal increase in temporal coding acuity and decrease in cortical overrepresentation of acoustic input in the first six months following activation of a unilateral CI. Specifically, neural phase-locking to 40-Hz amplitude-modulated (AM) sounds increased, while phase-locking to 4-Hz AM sounds decreased, indicating refined temporal processing and reduced overrepresentation, respectively. In the spatial listening task, the CI benefit was most pronounced when the CI ear was primarily exposed to target speech. Lateralized alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) reliably marked CI users focus of spatial attention. Stronger alpha modulation in the hemisphere opposite to the non-implanted ear indicates an attentional bias toward the acoustically hearing ear. Our findings suggest that adaptation to hearing with a CI is accomplished by dynamic improvements in temporal coding and a persistent bias in auditory spatial attention.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Brightness, one of the primary dimensions of timbre, is governed by different acoustic parameters compared to pitch, but the two can be confused perceptually when varied simultaneously. Here we combine human behavior and fMRI to provide evidence of a potential neural substrate to explain this important but poorly understood perceptual confusion. We identify orderly mappings of both pitch and brightness within auditory cortex and reveal two independent lines of evidence for cortical confusion between them. First, the preferred pitch of individual voxels decreases systematically as brightness increases, and vice versa, consistent with predictions based on perceptual confusion. Second, pitch and brightness mapping share a common high-low-high gradient across auditory cortex, implying a shared trajectory of cortical activation for changes in each dimension. The results provide a cortical substrate at both local and global scales for an established auditory perceptual phenomenon that is thought to reflect efficient coding of features ubiquitous in natural sound statistics.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

C.; Levenstein, J. M.", "abstract": "Objective: The inhibition deficit hypothesis postulates that inhibitory functioning declines with age, which negatively impacts other cognitive abilities. Yet still, the impact of healthy ageing on inhibitory functioning remains unclear, with the multifaceted nature of inhibition often an overlooked factor. Moreover, no prior study has empirically tested whether inhibitory sub-components explain differential age-effects in sustained attention - an open question that this work aims to address. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the inhibition deficit hypothesis in a sample of eighty healthy older adults (mean age = 67.78 years, 44f). We utilised the PsyToolkit platform to administer three inhibition tasks (i.e., flanker, Stroop, and go/no-go), each targeting a distinct sub-component process, along with the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Results: Semi-partial correlations (rho) of the three inhibition sub-component measures (correcting for gender and education) with age resulted in significant positive relationships with task performance on the Stroop and go/no-go, such that older individuals had more pronounced Stroop effects and worse go/no-go accuracy, respectively. Lastly, go/no-go performance completely mediated the relationship between ageing and sustained attention performance, whilst Stroop effects partially mediated this association. Conclusion: Age-related declines were observed in specific inhibition tasks, which speaks against a general inhibition deficit in healthy ageing and cautions against conflating these sub-components into a generalised concept of inhibition. The mediation findings demonstrate that inhibitory sub-components account for age-related declines in sustained attention, over and beyond ageing itself via an indirect path, representing an important cognitive domain to maintain throughout ageing.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

In recent decades, tree-planting initiatives have been widely implemented to restore these forests, yielding mixed results. To enhance restoration effectiveness, it is imperative to adopt a predictive approach, focusing on the drivers of seedling performance and their interactions. This study explores how functional traits of planted tree species interact with site environmental conditions to influence seedling survival and growth rates across nine restoration sites of varying ages and climatic conditions within the Peruvian Tumbes-Piura TDFs. While the widely accepted resource-use theory predicts that acquisitive species - focusing on the fast retrieval of resources and characterised by higher specific leaf area and lower wood density - achieve high growth rates in resource-rich environments but experience sharp declines under resource-limited conditions, we found that acquisitive species maintained their high growth rates along the environmental gradient. In contrast, conservative species, expected to be less sensitive to resource variability, exhibited marked declines in growth when water or nutrient availability decreased. Additionally, nitrogen-fixing species did not outperform non-fixers in growth or survival, indicating that nitrogen fixation alone does not confer a consistent advantage in early restoration. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of trait-environment interactions in tree planting performance and underscore the need to align species selection and management strategies with site conditions and broader restoration goals to enhance the success of TDF restoration.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Yet, few methods operate at the resolution necessary to capture subtle effects of single-nucleotide changes. Furthermore, it remains unclear which architectural components - such as residual connections, normalization strategies, or attention mechanisms - drive performance in these high-resolution predictions. To address these knowledge gaps, we systematically evaluate classic architectural choices and introduce ConvNeXt V2 blocks, originally developed for computer vision, as high-resolution feature extractors in deep learning models for genomic data. Integrated into diverse architectures - CNNs, LSTMs, dilated CNNs, and transformers - ConvNeXt V2 blocks consistently improve performance, leading to similar prediction accuracy across these different model types. This reveals that early feature extraction, rather than downstream architecture, is the primary determinant of prediction accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of these models on ATAC-seq signal prediction at 4 bp resolution in a cell-type-specific manner identifies the ConvNeXt-based dilated CNN as the most robust performer, better preserving the signal's shape.

However, most studies focus on selective auditory attention decoding (sAAD) with competing speakers, while the dynamics of absolute auditory attention decoding (aAAD) to a single target remains underexplored. The goal of aAAD is to measure the degree of attention to a single speaker, has applications for objective measurements of attention in psychological and educational contexts. To investigate this aAAD paradigm, we designed an experiment where subjects listened to a video lecture under varying attentive conditions. We trained neural decoders to reconstruct the speech envelope from EEG in the baseline attentive condition and use the correlation coefficient between the decoded and real speech envelope as a metric for attention to the speech. Our analysis shows that the envelope standard deviation (SD) of the speech envelope in the 1-4 Hz band strongly correlates with this metric across different segments of the speech stimulus. However, this correlation weakens in the 0.1-4 Hz band, where the degree of separation between the attentive and inattentive state becomes more pronounced. This highlights the unique contribution of the 0.1-1 Hz range, which enhances the distinction of attentional states and remains less affected by confounding factors such as the time-varying dynamic range of the speech envelope.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

ADAR1 manipulation has a significant impact on alternative splicing. While many of those changes are related to changes in their A-to-I RNA editing activity, we speculate that ADAR1 may also influence splicing in an editing-independent manner. In this work, the protein-protein interactome of ADAR1 revealed that ADAR1 interacts with spliceosome co-factors and auxiliary splicing regulators. We confirmed that ADAR1 does not only influence splicing through editing but also throughout editing-independent functions with even greater penetrance. We show that ADAR1 modulates the splicing of transcripts encoding splicing factors, with many of these splice sites overlapping with known splicing changes induced by the splicing factor ACIN1, suggesting indirect effects upon ADAR1 expression.

The current management for TB is prolonged with severe side effects, leading to poor patient compliance.

This work explores the bactericidal potential of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnONPs, 40 nm) in managing both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB in combination with anti-TB drugs. It was found that ZnONPs inhibit generation of active SufB protein via splicing inhibition, an essential event for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survival. While TEM and UV-visible spectroscopy identified NPs~protein interaction, SEM visualised extensive membrane damage in H37Rv and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb cells. Alamar blue assay and spread plate method detected minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of ZnONPs towards H37Rv strain and MDR Mtb isolates. In vitro studies identified a combination with ZnONPs that reduced effective doses for anti-TB drugs towards H37Rv and MDR Mtb isolates. A correlation to splicing inhibition was made by performing Alamar blue assay in SufB intein-less microbe, Mycobacterium smegmatis. A similar drug combination, attenuated the mycobacterial load, inflammation in the spleen & lungs, and protected against Mtb induced splenomegaly in infected mice. Thus, ZnONPs can be used as potent additive in anti-TB regimen to manage drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, addressing challenges such as prolonged therapy, drug toxicity and poor patient compliance.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Humans have a remarkable capacity to adjust reaching movements rapidly and accurately when visual targets jump to a new location. The short latency of such online corrections has led to the hypothesis that they constitute a distinct class of movement and arise from an automatic pilot that is selectively engaged only during ongoing movements. However, concrete evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. Here, we test this idea by measuring muscle recruitment, force, and kinematics in a jumping target reaching task. In separate blocks of trials, participants were instructed to respond to target jumps by (1) following the jumped target, (2) stopping the on-going movement, or (3) ignoring the jumped target. This allowed us to establish the automaticity and timing of responses to target jumps and to compare such measures to the original reaching movement initiated from rest. We find that the earliest phase of muscle recruitment elicited by the jumped target corresponds to a subcortical reflex, beginning at ~80ms and ending by ~120ms, preceding the onset of voluntary recruitment at ~130ms. This reflex inexorably drives a reaching adjustment towards the new target in all three blocks; it is only somewhat reduced in the stop and ignore blocks. Critically, this earliest phase of muscle recruitment was also present at the exact same latency (80ms) for the original reaching movement initiated from rest. Thus, rather than supporting the model of online corrections as distinct class of movement that is mediated by an automatic pilot, our results suggest that all reaches, whether adjusted in mid-flight or initiated from rest, arise from a common nested control system featuring subcortical and cortical components whose influence can be strategically preset by task demands.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

This occurs despite our finding that adult skill level has evolved an increased reactivity to environmental and social change, and a decreased reactivity to genetic change, which is consistent with observation.

The most characteristic feature of the condition NF1 is the neurofibroma, a benign, multi-cellular tumor which initiates when a cell of the Schwann cell lineage gains a somatic pathogenic variant of the other NF1 allele. Neurofibromas developing at nerve termini in the skin are termed \"cutaneous\" neurofibromas (cNFs), while those developing within larger nerves are termed \"plexiform.\" Most patients develop cNFs beginning in late childhood or early adulthood, continuing throughout life at variable rates. Some patients may develop only a few cNFs, while others suffer from thousands. There are no reliably effective physical or pharmaceutical therapies besides surgical removal. Although these are not life-threatening, they are disfiguring and can interfere with normal life functions. To provide a resource for research, we developed short-term cNF Schwann cell cultures from NF1 patients, from which we subsequently established the first semi-immortalized cNF cell lines through transduction with wild-type human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (mCdk4) genes. Here we present molecular, cellular, and functional characterization of these cell lines, which will be of utility for investigating and developing NF1 cNF therapies.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

L.; Tokuriki, N.; Spence, M. A.; Jackson, C.", "abstract": "Proteins operate through ligand and solvent interactions governed by thermodynamics, yet the enthalpy-entropy trade-offs that guide their functional evolution remain poorly understood. The LacI/GalR family (LGF) of transcription factors provides a system for examining how these trade-offs evolve over billions of years but has seldom been studied from a full thermodynamic perspective. While the evolution of ligand specificity has been well-studied, the thermodynamic determinants underlying the changes in specificity is not well understood, especially how proteins alter thermodynamic strategies to optimize affinity. By reconstructing LGF ancestors, we reveal a shift from entropy-driven binding in the most distant ancestor, to enthalpy-driven binding in the most recent ancestor and extant LacI. The most distant ancestor is characterized by the ability to bind its ligand in an open and dynamic conformation, and we propose that entropically-driven binding is driven by the presence of entropic reservoirs. This thermodynamic binding trade-off between the most distant and most recent ancestor is in accordance with the concept of ancient life that existed in a hot Earth environment, where higher temperatures enhanced entropically-driven binding. This suggests that molecular binding mechanisms evolved not just for ligand specificity, but to adapt to environmental pressures such as cooling Earth temperatures where enthalpic binding modes are favored.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Disruption of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to congenital lymphatic disorders and contribute to various pathological conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the molecular regulation of these processes remain elusive. Here we reveal a critical and previously unappreciated role for the signaling scaffold protein Shoc2 in lymphangiogenesis. We demonstrate that loss of Shoc2 leads to nearly a complete loss of lymphatic vasculature in vivo and senescence of lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Shoc2 is required for balancing signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway, and its loss results in increased mTORC1 signaling. This dysregulation impairs mitochondrial respiration and triggers an IRF/IFN-II response, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Strikingly, expression of the Noonan Syndrome with Loose anagen Hair (NSLH)-causing Shoc2 variant S2G phenocopies the effects of Shoc2 loss. Together, these studies establish the critical role of Shoc2 in lymphangiogenesis and uncover a novel mechanistic link between Shoc2 signaling, mitochondrial function, innate immune response, and lymphatic development, with significant implications for Ras-pathway-related congenital disorders.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

However, MYC's transcriptional regulation remains incompletely understood. Our previous work demonstrated that key regulatory elements controlling Drosophila Myc reside within its 5' UTR and intergenic regions. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and selective Solid Surface Magnetic Enrichment Protocol (SSMEP) to purify DNA-protein complexes formed on Myc cis-elements. Using analysis of truncated reporters, Electrophoretic-Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA), and mass spectrometric protein identification, we identified a cis-regulatory module (CRM) within the proximal 5' UTR that appears sufficient to activate lacZ reporter expression in the ovary and embryos. Furthermore, combining CRMs from either the upstream region or the intergenic Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) region with the proximal 5' UTR regulatory unit recapitulates expression patterns previously observed in larval tissues, ovaries, and embryos. The DPE itself exhibits promoter activity when fused in-frame to an adjacent binding site cluster, and drives expression mimicking that of wild-type Myc. Further in vivo validation is necessary to confirm the functional relevance of the associated factors and identified signaling cascades as Myc regulators.

Here, we studied the phase separation of alpha synuclein (-syn), an intrinsically disordered protein whose aggregation is implicated in the pathology of Parkinsons Disease, (PD) inside yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Using a positively charged polymer; polyethylenimine (PEI), which binds presumably at the negatively charged C-terminal domain of -syn, we find that the aggregation of -syn inside yeast can be modulated by at least two pathways: one involving phase separation and the second one without phase separation. We find further that these two pathways lead to varying fibril characteristics and toxicities.

H.; Ferrari, P.; Arnulfo, G.; Marzulli, M.; Degras, D.; Myrov, V.; Palva, S.; Nobili, L.; Ciuciu, P.; Palva, M.", "abstract": "Surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is the most effective treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. However, 30[ndash]80% of patients do not attain long-term seizure freedom post-surgery, indicating that pre-surgical evaluation often falls short of fully delineating the EZ. Accurate EZ-localization is challenging because each individual EZ is a unique and complex network, often comprising multiple overlapping neuropathologies. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that combining multiple biomarkers enhances localization accuracy. Nonetheless, combining biomarkers leads to high-dimensional features that risks overfitting classifiers and reduces the interpretability of underlying neuropathology, ultimately limiting clinical applicability. We asked whether high-dimensional neuronal features could be reduced to a low-dimensional latent space to captures essential characteristics of the epileptogenic network (EpiNet). In the latent space, each sampled brain region is assigned an EpiNet-saliency score along a 0[ndash]1 continuum, characterizing the degree of epileptogenic proneness from lowest to highest. Using 10-minute interictal recordings from 7,183 stereo-EEG (SEEG) contacts across 64 focal epilepsy patients, we extracted 260 features of local and network dynamics. Singular value decomposition revealed that ten eigenfeatures were sufficient to identify brain regions where seizures emerged (SZ). These eigenfeatures were used to train two unsupervised classifiers, which converged on a consensus model for assessing EpiNet-saliency using only the first and second eigenfeatures, reducing the dimensionality to 0.77% of the original feature set. The resulting model was tested on 7[ndash]9 hours of sleep-SEEG recordings from three patients in an independent cohort and validated using tensor component analysis. Among the 64 training subjects, SZ-classification accuracy correlated with individual position in the eigenfeature space (r2=0.5), suggesting that variability in EpiNet-saliency contributes to differences in classification performance. The model was tested on three subjects from an independent cohort, where it successfully captured time-varying EpiNet-saliency in sleep-SEEG, corroborating clinical assessments and achieving peak classification accuracies of 0.63, 0.85, and 0.94, respectively. A separate tensor component analysis verified the spatiotemporal characteristics of model-predicted EpiNet-saliency in the sleep-SEEG. These results provide compelling evidence supporting our hypothesis of a low-dimensional representation of epileptogenicity, which appears to be independent of brain state or neuropathological origin. This innovative approach enables straightforward interpretation of neuropathology and facilitates the integration of additional biomarkers and study of large cohorts, owing to its minimal computational footprint. These advancements significantly enhance the feasibility of a framework for unified epilepsy biomarkers.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Experimental testing is challenging because of the wide range of conditions that must be tested. Here, we use muscle-driven simulations to overcome this challenge and inform exotendon design. We validated a simulation framework that estimates changes in energy expenditure, body kinematics, and muscle activations when simulated subjects run with and without an exotendon. Simulations of people running at 4 m/s with the exotendon that saved energy at 2.7 m/s predicted a 10% reduction in energy cost compared to natural running. We then performed simulations of 25 designs and found that many of the designs saved energy. A longer, stiffer exotendon yielded slightly greater energy savings (12%). Longer and more compliant exotendons offered little savings. We plan to test a limited set of our simulation predictions in an experiment to evaluate their accuracy and assess how an exotendon impacts running performance at 4 m/s. The purpose of this paper is to present the simulation results and to make predictions about the performance of the runner-exotendon system in experiments.

Methods: Seventeen healthy individuals performed 15 repetitions of a complex force-matching task at 10% of a maximal voluntary contraction. Two trials were selected for analysis, the one with the highest force-target error (pre-learning) and the one with the lowest (post-learning). High-density surface electromyograms recorded from vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) were decomposed into their constituent motor unit spike trains, with individual motor units being tracked between trials. Motor unit discharge behavior and common synaptic oscillations across the delta, alpha, and beta bands were calculated and compared between pre- and post-learning. Results: Force-target matching improved across trials, accompanied by a significant decrease in the coefficient of variation of the inter-spike interval (p < 0.01), while the mean discharge rate remained similar (p > 0.85). The area under the curve within delta (p < 0.003) and alpha (p < 0.004) bands decreased between trials, with no significant changes in the beta band (p > 0.05).

Although these processes are circadian-regulated and clock genes reportedly show robust cycling along the 3rd ventricle, the role of the clock in tanycytes has not yet been examined. We report here that clock genes cycle with much higher amplitude in ventral tanycytes compared to more dorsal ependymocytes of the 3rd ventricle, and that specific disruption of the tanycyte clock can be achieved by adult Bmal1 deletion using the RaxCreER driver. Adult tanycyte Bmal1 deletion did not affect circadian rhythms of wheel-running and sleep, but did inhibit weight gain on high-fat diet in female mice. Altered tanycyte-derived hypothalamic neurogenesis, which can regulate feeding and weight gain by contributing new neurons to nearby feeding-relevant nuclei, is one mechanism that likely contributes to this phenotype. Fate mapping studies showed that female mice have higher baseline tanycyte-derived neurogenesis than males, with many of the resulting neurons localizing to the feeding-relevant arcuate nucleus. Female but not male mice show reduced tanycyte-derived arcuate neurogenesis after adult tanycyte Bmal1 deletion and an increased percentage of newborn arcuate neurons take on a feeding-suppressing POMC neuropeptidergic fate. Thereby, skewing of feeding and satiety promoting fates link the weight homeostasis and neurogenesis effects.

Migrating cortical interneurons remain in constant communication with both extracellular signals and intracellular machinery to maintain a directed migration into the cortical rudiment. In order to engage in directed migration, cortical interneurons undergo the cell biological process termed nucleokinesis in which interneurons translocate their cell bodies into a cytoplasmic swelling formed in the leading process. Many of the intracellular mechanisms governing the timing of migratory stream exit and cortical plate invasion are poorly understood yet are of fundamental importance to cortical development. We previously uncovered a requirement for the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in cortical interneuron migration. Disruption of the JNK signaling pathway resulted in a delayed entry of cortical interneurons into the cortex, as well as a premature departure from migratory streams. We are interested in uncovering the mechanisms by which JNK activity coordinates the intracellular processes essential for the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Our data shows, through the use of multiple ex vivo and in vitro assays, that cortical interneurons treated with JNK inhibitor exhibit major deficiencies in nucleokinesis. Additionally, we developed a novel tool to explore cortical interneuron migration using a nanopattern topography. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns have significantly faster migratory speeds and translocate further distances than cells cultured on a flat substrate. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns also display a different subcellular distribution of doublecortin, a known target of JNK signaling involved in microtubule stability and the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Overall, our results highlight the importance of JNK signaling in the guided migration of cortical interneurons.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

A left-lateralized network comprising the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been consistently implicated in this process. While previous studies have established the necessity of the IFG and pMTG in semantic control, the causal role of the left dmPFC remains unclear. Additionally, it is unknown whether each of these three regions exhibits internal functional differentiation and how they interact to support semantic control. To address these questions, we combined task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that dmPFC, like IFG and pMTG, is causally involved in semantic control. All three regions exhibited a consistent anterior-posterior functional gradient: anterior subregions were selectively engaged during high-demand semantic processing, whereas posterior subregions responded to both easy and hard tasks. Furthermore, combined activation patterns of these regions better predicted the behavioral differences between hard and easy semantic tasks compared to the activation patterns of any single region. Semantic control modulated both the autoinhibition within individual regions and the functional connectivity among them, suggesting these regions operate in a coordinated network rather than in isolation. These findings advance our understanding of the neural architecture supporting flexible semantic behavior.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

We investigated the association between plasma and skin amino acids and the sphingolipidome in blood and skin of T2D patients and several diabetic rodent models. We developed a hypothesis on how changes in the metabolism of the two amino acids relates to SL formation and DPN.

METHODS: We investigated pathological mediators across varying severities of VCI in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Proteomic analysis guided the evaluation of neuropeptide and non-neuropeptide markers associated with vascular and nonvascular dysfunction, which were correlated with cognitive function to determine their role in VCI. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis revealed vasomotor dysfunction as the primary pathological pathway in VCI. Microvascular vasoconstriction was the earliest and most persistent event, initiating a cascade of both microvascular and nonvascular dysfunction. Dysregulation of vasoactive neuropeptides was identified as the key driver of this process. CGRP supplementation effectively prevented vasoconstriction, and improving cognitive function in CCH. DISCUSSION: This study suggests dysregulation of vasoactive neuropeptides plays a central role in CCH pathomechanism, with microvascular vasoconstriction acting as the primary mediator.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

This study introduces a subject-specific, in silico modeling tool for optimizing electrode placement and maximizing coverage with a variety of devices. The basis for optimization is the inherent information patterns of field potentials derived from dipolar sources. The approach integrates subject-specific MRI data with finite element modeling (FEM) used to simulate the sensitivity of subdural and intracortical devices. Sensitivity maps, or lead fields, from these models enable the comparison of different electrode placements, contact sizes, contact configurations, and substrate properties, which are often overlooked factors. One tool is a genetic algorithm that optimizes electrode placement by maximizing information capacity. Another is a sparse sensor method, Sparse Electrode Placement for Input Optimization (SEPIO), that selects the best sensor subsets for accurate source classification. We demonstrate several use cases for clinicians, engineers, and researchers. Overall, these open-source tools offer a quantitative framework to juxtapose devices in one's neurosurgical armament or optimize device and contact placement. It may help users refine electrode coverage with low channel count devices and minimize invasive surgery burden. The study demonstrates that optimized electrode placement significantly improves the information capacity and signal quality of LFP recordings.

Here we have taken advantage of Visium spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression in discrete CTE lesions and matched normal tissue from the same individuals. In doing so we derived a common 21-gene \"signature\" of CTE lesions that highlights astrocytic activation, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier function, and extracellular matrix remodeling as key in situ features of CTE lesions. Almost all CTE signature genes were strongly expressed in astrocytes, and ontological and protein association analyses implicated extracellular matrix functions as drivers of the disease.

Although these acute effects are short-lived, users often experience lasting improvements in emotional and social functioning. Yet, few studies have quantitatively linked subjective experiences to neural dynamics. To bridge this gap, we investigate the acute and subacute effects of ayahuasca using fMRI data and the 2D Ising model, estimating the Ising brain temperature to quantify the shift from ordered to disordered resting state configurations and expose the critical transitions that characterize ayahuasca-induced brain dynamics. To complement our analysis, we investigated cortical functional connectivity changes through graph-theoretical metrics, quantifying how psychedelic ingestion alters functional network architecture in acute and subacute phases. Only the Ising temperature reliably differentiated the subacute phase. Applying a recently developed method that combines cortical connectivity analyses with Graph Neural Networks trained on Ising networks, our results robustly revealed significant Ising temperature increases during the acute (p < 0.001) and subacute (p < 0.05) phases compared with placebo, reflecting heightened brain entropy and a persistent shift toward a more disordered, paramagnetic state. To evaluate longer-term effects, the subacute temperature change correlated linearly with affective scores on the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale (HRS) captured during the acute session (p < 0.01), with HRS scores explaining substantially greater variance in the subacute group (adjusted R^2 = 0.58) than in the placebo group (adjusted R^2 = -0.05). These observations suggest that ayahuasca elevates system entropy and that the magnitude of lasting functional alterations scales with the intensity of the acute subjective experience.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Tapentadol, lacosamide and pregabalin were used as pharmacological probes to assess the sensitivity of spinal SEPs to drug action. In anaesthetised, naive rats (n=44), a multielectrode silicon probe was inserted into the L4 spinal cord to record SEPs from the dorsal horn following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. At baseline, the N1 component (rodent equivalent of the human N13) had an amplitude of 1.33 +/- 0.07mV at a latency of 4.6 +/- 0.2ms following low-intensity stimulation, with an intensity-dependent amplitude increase into the noxious range. The N1 amplitude was significantly reduced by 10mg/Kg tapentadol (40.2 +/-12.5 % vs vehicle 96.2 +/-8.0 %) and 30mg/Kg lacosamide (46.3 +/-20.9 % lacosamide vs vehicle 115 +/-5.9 %) at 60 minutes after intraperitoneal administration. Tapentadol also reduced the N1 amplitude in the noxious range.

Recent studies have suggested its dysregulation may contribute to Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis; however, the specific genes and regulatory mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Methods: Four publicly available microarray datasets (GSE5281, GSE29378, GSE36980, and GSE138260) were utilized to investigate genes with differential expression between control and AD samples. Asparagine metabolism-related genes (AMGs) were retrieved from the GeneCards database, and their intersection with DEGs yielded candidate asparagine metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (AMG-DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and centrality scoring identified hub genes. Regulatory mechanisms were investigated through construction of competing endogenous RNA and transcription factor networks. Potential therapeutic compounds were predicted via drug-gene enrichment and evaluated using molecular docking simulations. Results: Thirty-nine AMG-DEGs were identified and found to be enriched in neurodevelopmental, synaptic transmission, and inflammatory signaling pathways. PPI analysis and centrality screening revealed seven hub genes (HPRT1, GAD2, TUBB3, GFAP, CD44, CCL2, and NFKBIA). Regulatory network analysis highlighted specific miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and transcription factors involved in their modulation. Drug screening and docking identified Bathocuproine disulfonate, DL-Mevalonic acid, and Phenethyl isothiocyanate as promising compounds with strong binding affinities to hub proteins. Conclusion: This study comprehensively maps the dysregulation of asparagine metabolism in Alzheimers disease and reveals a set of hub genes and regulatory elements potentially involved in disease progression. The predicted therapeutic compounds provide a foundation for further experimental validation and may contribute to the development of novel metabolism-targeted strategies for AD treatment.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

These changes, collectively known as sickness syndrome, are orchestrated by the brain in response to immune mediators released during systemic inflammation. While the roles of subcortical regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei, in regulating sickness symptoms are well established, the contribution of the neocortex to the encoding and modulation of the sick state remains less well understood. We examined the neuronal correlates of sickness in the neocortex of awake mice following a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a well-characterized mediator of sickness. Behavioral analysis revealed that PGE2 elicited a rapid and robust sickness response, characterized by fever, slower locomotion, quiescence, anorexia, and eye squinting. Whole-brain Fos mapping showed that PGE2 generates a distinct neural activation pattern encompassing much of the interoceptive network. Electrophysiological recordings using Neuropixel probes in awake mice revealed that neuronal population dynamics in the insular cortex (IC) and the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp), two regions involved in body state representation, encode sickness-related information, such as body temperature, walking velocity, grooming, and eye squinting. However, unlike SSp, ongoing neuronal activity in IC exhibited a better decoding performance for an integrated measure of sickness rather than individual symptoms. Together, these results suggest that PGE2 induces a coordinated physiological and behavioral response akin to a sick state, which is preferentially encoded in the IC.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we sought to use combined whole-brain transcriptome and spatial transcriptomics approaches to determine whether Aldara-driven neuroinflammation resulted in consistent immune and neurobiological changes throughout the brain. We found evidence of strong immune activation throughout the brain, with astrocytes displaying a strong inflammatory profile that was relatively uniform throughout. However, we found that this global inflammatory signal led to regionally-specific changes in gene expression, particularly reduced expression of genes associated with synaptic function in brain areas underlying mood and anxiety, such as ventral striatum and amygdala.

While Plx3397 administration increased synaptic density in 5xFAD mice, it also reduced the percentage of neurons phase-locked to gamma oscillations. This neural decoupling was closely associated with gene expression changes related to synapse organization. These observations prompted us to investigate whether gamma-frequency entrainment could counteract the neural circuit alterations induced by Plx3397 administration. We thus enhanced gamma phase-locking in neurons using non-invasive patterned sensory light stimulation. Remarkably, restoring gamma oscillations improved neural function, reshaped gene expression signatures, and improved learning and memory in Plx3397-treated 5xFAD mice.

Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-rRNA species in dendrites, alongside the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites. This mechanism may enable rapid modulation of the translational capacity in response to physiological changes, regulating synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis in neurons.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The mechanism of this coupled dysfunction is not fully understood, but a recently approved NPC therapeutic, N-Acetyl-l-Leucine (NALL), reverses both lysosomal and mitochondrial phenotypes in NPC patient cells. Our data indicate that direct inter-organelle communication through lysosome membrane contact sites with mitochondria contribute to the coupled organelle dysfunction in NPC. We find that mitochondria:lysosome contact sites are expanded in NPC, dependent on accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and that NALL rescues the aberrant contact sites. We further identify a direct correlation between mitochondria:lysosome contact site expansion and mitochondrial dysfunction and propose that normalisation of contacts sites contributes to the coupled restoration of lysosome and mitochondrial function by NALL. We further find that NALL-mediated normalisation of lysosomal contact sites also correlates with restoration of autophagic flux and lysosome repair in NPC patient cells.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Using a phenotypic-based senescent cell screening assay, we identified fucoidans, a class of sulfated polysaccharides derived from brown algae and seaweed, as novel senotherapeutics. In particular, fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus (Fucoidan-FV) displayed potent senomorphic activity in different types of SnCs, reduced senescence in multiple tissues in aged mice, and extended healthspan in a mouse model of accelerated aging. Fucoidan-FV also enhanced the deacetylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation (mADPr) activity of SIRT6 and improved DNA repair and reduced senescence, in part, through SIRT6-dependent pathways. In addition, Fucoidan-FV downregulated genes associated with inflammation, Wnt signaling, and ECM remodeling pathways in SnCs and increased expression of genes involved with DNA repair.

Traditional motility assessment methods primarily focus on static velocity parameters, often overlooking temporal declines in motility during the sperm trajectory. Objective: We aimed to develop and validate a novel fatigue-based profiling approach to assess intra-trajectory motility decline in human spermatozoa. Methods: Using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA)-derived motion tracking data, we introduced the Fatigue Index, a metric quantifying the decline in forward progression over time. We performed descriptive and inferential analyses to examine motility patterns, complemented by multivariate dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. Results: Our analysis revealed significant intra-trajectory fatigue effects that traditional static parameters failed to capture. Fatigue-based profiling distinguished hidden subpopulations of sperm trajectories with distinct motility dynamics. The proposed Fatigue Index demonstrated robust consistency across samples and correlated with key kinematic features.

In this study, we identify Sjogren's syndrome nuclear autoantigen 1 (SSNA1) as a bona fide centriolar protein and a key regulator of ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. Using our newly developed knockout (KO)-validated antibody, we show that, contrary to previous reports, SSNA1 does not reside in the nucleus, midbody, or ciliary axoneme. Instead, super-resolution imaging combined with expansion microscopy (ExM) reveals that SSNA1 localizes to the distal lumen of centrioles and the basal bodies of both primary and motile cilia, where it is arranged in a ring-like configuration with 9-fold symmetry and apart from centriolar microtubules. Molecular dissection using tag-free SSNA1, its oligomerization-deficient mutants, and microtubule co-pelleting assays further demonstrates that SSNA1, previously described as a microtubule nucleator, stabilizer, and branching factor, does not bind microtubules in vitro. Interactor screening and KO analysis unveil a hierarchical targeting network involving a C2CD3-SSNA1-LRRCC1 axis in the distal lumen. Functional characterization indicates that although dispensable for cell division, overall centriole organization and duplication, SSNA1 promotes cilia assembly by facilitating CP110 removal. Our findings redefine the physiological role of SSNA1 as part of the distal luminal module contributing to ciliogenesis and provide new insights into the molecular architecture and functional relevance of the distal centriolar lumen.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

A key example is the formation of the posterior neural tube during the secondary neurulation, which requires precise morphogenetic events for de novo lumen formation. Although several studies have highlighted the role of autophagy in specific morphogenetic events, its involvement in epithelial organ development remains unclear. Autophagy operates via canonical and noncanonical pathways. Canonical autophagy is catabolic, requiring double-membrane autophagosomes and the full ATG protein set. Noncanonical autophagy, including the V-ATPase/ATG16L1-dependent Conjugation of ATG8 in Single Membranes (CASM), has both degradative and non-degradative roles and regulates different membrane trafficking processes. Using human neural tube organoids, spheroids, and tube micropatterns deficient in CASM or canonical autophagy, we show that CASM plays a pivotal role in epithelial tube morphogenesis. Specifically, the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 axis is essential for de novo lumen formation by regulating membrane junction remodeling and Rab11-dependent recycling pathways. These findings reveal distinct contributions of autophagy pathways in epithelial development, with potential implications for diseases linked to autophagy dysfunction.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we identify that the intracellular domain of Sidekick, known to localize to tricellular junctions and recruit mechanical force-generating myosin II, undergoes phase separation into condensates. This condensation controls the physiological localization and concentration of Sidekick on lipid membranes. Altering the molecular dynamics of these condensates disrupts Sidekick's localization against cellular movements, misdirecting myosin II and leading to delayed junction formation.

During anaphase I in C. elegans oocytes, chromosome segregation is coordinated with vesicle trafficking to support polar body extrusion and exocytosis of extracellular matrix material. Prior to anaphase, numerous outer kinetochore proteins localize to mysterious linear element structures throughout the cortex in addition to chromosomes, which has been observed in oocytes of multiple species. Linear elements initially form as puncta just before nuclear envelope breakdown and rapidly assemble into larger elongated structures. As linear elements grow, they form large clusters with secretory vesicles, initiating an elaborate transport mechanism that distributes vesicles throughout the cortex by anaphase I. Linear elements dynamically interact with microtubules and endoplasmic reticulum during this process. Microtubules are required for linear element assembly, motility, and clustering with vesicles. Knockdown of a plus end microtubule binding kinetochore component also inhibits linear element growth and vesicle clustering, but not the motility of linear element puncta. Depletion of several outer kinetochore proteins causes defects in extracellular matrix formation. Therefore, linear elements facilitate the microtubule-dependent transport of vesicles for their proper distribution in the cortex. We hypothesize that outer kinetochore complexes coordinate movements of chromosomes and cytoplasmic membranes to enhance the fidelity of cell division.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Rap2, a Ras GTPase family member, has previously been reported to localize to the lamellipodia as a result of Rab40/CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase induced tri-mono-ubiquitylation. However, how Rap2 functions and how mono-ubiquitylation targets Rap2 to the lamellipodia remained unclear.

Furthermore, using a variety of genetic and pharmacological techniques, we show that tri-mono-ubiquitylation is required for GEF-dependent Rap2 activation, a necessary step for Rap2 targeting to lamellipodia membrane.

Despite its strong association with insulin resistance and obesity, a notable proportion of lean individuals develop NAFLD, suggesting the involvement of additional factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a potential contributor, given its role in lipid homeostasis and the generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS). Methods In this study, we took advantage of the mtDNA mutator mouse model, characterized by oxidative phosphorylation deficiency due to accelerated accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, to investigate how mitochondrial dysfunction affects liver homeostasis triggering fat accumulation. Results We found that mitochondrial dysfunction induces liver steatosis and inflammation in this mouse model at a young age, independent of obesity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction alters the levels of multiple proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and inflammation. In vitro data show a shift in cellular metabolism toward the glycolytic pathway and confirm the upregulation of inflammatory genes. These changes are associated with oxidative stress and occur independently of mtDNA molecule release into the cytoplasm. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that liver steatosis might develop as result of mitochondrial dysfunction without obesity and insulin resistance, underscoring the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in NAFLD development in lean individuals and providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex metabolic disorder.

We demonstrate that the ageing-like inflammatory environment in tert mutant disrupts muSC migration, impairs activation and proliferation, and compromises regenerative capacity. We further show that sustained inflammation, mediated by persistent macrophage presence and elevated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity directly limits muSC recruitment and migration efficiency. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP9/13 activity and genetic depletion of macrophages partially restore muSC migratory behaviour and regenerative outcomes.

Protoneuromast formation is initiated by Fgf signaling at the trailing zone of the migrating primordium in response to Fgfs produced by Wnt active cells in a leading zone. Progressive restriction of an initially broad Wnt signaling domain to a smaller leading zone allows new Fgf signaling-dependent protoneuromasts to form in the wake of the shrinking Wnt system. We show Sox2 and Sox3 are expressed in nascent and maturing protoneuromasts in a trailing part of the primordium in a pattern that is complementary to Wnt activity in a leading domain, where Sox1a, is expressed. Together, these SoxB1 factors help inhibit Wnt signaling to determine effective maturation of trailing protoneuromasts and the timely deposition of stable neuromasts. Using dkk1b and atoh1b to monitor initiation and subsequent maturation of protoneuromasts, respectively, we show how Wnt signaling regulates the pace of protoneuromast maturation in the migrating primordium, and how its inhibition by SoxB1 family members ensures maturation and deposition of stable neuromasts. Together, our observations define three steps in the periodic formation of neuromasts: first, polarization of Wnt activity in the primordium; second, pattern forming step that determines periodic formation of protoneuromasts in the context of polarized Wnt activity; and third, inhibition of Wnt signaling, which is essential for stabilizing nascent neuromasts formed in the earlier pattern forming stage.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

However, our understanding of the dynamics of the metabolic rewiring especially at implantation remains rudimentary. In this study, we reconstruct the intracellular metabolite routings in pre- and post-implantation mouse embryos and during dynamic pluripotency transitions of cultured stem cells. Our findings reveal that, instead of a simple TCA cycle shutdown, there is a spatio-temporally programmed rewiring of the TCA cycle at implantation. Focusing on the spectrum of pluripotent cells, we identify pyruvate as a key metabolic nexus. Indeed, pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme activity establish cyclical carbon flow, which is essential for maintaining a balanced metabolic and transcriptional state and timely exit from naive pluripotency. Additionally, we discover that formative and primed pluripotent cells exhibit increased glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle, reduced oxidative TCA activity, and reciprocal reductive glutamine metabolism. This metabolic rewiring supports increased histone acetylation turnover, primarily using glutamine as a carbon source, supplemented by pyruvate cycling. Thus, we uncover diverse nutrient strategies that are functionally coupled to epigenome programming and dynamic pluripotency cell state transitions at the time of implantation.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Tissue formation is coordinated by cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signals across space and time, yet how self-limiting growth is controlled remains mysterious. Here, we leveraged the highly regenerative planarian Schmidtea mediterranea to identify molecular regulators of endogenous growth termination in adults, where unchecked growth can promote carcinogenesis. We identified the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway as a key regulator of body-wide regenerative growth through control of stem cell division symmetry. Following PCP pathway inhibition, widespread tissue hyperplasia occurred weeks after regeneration normally finishes. Importantly, this was due to progenitor expansion and depletion of adult tspan-1+ pluripotent stem cells capable of whole-body regeneration. Using transcriptional analysis of regenerating animals over time, we identified that control of stem cell fate by changes in cell division symmetry is a potential growth termination mechanism. While symmetric divisions maintain the stem cell pool in adult planaria, upon PCP loss, the number of asymmetrically dividing cells increases, driving stem cell depletion and excessive tissue differentiation. Our data suggest that PCP signaling regulates stem cell maintenance and fate decisions during self-limiting growth.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

B.; De la Puente-Leon, M.; Levy, M. Z.; Castillo-Neyra, R.", "abstract": "BackgroundDomestic dogs are known carriers of a variety of zoonotic pathogens significant to public health including leishmaniasis, echinococcosis, and, the most lethal, rabies. Control efforts for rabies and other diseases focus on the removal of infected individuals and mass treatment or vaccination to reduce incidence and raise immunity in the susceptible population. However, the complex population dynamics surrounding free-roaming dogs in many developing countries complicate these control methods. While rabies vaccination coverage of 70% or higher, of the dog population at risk, performed annually, should be sufficient to maintain coverage above the critical threshold, rapid population turnover and growth could reduce effective coverage. Our objective was to investigate the impact of dog population dynamics on rabies control activities in a rabies-endemic city.\n\nMethodologyUsing data from annual door-to-door surveys in urban and periurban areas, we collected household information (e.g., number of residents), respondent characteristics (e.g., education level), and dog-related data (e.g., vaccination status). These variables were analyzed to evaluate changes in the dog population and vaccination coverage. A compartmental Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Vaccinated (SEIV) mathematical model was utilized to estimate the effects of population dynamics on herd immunity against rabies.\n\nFindingsWe found that the highly dynamic dog population in Arequipa and its rapid expansion hampers herd immunity, counteracting the efforts made in yearly vaccination campaigns and leading to underestimates of the human to dog ratios ([~]4:1 vs 6:1). Moreover, there are significant differences in dog population trends within urban and periurban areas indicating that different strategies or coverage vaccination targets might be needed. This study also introduces an important variable of interest: transient dogs, a population with extremely high turnover (less than one year), which causes an important drop in vaccination coverage that has thus far gone undetected.\n\nConclusionsStabilizing the free-roaming domestic dog population by lowering both mortality and birth rates may help improve the efficacy of current mass vaccination programs. Additionally, the population dynamic parameters, on which we base our models, must be regularly refined to best represent the current status of disease risk and population immunity. By using a One Health approach we can understand and address the dynamics of dog populations, and better control zoonotic diseases like rabies, ultimately improving public health.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

C.; Abdelbaki, P. Y.; Fuess, L. E.", "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change has caused unprecedented declines across a number of marine taxa. Coral reef ecosystems, which are formed by scleractinian corals, face widespread declines in ecosystem health and function due to co-occurring environmental stressors. Frequent exposure of corals to a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors makes these cnidarians a prime candidate for investigating the effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems. In recent decades, hyperthermic bleaching events and disease outbreaks have been prominent stressors on reefs. Disease outbreaks often follow hyperthermic bleaching events, yet the mechanisms driving the diffuse associations between bleaching and disease are poorly understood. Here we investigated the mechanisms linking sequential bleaching and disease using the model cnidarian Exaiptasia diaphana. We examined the transcriptomic responses of anemones to immune challenge during acute recovery from prior heat stress. We observed notable upregulation of apoptotic pathways and downregulation of autophagic pathways in previously heat-stressed anemones, while anemones maintained at ambient temperatures displayed an inverse pattern characterized by downregulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, network analyses suggest that disruption of host-Symbiodiniaceae nutrient exchange during bleaching recovery of previously heat-stressed anemones may contribute to observed immune suppression following heat stress. These results provide insight regarding the cellular mechanisms facilitating increased disease susceptibility during recovery from heat stress, highlighting the roles of immunological regulation and nutrient availability in these processes.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Recently a family of structural stability approaches that determine the range of intrinsic growth rates compatible with system feasibility have been gaining popularity as a measure of how likely a community is able to persist in fluctuating conditions. This offers a theoretical basis for understanding and predicting the assembly and stability of complex multi-species communities from only interaction network structures. However, here I show that the high sensitivity of calculations of the feasibility domain, coupled with empirical uncertainties inherent in estimated interactions, are likely to preclude the approach's reliable application to empirical settings. Across four reanalyses of previous empirical demonstrations of the structural stability approach, more parsimonious explanations based on species connectance provide better explanations for patterns of community assembly or dynamic stability. Calculation of structural stability metrics therefore appears to lose, rather than synthesise, information embedded in empirical interaction matrices. This success of simpler measures is good news for the purposes of prediction and emphasises the value of multiple-competing hypotheses in validation tests to demonstrate value-added associated with new approaches.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic alterations, especially DNA methylation which affects gene expression, potentially mediate developmental condition effects on adult phenotype. We tested for such effects using captive zebra finches that were reared in either small or large broods, a manipulation that is known to have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Analyzing whole genome DNA methylation patterns in erythrocytes from 50 individuals sampled in adulthood, we found 0.8% of all CpG sites after filtering to be differentially methylated after correction for multiple testing. We identified 149 non-transiently differentially methylated sites (DMSs) where the DNA methylation difference between treatments was larger than 25%. These DMSs were located in 19 autosomal chromosomes, in or near genes involved in critical biological processes such as cell growth, division, and differentiation, regulation of immune response, muscle contraction, and neuronal signaling. These findings suggest that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation potentially mediate long-term effects of early-life adversity via differential gene expression, but follow-up studies are needed to identify the extent to which the observed DMSs are functionally related to the previously observed phenotypic effects.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

For both tasks, we trained bees to choose between two locations on each side of a computer screen and collect a reward bellow a full contrast target displayed on the screen. During detection task tests, the contrast of the target was varied and it could be preceded by a cue flashed on the side of the target, the opposite side of the screen or not flashed at all. The discrimination task tests were similar but with a full contrast target on one side and a variable contrast distractor on the opposite side of the screen. We tested if the presence of the flash influenced the orientation and choices of the bees as well as their contrast sensitivity as has been seen in primates.

Population genomics takes a 'bottom-up' approach, scanning the genome for molecular signatures of processes that drive or maintain divergence. However, interpreting the 'genomic landscape' of speciation is complicated, because genome scans conflate multiple processes, most of which are not informative about gene flow. However, studying replicated population contrasts, including multiple incidences of secondary contact, can strengthen inferences. In this paper, we use linked-read sequencing (haplotagging), FST scans, and genealogical methods to characterise the genomic landscape associated with replicate hybrid zone formation. We studied two flower colour varieties of the common snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus, that form form secondary hybrid zones in multiple independent valleys in the Pyrenees. Consistent with past work, we found very low differentiation at one well-studied zone (Planoles). However, at a second zone (Avallenet), we found stronger differentiation and greater heterogeneity, which we argue is due to differences in the amount of introgression following secondary contact. Topology weighting of genealogical trees identified loci where haplotype diversity was associated with the two snapdragon varieties. Two of the strongest associations were at previously identified flower colour loci: Flavia, that affects yellow pigmentation, and Rosea/Eluta, two linked loci that affect magenta pigmentation. Preliminary analysis of coalescence times provides additional evidence for selective sweeps at these loci and barriers to gene flow. Our study highlights the impact of demographic history on the differentiation landscape, emphasizing the need to distinguish between historical divergence and recent introgression.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

In nature, closely related \"good\" species are observed to possess multiple different barriers in their genomes that collectively generate strong and irreversible reproductive isolation (RI). Theorists hypothesize that early-stage mechanisms responsible for establishing an initial reproductive barrier differ from those driving the coupling of barriers in later stages of sympatric speciation. In a prior study, we developed a two-allele mathematical model of mating-bias traits to demonstrate how initial premating RI can arise in a sympatric population under disruptive ecological selection. Here, we extend this model to investigate how different pre- and post-mating barriers can couple with such an initial barrier and with one another during late-stage sympatric speciation to establish strong and irreversible RI. We developed computer applications to examine the properties of various barrier mechanisms and the conditions required for their invasion and coupling. Early-stage, adaptive premating barriers, driven by maladaptive hybrid loss, are effective in establishing initial RI and coupling with other barriers but are easily reversed if disruptive ecological selection weakens. Late-stage barriers, by contrast, often rely on earlier barriers to create an environment of reduced gene flow to facilitate their invasion and coupling. Mutations reducing hybrid viability are underdominant in inter-niche matings and can only invade by hitchhiking with barriers conferring a fitness advantage. Chromosomal inversions, an adaptive late-stage mechanism, can combine different barrier properties into a supergene and gain a net fitness advantage to invade and couple with other barriers to create strong and less reversible RI. Late-stage nonadaptive Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) barriers evolve more slowly but confer the strongest and least reversible RI. Our findings reveal a positive feedback loop in which early-stage barriers facilitate the establishment of late-stage barriers, while late-stage barriers strengthen and secure early-stage barriers. This positive reinforcement progressively strengthens overall RI until it becomes irreversible. By examining the properties and invasion dynamics of various barrier mechanisms, this study complements our previous study to propose a comprehensive process of sympatric speciation that explains how barriers emerge and couple to complete the speciation process.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

C.; Pal, M.", "abstract": "Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) masters cellular proteostasis under stress by upregulating the expression of molecular chaperones that help refold or degrade the misfolded proteins. HSF1 activation involves a monomer-to-oligomer transition and binding to its recognition sequence, the heat shock elements (HSEs) on its target gene promoters. HSF1 activity declines with age as well as in neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) such as Parkinson disease, highlighting the need for strategies to restore its function. Azadiradione (AZD), a limonoid isolated from Azadirachta indica seeds, directly activates HSF1 in cellular and preclinical ND models, unlike other small-molecule activators reported elsewhere. We investigated the molecular basis of AZD-mediated HSF1 activation using purified variants of this protein including those without its oligomerization and transactivation domain. Fluorescence polarization and dynamic light scattering assays revealed that AZD promotes the oligomerization of monomeric HSF1 to enhance its HSE-binding affinity by engaging with its DNA-binding domain (DBD). The oligomerization domain known to be required for stress-induced activation, appears redundant in AZD-mediated activation. Furthermore, evidence suggests AZD-induced conformational alterations in the HSE facilitate its binding to the HSF1 monomer. Notably, AZD reduces the DNA-binding ability of pre-assembled oligomeric HSF1 by triggering its amyloid-like aggregation. This finding also highlighted a potential anticancer effect of AZD, as cancer cells heavily depend on this HSF1 population for rapid proliferation and survival. Overall, these findings offer novel insights into the functional regulation of HSF1 and suggest a framework for developing small-molecule HSF1 activators with therapeutic potential for protein conformation disorders.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The range of interdomain distances and orientations (poses) of such domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) proteins can play an important role in protein function, allostery, aggregation, and the thermodynamics of binding. The CASP16 Conformational Ensembles Experiment included two challenges to predict the interdomain pose distribution of a Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) D-L-D construct, called ZLBT-C, in which two of SpA's five nearly identical domains are connected by either (1) a six-residue wild-type (WT) linker (KADNKF), or (2) an all-glycine (Gly6) linker. The wild-type linker has a highly conserved sequence and is thought to contribute to the energetic barrier for binding with host antibodies. Ground truth was provided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data on WT protein and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data on both proteins in solution. Twenty-five predictor groups submitted 35 sets of predicted conformational distributions, in the form of population-weighted finite ensembles of discrete structures. Unlike traditional CASP assessments that compare predicted atomic models to experimental atomic models, the accuracy of these predictions was assessed by back-calculating NMR RDCs and SAXS curves from each ensemble of atomic models and comparing these results to respective experimental data. Accuracy was also assessed by using kernelization to compare ensembles to the continuous orientational distributions optimally fit to experimental data. In our assessment, predictions spanned a wide range of accuracy, but none were close fits to the combined NMR and SAXS data. In addition, none were able to recapitulate the observed difference between WT and Gly6 proteins, as observed in the SAXS data.

SAM-AMP activates a trans-membrane effector of the CorA magnesium transporter family to provide anti-phage defence.

However, the heterogeneous acoustic properties of the skull often induce phase aberrations that shift the ultrasound focus and compromise energy delivery. In this study, we developed and validated a phase-reversal based aberration correction method to enhance the targeting specificity of tFUS using a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer. Individual head models were constructed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and corresponding pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) data to accurately represent subject-specific skull geometries and the targeted left V5 (V5L) region. Acoustic simulations were conducted with the k-Wave toolbox by first acquiring free-field pressure waveforms and then recording the aberrated waveforms in the presence of the skull. The phase differences between these conditions were used to compute corrective delays for each transducer element. Quantitative evaluation using metrics such as focal overlap with the target region, axial focal positioning, and the delivered ultrasound energy demonstrated significant improvements: the overlap volume increased by 98.70%, mean axial positioning errors were reduced by up to 14.36%, and energy delivery to the target improved by 17.58%. We further demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional ray-tracing methods. The results show that phase-reversal based aberration correction markedly increases the spatial targeting accuracy of tFUS and enhances the efficiency of focused ultrasound energy deposition for the customized random array transducer, paving a way for effective and personalized noninvasive neuromodulation therapies.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

However, existing switches achieve translocation through induced dimerization, requiring constitutive anchoring of one component into the target compartment and optimization of relative expression levels between the two components. We present a simpler, single-component strategy called Avidity-assisted targeting (Aviatar). Aviatar achieves translocation with only a single protein by converting low-affinity monomers into high-avidity assemblies through inducible clustering. We demonstrated the Aviatar concept and its generality using optogenetic clustering to drive translocation to the plasma membrane, endosomes, golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and microtubules using binding domains for lipids or endogenous proteins that were specific to those compartments. Aviatar recruitment regulated actin polymerization at the cell periphery and revealed compartment-specific signaling of receptor tyrosine kinase fusions associated with cancer. Finally, GFP-targeting Aviatar probes allowed inducible localization to any GFP-tagged target, including endogenously-tagged stress granule proteins. Aviatar is a straightforward platform that can be rapidly adapted to a broad array of targets without the need for their prior modification or disruption.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

While recent advances in tissue engineering have enabled the fabrication of meniscus-like grafts, these constructs do not fully replicate the zonal structure and composition of the native meniscus. In this study, we used fibrocartilage microtissues generated from meniscus progenitor cells (MPCs) as biological building blocks to biofabricate zonally defined meniscal grafts. MPCs isolated from the inner (iMPC) and outer (oMPC) regions of caprine menisci were used to engineer region-specific meniscal microtissues in a medium-high throughput manner. Both iMPC and oMPC derived microtissues were rich in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen, with iMPC microtissues staining more intensely for type II collagen. These microtissues were assembled into two different physically confining moulds (cylindrical and ring-shaped), where they rapidly fused and generated a fibrocartilaginous graft over six weeks of culture. Both iMPC and oMPC assembled microtissues were rich in sGAG and type I collagen, however only the iMPC assembled microtissues stained strongly for type II collagen. We then explored the impact of the catabolic enzyme chondroitinase-ABC (cABC) on the composition and structural organization of the meniscal grafts. This temporal enzymatic treatment increased collagen fiber thickness without altering tissue phenotype. Finally, iMPC and oMPC microtissues were spatially assembled to biofabricate a scaled-up and zonally defined meniscal graft. This graft was phenotypically similar to the native meniscus, with all regions rich in collagen type I and an inner core rich in collagen type II and sGAG. These findings support the use of MPC derived microtissues as biological building blocks for the engineering of zonally defined meniscal grafts.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

However, extending SCAPE to mesoscopic scales has been hindered by the limited tilting angle of the oblique illumination light sheet achievable with commercial low-magnification objectives. Here, we present a mesoscopic SCAPE microscope that overcomes this constraint by implementing a super-oblique light sheet--tilted up to ~60{degrees} relative to the optical axis of a 0.5-NA primary objective--enabled by an air-to-water bridging reflector. In addition, we introduce a single-galvanometer, self-conjugating rescanning strategy that allows arbitrary customization of the optical-to-mechanical angle ratio. This innovation accommodates the reversed and modulated scan displacement of the reflected light sheet and preserves descanned epi-fluorescence detection. Together, these advancements enable our mesoscopic SCAPE microscope to achieve a lateral FOV of 5.0 mm x 2.9 mm, cellular-level spatial resolution (~9.4 m x ~5.9 m lateral, and ~6.0 m axial), and a volumetric imaging rate of 9 volumes per second.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal that diffusivity in mucus is not solely determined by shape or functionalization alone, but by their interplay: while unmodified rods diffused poorly, their mobility increased significantly upon antibody functionalization, reaching a maximum at an intermediate ligand density.

This study explores the antifungal potential of curcumin nanosuspension (CNS) alone and in combination with azoles, emphasizing synergistic mechanisms to counter drug resistance. CNS substantially improved curcumin's aqueous solubility and enabled sustained in vitro release, overcoming its inherent bioavailability limitations. Checkerboard assays demonstrated synergistic interactions between CNS and fluconazole (FLC) against planktonic cells (FICI: 0.38-0.5) and early-stage C.albicans biofilms (FICI <0.5). Morphological analyses revealed that the combination suppressed hyphal formation and disrupted biofilm architecture--key virulence traits of C. albicans. Mechanistically, qPCR data indicated downregulation of adhesion-related genes (ALS1, ALS3, HWP1, EFG1), impairing fungal colonization. The synergy likely stems from dual mechanisms: facilitated FLC cellular uptake and inhibition of efflux pumps.

While exercise is a potential therapeutic strategy, the molecular response of skeletal muscle to exercise in CKD remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle 24 hours after aerobic (AE) or combined aerobic and resistance exercise (CE) in non-dialysis CKD. Methods This study utilised muscle biopsies from participants in the ExTRA CKD trial with stage 3b-4 CKDages 3b-4 (AE: 24 (15-32) ml/min/1.73m2; CE: 25 (19-31) ml/min/1.73m2). Participants (n=4 per group) were randomised to 12 weeks of thrice-weekly AE or CE. Vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at baseline and 24h after the first bout of exercise. RNA was extracted for Bulk RNA sequencing. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between baseline and post-exercise samples, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Results Following AE, 1480 genes were upregulated and 1554 downregulated. CE resulted in 556 upregulated and 115 downregulated genes. The most upregulated gene after AE was CHI3L1 (log2FC 10.7), followed by SAA2 and PTX3, all associated with inflammation. After CE, SFN (log2FC 6.8) and MT1A were among the most highly upregulated. Enrichment analysis showed strong activation of inflammatory and cellular senescence pathways, and downregulation of mitochondrial function-related processes, particularly after AE. Conclusion Both AE and CE triggered robust inflammatory gene expression responses in CKD skeletal muscle, indicative of early repair processes. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial-related pathways were downregulated, aligning with previous findings of impaired mitochondrial adaptation in CKD. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential barrier to effective exercise adaptation and a possible therapeutic target in this population.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Significant reduction in infarct propagation is observed when mechanical unloading is coupled with reperfusion, but little is known of the effect this reduction in wall stress and extracellular matrix with pLVADs have on the hearts regenerative capacity. Objective: This study investigates the effect coronary reperfusion coupled with mechanical unloading has on myocardial fibrosis, and the impact these changes in extracellular matrix have on the hearts regenerative potential. Methods: MI was induced by coronary artery ligation in Lewis rats. Hearts underwent permanent coronary ligation (AMI) or were reperfused after 90 minutes (AMI/R). In each group, hearts were either loaded (AMI-L or AMI/R-L) or unloaded (AMI-U or AMI/R-U). In the unloaded subgroup, the infarcted hearts were explanted after 90 minutes and transplanted into the abdomen of healthy recipients via heterotopic abdominal heart-lung transplantation. The recipient's heart acted as control. Hearts were analysed on day 7. Results: 30 hearts were studied. In the permanent ligation group, fibrosis increased in both the loaded and unloaded hearts with no significant rise in cardiomyocyte proliferation. After coronary reperfusion, there was a decrease in fibrosis with mechanical unloading and cardiomyocyte proliferation rose significantly (AMI/R-L vs AMI/R-U p= 0.0001). Cardiomyocyte proliferative rate in the loaded and unloaded hearts was 0.6%, and 3.7% respectively after permanent ligation, and 0.5%, and 10.4% respectively after coronary reperfusion.

Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) identifies individuals with obesity but a relatively preserved metabolic state. However, the criteria defining MHO remain inconsistent, and little is known about the gut microbiome (GM) features underlying this intermediate phenotype. Here, we aim to describe microbial structures contributing to metabolic health and disease. To do so, we analyzed the GM of 959 individuals classified as metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO), MHO, metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUNO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO), using stool shotgun metagenomics. MHO subjects display intermediate anthropometric and biochemical profiles, with a GM composition and diversity in an in-between state among MHNO and MUO individuals. Network science analyses reveal that metabolic health, rather than obesity, drives microbial connectivity: MHNO and MHO individuals harbor more robust and functionally cohesive microbial networks, whose most influential nodes are focused toward SCFA production. In contrast, MUO and MUNO communities exhibit a dysbiotic state with reduced connectivity and increased influence of low-abundance, ectopic and potentially pro-inflammatory species resulting in a damaged, unstable microbial community network. These findings suggest that metabolic disorders disrupt microbial ecology beyond compositional shifts, emphasizing the need for systems-level approaches.

To address this, we developed CS-Fold, a novel deep learning framework that integrates compensatory substitutions likelihoods as constraints using likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo algorithms. These likelihoods, representing evolutionary changes along phylogenetic trees, are encoded in a sparse matrix that guides the attention mechanism of a Pairformer-based architecture. A custom loss function and an unrolled post-processing algorithm enforce adherence to the solution space constrained by these evolutionary constraints.

Through comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of transgenic tobacco seedlings where long-stalked glandular trichome development was induced in aerial parts, we identified a suite of differentially expressed genes, including several transcription factors, shedding light on the early transcriptional cascade governing this developmental process. Moreover, through confocal live cell imaging of transcriptional reporter lines, interaction studies and DAP-seq assays, we confirmed the involvement of NtZFP8, a gene identified in our study, in long-stalked glandular trichome development. Our findings support a model in which NtZFP8 regulates a gene network essential for this developmental process. This study underscores the effectiveness of our approach in decoding the regulatory landscape of glandular trichome development in N. tabacum and provides a valuable framework for future functional investigations.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The zebrafish (Danio rerio), a key model organism, has been increasingly utilized in various fields, including medicine, genetics and environmental toxicology. This has led to a corresponding increase in demand for intelligent management and detection systems. However, traditional methods of fish disease detection may have irreversible effects on fish, particularly small species, and often fail to meet the precision, non-destructive warning, and real-time requirements for zebrafish detection. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method based on the YOLOv8 framework, designated ESC-YOLOv8-seg. This method significantly enhances the precision and speed of detecting surface abnormalities on small fish in complex settings by integrating the EMA the SPPELAN and C2f-Faster modules, and adding a detection head tailored for small targets. Furthermore, the integration of positional information and surface features enables the method to achieve real-time monitoring and non-destructive early warning of fish surface abnormalities. The proposed method enhances precision in small target detection and achieves high accuracy in discerning subtle differences among detection targets. In real aquaculture settings, it can reach an average speed of 106 FPS with a detection accuracy of 98%. Although this study has been designed to meet the specific needs of zebrafish scientific research, it is highly generalisable and can be applied to the real-time detection of underwater surface abnormalities in a range of fish species in aquaculture.

Intramolecular isopeptide bonds represent one such covalent interaction, yet their distribution across protein domains and organisms has been largely unexplored. Here, we sought to address this by employing a large-scale prediction of intramolecular isopeptide bonds in the AlphaFold database using the structural template-based software Isopeptor. Our findings reveal an extensive phyletic distribution in surface proteins resembling fibrillar adhesins and pilins. All identified intramolecular isopeptide bonds are found in two structurally distinct folds, CnaA-like or CnaB-like, from a relatively small set of related Pfam families, including ten novel families that we predict to contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds. One CnaA-like domain of unknown function, DUF11 (renamed here to \"CLIPPER\") is broadly distributed in cell-surface proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and archaea, and is structurally and biophysically characterised in this work. Using X-ray crystallography, we resolve a CLIPPER domain from a Gram-negative fibrillar adhesin that contains an intramolecular isopeptide bond and further demonstrate that it imparts thermostability and resistance to proteolysis. Our findings demonstrate the extensive distribution of intramolecular isopeptide bond-containing protein domains in nature, and structurally resolve the previously cryptic CLIPPER domain.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

These complexes are composed of transcription factors from the MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) families along with a tryptophan-aspartate repeat (WDR) scaffold protein (MBW complexes). The MYB member has been found to be the most pathway-specific component of the complex and modifications to these MYB genes are overrepresented in studies investigating the genetic basis of changes in pigmentation phenotypes across flowering plants. Here we investigated the orthologues of the MBW complex in a divergent lineage to understand its origin and evolution. We found evidence that these transcriptional complexes also form in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, indicating, together with an analysis of published gene family phylogenies, that they are ancestral to land plants. The activities of each of the two orthologous MYB genes, MpMYB14 and MpMYB02, both depend on the single orthologous bHLH gene, MpbHLH12. We could not assess the functional role of the WDR genes in M. polymorpha, due to low mutant recovery suspected to be caused by pleiotropic effects on viability. We propose that the two transcriptional complexes with alternative MYB paralogues in M. polymorpha represent an ancestral function, regulation of the flavonoid pathway, and a derived function, maturation of liverwort-specific oil bodies.

However, vesicle trafficking plays dual roles during pathogen infections. In plants, the endomembrane system mediates autophagic immune responses but can also be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate successful infections. In this study, we demonstrate that vesicle trafficking machinery acts as a double-edged sword during infection by the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSaV) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of eight genes encoding key vesicle trafficking regulators revealed contrasting outcomes. Silencing of NbSAR1 and NbAP-1{gamma} significantly increased systemic geminiviral DNA accumulation, whereas silencing of Nb{delta}-COP, NbARF1, and clathrin genes almost completely abolished infection. Notably, this inhibition is hypothesized to result from direct or indirect impairment in viral movement, as replication remained unaffected by gene silencing. Furthermore, the observed effects affect other geminiviruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and beet curly top virus (BCTV), but not unrelated pathogens such as the RNA potato virus X (PVX) or the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. These findings suggest that while the vacuolar and autophagy branches of the vesicle trafficking system might mediate antiviral autophagic defense responses, the integrity of endocytosis and retrograde transport is essential for systemic geminiviral infection.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

This threat is particularly acute for perennial crops, which may be cultivated for several decades. With the increasing use of new varieties carrying multiple major resistance loci, grapevine (Vitis spp.) represents a distinctive model to investigate the broad agreement that combining several resistance genes (pyramiding) enhances both resistance efficacy and durability. To this end, grapevine progenies segregating for four resistance loci against Plasmopara viticola (Rpvs) were used to evaluate the efficiency of single and pyramided major loci when confronted to naive and Rpv-breaking pathogen strains. In the context of polygenic resistance, both undefeated and defeated Rpvs provided significant quantitative effects. However, interactions between pyramided Rpvs were either beneficial, neutral or detrimental to the level of resistance, depending on the loci combination and pathogen strain. In particular, the fact that the presence of defeated resistance loci may compromise the resistance provided by functional major loci has important implications for crops resistance breeding. Thorough phenotypic investigations of pyramiding breeding schemes emerge as a critical step for the effective and durable management of genetic resistances and plant diseases.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The polyester constituting the delicate Arabidopsis root cap cuticle of the primary root has an atypical composition, containing unsubstituted very-long-chain fatty acids in addition to the oxygenated fatty acids typically found in cutin. The sn2-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases GPAT4 and GPAT8, which possess an active phosphatase domain, synthesize monoacylglycerols and are crucial for incorporating oxygenated fatty acids into the root cap cutin. Here, we show that the incorporation of very-long-chain fatty acids into cutin requires the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase GPAT2, which lacks an active phosphatase domain and produces lysophosphatidic acids. The GPAT2 knockout alters the properties of the root cap leading to increased mucilage deposition but lower barrier properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-chain CoA synthetase LACS2 is required solely for the incorporation of oxygenated fatty acids into cutin, similar to GPAT4 and GPAT8. Consequently, two largely non-redundant pathways contribute to root cap cuticle formation in the primary root: both the LACS2/GPAT4/GPAT8- and the GPAT2-dependent pathways contribute non-redundantly to its barrier and surface properties. LACS2 also plays an important role in the formation of the root cap cuticle in emerging lateral roots, whereas GPAT2 has a minor function in this process. These findings underscore the diverse mechanisms by which cuticle synthesis is fine-tuned across plant organs and developmental stages to achieve specialized barrier and surface properties.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

A key prerequisite is the feedback between auxin signaling and directional auxin transport, mediated by PIN transporters. Despite the developmental importance of canalization, the molecular components linking auxin perception to the regulation of PIN auxin transporters remain poorly understood. Here, we identify TOW, a novel and essential component of auxin canalization that links intracellular auxin signaling with cell surface auxin perception. TOW is regulated downstream of TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA-WRKY23 transcriptional auxin signaling. tow mutants exhibit defects in regeneration and de novo vasculature formation, along with impaired formation of polarized, PIN-expressing auxin channels. At the subcellular level, these mutants display disrupted auxin-induced PIN polarization and altered PIN endocytic trafficking dynamics. TOW localizes to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and predominantly to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with receptor-like kinases involved in auxin canalization, including the TMK1 auxin co-receptor and the CAMEL-CANAR complex.

Methods: Through single B cell sorting and RT-PCR, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated from a donor who experienced BA.5 or BF.7 breakthrough infection after three doses of inactivated vaccines. Their binding and neutralizing capacities were respectively measured with ELISA and pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Their epitopes were mapped by competition ELISA and site-directed mutation. Results: Among a total of 67 spike-specific mAbs cloned from the donor, four mAbs (KXD643, KXD652, KXD681, and KXD686) can neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from wild-type to KP.3. Moreover, KXD643, KXD652, and KXD681 belong to a clonotype encoded by IGHV5-51 and IGKV1-13, and recognize the cryptic and conserved RBD-8 epitope on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). In contrast, KXD686 is encoded by IGHV1-69 and IGKV3-20, and targets a conserved epitope (NTD Site iv) outside the antigenic supersite (NTD Site i) of the N-terminal domain (NTD). Notably, antibody cocktails containing these two groups of mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 more potently due to synergistic effects. In addition, bispecific antibodies derived from KXD643 and KXD686 demonstrate further improved neutralizing potency compared to antibody cocktails. Conclusions: These four mAbs can be developed as candidates of pan-SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapeutics through further antibody engineering.

Here, we presented a mechanism explaining how the two monovalent cations differently regulate TCR function. At rest, high intracellular K+ uncouples allosteric recruitment of ZAP-70, a key signaling module, to the TCR complex. The formation of antigen TCR complex induces K+ efflux, causing spontaneous recruitment of ZAP-70 to the TCR. Increasing extracellular K+ perturbs K+ efflux and slows ZAP-70 recruitment to the TCR complex, even upon antigen binding.

While TIRAP is traditionally associated with plasma membrane TLR signaling, recent evidence suggests it also contributes to signaling via endosomal TLRs. Here, we examined the role of TIRAP in TLR7/8 signaling using P7-Pen, a novel SLAMF1-derived peptide that disrupts the TIRAP-MyD88 interaction. In primary human monocytes and a whole blood model, P7-Pen inhibited TLR7- and TLR8-induced expression and secretion of IRF5-regulated cytokines IFN{beta}, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70, without effect on TNF or IL-6. Mechanistically, P7-Pen blocked TIRAP recruitment to the TLR8-MyD88 complex, leading to reduced late-stage IRAK1 activation, Akt and IKK/{beta} phosphorylation, and downstream IRF5 dimerization and nuclear translocation. Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus-induced cytokine production by P7-Pen was associated with reduced bacterial phagocytosis, impairing endosomal delivery of bacterial RNA. Notably, P7-Pen failed to inhibit murine TLR7 responses, which correlated with a lack of TIRAP recruitment to MyD88 in mouse macrophages following TLR7 ligand stimulation, highlighting species-specific differences in TLR signaling mechanisms. These findings support a noncanonical role for TIRAP in regulating IRF5-dependent signaling downstream of human TLR7 and TLR8, and demonstrate that selective disruption of TIRAP recruitment by a SLAMF1-derived peptide effectively attenuates IFN{beta} production. This strategy may hold therapeutic potential in diseases characterized by dysregulated type I IFN responses, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic infections.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The discovery of RNA interference, a gene-silencing mechanism, revolutionised the study of gene function. dsRNA has since been used in novel therapeutics and as an agricultural biocontrol alternative to chemical pesticides. Microbial production typically involves expression systems with convergent T7 promoters. However, convergent transcription from DNA-dependent RNA polymerases can lead to transcriptional interference. In this study, we designed multiple plasmid DNA constructs to investigate the effect of convergent and divergent T7 RNA polymerase production of dsRNA via in vitro transcription and in vivo in E. coli, prior to dsRNA yield quantification and analysis of product quality. We demonstrate that higher yields of larger dsRNA are typically obtained using convergent promoters during in vivo production. A typical fold increase of 2.1 was obtained for dsRNA > 400 bp. However, production of smaller dsRNA (< 250 bp) by divergent promoters resulted in increased yields (2.2 fold). Furthermore, our data demonstrates that in vitro transcription production of dsRNA using divergent T7 promoters results in significantly higher yields of dsRNA, with a maximum fold increase of 6.46. Finally, independent of size, we demonstrate that dsRNA synthesised from DNA templates with multiple transcriptional terminators, compared to run-off transcription, improved the quality and purity of dsRNA due to decreased formation of dsRNA multimers or aggregates.

In this work, controlled shockwave exposure was applied to adult hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs) and resultant alterations in nanomechanical, viscoelastic properties, cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation were examined. bTBI was induced using a custom-designed compression-driven shock tube, and cellular responses to single (overpressure magnitude: 14.5 psi or 100 kPa) and double shockwave exposures (overpressure magnitude: 29.0 psi or 200 kPa) applied in two different directions (from top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top) were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). We observed noticeable changes in cellular mechanics, especially when exposed to a double shockwave from bottom-to-top direction. These variations were characterized by a significant reduction in Youngs modulus, surface roughness, and viscosity. Shockwave exposure from bottom-to-top direction caused pronounced actin cytoskeletal disruptions compared to top-to-bottom direction. However, ICC results showed that cell viability remained high for both cases of shockwave exposures despite mechanical changes; although the population of oligodendrocytes and immature neurons displayed significant decreases after double shockwave exposure.

Here we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of a weak, constant uniform electric field of 4 mV/nm on the nanofibril structure of chitosan composed of 4 antiparallel sheets, each having 6 chains of 20 neutral glucosamine units. The simulations with an aggregate time of 21 microseconds demonstrated that under the electric field, the nanofibril becomes more ordered, while contracting in the sheet-stacking thickness. Analysis revealed that these effects are the result of the field-induced disruption of water-bridged intra- and inter-sheet hydrogen bonds, which expels water molecules from the fibril and at the same time stabilizes the intra- and inter-sheet hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a novel mechanism by which an electric field induces dewetting transitions between amphiphilic sheets, extending beyond the passive dewetting phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the theoretical community. The electric field-induced dewetting represents a novel approach for controlling the hydration state and microscopic structure of materials.

Here, we consider that in addition to providing structural stability and flexibility of proteins, hydrogen bonds inside the protein may act as conduits for long-range communication. To this end, we develop a computational framework that predicts allosteric sites and total allosteric network by analyzing correlations among hydrogen bond fluctuation from equilibrium molecular dynamics trajectory of apo state of proteins. We demonstrated that this method can accurately captures experimentally verified allosteric sites and suggest allosteric signal transduction pathways across three different proteins. Furthermore, since our predictions are derived solely from the simulation trajectory of the apo state, these findings reinforce the idea that the signature of allostery is inherently encoded in the apo state of the protein.

The development of orthogonal assays that are highly sensitive and can accelerate the hit-to-lead process is valuable. Limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a technique used to study changes in protein structure upon ligand binding. In LiP-MS, proteins are exposed to low concentrations of proteases under native conditions. The resulting proteolytic pattern is sensitive to protein structure at the cleavage site, which can change upon ligand binding. We characterized the interaction of small molecule inhibitors of the KRas G12D mutant oncoprotein by LiP-MS combined with molecular dynamics (MD). Intact mass spectrometry and top-down analysis were used to detect and identify KRas G12D cleavage products in the presence and absence of inhibitors, thereby locating the cleavage sites in the protein. Cleavage sites protected upon compound binding correlated well with the switch II binding site. The degree of cleavage depends on binding affinity and the presence of specific functional groups in the inhibitor structure.

Infection is critically dependent on the RSV fusion (F)-protein, which mediates fusion between the viral envelope and host cells, as well as fusion of infected cells with adjacent cells, resulting in syncytium formation. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in children younger than 5-years of age with acute respiratory infections, posing a high risk of bronchiolitis and severe pneumonia particularly in infants under 6-months of age. RSV is also recognized to cause a substantial health burden in older adults. Virus-triggered exacerbated inflammation is associated with severe RSV disease outcomes. Although several F-targeting vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are now available for prevention of RSV disease in infants and older adults in several countries, there is no effective specific drug treatment for RSV. Herein we show that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin has a remarkable antiviral activity against RSV, causing a decrease in infectious virus production in different types of human respiratory cells at low micromolar concentrations. Whereas the mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity against RSV remain to be elucidated, we found that indomethacin does not affect RSV adsorption or entry into host cells, but acts at postentry level interfering with F-protein expression.

Among them, virus-to-virus HGTs are recently recognized as an important mechanism for disseminating functional genes between giant viruses. In this study, we isolated a giant virus of a member of pandoraviruses, which have the largest genome sizes reaching 2.5 Mbp. Based on the average nucleotide identity of known pandoraviruses, this new pandoravirus belongs to an existing viral species. However, its genome was approximately 200 kbp larger than those of the other strains from the same species. A genome-wide comparison identified a 180-kbp region with 168 genes missing from the other strains but found in phylogenetically distant pandoraviruses. The GC ratio and homology of the deduced amino acid sequences in this 180-kbp region suggest that the new virus horizontally acquired this region from a distantly related pandoravirus. The gene composition in the 180-kbp region further indicates that this region was already large at the time of the horizontal transfer.

Interestingly, D. communis CCALA 463 showed a 3.5-fold improvement in growth in the large-scale photobioreactor as well as improved total fatty acid productivity. Eight of the ten microalgal strains used were capable of heterotrophic growth. Although specific growth rates were higher in heterotrophy, biomass productivity and total fatty acid productivity were lower than in the case of high light intensities of the autotrophic treatment.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

L.; Miller-Ensminger, T.; Lopez, A. H.; Mani, S.; Mainigi, M.; Hunter, C.; Jurado, K.", "abstract": "Congenital viral infections can have severe consequences for pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Remarkably, the fetal-derived placenta serves as a robust barrier to infection through meticulous regulation by immune effectors and a diverse repertoire of cytokines. Yet, the regulatory roles of many cytokines remain undefined at the maternal-fetal interface. Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a highly expressed cytokine in the placenta whose functional consequence during congenital infection is unknown. Here, we utilized trophoblast organoids (TO) derived from primary human placentas and a mouse model of congenital viral infection to uncover the functional role of IL-27 signaling during pregnancy. We show that TOs constitutively express IL-27 and its receptor, IL27RA, and demonstrate that IL-27 signaling restricts Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of TOs. Through bulk RNA-sequencing of TOs in the absence and presence of IL-27 signaling, we demonstrate IL-27-mediated upregulation of antiviral genes. Finally, we show that IL-27 signaling is critical within the context of congenital murine ZIKV infection, as IL-27 restricts placental ZIKV burdens and protects against pathologic fetal outcomes early in gestation. These findings collectively demonstrate a novel role for IL-27 in the placenta and establish IL-27 as an innate antiviral defense at the maternal-fetal interface during congenital viral infection.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The flax rust fungus Melampsora lini has been a model species for the genetic dissection of plant immunity since the 1940s, however the highly fragmented and incomplete reference genome has so far hindered progress in effector gene discovery. Here, we generate a fully-phased, chromosome-scale assembly of the two nuclear genomes of M. lini strain CH5, resolving an additional 320 Mbp of sequence compared to the previous short-read assembly. The 482 Mbp dikaryotic genome is at least 79% repetitive with a large proportion (~40%) of the genome comprised of young, highly similar transposable elements. The assembly resolves the known effector gene loci some of which carry complex duplications that were collapsed in the previous assembly. Using a genetic map followed by manual correction of gene models, we identify the AvrM3 and AvrN genes which encode unusually large fungal effector proteins and trigger defense responses when co-expressed with the corresponding resistance genes in Nicotiana tabacum. We locate the genes linked to the tetrapolar mating system on chromosomes 4 and 9, but in contrast to the cereal rusts which have one pheromone receptor gene per haplotype, in flax rust three pheromone receptor genes are found with two of them closely linked on one haplotype. Taken together, we show that a high-quality assembly is crucial for resolving complex gene loci and given the increasing number of fungal effectors of large size, the commonly applied criterion for effector candidates as being small proteins as needs to be reconsidered.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Hematogenous dissemination of HCMV to different organ sites is facilitated by peripheral blood monocytes. Circulating monocytes have a short lifespan due, in part, to their intrinsic biological programming to initiate caspase 8-mediated apoptosis upon entry into the circulation from the bone marrow. We previously reported that HCMV extends the lifespan of infected monocytes by blocking procaspase 8 cleavage, yet the precise viral mechanism responsible for suppressing caspase 8 activity remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that HCMV entry into monocytes rapidly increases the abundance of the antiapoptotic cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein long (cFLIPL), which prevents procaspase 8 cleavage into active caspase 8. However, others have demonstrated that inhibition of caspase 8 opens a \"trapdoor\" cell death response termed necroptosis. Accordingly, we found the increased levels of cFLIPL, along with a co-stimulatory signal from toll like receptor 3 (TLR3), activates the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) responsible for initiating necroptosis. Despite triggering of the necroptotic cascade within infected monocytes, the final execution of this death pathway is thwarted by nuclear sequestering of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL), the executioner of necroptosis. Together, our data reveal a multitude of countermeasures employed by HCMV to obstruct cellular antiviral death responses within infected monocytes.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

During the nematode's infection process, the presence of certain bacteria has been suggested to affect the pathogenicity and efficiency of the nematodes in killing slugs, though the potential roles of different bacteria in affecting host-infection by nematodes remains unclear. In this study, we examined three experimental P. hermaphrodita populations cultured with three different bacteria: 1) Escherichia coli (EC), 2) a newly isolated Pseudomonas sp. Strain (PS) that co-cultured with a P. hermaphrodita strain found in Oregon, USA, and 3) the original complex bacterial community (BC) associated with the nematode. For each of the three treatments, we evaluated the pathogenicity of P. hermaphrodita at a low and high concentration towards adult Deroceras reticulatum (Mollusca: Gastropoda) and investigated the changes in the nematode microbiome structure before and after slug infection. Slugs exposed to EC low treatments (LT50: 8.61 days) and EC high treatments (LT50: 7.74 days) survived significantly longer than slugs exposed to PS high (LT 50: 5.68 days) and BC high (LT50: 5.92 days). Slugs in the BC low treatment (LT50: 6.77 days) survived significantly longer when compared to BC high, but survival was significantly shorter when compared to EC high. We identified a wide variety of taxa components (82 genera) in the community associated with the nematode pre-infection, most of which are of low abundance. In all bacterial treatments post-infection, the number of genera almost quadrupled and those taxa's abundance changed remarkably, although the taxa with the highest abundance remained stable. We also observed four Pseudomonas amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that increased in abundance after slug infection in the Pseudomonas treatment, which may suggest a role of the taxa in the infection process.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we first identified that inulin can enhance the growth capacity of Lysinibacillus sphaericus HR92 and its ability to inhibit Ralstonia solanacearum. Further investigation revealed that inulin can enhance strain HR92's flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, fatty acid metabolism, and siderophore synthesis capabilities, ultimately improving strain HR92's effectiveness in controlling bacterial wilt. Moreover, adding inulin to the soil can enrich Pseudarthrobacter strains. This genus, together with inulin, promotes HR92's synthesis of butanediol and Surfactin while also competing with R. solanacearum for nutrients, thereby further inhibiting the occurrence of bacterial wilt disease. Additionally, the combination of inulin and Pseudarthrobacter strains upregulates the valine and leucine pathway genes in strain HR92. These genes play a crucial role in the synthesis of surfactin and the antimicrobial VOC 3-methyl-1-butanol.

This study investigated the volatilome of Streptomyces scabiei 87-22, the model species for causative agents of common scab in root and tuber crops, under culture conditions that completely inhibited fungal growth, including the phytopathogens Alternaria solani and Gibberella zeae. Bicameral assays confirmed that these inhibitory effects were at least partially mediated by VCs. Using GC x GC TOFMS, 36 VCs were unambiguously identified as products of S. scabiei 87-22 metabolic activity. These included mainly ketones and aromatic compounds (both benzene derivatives and heterocycles), along with smaller contributions from other chemical families including sulfur-containing compounds, nitriles, esters, terpenoids, an amide, and an aldehyde. A literature survey suggests that many of these VCs possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-oomycete, nematocidal, and insecticidal effects, while the bioactivity of others remains speculative, having been identified only within complex volatile mixtures. Among those with known antifungal properties, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-heptanone, and creosol inhibited the growth of the fungal pathogens tested in this study. In addition, we reveal here that 3-penten-2-one is also a strong inhibitor of fungal growth. Remarkably, despite S. scabiei 87-22 being defined as a pathogen, some of its VCs were associated with plant growth promotion and defense stimulation. Overall, our work highlights the remarkable potential of S. scabiei 87-22 to produce VCs with diverse bioactivities including fungal pathogen inhibition and priming plant resistance.\n\nImportanceThis study reveals that Streptomyces scabiei, the bacterium causing common scab in root and tuber crops, produces a wide variety of volatile chemicals with surprising benefits.

E.", "abstract": "Although viruses have been shown to infect all domains of life, our understanding of the genetic program behind the exploitation of host resources to produce progeny virions is thus far limited to several bacterial viruses. Therefore, to elucidate the transcriptome of euryarchaeal viruses and their hosts, we employed RNAseq analysis of samples taken at different time points from Haloferax gibbonsii LR2-5 cultures infected with the lytic model virus Haloferax Tailed Virus 1 (HFTV1). While following the transcription of viral genes throughout the infective life cycle, we observed a tight temporal regulation of viral transcripts as well as differential expression from within viral gene clusters. Furthermore, anti-sense RNAs (asRNAs) appear to play an important role in support of the timing of late-expressed viral genes. Therefore, with many differentially expressed transcripts, including intragenic transcripts and asRNAs, the regulatory machinery employed by HFTV1 contrasts with viral model systems (based on phages), in which antitermination and/or alternative polymerases (seemingly lacking in HFTV1) are more widespread. When looking into differentially expressed host genes, we observed a strong downregulation of genes involved in motility, such as the archaellum and chemotaxis machinery, which was confirmed with swimming assays of HFTV1 infected cells. This might be a strategy of the virus to redirect energy flowing into movement towards the production of virions. In conclusion, this work thus provides a stepping stone for further exploration of the intriguing strategies of viral transcriptional regulation of their infection cycle across the domains of life.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses infect members of all three domains of life, including Archaea. Euryarchaea are widespread microorganisms found in various environments such as the human gut and solar salterns. Due to the exceptional availability of cell biology and genetic tools of some salt-loving archaea, they are a model system to extrapolate from. Insights into the regulation of viral infections are of particular importance, especially since HFTV1, has been adopted as a model virus by the archaeal viral community.\n\nWe found that, while harboring parallels with bacterial viruses, such as tight temporal regulation, HFTV1 harbors an impressive number of differentially expressed transcriptional units. Furthermore, anti-sense RNAs and intragenic regulatory elements seem to play a much more prominent role in HFTV1 gene expression.

The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae has a diverse repertoire of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that control the intracellular cdG concentration depending on local environmental cues and its physiological state. Determining the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes and the respective environmental signals that control their activity is important to understand how and when V. cholerae switches between motile and sessile lifestyles in different environments. In some strains of the current V. cholerae 7th pandemic El Tor biotype, the horizontally acquired Vibrio Seventh Pandemic 2 (VSP-2) island encodes an uncharacterized PDE at the gene locus vc0515 which we named zpdA (Zinc-inhibited Phosphodiesterase-A). We show here that zpdA transcription is repressed by Zur when Zn2+ is abundant, as well as by the quorum sensing regulator HapR when cells grow to high density. Furthermore, we find that the PDE activity of the purified ZpdA protein is inhibited by Zn2+ but is dependent on alternative divalent cations such as Mn2+, which we find is elevated in V. cholerae cells grown under zinc limiting conditions. We conclude that ZpdA is an active metal-dependent PDE that is regulated by Zn2+ availability at both the level of transcription and post-translation leading to elevated cdG levels when Zn2+ is abundant.

Selecting appropriate challenge strains is a central design consideration in developing challenge model protocols. We describe the rationale, manufacture, and detailed characterisation of two STm strains used in the first-in-human NTS CHIM.   Two well-characterised STm strains were selected: 4/74 (ST19 lineage), a globally distributed diarrhoeal isolate, and D23580 (ST313 lineage 2.0), the predominant invasive pathovariant in Africa. These strains were selected based on phylogenetic relevance, antibiotic susceptibility, known provenance, and comprehensive existing virulence data. Manufacturing was conducted under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions, with confirmation of purity, viability, and stability. Phenotypic characterisation included growth profiling, motility, colony morphology, acid and buffer sensitivity, and antibiotic susceptibility. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed genetic stability. Additionally, we investigated the effect of sodium bicarbonate exposure - used for gastric acid neutralisation - on STm virulence gene expression using transcriptomic analysis.   Both strains retained expected in vitro phenotypic characteristics, including reduced motility and melibiose utilisation in D23580. Growth and viability were preserved in simulated gastrointestinal conditions and holding buffers. No unexpected mutations were detected, and both strains remained susceptible to study antibiotics. Transcriptomic profiling revealed no significant changes in key Salmonella pathogenicity island genes after sodium bicarbonate exposure, suggesting unaltered virulence at administration.   These findings confirm that STm 4/74 and D23580 retain genomic and phenotypic integrity post-manufacture.

Emerging data demonstrate clinical activity, including tumor regressions, in patients with RAS driven cancers. Despite being promising therapeutic interventions, the mechanisms of resistance in patients treated with these inhibitors remain unknown. Here we studied matched baseline and post-progression specimens from patients treated with the RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor daraxonrasib (RMC-6236). Tissue or cell-free DNA specimens were collected from 40 patients with RAS-mutant non-small cell lung, colorectal, or other cancers. Eighteen patients (45%) were found to have acquired alterations in RAS signaling intermediates, including recurrent alterations in KRAS, BRAF, RAF1, MAP2K1/2 and PIK3CA. Preclinical resistance models mirrored the alterations observed in patients. We found that secondary KRAS Y64X mutations caused resistance by disrupting an important pi-pi interaction between KRAS and the indole ring of daraxonrasib, which lowers the affinity of the daraxonrasib:CYPA binary complex for active KRAS. We also identified kinase-dead and low-activity BRAF mutations in samples with acquired resistance. This is puzzling, because TCIs are expected to prevent the interaction between RAS and BRAF, which is needed for hypoactive mutants to dimerize and signal. We now show that RAF dimers are harder to displace from active RAS, as compared to their monomeric forms. Indeed, enhanced RAF dimerization attenuated the ability of TCIs to recruit CYPA to active RAS, resulting in diminished inhibition of oncogenic signaling and tumor growth. Thus, several clinical resistance alterations converge at attenuating the formation of the RAS:daraxonrasib:CYPA tri-complex, either by preventing daraxonrasib binding or by inducing RAF dimers.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

This study tested the hypothesis that adipocytes contribute to an imbalanced tumour-microenvironment by exposing cancer cells to elevated oxysterols, mimicking chemotherapy-exposure conditions and priming for chemoresistance.\n\nMethodsTumour tissue microarray from 148 TNBC patients was assessed using immunohistochemistry for expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1 and P-glycoprotein, and survival outcomes assessed. Gene expression was compared between tumours from patients and mouse models with high versus low adiposity. In vitro, cells of the tumour-microenvironment were evaluated for oxysterol content, secretion, expression of relevant enzymes, and their ability to induce P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance in TNBC cells.\n\nResultsIn patients, expression of oxysterol-synthesizing enzymes in stroma correlated with P-glycoprotein expression in cancer epithelial cells and was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Adipocytes conditioned media contained significantly higher oxysterols levels than that conditioned by other cell types and induced P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance in MDA.MB.468 cells. Obese mice had elevated levels of P-glycoprotein in tumours compared to lean counterparts.\n\nConclusionsAdipocytes secrete oxysterols that promote drug resistance in vitro and correlate with oxysterol:Pgp axis and survival in vivo.\n\nSignificanceThis study reveals a mechanism by which adipose tissue contributes to drug resistance in ER-negative breast cancers, identifying the oxysterol-Pgp axis as potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

The LTL331 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model consistently progresses to NEPC following castration, mimicking clinical responses to androgen-deprivation therapy. Here we tracked NEtD using longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) across eight time points in LTL331 from pre- to post-castration. Castration led to the loss of AR-high PRAD cells, expansion of AR-low populations, and emergence of an AR- and NE-negative (AR-/NE-) intermediate state that transitioned into NEPC. We delineate a model in which pre-EMT cells enriched in ciliogenesis and cell-adhesion pathways differentiate into EMT-like populations before branching into distinct ASCL1+ and ASCL1- NEPC states. The EMT-enriched intermediate, marked by progenitor and neural crest stem-cell genes, acts as a transition bridge, suggesting EMT-associated stemness underlies lineage plasticity. A terminal ASCL1- NEPC state also suggests that ASCL1 is not essential for NEPC maintenance. Gene regulatory analysis highlighted key regulators driving NEtD, including MSX1 and ASCL1 in early EMT-like and NEPC states, respectively. These transcriptional states were validated in both patient-derived bulk and scRNA-seq data. Our findings offer insights into intervention strategies to delay or prevent NEtD with the potential of identifying novel prognostic and therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Its poor prognosis is driven by therapy-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), which are challenging to study in traditional preclinical models. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate tumor-related pathways by repressing oncogenic gene expression, a function lost in cancer. We assessed the therapeutic potential of miRNA restoration in human MB from distinct subgroups, validated in a xenotransplant model using wild-type (WT) mouse embryos. Multi-omics, imaging, and in silico analyses were employed to identify underlying mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Human MB cells formed tumors in embryonic mouse brains that mirrored key MB features, including vascularized CSC niches and metastases. Restoration of underexpressed miRNAs reduced tumor growth and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. These miRNAs synergistically repressed gene networks related to cell adhesion and RNA metabolism, shared oncogenic pathways across MB subgroups. Our embryonic xenotransplant model provides a clinically relevant platform for evaluating next-generation gene therapies in pediatric brain cancer.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Its expression is downregulated in a subgroup of medulloblastomas driven by constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Patients with SHH-driven medulloblastomas with elevated expression of the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) and reduced expression of USP37 have poor outcomes. In previous studies, we showed sustained proliferation of SHH-medulloblastoma cells due to blockade of terminal cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation stemming from a failure in USP37-dependent stabilization of its target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI)-p27. This finding suggested a tumor suppressive function for USP37. Interestingly, the current study also uncovered Raptor, a component of the mTORC1 complex, as a novel target of USP37. Under conditions of low-USP37 expression, reduced Raptor stability and mTORC1 activity caused a decline in phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and increased its interaction with eukaryotic elongation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is known to inhibit CAP-dependent translation initiation. Surprisingly, a subset of patients with SHH-driven medulloblastomas with elevated expression of USP37 and the Glioma associated Oncogene 1 (GLI1), also exhibited poor outcomes. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, we showed that USP37-mediated stabilization of GLI1, a terminal effector of SHH signaling, increases pathway activity and upregulates expression of its target oncogene products, NMYC and CCND1, to drive cell proliferation. These data indicate that USP37 elevation in SHH-driven medulloblastomas has the potential to promote non-canonical activation of SHH signaling. Overall, our findings suggest that USP37 may have context-specific oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in medulloblastoma cells.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

Both demonstrate MYB proto-oncogene upregulation, but HMSC lacks the MYB translocation typically seen in ACC. Transcriptional changes in HMSC tumors remain uncharacterized. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a human HMSC tumor and compared expression profiles with published ACC and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) scRNA-seq datasets. Primary malignant cells from HMSC (n=134) and ACC (n=980) clustered separately, and HMSC lacked bicellular differentiation into luminal and myoepithelial cells, distinguishing it from ACC. A greater proportion of HMSC cells expressing HPV-related genes (HPVon) expressed MYB (83% vs. 62%, p=0.022) and MYB targets (p=6.4x10-6), suggesting an HPV-MYB association. This finding was validated in HPV-positive OPSCC, with 7/10 tumors showing MYB upregulation in HPVon versus HPVoff cells (p<0.05). A 264-gene signature from HPVon HMSC cells was also associated with worse prognosis in HPV+ OPSCC (p<0.003), suggesting an alternate role for HPV that has not been well characterized. Further validation of the HPV-MYB association and prognostically relevant HPV gene signature may improve patient stratification and therapeutic strategies in HPV-related malignancies.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

In recent years, the TME has been profiled at an unprecedented level of detail by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on patient samples. However, from patient samples, studying the temporal dynamics of the TME using patient samples has been challenging. Interrogating the temporal dynamics of the TME is critical to understand how inter-tumor heterogeneity is organized into a temporally ordered sequence of causes and consequences in cellular events. Here we survey the temporal dynamics of the TME by performing longitudinal scRNAseq on mouse breast tumors at different progression time points of tumor progression. We reveal multi-cellular phenotypic dynamics that follow one out of three possible temporal patterns: stable colonization, wave-like, or progressive increase. In particular, IFN-responsive cancer cells, GzmB + cytotoxic T cells, as well as C1q macrophages, progressively increase in parallel with tumors progression. These findings establish the single-cell types and phenotypes in a progressing breast tumor, and determine when these cellular players enter and leave the TME.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

K.; Saddawi-Konefka, R.; Salanga, C.; Schokrpur, S.; Gutkind, J. S. K.; Handel, T. M.", "abstract": "The immune-suppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has limited the impact of immune checkpoint blockade in many cancers, often by restricting the infiltration and activation of anti-tumoral CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and NK cells. Here, we utilized murine models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and demonstrated that intratumoral (IT) delivery of CXCL10 drives tumor elimination and inhibits recurrence. CD8+ T cells recruited to tumors display enhanced activation, increased tumor antigen specificity, and decreased markers of T cell exhaustion, indicating that CXCL10 not only directs cell migration, but also enhances T cell effector functions. Despite delivery of CXCL10 into tumors, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells also show enhanced presence and proliferation in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs), consistent with antigen presentation and trafficking of these cells between tumors and TdLNs. CXCL10 also stunts angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis within the TME, which likely contributes to its antitumoral effects. Finally, enhanced tumor clearance was observed by combining IT CXCL10 and anti-PD-1. Together, these findings provide the rationale for the clinical evaluation of CXCL10 as a strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}

This transcriptional block triggers a coordinated stress response involving transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), removal and degradation of the stalled RNAPII, and global transcriptional shutdown. However, the molecular and cellular consequences of RNAPII bypassing such lesions remain unclear. Here, we identify the acetyltransferase p300 as a key regulator of this transcriptional stress response. p300 interacts with stalled RNAPII and promotes its removal and degradation through a USP7-dependent mechanism. Remarkably, in p300-deficient cells, RNAPII bypasses DNA lesions, allowing transcription to persist despite DNA damage and leading to the production of full-length mRNAs. This sustained transcriptional activity without DNA lesion repair results in increased genome instability and reduced cellular proliferation capacity. These findings reveal the biological consequences of transcribing through transcription-blocking lesions.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": ""}
