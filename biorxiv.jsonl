The conserved heat shock protein Hsp70 is a key regulator of tumour survival, yet its control mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila wing epithelium, we show that lgl[4]; yki[OE] MARCM clones developing into malignant tumours exhibit spatio-temporal Hsp70 elevation, correlating with clonal overgrowth and invasion. This upregulation is independent of canonical stress regulators HSF and Hif1alpha, instead driven by ROS-induced JNK activation, which triggers dFOXO-mediated Hsp70 expression. Disruption of Nox or JNK signaling suppressed Hsp70 induction and tumour expansion, revealing a redox-dependent, non-canonical regulatory axis. These findings identify Hsp70 as a dynamic effector of the ROS-JNK-FOXO axis in neoplastic transformation. The atypical regulation of Hsp70 underscores its role in tumour fitness and heterogeneity, with broader implications for understanding stress adaptation in epithelial carcinomas.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a new algorithmic paradigm based on approximate message passing, gVAMP, for identifying DNA sequence variants associated with complex traits and common diseases in large-scale whole genome sequence (WGS) data. We show that gVAMP accurately localizes associations to variants with the correct frequency and position in the DNA, outperforming existing fine-mapping methods in selecting the appropriate genetic variants within WGS data. We then apply gVAMP to jointly model the relationship of tens of millions of WGS variants with human height in hundreds of thousands of UK Biobank individuals. We identify 59 rare variants and gene burden scores alongside many hundreds of DNA regions containing common variant associations, and show that understanding the genetic basis of complex traits will require the joint analysis of hundreds of millions of variables measured on millions of people. The polygenic risk scores obtained from gVAMP have high accuracy (including a prediction accuracy of ~46% for human height) and outperform current methods for downstream tasks such as mixed linear model association testing across 13 UK Biobank traits.

In addition, they contribute to the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, DNA replication, and other processes. We propose a novel classification of prokaryotic MTases that addresses a longstanding deficiency in the previous classification scheme developed by Malone and Bujnicki. The latter classification, which grouped MTases into categories such as , {beta}, {gamma}, etc., has been in use for over 20 years. Our approach involves identifying 6 classes of MTases based on the 3D topology of the catalytic domain. This was achieved by analyzing the available 3D structures and certain predicted 3D structures of MTases from the AlfaFold database. The catalytic domains of each class of MTase exhibit homology not only in structure but also in conserved motifs. To develop this classification algorithm, we utilized a set of MTases from the gold standard REBASE database. Our new classification system facilitates the recovery of MTase evolution and MTase annotations in both existing and new sequence data sets. This is particularly important for understanding the complex relationships between MTases and their roles in various biological processes.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterized genetic diversity of the widespread genus Acropora by building a genomic database of 595 coral samples from different oceanic regions-from the Great Barrier Reef to the Persian Gulf. Through genome-environment associations, we found that different Acropora species showed parallel evolutionary signals of heat-adaptation in the same genomic regions, pointing to genes associated with molecular heat shock responses and symbiosis. We then projected the present and the predicted future distribution of heat-adapted genotypes across reefs worldwide. Reefs projected with low frequency of heat-adapted genotypes display higher rates of Acropora decline, indicating a potential genomic vulnerability to heat exposure. Our projections also suggest a transition where heat-adapted genotypes will spread at least until 2040. However, this transition will likely involve mass mortality of entire non-adapted populations and a consequent erosion of Acropora genetic diversity. This genetic diversity loss could hinder the capacity of Acropora to adapt to the more extreme heatwaves projected beyond 2040.

While traditional models emphasize protein function or cross-species conservation, we propose that intra-genomic patterns of oligonucleotide (k-mer) frequencies also reflect selective forces. To explore this, we developed kGain score, a metric that quantifies the frequency shift of a k-mer upon single-nucleotide substitution, using the surrounding genomic context as a baseline. We hypothesize that variants arising in high-kGain contexts are more likely to persist due to evolutionary favorability. We validated this hypothesis across multiple systems. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae long-term evolution experiments, we found that fixed, essential, and parallel mutations consistently show elevated kGain scores. This trend held in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and in an in-house antibiotic adaptation experiment, where a high-kGain fusA Y515N mutation conferred resistance and maintained fitness when overexpressed, demonstrating a causal link between kGain and adaptive potential. To enable cross-species generalization, we trained a transformer-based neural network regressor on LTEE-derived mutations to predict kGain from sequence alone. The model achieved high correlation in held-out in-domain data (Pearson r = 0.81) and accurately predicted kGain trends in out-of-domain data (Pearson r = 0.82), demonstrating that k-mer-based sequence constraints learned from one genome can be effectively transferred to others. Together, our results establish kGain as a biologically meaningful, scalable metric for probing within-genome sequence selection, offering a complementary lens to existing conservation-based frameworks for understanding evolutionary fitness and variant persistence.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show: i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality.

It forms part of a multiprotein complex that has bipartite DNA binding through heterodimeric bHLH and GATA proteins. To determine if degradation of LMO2 in the context of T-ALL has therapeutic potential, a chimaeric intracellular antibody has been developed fusing an anti-LMO2 single domain variable region with one of three E3 ligases to create biodegraders. The intracellular binary interaction of these biodegraders with LMO2 leads to its proteosomal degradation but, in addition, concomitant loss of bHLH proteins that associate with LMO2 in the DNA-binding complex. Chemical compound surrogates of the intracellular antibody paratope (called Abd compounds) have been modified to create proteolysis targeting chimaeras (PROTACs) for orthogonal assays of effects of LMO2 degradation. These form a ternary complex with LMO2 and E3 ligase in leukaemia cells that induces degradation of LMO2, and is also accompanied by loss of associated bHLH proteins. This is accompanied by T-ALL growth inhibition, alterations in proteins involved in cell cycling and instigation of apoptosis. These effects do not occur in the absence of LMO2.

Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in a difficult task. This difference in performance was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as higher lick bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding of the difficult task in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices.

The plant that the mosquitoes fed on affected their longevity (which ranged from an average of 8.2 days when they fed on C. papaya to 21.1 days when they fed on M. coromandelianum), and the mosquitoes took larger meals (in a separate experiment) from the plants that gave a longer life.

Some theories propose that remapping helps to minimize interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others link it to shifts in an underlying latent state representation. However, how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with, remains unclear. To unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping, we here adopt a neural coding and population geometry perspective. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce remapping: (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability in the null space of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature.

J.; Neftci, E.; Sommer, F. T.; Renner, A.", "abstract": "Spatial navigation relies on the head-direction (HD) system, which integrates angular head velocity (AHV) to track orientation. Since integration accumulates drift over time, visual landmarks provide corrective cues. However, such sensory cues are perceived egocentrically and must therefore be transformed into allocentric coordinates. The parallax effect, where nearby objects appear to shift more than distant ones during movement, should lead to a systematic position-dependent HD error unless there is a correction mechanism. How the HD system solves this problem remained an open question. Here, we analyzed postsubicular HD cell activity in mice navigating in a restricted environment with a single visual cue. We discovered a systematic parallax bias in the decoded HD, indicating that the HD system misinterprets the cue's position depending on the viewing angle. The observed error was smaller than predicted by a pure vision model, which can be explained by the combination of AHV integration with simple visual anchoring. In less restricted experimental settings with multiple cues available, the parallax effect is drastically decreased. These experimental findings indicate that the HD system does not actively correct for parallax in a position-dependent manner, but instead relies on a simple cue anchoring mechanism for the transformation of the egocentrically observed cues into an allocentric reference frame. The use of AHV integration and multiple cues is sufficient to account for parallax and produce a stable HD signal for spatial navigation. This sheds light on the mechanisms of ego-to-allocentric transformation in neural systems, which is crucial for the formation of the cognitive map. Furthermore, it highlights a fundamental trade-off in neural coding between computational efficiency and positional accuracy, with implications for biological and artificial navigation systems.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Electrophysiologically, three distinct auditory responses onset, change, and offset were evoked; both the onset and change responses were attenuated during walking, with the most pronounced effect observed for the cognitively demanding change response. Notably, this modulation was further amplified for the change response during active engagement compared to passive listening, implicating attentional resource allocation. Strikingly, both behavioral performance and change-related neural responses fluctuated rhythmically with the gait cycle, while onset and offset responses remained comparatively stable. Together, these findings reveal a stride-phase-dependent gating mechanism that selectively modulates perceptually relevant auditory signals, illustrating how the brain rhythmically reallocates sensory resources to optimize perception during locomotion.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

C.; Boyer, F.; David, J.-P.", "abstract": "The resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides is a valuable model system for studying the genetic bases of xenobiotic adaptation in insects. The spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus combined to the massive use of pyrethroid insecticides to limit arbovirus transmission resulted in the rise of resistance in various continents. Here, we investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying the recent adaptation of this mosquito to deltamethrin in La Reunion island. Bioassays confirmed the presence of resistance alleles in field populations. The resistance phenotype was further enhanced in the laboratory following a few generations of controlled selection. Combining whole genome Pool-seq and RNA-seq revealed no evidence of target-site resistance mutations but the over-expression and variant selection of detoxification enzymes associated with pyrethroid metabolism including cytochrome P450s, transferases and ABC-transporters. Among over-expressed detoxification genes, only one was linked to a gene duplication while polymorphism data suggest most of them being trans-regulated. Genome-wide selection signatures revealed a 9 Mb inverted superlocus responding to insecticide selection whose phenotypical importance remains uncertain. Altogether, this study indicates that the multigenic metabolic resistance phenotype observed in this insular territory mainly results from local adaptation. From an applied perspective, this study provides a set of markers to track pyrethroid resistance in the tiger mosquito in the South-West Indian Ocean. As this region is subjected to recurrent arbovirus outbreaks, the additive resistance phenotype that may arise from the introduction of Kdr mutations from other territories also calls for improving resistance surveillance at the regional scale.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile novel vector control strategies are being developed, chemical insecticides remain widely used to control mosquitoes transmitting human diseases such as the Asian tiger mosquito. However, the recurrent use of insecticides resulted in the emergence of resistance which can ultimately affect vector control efficacy. Here, we investigate the genetic bases underlying the resistance of the Asian tiger mosquito to the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin in La Reunion island. By combining two complementary genomic approaches, we showed that resistance is mainly caused by an increased insecticide detoxification while classical  Knock down resistance mutations affecting the target of the insecticide were not detected. We also showed that resistance is underlain by multiple genetic changes spread across the genome, supporting the local selection of resistance rather than the introduction of resistance alleles. Furthermore, we identified a large inverted supergene responding to insecticide selection. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic bases of insecticide resistance, enabling the implementation of molecular makers to improve the tracking of insecticide resistance in this major mosquito vector across the Indian Ocean.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

In particular, the hemispheric contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) remain unresolved. Here, we applied inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC in 95 healthy adults during a probabilistic sequence learning task. We found that inhibiting the right and bilateral DLPFC significantly enhanced statistical learning compared to sham and left DLPFC stimulation. Contrary to the hypothesis that this competition is mediated by the suppression of existing knowledge, episodic memory performance was unaffected across all stimulation groups. These findings challenge a direct episodic gating mechanism and suggest the DLPFCs influence on statistical learning is hemisphere-dependent. As an alternative, we propose that right DLPFC inhibition shifts cognitive processing toward a more exploratory information-sampling strategy, a view supported by our finding of significantly greater reaction time variability in the right and bilateral stimulation groups. Together, our results provide causal evidence for a right-lateralized suppressive influence of the DLPFC on unsupervised learning and suggest its modulatory role is linked to information processing style rather than direct competition with episodic memory systems.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

We addressed this by comparing prefrontal encoding during successful adaptation vs. maladaptive perseveration. Specifically, we studied mutant (Dlx5/6+/-) mice, which have dysfunctional parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons and perseverate in a rule shifting task. We measured mPFC activity patterns using microendoscopic calcium imaging, then used linear classifiers and neural networks to compare representational geometries in wild-type mice and Dlx5/6+/- mutants before, during, and after benzodiazepine treatment, which persistently rescues their rule shift learning. The encoding of correct vs. incorrect trial outcomes rapidly shifts as mice successfully learn new cue-reward associations, but becomes more stable when mutant mice perseverate. We also find activity patterns that normally distinguish learning of the initial association vs. rule shift, but become diminished during perseveration. Finally, during perseveration, outdated representations are inappropriately reinstated, not just passively maintained. These results reveal prefrontal contributions to flexible behavior driven by the dynamic reorganization of abstract rule representations, rather than stable reinforcement signals.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Gene expression analysis revealed that the Dri1-Rhs1 and Ccr4-Not complexes negatively regulate a set of genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis (Ribi genes). Loss of the Dri1-Rhs1 complex results in the augmented expression of Ribi genes, thereby suppressing the accumulation of 80S monosomes and the growth inhibition under high-temperature conditions.

T.", "abstract": "A major challenge in understanding Alzheimer's disease is linking changes that occur across different biological scales. For example, how do changes in individual neurons build into widespread network disruptions? To address this, we used flexible mesh electronics to record neuronal activity for six months in ThyTau22 mice, a model of tauopathy that accumulates mutant human tau with age. Electrophysiology was recorded simultaneously from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of awake, behaving mice. At all ages we observed neuron-level, tau-driven silencing including ages without detectable tangles or cell-death. We found an unexpected phenomenon: neurons silenced by tau spontaneously recover individual firing patterns, yet these neurons fail to regain normal network interactions. Thus, as the animals age, disrupted network-level activity emerges. Specifically, we observe a global decrease in excitatory interactions and a breakdown in gamma-band coherence, which is particularly disrupted between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These observations reveal a temporal relationship between neuronal silencing and impaired network connectivity, which also contributes to a progressive disruption in the excitatory/inhibitory balance. This ultimately disconnects viable entorhinal-hippocampal connections, physiologically isolating the hippocampus. Importantly, this network dysfunction is not driven by neuron loss, but by the failure of neurons to re-establish proper network interactions after silencing. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant tau can destabilize neural systems. Further, these experiments indicate that a therapeutic window may exist where neuronal function and network activity might still be restored prior to irreversible degeneration.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, eight novel lytic tailed phages were isolated from wastewater samples, including three jumbophages, which are the first known to infect this pathovar. These jumbophages define a new viral genus and exhibit distinct biological characteristics, including broader host ranges, but lower burst sizes and slower lytic cycles compared to the smaller-genome phages. Together, the newly isolated phages exhibited lytic activity against nearly all X. hortorum pv. vitians strains tested while remaining highly specific to the pathovar. Genomic analyses revealed strictly lytic profiles, and absence of virulence or resistance genes, supporting their biosafety for agricultural use. Furthermore, the isolation of a phage infecting a bacterial mutant previously shown to be resistant to the virulent phage {Phi}Xhv-1 highlights the potential for designing robust phage cocktails to mitigate resistance emergence.

Although diabetes mellitus patients are reported to be under oxidative stress because of prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia, the influence of glycemic control in diabetes on enhanced free-radical activity is poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation and catalase, an antioxidant enzyme in T2DM patients with good and poor glycemic control and compare them with apparently healthy individuals. Methods A hospital-based case-control study was carried out at the Buea Regional Hospital from January to May, 2024 among patients with T2DM and age-matched healthy subjects. Sociodemographic, clinical and anthropometric data were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Levels of glucose, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by spectrophotometry.

Visceral fat removal (VFR) improves metabolism and reduces proinflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that VFR removal in AD mice would improve metabolism and cognition. Methods: Male and female APPNL-F mice underwent sham or vWAT surgical resection (epididymal and perirenal) at 4 (pre-symptomatic) and 16 (symptomatic) months of age to understand interventional and therapeutic effects, respectively. At 18 months of age, glucose metabolism and novel object recognition (NOR) memory were assayed followed by assessment of body composition and tissue-specific markers of metabolism, cell senescence, inflammation, or amyloid accumulation. Results: Male and female APPNL-F mice showed distinct VFR responses. In pre-symptomatic males, increased vWAT lipolysis and hepatic lipogenesis led to ectopic liver lipid accumulation, with reduced adiponectin and leptin, elevated visfatin, and impaired glucose metabolism. Symptomatic males showed reduced vWAT lipogenesis, enhanced hepatic lipolysis, glycolysis, and glycogenesis, lowering liver lipids and improving insulin sensitivity. Only symptomatic males improved NOR, linked to elevated hippocampal learning and memory markers. Female vWAT reaccumulation was due to increased lipogenesis and lower lipolysis. Pre-symptomatic females had lower hepatic lipogenesis, while glycolysis and glycogenesis declined with disease progression. Hippocampal senescence and inflammation were elevated early in the disease that persisted symptomatically. Conclusions: Sex-specific differences in glucose and lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation underlie the divergent responses to VFR in APPNL-F mice, with symptomatic males showing the only beneficial outcomes in metabolism and cognition.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

It is well-established that contraction of the target muscle increases motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and correspondingly decreases RMT. As such, when estimating RMT it is crucial to ensure the target muscle is relaxed. Typically trials in which baseline electromyographic (EMG) amplitude exceeds a specified threshold are rejected. The influence of motor activity below typical rejection thresholds on MEP amplitudes has yet to be established. Methods We retrospectively analysed TMS-EMG data collected during RMT measurement in 45 healthy controls (1761 datapoints) and 35 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, 1238 datapoints). Trials where root mean squared (RMS) baseline EMG amplitude exceeded 10V were rejected. Generalised linear mixed-effects models were used to assess effects of muscle activity below this rejection threshold on probability of evoking an MEP with peak-to-peak amplitude [&ge;]50V. Results Greater sub-rejection-threshold activity significantly increases MEP probability in controls (p<0.0004) and people with ALS (p=0.0010).

We found that, two weeks after LPS challenge, wild-type mice (WT) recovered but Sh3+/- mice exhibited motor impairment, anxiety-like behaviors, and excessive grooming, similar to Shank3 exon 4-22 deletion homozygous mutants. Anti-inflammatory treatment partially reversed LPS-induced behavioral changes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of neuroinflammation-related genes and downregulation of synaptic function-related genes in Sh3+/- mice in response to LPS. Especially, pro-inflammatory genes and microglia markers were overly activated that may result from the increased Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in microglia in Sh3+/- mice. Our findings indicate that neuroinflammation increases the penetrance of behavioral impairment in Shank3 haploinsufficiency mice and support a potential mechanism for the behavioral regression in human SHANK3 disorders for future investigations.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

We previously found that the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) transporter Osh5 is critical for autophagosome formation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the knockout of cho1, which encodes PtdSer synthase, on autophagy. Green fluorescent protein-autophagy-related gene 8 (GFP-Atg8) processing assay revealed a significant defect in the macroautophagic activity of the cho1{triangleup} mutant, regardless of the presence or absence of ethanolamine (Etn). Notably, autophagosomes were absent in the cytosol, and macroautophagic bodies were not observed in the vacuoles of the starved cho1{triangleup} mutant, underscoring the essential role of PtdSer synthesized using Cho1 in autophagosome biogenesis. In contrast, numerous microautophagic vesicles containing lipid droplets were observed in the vacuoles of cho1{triangleup} mutants starved in the presence of Etn, suggesting the crucial role of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) synthesized via the Kennedy pathway in microautophagic lipophagy when PtdSer synthesis using Cho1 is disrupted. Given recent evidence pointing to the involvement of the ubiquitination system in various autophagy-related processes, we also examined the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 gene ubc4. Moreover, microautophagic lipophagy was significantly diminished in starved cho1{triangleup} yeast with ubc4 knockout.

Here, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to investigate how altered sterol content impacts macrophage signaling and membrane function. Through pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, reduced cholesterol and increased levels of disease-associated sterol intermediates coincided with reduced expression of cell surface proteins and impaired macropinocytosis. Macropinocytic activity was sensitive to both reduced plasma membrane cholesterol and sterols containing functional groups substituted for the C3 hydroxyl group. Transcriptomic analyses of cholesterol-inhibited BMDMs revealed alterations in immune and chemokine signaling pathways.

We hypothesized that the membrane-bound C-terminal FPC domain (FPCct) is necessary to suppress cystogensis and facilitate epithelial homeostasis. In ARPKD, cystic kidney epithelia are characterized by a secretory phenotype associated with high intracellular cAMP levels and enhanced STAT3-dependent transcription. Moreover, impaired FPC function may lead to enhanced activation of Src tyrosine kinase, thereby activating STAT3 signaling and its downstream transcriptional activity. To investigate the effects of FPC loss on the cystic epithelial cell phenotype, we used an established principal-like MDCK cell line (pl-MDCK) and studied monolayers in both two and three-dimensional culture. In this in vitro model of collecting duct epithelia, FPC-deficient cells showed two-fold elevated basal cAMP levels and enhanced apical secretion leading to three-fold higher luminal pressure. Forskolin-stimulated elevation of cAMP levels triggered enhanced Src-dependent activation of STAT3 resulting in a pronounced cystic phenotype. Notably, expression of wildtype FPCct reduced both STAT3-dependent transcription and the secretory phenotype in knockout epithelial cells. Our data suggest that FPCct interacts with Src kinase at the plasma membrane, thereby reducing Src-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and limiting STAT3-dependent transcription. Thus, FPCct appears to act like a physiological suppressor of cystogenic signaling, as found in healthy kidney epithelia, that is essential for maintaining epithelial homeostasis.

Here, we show that recruitment of TSG101, an ESCRT-I protein, to endosome is the mechanism by which CPAP facilitates EVT. While CPAP depletion disrupts the Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion and endosome maturation processes, it does not interact with these GTPases. We found that CPAP not only co-immunoprecipitates with TSG101, but also colocalizes with TSG101 as well as ESCRT 0 protein HRS on the early endosomes. Although CPAP-TSG101 interaction occurs under quiescent state, this interaction is more robust during EVT progression. TSG101 recruitment to endosome and Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion were restored in CPAP depleted cells upon overexpression of HRS suggesting that CPAP functions upstream of TSG101, but in parallel to HRS, and bridges ESCRT 0 and ESCRT I components.

However, the mechanisms by which it enhances host glucose metabolism remain incompletely understood. Methods We used fluorescence-based glucose uptake assays, flow cytometry, metabolic flux analysis, and gene silencing in ARPE-19 cells, along with transgenic mouse models, to explore how T. gondii manipulates host glucose utilization and whether this promotes parasite proliferation. Results T. gondii infection significantly enhanced host glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner and promoted GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Notably, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) assays demonstrated a marked increase in glycolytic activity following infection. Mechanistically, we identified that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediates the phosphorylation and transcriptional upregulation of TBC1D4, a Rab-GAP protein essential for GLUT4 trafficking. Genetic silencing of TBC1D4 impaired both glucose uptake and parasite replication. Furthermore, we uncovered a regulatory mechanism involving AKT-dependent nuclear signaling that modulates TBC1D4 transcription. In vivo experiments using Phf20 transgenic mice confirmed increased susceptibility to T. gondii and elevated glucose metabolic responses.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated how tubulin deglutamylases (CCPP-1 and CCPP-6) and polyglutamylases (TTLL-5 and TTLL-9) affect kinesin-3/UNC-104-mediated axonal transport. Loss of CCPP-1 not only facilitated tubulin polyglutamylation as expected, but it also leads to increased tyrosination. Vice versa, loss of TTLL-5 reduced tubulin polyglutamylation as expected, but at the same time leads to reduced tyrosination as well. This crosstalk in tubulin PTM appears to be critical feature such as no tyrosination or detyrosination enzymes are known in in C. elegans. Notably, acetylation and detyrosination remained unaffected in the deglutamylation and polyglutamylation mutants. Functionally, reduced glutamylation and tyrosination improved kinesin-3 KIF1A/UNC-104 transport characteristics. Conversely, increased glutamylation and tyrosination negatively affected the movement of both UNC-104 motor and its cargo RAB-3. UNC-104 motors visibly accumulate in neuronal cell bodies of ccpp-1 mutants while being significantly reduced in ttll-5 mutants. In ttll-5 mutants, motors tend to cluster along distal axonal regions and these cluster are reduced in ccpp-1 mutants revealing a role of tubulin PYM in axonal motor scaffolding. Employing promoter fusions, we confirmed that all investigated PTM enzymes express in neurons and colocalize with UNC-104. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that hyper-glutamylated tubulin appears in a physical complex with UNC-104, while hypoglutamylated tubulin binds less effectively to the motor. In our model, highly negatively charged polyglutamylated tubulin traps UNC-104 onto microtubules via increased charge-interactions. Tubulin \"stickiness\" is reduced in polyglutamylase mutants leading to increased motor speeds.

Building on previous work, we developed a parsimonious mathematical model of meiotic termination that elucidates the role of Rim4-mRNA release and translation of AMA1 mRNA in the fidelity of meiotic exit. Central to our model is the accumulation of Ama1 protein, a meiosis-specific activator of APC/C. Our mathematical model predicted further outcomes, which we tested experimentally. We found that either slowing Rim4 degradation or disrupting APC/CAma1 activity delayed meiosis II. In some cells, this disruption prevented meiotic exit entirely, leading them to re-enter cell cycle oscillations after meiosis II.

To remedy this, we used budding yeast as a genetic model to explore uptake mechanisms of several common furanic compounds: 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural (FUR), and 2-Furyl methyl ketone (FMK). Titrations were used to identify sub-lethal doses of each furanic compound for downstream experiments. We then revealed HMF is a potential substrate of the Pdr5 multidrug resistance pump and that both HMF and FUR require surface nutrient transporters to induce toxicity. Live cell imaging suggests that HMF disrupts mitochondria whilst FUR affects the endolysosomal system. Collectively, this work suggests that the uptake and efflux of even these related furanic compounds have different mechanisms, and exert their toxic effects via distinct intracellular pathways.

Endogenous MORC2 forms dynamic condensates in neurons from EGFP-MORC2 knock-in mice, supporting the physiological relevance of LLPS in vivo. The 3.1 [A] crystal structure of coiled-coil 3 (CC3) reveals a dimeric scaffold that drives phase separation, while multivalent interactions between the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a newly defined IDR-binding domain (IBD) further promote condensate formation. Moreover, LLPS enhances MORC2s ATPase activity in a DNA-dependent manner, indicating a functional coupling between phase separation, DNA binding, and enzymatic regulation. RNA-seq analysis shows that only wild-type, but not LLPS-deficient MORC2, represses core target genes in knockout cells, directly linking condensate formation to transcriptional control. Furthermore, disease-associated MORC2 variants alter condensate dynamics, ATPase activity, and DNA binding, offering mechanistic insights into their pathogenic effects.

Mutations in these genes impair oxidative phosphorylation, compromise mitochondrial ATP production and cellular energy supply, and can cause mitochondrial diseases. These consequences highlight the importance of mtDNA quality control (mtDNA-QC), the process by which cells selectively maintain intact mtDNA to preserve respiratory function. Here, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to track mtDNA segregation in cell populations derived from heteroplasmic zygotes, in which wild-type (WT) mtDNA is fluorescently labeled and mutant mtDNA remains unlabeled. Using this approach, we observe purifying selection against mtDNA lacking subunits of complex III (COB), complex IV (COX2) or the ATP synthase (ATP6), under fermentative conditions that do not require respiratory activity. By integrating cytometric data with growth assays and simulations, we show that the decline of {Delta}atp6 mtDNA reflects both intracellular selection for intact genomes and a proliferative disadvantage of cells lacking ATP synthase. In contrast, loss of {Delta}cob and {Delta}cox2 mtDNA is primarily driven by selective maintenance of functional genomes. In heteroplasmic cells containing both intact and mutant mtDNA, fluorescent reporters revealed local reductions in ATP levels and membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}) near mutant genomes, indicating spatial heterogeneity in mitochondrial physiology that reflects local mtDNA quality. Disruption of the respiratory chain by deletion of nuclear-encoded subunits (RIP1, COX4) abolished these physiological gradients and impaired mtDNA-QC, suggesting that local bioenergetic differences are required for selective recognition.

Further, for specialist herbivores like Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata, biotic factors, including host plant availability and the presence of a shared parasitoid Cotesia congregata, may play a critical role in shaping their spatial patterns. Yet, existing predictive models often focus solely on abiotic factors, with the contribution of biotic factors largely unknown. 2. In this study, we assessed whether abiotic and biotic factors as isolated or combined components of species distribution models (SDM) better predict the distribution of the congeners, M. sexta and M. quinquemaculata, and their shared endoparasitoid, C. congregata. We further evaluated the influence of bioclimate variables and elevation on cultivated and wild host plant distributions of M. sexta and M. quinquemaculata. To ensure robustness of our SDMs, we constructed them using an ensemble of three predictive algorithms: generalized linear model, maximum entropy, and random forest. We also applied Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) metrics to assess how well each model predicted outcomes. Then, to compare the predictive power between models that used isolated and combined abiotic and biotic factors, we analyzed the values obtained from the AUC and TSS metrics using a one-way ANOVA. 3. Our findings showed that the predictive power of models that used isolated and combined abiotic and biotic factors did not significantly differ. The abiotic-only model identified minimum temperature of the coldest month, elevation, and summer precipitation as the primary determinants of distributions of the Manduca spp., host plants, and C. congregata, respectively. Both Manduca spp. showed similar responses to minimum temperature of the coldest month and elevation, but response to summer precipitation differed between species. Models accounting for biotic factors only and combination of abiotic and biotic factors revealed cultivated host plants as the most important predictor for the distribution of both the Manduca spp. and C. congregata. Both Manduca spp. and C. congregata showed a high likelihood of occurrence with the presence of cultivated host plants. While this finding is not surprising, the responses of Manduca spp. to predictors like wild host plants varied between biotic-only and abiotic-biotic models. Similarly, the parasitoid's response to its host, Manduca spp., also differed between the two models. 4.

Passive trapping techniques such as pitfall and malaise traps probably constitute the most widely used methods for standardised surveys of invertebrate populations worldwide. These methods typically yield aggregated count data over multi-day trapping periods, often spanning several weeks, during which species activity (i.e. phenology) can vary. The analysis of trapping data collected over temporally misaligned sampling intervals is challenging, hampering the integrated analysis of historically available trapping datasets. 2. We introduce a temporal disaggregation approach using interval-integrated B-splines to analyse data collected over misaligned sampling intervals while accounting for phenological influences. We present computationally efficient Taylor series approximations for integrating exponentiated B-splines over sampling intervals. We further tailor our approach to typical trapping datasets by providing several extensions, including joint species distribution modelling. 3. Through simulations and cross-validation, we demonstrate that our approach of temporal disaggregation outperforms naive approaches and provides improved inference on phenology and other parameters of interest, such as inter-annual trends. The first-order Taylor approximation, which can be fit using regular software routines, properly accounts for heterogeneity in sampling duration and timing, while the second-order Taylor approximation and the exact model additionally allow for improved estimation of phenological patterns. 4.

PLP is a required cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, including the synthesis of GABA and the monoamines. PNPO disruption in humans is associated with an array of epilepsy syndromes, while Drosophila harboring mutations in the sole PNPO ortholog, sugarlethal (sgll), display spontaneous seizures and short lifespans. These phenotypes are suppressed by PLP supplementation and are exacerbated by restriction of dietary B6 vitamers. In the context of PNPO deficiency, it remains to be resolved what the specific contributions by cellular subpopulations in the nervous system are to neurological phenotypes. We addressed this question in sgll mutants by expressing human PNPO (hPNPO) cDNA in cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurons as well as glia and measuring changes in survival and seizure phenotypes. We found hPNPO expression in GABAergic neurons largely restored lifespan and attenuated seizure activity, while glial expression also improved sgll phenotypes albeit to a lesser degree. In contrast, hPNPO expression in either cholinergic or glutamatergic neurons, accounting for most neurons in the fly brain, did not appreciably alter sgll phenotypes. We contrasted these observations with changes in sgll mutants induced by feeding GABA receptor modulators. The GABAB agonist SKF-97541 reduced mortality, while GABA or GABAA receptor modulators did not improve survival. Together, our data establish a cell-autonomous role for PNPO in GABAergic neurons to support brain function, especially under VB6-restricted conditions.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

To explore the value of the BALB/c Relapsing Mouse Model of TB in evaluating treatment forgiveness, we assessed the impact of weekend dose holidays on the bactericidal, including RS ratio, and sterilizing efficacy of RHZE/RH and BPaMZ in perspective of each drug exposure. The cure/relapse data from this study plus multiple historical studies were used to identify a nonlinear mixed-effects Emax model that was used to estimate time to cure 50% and derive time to cure 90% mice (T90). Expected time-dependent bactericidal activity and reductions in RS ratio were observed for both treatments, with more rapid decreases for the BPaMZ groups. The weekend dosing holiday significantly decreased reductions in lung CFU and RS ratio earlier in RHZE/RH treatment, but no such effect was observed for BPaMZ. Similarly, the predicted T90 was significantly greater for RHZE/RH (but not BPaMZ), with weekend doses omitted. No major drug exposure difference was observed between the 2 dosing schedules. Our results suggest BPaMZ is more forgiving of missed doses than RHZE/RH and suggests utility of this methodology to support evaluation of TB treatment forgiveness.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Antiarrhythmic agents that prolong APD by selectively blocking specific ion channels (like IKr) often increase dispersion of repolarization, which could result in a pro-arrhythmic risk. In this report, using computer models of the action potential of human epicardial and mid-myocardial myocytes, we have identified two strategies to prolong APD while reducing transmural dispersion of repolarization. The first strategy, which involves blocking several depolarizing and repolarizing ion channels (INaL, ICaL, IKr and INaCa), can reduce the transmural APD dispersion by about 20%. The second strategy, which involves the use of a combination of ion channel blockers and activators, results in a stronger reduction in transmural dispersion of repolarization than using only ion channel blockers. Enhancing IKs and blocking IKr can reduce transmural APD dispersion by about 70%. Our results suggest that a multichannel pharmacology strategy (as opposed to a single channel strategy), possibly using ion channel blockers and activators, can be effective at increasing APD while minimizing dispersion of repolarization.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

While ABR morphology has been proposed as a biomarker for AD, we report a novel biomarker derived from multidimensional parametric feature extraction on the distribution statistics of repeated single traces of the ABR that increases its potential for clinical utility with sensitivity and specificity. We report accurate prediction of AD genetic risk in both young and aged animals: AppS rats separate clearly from humanized controls in both sex- and age-dependent manners. Notably, auditory learning in young adulthood normalized the ABR signature in AppS rats with maintained effects into older age, altogether supporting a central neural generator of auditory dysfunction related to AD risk.

However, ICD is dampened when tumors acquire resistance, affecting immune recognition. KDEL receptors (KDELRs), through a retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, prevent spontaneous secretion of KDEL proteins. We report that inhibition of a single KDELR in a minor fraction of tumor cells, primarily KDELR2, provokes robust infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a complete regression of both immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumors independently of T cells. Importantly, in the course of regression, anti-tumor T cells are primed, conferring protection against a second challenge. Recapitulated by intratumoral delivery of siDKELR2 utilizing lipid nanoparticles, we implicate KDELR2 as a target to unleash an unusual robust innate immune response, which represents a tractable approach to initiate an adaptive response downstream, bypassing conventional ICD-inducing therapies.

Some mammals that are native to high elevation have evolved a means of attenuating HPH, demonstrating how environmental adaptation may sometimes counteract the effects of ancestral acclimatization responses. Here, we examine elevational variation in heart mass and measures of RV hypertrophy in four closely related species of leaf-eared mice (genus Phyllotis) that are broadly co-distributed across a steep elevational gradient on the Western slope of the Andes. There was a positive relationship overall between heart mass and elevation that reflected proportional changes in both the right and left ventricles. Thus, elevation-related increases in overall heart mass were not generally attributable to RV hypertrophy, suggesting that this group of predominantly highland species have evolved a means of avoiding HPH and/or attenuating the cardiac response to HPH. To gain insight into possible transcriptional mechanisms, we examined patterns of transcriptomic variation in the right ventricles of Phyllotis vaccarum from two geographically distinct highland populations (both from elevations >5000 m) that exhibit strikingly different levels of RV hypertrophy. Suppression of RV hypertrophy is associated with differential expression of key regulatory genes involved in striated muscle, immune processes, and the inflammatory response. Analysis of co-expression modules identified a promising set of candidate genes for mediating the development of RV hypertrophy at extremely high elevations.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Current in vitro models lack the integration of functional physiology with immune and neuronal complexity required to establish causal links between neuroinflammation and dysmotility. Here, an immune competent bioengineered colon is introduced that integrates multiple cell types of the external colonic wall, along with functional readouts of motility. Within bioengineered colons, exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a toxicant associated with GWI, drove interferon gamma mediated neuroinflammation. Contractile motility dysfunction occurred in PB-exposed bioengineered colons due to neural progenitor depletion, and impaired neuronal regeneration.

V.; Singh, P.; Zeng, E.", "abstract": "Background: Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are bacterial regulatory elements involved in persistence, dormancy, and biofilm stability under stress conditions such as limited nutrients, acid exposure, and antimicrobial treatment. Although their roles are well-characterized in isolated pathogens, TA systems remain largely unexamined in the context of the oral microbiome. Given their potential involvement in microbial adaptation during oral diseases and treatment, we aimed to identify transcriptionally active TA systems and evaluate their condition-specific expression patterns across oral health states using metatranscriptomic data. Results: We re-analyzed two publicly available supragingival metatranscriptomic datasets: a longitudinal dataset by Carda-Dieguez et.al. (Dieguez) capturing treatment transitions (fluoride (Fl), fluoride-arginine (Fl-Ar)) in caries-active and caries-free individuals, and a cross-sectional dataset by Ev et.al., (Ev) profiling caries-active lesions (CA), caries-inactive (CI), and caries-free (CF) states. After quality control, host sequences removal, rRNA removal, and HUMAnN3-based functional profiling, we identified 1,189 unique UniRef90 gene clusters with known TA associations. Differential analysis using ANCOM-BC revealed 197 TA-related gene clusters as significantly modulated in at least one condition. Of these, 22 gene clusters were differentially expressed in Dieguez, 38 in Ev, with 77 shared across both datasets. Distinct TA expression signatures were observed across healthy (CF, CI, baseline), lesion types (CAa, CAi, CAs), and treatment stages (Fl, Fl-Ar), suggesting condition-specific regulatory activity. Functional annotation of differentially expressed TA genes using the Toxin-antitoxin system database, eggNOG-mapper, and InterProScan, revealed 18 genes with strong evidence for their involvement in key bacterial stress-response pathways. These included members of the ParD-ParE, RelE/StbE-RelB/StbD, FitA, and YafQ families, which are annotated with mRNA catabolism, transcriptional repression, and prokaryotic defense-associated pathways. Conclusion: This is the first metatranscriptomic analysis profiling functional shifts in toxin-antitoxin systems across oral healthy, caries, and treatment states. TA systems showed dynamic and condition-specific expression, with pathway annotations suggesting their roles in microbial persistence, stress adaptation, and ecological remodeling during caries progression. These findings open new avenues for targeting microbial stress modules in precision microbiome therapeutics.

We propose a keystone identification approach called KeySDL which reduces the amount of data required by incorporating assumptions about the type of microbial dynamics present in the experimental system. The data are modeled as originating from a Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, an architecture commonly used to simulate microbial systems. The parameters of this model are then estimated using Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL) Compared to existing methods, this approach allows accurate prediction of keystone microbes from small numbers of samples and provides an output interpretable as reconstructed system dynamics.

The regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) RI phase separates following cAMP-induced kinase activation, thereby restricting and enhancing PKA activity in space and time. The N-terminal dimerization/docking (D/D) domain and the linker region of RI have been identified as necessary and sufficient for phase separation, but their interactions at atomic resolution have remained elusive. We report here a structural investigation of the minimal phase-separating region of RI by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The intrinsically disordered regions of RI cause broadening of NMR signals throughout the protein indicative of widespread dynamic interactions. Mutation of arginine residues in the RI inhibitory sequence leads to a reduction in signal broadening accompanied by loss of phase separation. Independently, binding of RI to an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) leads to spectral changes that are indicative of a loss of interactions between the D/D domain and the linker region, suggestive of a competition between intramolecular interactions and partner binding. Corroborating the experimental observations, multiscale MD simulations detect pervasive interactions of the folded D/D domain of RI with the intrinsically disordered linker, and the intermolecular interactions in the condensate mirror those found internally in RI dimers.

However, it is unclear if oxidative stress ultimately increases to a point of cell death. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer strategy, it remains unknown whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and if it can be leveraged therapeutically. Using genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we performed tumor specific loss-of-function studies of the two key ferroptosis suppressors, glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (Fsp1), and observed increased lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis and robust suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumors are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that FSP1 was selectively required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout (Fsp1KO) tumors had an accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, dietary, or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of Fsp1 KO tumors in vivo. Unlike GPX4, FSP1 expression was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in LUAD patients, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic target. Moreover, given the critical role of GPX4 in multiple tissues, there is a greater therapeutic window for targeting FSP1. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models.

The limited efficacy of current immunotherapy is attributed to the presence of these immunosuppressive cells. Here, we describe a novel immunotherapy approach, using a single-cycle alphavirus replicon particle (VRP) that carries a self-amplifying RNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12). Leveraging the natural tropism of alphavirus to myeloid cells, single cell transcriptomic analyses of mouse tumor tissues demonstrated that intratumoral (i.t.) injection of the vector effectively reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils toward a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor phenotype via interferon signaling, further enhanced by IL-12 expression. The treatment also induced cytotoxic NK and T cell responses, resulting in a significant reduction of tumor growth and effectively preventing nodal and distant metastases in solid tumor mouse models. By targeting tumor-supporting myeloid cells to transform the TME into an immune-active state, our myeloid modulation approach has the potential to enhance the efficacy of current immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

This network enables a comprehensive investigation of each miRNA's systems level properties in breast cancer. Community analyses revealed 17 distinct regulatory communities, which define the coordinated functions of miRNA. These community-level insights uncovered novel collective miRNA functional associations. For example, the analysis reveals a link between the miR-29 family and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is shared across breast cancer molecular subtypes. This suggests that the miR-29 family can uniquely be used as a key regulator of EMT across breast cancers.

A retrospective examination of historical mosquito collections held at the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD, France) and the Institut Louis Malarde (ILM, Tahiti) revealed evidence of Ae. vexans on Tahiti dating back as early as 1993. This historical detection was corroborated by targeted field surveys conducted between 2023 and 2025, which confirmed the species presence at multiple sites, particularly in the southern part of the island. To support these observations, COI gene sequences from newly collected specimens were analyzed alongside reference Ae. vexans sequences from GenBank. The Tahitian specimens fall unambiguously within the Pacific clade of Ae. vexans and show no genetic divergence that would support their assignment to Ae. nocturnus or Ae. nipponii. Similarly, sequences published under these names in GenBank do not form distinct lineages within Ae. vexans. This study provides the first confirmed record of Ae. vexans on Tahiti, based on both morphological identification and molecular evidence.

Alterations have been observed across multiple levels, from changes in cellular morphology, synaptic density, and neuroglial interactions to a brain-wide reduction in gray matter volume. While these adaptations are thought to support offspring survival and promote maternal physiological and psychological well-being, their functional significance remains largely unresolved. In particular, linking localized synaptic plasticity to a broader brain-wide circuit dynamics has posed a major challenge. Using virus-mediated screening in mice, we investigated the pregnancy-induced remodeling of the presynaptic landscape of paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) oxytocin neurons, a central hub of maternal physiology. Here we show a selective and reversible elimination of excitatory synaptic inputs from the medial preoptic nucleus to PVH oxytocin neurons, displaying region-, cell-type-, and pathway-specificity. This reduction in excitatory drive attenuated the anorexigenic activity of oxytocin neurons during feeding, thereby promoting the increased food intake characteristic of pregnancy. These data demonstrate that the selective suppression of anorexigenic PVH oxytocin neuron activity plays a critical role in appetite regulation during pregnancy. More broadly, our data identify a pregnancy-associated remodeling of hypothalamic neural circuits with direct physiological relevance.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Here we develop the reverse predictivity metric, which quantifies how well macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex responses predict ANN unit activations. This two-way framework reveals a striking asymmetry: models with high forward predictivity (~50% variance explained) often contain units unpredictable from neural activity, reflecting biologically inaccessible dimensions. In contrast, monkey-to-monkey mappings are symmetric, confirming that the asymmetry reflects genuine representational mismatch. Reverse predictivity isolates common ANN units -- shared with IT, behaviorally relevant, and generalizing across species -- and unique units lacking such alignment. Influenced by feature dimensionality, training objectives, and adversarial robustness, reverse predictivity offers a principled benchmark for guiding next-generation ANNs toward both high task performance and genuine biological plausibility.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that the presence and proportion of MoAM in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with SSc-ILD may be a biomarker of ILD severity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed BAL fluid from 9 prospectively enrolled patients with SSc-ILD and 13 healthy controls using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Patients with SSc-ILD had more MoAM and interstitial macrophages in BAL fluid than healthy controls, and their abundance was associated with lung fibrosis severity. We identified changes in the MoAM transcriptome as a function of treatment with mycophenolate, an effective therapy for SSc-ILD. In SSc-ILD lung explants, spatial transcriptomics identified an expanded population of interstitial macrophages spilling into the alveolar space.

However, the immunological differences between males and females and the mechanisms underlying them remain poorly characterized. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to test the hypothesis that sex differences in nutritional immunity, particularly iron sequestration, contribute to sexual dimorphism in infection outcome. Using the natural Drosophila pathogen Providencia alcalifaciens, which is controlled by host-mediated iron sequestration, we established an infection model in which males demonstrate increased resistance. Leveraging this model, we demonstrated that males exhibit higher basal and infection-induced expression levels of Transferrin 1-an iron transporter mediating iron sequestration during infection. Consequently, males contained lower iron levels in the hemolymph compared to females. Importantly, sex differences in iron content and in survival after P. alcalifaciens infection were abolished in Tsf1 mutants. However, these mutants still exhibited sex differences in pathogen load. Thus, while Tsf1 mediates sexual dimorphism in iron sequestration and susceptibility to P. alcalifaciens infection, it also has an unexpected role in host tolerance to infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the Toll pathway mediates sex differences in Tsf1 expression and susceptibility to infection. Altogether, our study demonstrates that Tsf1-mediated iron sequestration differs between male and female D. melanogaster, thereby identifying nutritional immunity as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in infection outcome.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Metabolic profiling revealed enhanced oxidative phosphorylation in Tregs from aged mice, along with a fivefold increase in intracellular succinate levels. This accumulation of succinate within the aged tumor microenvironment was found to potentiate Treg suppressive function. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reversed this effect, restoring effector T cell activity.

In zebrafish, morpholino knockdown of -tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (TAT1), the enzyme responsible for depositing -tubK40Ac marks, has been reported to cause severe developmental defects, whereas genetic loss-of-function studies in mice found no overt role in development. Here, we generated TAT1 loss-of-function alleles in zebrafish and found that, in contrast to morphants, mutants are viable, fertile, and develop normally. TAT1 mutants lack detectable -tubK40Ac in all examined tissues, indicating that no other enzyme compensates for loss of TAT1. Both cilia and neurons normally display high levels of -tubK40Ac and despite the complete loss of this modification in TAT1 mutants, gross cilia structure and motility were preserved, and cilia-dependent developmental processes remained intact. However, TAT1 mutants did exhibit defects in touch responsiveness, something which could be rescued by wild-type but not catalytically inactive TAT1.

Unfortunately, the popular simulation framework SLiM has always been intrinsically limited to simulations of a single diploid chromosome. Modeling multiple chromosomes of different types, such as sex chromosomes, has always been cumbersome even with scripting, presenting a substantial barrier to the development of full-genome simulations. Here we present SLiM 5, a major extension of SLiM's capabilities for simulating multiple chromosomes. Modeling up to 256 chromosomes is now possible, and each chromosome may belong to any of a wide variety of types -- not just autosomes (diploid and haploid), but also sex chromosomes (X, Y, Z, and W), haploid mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA, and more. This new functionality is integrated across all of SLiM, including not only the mechanics of reproduction and inheritance, but also input and output of multi-chromosome data in formats like VCF, and tree-sequence recording across multiple chromosomes. New recipes in the SLiM manual demonstrate these new features, and SLiM's graphical modeling environment, SLiMgui, has been extended in many ways for the visualization of multi-chromosome models.

In Drosophila, four p53 isoforms are expressed from a single locus, but their individual roles under different stress conditions are not yet fully understood, partly due to limited tools for isoform-specific analysis. To address this gap, we developed and validated a set of isoform-specific qPCR primers that accurately distinguish all endogenous Drosophila p53 transcripts. Using this approach, we examined how each isoform responds to nucleolar stress, a mechanism triggered in humans by deregulation of ribosome biogenesis, often accompanied by increased p53 and apoptosis. In Drosophila, knockdown of Nucleolar complex protein 1 (NOC1) impairs rRNA maturation and ribosomal assembly, triggering nucleolar stress and leading to upregulation of p53 level. Using our isoform-specific qPCR primers, we found that p53B and the previously uncharacterized p53C isoforms are selectively upregulated in response to NOC1 knockdown, while p53A expression remains largely unaffected. This differential regulation underscores a stress-specific pattern of isoform activation distinct from the response typically observed under genotoxic stress conditions, where p53A predominates. These findings suggest the existence of isoform-specific roles in nucleolar stress signaling. Furthermore, our data support the possibility of autoregulatory interactions among p53 isoforms, whereby the stress-induced upregulation of one isoform may influence the transcriptional activity or stability of others. Notably, we also identified a previously unrecognized and evolutionarily conserved transcriptional response of p53 to nucleolar stress, which is detectable in both Drosophila and human systems.

Magnetic Ion Channel Activation (MICA) utilises remote magnetic fields to stimulate mechano-sensitive ion channels through magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs).

The findings demonstrate that MICA significantly increased the production yield of EVs from MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts compared to magnetic stimulation or TREK1 functionalised graphene oxide-MNP particles alone. The obtained EVs exhibited typical size distribution, morphology, and EV protein expression consistent with nano-sized vesicles.

Because the N-terminus contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), how ALK inhibitors affect the structure and dynamics of full-length EML4-ALK remains unclear. Here, using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), we visualize the overall structures of three full-length EML4-ALK variants (v1, v3, and v5) at the single-molecule level. We identified a transient globular subdomain (residues 191-217) within the v3 IDR that contributes to distinct oligomerization patterns. Notably, ALK inhibitors compact the IDR subdomain and reduce oligomerization, whereas this effect is abolished by the resistance mutation ALKG1202R, suggesting that ALK inhibitors not only affect kinase activity but also modulate IDR dynamics. Our findings shed new light on the structural regulation of EML4-ALK and provide a foundation for developing next-generation targeted therapies that account for IDR-driven molecular behavior.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

This study evaluated the effectiveness of MALDI-TOF MS in identifying seven species of Coleoptera collected between 2014 and 2023 from 17 French cultural sites. A total of 273 specimens (205 field-collected and 68 laboratory-reared) were analysed. Although reproducible and species-specific MS spectra were obtained, intra-species reproducibility was higher for laboratory reared specimens frozenly-stored compared to counterparts field collected and stored at room temperature. Two successive blind tests were done against the reference MS database including, firstly (ie, database 1, DB1), only laboratory-reared Coleoptera MS spectra, and secondly, those of DB1 upgraded with MS spectra from field collected specimens (ie, BD2). Correct identification at the species were obtained for MS spectra query against DB1 for species which possess homolog in the database. However, the spectra reaching threshold for relevant identification were coming from essentially laboratory-reared Coleoptera. An upgrading of the reference MS database (ie, BD2), improved identification performance for field specimens, although limitations remained for species with MS spectra of low peak diversity like Pentarthrum huttoni. In parallel, three specimens per species and storing mode were submitted to molecular identification using COI and 16S markers. For field samples, the rate of successful PCR product sequencing was lower than 10%, which was likely attributed to DNA degradation of these samples stored long term at room temperature. Overall, the study confirmed that MALDI-TOF MS appeared as a promising tool for Coleopteran pest identification, especially when reference spectra matched both species and preservation mode.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

One of the main parameters affecting flow and fluency of speech is pause behaviour. However, the precise language characteristics of pauses, including sentence complexity and length, and how they contribute to the fluency disruptions of PD are not fully understood. This study examined how sentence complexity and length affect pause behaviour in PD. Method Seventy-one participants, comprising individuals with PD (n = 32) and neurotypical controls (n = 39), read a speech passage aloud. The number and duration of pauses, categorised by location (between, within sentences), sentence complexity (simple, complex), and sentence length (short, long) were analysed. Cognitive ability, assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and motor speech deficits (i.e., dysarthria) severity, assessed using a speech perceptual ranking, were evaluated and correlated with pause characteristics. Results Individuals with PD produced significantly more pauses across all categories compared to controls. However, only between-sentence and long-sentence pauses were significantly longer in duration. Pause frequency and duration in both groups were higher in more complex and longer sentences. Significant negative correlations were found between MoCA scores and number of pauses. Significant positive correlations were observed between dysarthria severity and duration of pauses. Conclusion These findings suggest that increased cognitive-linguistic demands--indexed by sentence complexity and length--may underlie pausing behaviour and contribute to fluency disruptions in individuals with PD. The results extend previous research by highlighting the potential cognitive-linguistic basis of motor speech dysfunction in PD.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

However, inconsistencies in the definition and implementation of ALFF have led to confusion in the field. In this study, we provide a mathematical clarification of ALFF and fALFF by introducing two variants: the arithmetic mean-defined ALFF/fALFF (amALFF/amfALFF) and the quadratic mean-defined ALFF/fALFF (qmALFF/qmfALFF). We examine the relationships between mean BOLD intensity (MBI), amALFF, and qmALFF across both subjects and voxels using two independent datasets mapped onto different brain templates. Additionally, we investigate the impact of z-scoring the original BOLD signal on ALFF and fALFF metrics. Our key findings include: (1) MBI is positively correlated with both amALFF and qmALFF, highlighting the need for normalization to subject-level means; (2) normalized qmALFF and qmfALFF are highly correlated with normalized amALFF and amfALFF, respectively, at both the subject and voxel levels; (3) z-scoring the BOLD signal does not affect amfALFF or qmfALFF, but it substantially alters amALFF and qmALFF.

We extended the classic item-specific proportion congruency paradigm to dissociate the electroencephalographic (EEG) representations of controlled and non-controlled associations. Behavioral data replicated previous findings of association-driven adaptive behaviors. Decoding analyses of EEG data further showed that associations of controlled and non-controlled information were represented concurrently and differentially.

Previous research suggests that the human visual system infers these thresholds based on internal references of physically realizable surface colors under a given illumination, referred to as the physical gamut. A surface is perceived as self-luminous when its luminance exceeds the upper limit of this empirically internalized gamut. However, the precise structure and boundaries of these gamuts remain uncertain. Optimal colors, which represent theoretical surface reflectances under specific illuminants, have been shown to provide an effective model for visualizing and computing the physical gamuts. In prior studies, optimal colors have successfully predicted luminosity thresholds; however, these findings were limited to highly simplified, abstract stimuli. Whether this framework generalizes to more naturalistic viewing conditions has remained an open question. In the present study, we demonstrate that the theory of an internal reference in the form of an empirically constructed physical gamut, visualized through optimal colors, remains valid under more natural conditions. Our results confirm that optimal colors can still accurately predict luminosity thresholds in such settings. Moreover, our findings suggest that the luminosity thresholds encompass both self-luminosity and naturalness concepts. Subsequently, this may imply that the notion of physical gamut could envelope both concepts as well and could be defined as \"all physically possible colors in a scene for an object that does not emit light.\" These insights can have profound potential implications for both applied fields (i.e., XR or projection mapping) and fundamental science (e.g., understanding human visual processing mechanisms).", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

RNA sequencing analysis revealed that all strains activated proinflammatory pathways, particularly IL-17 signaling, though the magnitude and nature of the response varied by strain. Dugway infection induced the most robust transcriptional response and consistent M1-like macrophage polarization, while responses to NMI and NMII were more variable.

Resistance to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins is increasing in K. pneumoniae globally, restricting therapeutic options. The {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combinations are widely used to circumvent {beta}-lactamase-mediated resistance. In 2021, isolate KpMVR1 was recovered from a hospitalised patient in England. Two additional isolates with the same variable-number tandem-repeat profile--KpMVS1, collected from the same patient 42 days before KpMVR1, and KpMVS2, from another patient in the same hospital--were susceptible to meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam. Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing and hybrid genome assembly were conducted for these three isolates. Annotated genome assemblies were compared to identify genetic variation, and mutagenesis experiments were performed to verify predicted functional alterations. All isolates belonged to a novel clone ST8134 and carried blaKPC-2-like alleles (KpMVR1: blaKPC-157; KpMVS1 and KpMVS2: blaKPC-2) in presumptively conjugative plasmids. ISEc68 caused a frameshift mutation in KpMVR1's ompK36 gene, reducing the meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam susceptibility. KPC-157 demonstrated decreased hydrolysis of imipenem and ceftazidime when compared with KPC-2. KpMVR1 also encoded a disrupted transcriptional repressor MarR and a destabilising mutation in AcrB, a component of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. In conclusion, KpMVR1 harboured complex resistance-associated genetic alterations, with evidence for in vivo emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Keratinocytes, the primary cells in the epidermis, are directly affected by persistent injury in RDEB, contributing to chronic inflammation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is elevated in the serum of individuals with RDEB. However, its role in keratinocyte inflammation remains unclear. Here, we report an increase in HMGB1 expression in keratinocytes at chronic wound sites compared to matched non-wounded skin from an RDEB individual, suggesting a potential link to local inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGB1 using inflachromene reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in a keratinocyte cell line, supporting a role for keratinocyte-specific HMGB1 in inflammation. Surprisingly, deletion of HMGB1 alone or together with its paralogue HMGB2 did not suppress the inflammatory response to LPS. Furthermore, inflachromene still reduced inflammation in these knockout cells. This unexpected discrepancy between genetic deletion and pharmacologic inhibition points to a more complex role for HMGB1 or off-target effects of the compound. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may contribute to inflammation in keratinocytes, but its exact function needs further investigation.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Factors governing dysbiosis are poorly understood with immunosuppression therapy believed to be involved in altering GM composition in those patients, either directly or via the immune system. At the interface stands secretory (S)IgA, however, little is known on its role governing dysbiosis in the context of SOT. In this study, we performed quantitative metagenomic analyses of GM accompanied by SIgA sequencing in 48 pediatric SOT recipients (age = 10.6 +/- 4.7 years) receiving either a heart (HTR, n=10), a kidney (KTR, n=11) or a liver (LTR, n=27) and compared results to healthy controls (HC, n=16). Results: We confirmed compositional and functional dysbiosis in SOT patients that broadly clustered into two groups, where cluster 1 (n=23) comprised most LTR patients and was closer to HC compared with cluster 2 (n=24) that exhibited stronger dysbiosis and included most HTR and KTR patients. The degree of dysbiosis was associated with Tacrolimus (TAC) levels. Overall, patients exhibited higher SIgA levels than HC, along with an increased percentage of bacteria targeted and altered target spectra. Furthermore, altered SIgA responses were associated with the degree of dysbiosis and were especially increased in cluster 2, in particular in HTR patients. A mechanistic model connecting immunosuppression, GM composition and SIgA targeting is proposed. Conclusion: Our study suggests that altered SIgA responses play an important role for GM alterations observed in SOT patients.

Although immature virions expose larger patches of the viral membrane than do mature ones, our data show that virion maturity levels did not contribute to GAS6 binding. Surprisingly, while ZIKV contains PS comparable to cellular membranes, PS on WNV and DENV is markedly reduced. These findings explain why only ZIKV can bind GAS6 and provide insights into a novel mechanism by which closely-related flaviviruses differentially utilize cellular entry factors.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Harding, C.", "abstract": "Iron is required to support essential cellular processes. Due to diverse and dynamic host environments, the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii must adapt to iron limited conditions. To investigate the adaptations critical to parasite survival under these conditions, we conducted proteomic and metabolomic profiling of Toxoplasma cultured in iron depleted conditions. We find that iron depletion results in remodelling of the parasite proteome and triggers swift translational repression. This occurs prior to downregulation of the iron-regulated translation factor ABCE1, indicating an upstream, ABCE1-independent mechanism. In the context of repressed translation, we also observe a significant rewiring of energy metabolism. Iron depleted Toxoplasma have altered mitochondrial morphology and a profound reduction in mitochondrial respiration. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle dysregulation, characterised by accumulation of citrate and fumarate, both substrates of iron-dependent TCA cycle enzymes, and accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. We found iron deprived parasites continue to take up glucose and maintain glycolytic output, comparable to iron replete conditions. Limiting glucose availability either in culture media or by genetic ablation of glucose uptake caused a significant increase in sensitivity to iron restriction. Conversely, limitation of mitochondrially metabolised glutamine improved parasite fitness in iron depleted conditions. Together, our results establish iron as a key regulator of parasite translation and metabolic flexibility and demonstrate carbon source availability as important in Toxoplasma adaptation to iron deprivation.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the viral capsid protein VP1 have recently advanced into clinical development, driven by promising in vitro potency. Since naturally elicited neutralizing antibodies arise following infection, we examined whether host immune pressure may have shaped the VP1 surface, with implications for therapeutic application. To probe the impact of VP1 coevolution on therapeutic engagement, we evaluated two neutralizing antibody formats: the clinical-stage monoclonal antibody 319C07 and nanobodies VHH16 and VHH17. Our X-ray crystallographic analysis of the VP1 pentameric core in complex with antibody fragments showed a convergent receptor-mimetic engagement of the sialic acid-binding cleft, mapping to a shared epitope centered around the VP1 BC-loop. Analysis of over 900 BKPyV VP1 sequences from public databases, combined with longitudinal VP1 sequence data from transplant recipients, highlighted widespread pre-existing diversity at the BC-loop contact sites, underscoring the evolutionary adaptability of BKPyV at this antigenic surface that may compromise therapeutic recognition. Through integrated mutagenesis and binding analyses, we show that circulating BC-loop mutations, including single amino acid substitutions, are sufficient to abrogate 319C07 binding and neutralization. Nanobodies VHH16 and VHH17, selected for their compact size and potential to access intrarenal sites of BKPyV replication, also exhibited complete loss of binding across multiple clinically observed VP1 variants. Our findings may offer a mechanistic framework to interpret the translational gap between in vitro neutralization and clinical efficacy of these biologics. As part of ongoing efforts to target VP1, we demonstrate, for the first time, small molecules with nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities against BKPyV VP1 variants including potent binding to JCPyV VP1. Our work paves a path towards a new class of antiviral strategies that could block replication at intracellular replication sites, provide a higher genetic barrier to resistance and the potential to address both viral reactivation and persistent, high-burden viremia in transplant settings.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

While conventional, genetically encoded resistance is well established, recent studies have uncovered widespread non-canonical mechanisms driven by phenotypically insensitive subpopulations hiding in seemingly susceptible populations, such as heteroresistance, persistence or adaptive resistance. These variants are not only clinically significant but also act as evolutionary precursors to fully resistant populations, rendering infections increasingly difficult to control. Yet standard antibiotic susceptibility tests lack the resolution and dynamic range needed to detect this wide spectrum of resistance mechanisms and their evolutionary progression, often misguiding clinical decisions, obscuring mechanisms of failure, and underestimating the true epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. To address these limitations, we introduce the Dilution-and-Delay (DnD) assay, a practical, high-resolution approach that implements two basic principles of bacterial growth in the antibiotic susceptibility testing format. Using well-defined synthetic communities and strains, we demonstrate that the DnD assay quantifies viable cells over more than eight orders of magnitude and detects rare antibiotic-insensitive cells at frequencies as low as 1 in 100 million. It additionally reports the standardized MIC as a secondary output, thereby capturing the average antibiotic response of the majority population and heterogeneity of minority subpopulations within a single assay. We scaled this approach for high-throughput application, classifying ~120 previously uncharacterized clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii across five antibiotics. This robust, quantitative, and scalable platform opens the door to next-generation antibiotic susceptibility testing, with broad utility in basic research, clinical diagnostics, and epidemiological surveillance. This improved testing will guide evidence-based clinical decisions and prevent the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance, thereby counteracting the rising rate of treatment failure.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Despite its use in clinical practice for many decades the basic tools to study the translational pharmacodynamics of phages are not available and it is recognised that lack of understanding of phage pharmacokinetic/dynamics (PK/PD) is a severe limitation in individual patient use and clinical trial design. Methods Traditional in vitro PK/PD evaluation tools were used to assess the antibacterial effect of single exposures of a bacteriophage cocktail against 4 strains of E. coli with potentially different patterns of response to phage. Initially, time-kill curves (TKC) were performed over 48hr and subsequently a dilutional in vitro model (IVM) was used to assess the antibacterial effects over 72hr. Results In TKC, the four E. coli strains showed different patterns of kill and regrowth when exposed to phage with two strains showing a sustained drop in bacterial viable count and two showing initial kill and regrowth. Using the IVM similar bacterial pharmacodynamic patterns were observed, and phage titre increased inversely but consistently with E. coli kill. Conclusions An In vitro dilutional model can be used to study the antibacterial effect of a phage cocktail on E.coli showing strain-to-strain variation in bacterial killing and bacteriophage titre. Such models can be used to provide more nuanced information on phage pharmacokinetics/dynamics and translationally useful information for dosing in humans.

Soil metagenomes showed high levels of bacterial denitrifier genes, whereas freshwater metagenomes showed fewer denitrifiers. In wetland and agricultural soil cores, the relative abundance of norB, the marker gene for nitric oxide reductase, was a predictor of ambient N2O flux as measured by gas chromatography. Denitrifiers were predicted using the Kraken2/Bracken pipeline. In Ohio wetland soils, the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium species were strongly associated with denitrification genes. We also explored how freshwater environmental factors select for or against nitrogen cycle genes. Denitrifier genes were positively correlated with phosphate concentration. Denitrifiers and denitrification genes were detected under microaerobic conditions, demonstrating that denitrification activity diminishes proportionally to oxygen concentration.

Bacterial adaptation is critical for survival, virulence modulation, and persistence during infection and can manifest as colony morphotype variation (CMV). While Bp adaptation has been well studied, CMV remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized five clinical Bp isolates exhibiting heterogeneous populations with mucoid and non-mucoid colony morphologies. We used phenotypic assays, whole-genome sequencing, and proteomics to investigate the molecular pathways impacted by CMV - by comparing smooth and rough morphotypes. While phenotypic differences in protease activity, hemolysis, mucoidy, iron uptake and antibiotic sensitivity -including to antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat infections-were rare, these traits alone could not distinguish morphotypes or group of isolates. Genomic comparisons revealed either no differences or limited isolate-specific mutations, which does not explain the overall difference in phenotypes. In contrast, proteomic analysis uncovered consistent shifts in protein abundance related to virulence, including quorum sensing, DNA methylation, and secretion systems. Rough variants showed higher expression of EPS-associated proteins, the BpsI3/R3 quorum sensing system, and the global regulator ScmR, whereas smooth variants upregulated type III/VI secretion and siderophore biosynthesis pathways. These findings suggest that CMV is driven by phase variation and regulatory mechanisms rather than punctual genomic modifications. Our study underscores the limitations of phenotype or genome-based classification alone in the context of CMV and highlights the value of integrated multi-omics approaches to uncover CMV-associated biomarkers, with potential applications in diagnostics and the development of targeted therapies against persistent and drug-resistant Bp infections.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

However, the vIRF3/IRF4-responsive DNA sequences underlying this cooperation are unknown. Investigating the IRF4-SE, we mapped its vIRF3/IRF4-responsiveness to a complex ~83 bp region, which retained cooperative activation by vIRF3 and IRF4 and was activated by vIRF3 but not IRF4 alone. vIRF3-mediated activation depended on an AP1 site, while the cooperation of vIRF3 with IRF4 required the DNA binding ability of IRF4 and IRF-related motifs that do not participate in canonical AP1-IRF (AICE) composite sites. These motifs are necessary but insufficient to confer responsiveness outside their native sequence context, suggesting that vIRF3/IRF4-mediated IRF4-SE activation requires an extended composite element. DNA pulldowns confirmed the importance of the identified motifs for association of vIRF3 and IRF4 with the IRF4-SE. A PEL MYC-SE similarly depended on an extended responsive element containing a critical AP1 site, within a functional AICE motif. Together, our results show that vIRF3 activates oncogenic SEs by co-opting complex genetic elements that may accommodate previously unknown IRF4 binding configurations, improving our understanding of vIRF3 and IRF4-dependent oncogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

We show that Myc boosts renal CoA production by directly upregulating Fbl (PANK1-3 homolog) and downregulating dPANK4 in the MTs. Elevated CoA biosynthesis enhances the mevalonate-isoprenoid pathway activity in the gut, promoting intestinal stem cell proliferation.

Through comprehensive characterization of the repair outcomes, our findings demonstrate that the general rules governing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing in vivo largely align with those observed in vitro but with reduced editing precision.

Although the causative link between MCPyV and Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is well established, the molecular mechanisms that govern viral latency and prevent oncogenic progression remain poorly understood. We previously reported that the MCPyV early region protein ALTO is a key modulator of the STING-TBK1 signaling axis, enabling the virus to co-opt host innate immune pathways to suppress excessive viral replication and promote latency over transformation. In this study, we expand on this model by identifying a short, essential domain within ALTO that is required for TBK1 activation. This domain, which we term LIT (Lost in Tau), is necessary for ALTO-TBK1 interaction but dispensable for ALTO trafficking and its interactions with STING or Src. When expressed alone, the LIT domain functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type ALTO, competitively blocking TBK1 activation through a novel TBK1 interaction domain. Deletion of the LIT domain from ALTO not only abolishes TBK1 interaction and downstream phosphorylation but also eliminates TBK1-mediated suppression of MCPyV replication during early infection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). These findings provide mechanistic insight into how ALTO promotes viral persistence and immune evasion. More broadly, they highlight the functional importance of intrinsically disordered regions in modulating host?virus interactions and suggest that MCPyV latency is actively maintained through a finely tuned balance of pro- and anti-viral signaling.

Permafrost thaw exposes previously unavailable soil carbon and nutrients to decomposition--a process mediated by microbes--which releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. While it is well-established that thaw alters the composition and function of the permafrost microbiome, patterns revealing common responses to thaw across different permafrost soil types have not yet emerged. Here, we address how permafrost thaw impacts microbiome diversity, alters species abundance, and contributes to carbon flux in the Arctic. We sampled peat-like, mineral, and organic-mineral permafrost from three locations in central and northern Alaska and assessed their abiotic soil properties and microbiome characteristics during a 3-month laboratory microcosm incubation. In all sites, prokaryotic biomass increased following thaw, measured as 16S rRNA gene copy number and absolute abundance. This change in biomass was positively correlated with cumulative respiration, indicating an increase in microbial activity post-thaw. We assessed the thaw response of microbial taxa across three sites, identifying taxa that significantly increased in abundance post-thaw. Common responders shared across all sites belonged to the families Beijerinckiaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Clostridiaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Sporichthyaceae, indicating a common set of taxa that consistently respond to thaw regardless of site-specific conditions. Alpha diversity decreased with thaw across all sites, which likely reflects the increased dominance of specific thaw-responsive taxa, which may be driving post-thaw biogeochemistry and increased respiration. Taken together, we deepen the understanding of different permafrost microbiomes and their response to thaw, which has implications for the permafrost-climate feedback and allows for better predictions of how Arctic ecosystem structure and function respond to change.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

Here, using Hi-C data from mouse embryonic stem cell lines with auxin-inducible degron-tagged subunits of SMC complexes, we clarify the role of condensins in shaping chromatin contacts within the interphase nucleus. We found that depletion of condensin I leads to weakened segregation of chromatin into A and B compartments. We also show that the contact patterns established by condensins during mitosis are preserved in interphase, suggesting a structural memory of mitotic chromosome folding. Condensins influence chromocenter organization: in the absence of condensin II during mitosis, centromeres tend to cluster, forming hyperclusters of pericentric heterochromatin. In contrast, depletion of condensin I reduces the number of heterochromatin clusters, consistent with enhanced chromosome territoriality. By combining a cohesin-degron system with Mcph1 knockout, we established an artificial model in which condensin II becomes the major driver of chromatin folding in interphase nuclei following cohesin depletion. Unlike extrusive cohesin, condensin II does not stall at sequence-specific sites and forms large, randomly positioned loops on interphase chromatin. Moreover, condensin II activity during interphase does not interfere with cohesin-dependent structures such as TADs and chromatin loops.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

While regulatory T (Treg) cells are key mediators of immune homeostasis, their role in the context of age-related inflammation remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that age-related changes in the microbiota promote impaired Treg cell function, resulting in the differentiation of inflammatory T cells. In agreement, we find that aged germ-free (GF) mice exhibited a more balanced immune profile, where the Treg cells are functional and pro-inflammatory mediators are reduced, suggesting that microbial exposure is essential for the establishment of inflammaging. Furthermore, we show that the use of old microbiota in young animals was sufficient to induce pro-inflammatory T cell responses and impaired mucosal Treg cell proliferation, while young microbiota restored Treg cell function in old animals. Mechanistically, we show that exposure to aged microbiota was associated with sustained TNF signaling, elevated oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased expression of senescence markers such as {gamma}H2AX and p16 in Treg cells.

Recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in treating B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. However, this approach remains constrained by its reliance on lymphodepleting conditioning regimens, high invasiveness, high costs, and the risk of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Antibody-based therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and T cell-engager (TCE) bispecific antibodies, suffer from suboptimal tissue penetration, resulting in incomplete B cell depletion in lymphoid and peripheral tissues, and subsequent rapid resurgence of pathogenic B cells. Here, we engineered highly stable circular RNAs (circRNAs) encoding anti-CD19 CAR (circRNA-CAR), which demonstrated prolonged and enhanced CAR protein expression compared to conventional linear mRNAs. By employing immune cell-tropic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for in vivo delivery, circRNA-CAR facilitated the generation of panCAR immune cells (including CAR-T, CAR-NK, and CAR-macrophages) in both murine models and cynomolgus monkeys. Compared to rituximab or teclistamab, in vivo panCAR induced more extensive B cell depletion across multiple tissue compartments in mice. Moreover, in vivo panCAR mediated robust B cell depletion, eliminated autoreactive antibodies, and restored renal function by alleviating proteinuria in a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) murine model. It also effectively reduced IgE antibody levels, decreased eosinophil activity, and improved lung pathology in an asthma murine model. Notably, in vivo panCAR-mediated B cell depletion significantly attenuated age-related pathological features in 17-month-old aged mice, remarkably outperforming both rituximab and teclistamab. In cynomolgus monkeys, in vivo panCAR achieved sustained B cell depletion lasting approximately 40 to 50 days, followed by reconstitution of a naive B cell repertoire.

CD8+ T cells co-expressing residency- and exhaustion-associated molecules in chronic diseases often correlate with clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between these cells and conventional TRM or TEX cells remains unclear. Here, we show that chronic antigen stimulation drives development of tissue-resident TEX (TR-TEX) cells that are ontologically and functionally distinct from TRM cells generated after antigen clearance. TR-TEX phenotypically resembled TRM cells but were regulated by distinct transcriptional networks and were uniquely dependent on Tox for residency programming. Although TEX progenitor cells acquired residency features upon entering chronically infected tissues, they failed to generate conventional TRM cells after antigen withdrawal. Conversely, TRM cells were able to differentiate into TEX cells during chronic antigen stimulation. Deriving cell-state specific transcriptional signatures revealed a selective association of TR-TEX cells with patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade, and only TR-TEX but not TRM cells responded to PD-1 pathway inhibition in vivo. These data suggest that TR-TEX and TRM cells are developmentally distinct cell types that share a tissue-residency program but have distinct roles in disease control.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

B cells typically encounter antigens bound to the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to the formation of the immunological synapse (IS). To gain a deeper understanding of lymphocyte activation, we developed a dynamic micropatterning technique that enables the modeling of IS formation with exceptional spatial and temporal control. Using this method, we can image B cells before and after BCR engagement, in both fixed and live samples. We compared the activation of different BCR proximal signaling proteins in activatory and non-activatory areas of the synapse and found that the activated signaling proteins exhibited distinct spatial distributions. While pCD79A was strongly localized in the antigen-tethered area, surprisingly, pPLCg2 was enriched in regions lacking BCR ligands. We also visualized the formation of the IS in living cells using enhanced-resolution microscopy in 3D. We identified different cell behaviors during this process, including the repurposing of pre-existing actin-based protrusions as ready-made building blocks for the IS - a feature uniquely detectable with this highly controllable system. Extending our approach to include a co-stimulatory B cell ligand, ICAM-1, and T cell system using CD3 and CD28 antibodies as ligands, we demonstrate the broader applicability of this method.

E.", "abstract": "Remodeling of cell membranes into vesicles is essential for receptor transport into cells and viral escape from infected cells. Membranes must be forced into these highly curved vesicles, and this is primarily driven through a structured assembly of multiple, multivalent interacting protein subunits forming a lattice. Lattice assembly from these subunits is a stochastic process, and intermediate structures formed during growth can vary in both structure and stability. Here we show that the membrane bending energy cost per protein rises significantly when remodeling is driven by lattice intermediates that deviate from compact, ideal spherical structures. We use a continuum membrane mechanics model coupled to lattice intermediates assembled from stochastic rigid-body simulations of HIV-1 Gag lattice assembly to quantify the bending energy as it systematically varies with lattice eccentricity. Our results show that highly eccentric lattices induce a higher bending energy cost because the lattices still deform the membrane into an approximate spherical cap, but the radius of the cap is larger due to the imperfect lattice geometry. These quantitative trends are also nearly independent of the density of links to the membrane, emphasizing the importance of the lattice perimeter shape instead. Rescaling thus recovers an approximately universal bending energy cost when evaluated relative to the circumscribing sphere of the lattice intermediates. These results show that assembly pathways coupled to membrane remodeling face much stronger selection pressure for highly compact growth compared to solution assembly pathways due to bending energy costs and provide a tool to characterize these pathways during processes like viral budding and endocytosis.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

CAPAN1 pancreatic tumor cells and either HS5 bone marrow stromal cells or umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) cocultured in ultra-low-adhesion 96-well plates. PBMC cells (activated or non-activated) were added to infiltrate pre formed tumor/stromal or mesenchymal spheroids. Then after 48 hours post-seeding and 24 hours post-PBMC incubation, spheroids were incubated with Image-iT Green Hypoxia to mark hypoxic cores, and after 72 hours spheroids were dissociated and stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25 and CD127 antibodies. SpheroMap Cytometry revealed that non-activated immune cells infiltrated spheroids with a distinct pattern between normoxic and hypoxic regions, with an enrichment of CD4 over CD8 cells in the hypoxic core and a higher proportion of CD4posCD25posCD127 neg Treg-like cells. Pre-activation of PBMCs enhanced CD8 cell infiltration into the hypoxic region and increased CD25/CD25high/CD127neg Tregs in both compartments, indicating that T cell activation, while facilitating CD8 cell entry into hypoxic zones, may also promote immunosuppressive populations that impair cytotoxic function. Notably, the effects we observed from the infiltration of pre-activated lymphocytes into tumor/stromal spheroids were not seen in spheroids formed with tumor/mesenchymal cells, which may reflect the immunosuppressive role of umbilical cord mesenchymal cells.

Toward addressing this key knowledge gap comprehensively, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to longitudinally profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SIV-infected non-human primates longitudinally.

Consequently, informing on the abundance and ecological characteristics of fungal pathogens, such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), through tools such as mathematical models is of the utmost importance with respect to current conservation efforts. While traditional mathematical models, such as the logistic growth model, can infer basic details on Bd abundance, the model's simplistic nature renders it unable to account for myriad external factors. So, to inform on some of these factors, namely temporal fluctuations in the Bd growth rate, and carrying capacity, we extended the logistic growth model to consider combinations of time-varying coefficients. For our new models, we estimated model parameters from publicly available data on Bd zoospore density across multiple temperature ranges and geographies, assessing the quality of model fit relative to complexity by Akaike Information Criterion, and Akaike weights, in addition to characterizing potential long-term behaviors through stability analysis. Our work shows that our time-varying growth rate and carrying capacity model was at least 1.4 times more likely to reflect Bd abundance at optimal temperature ranges. This suggests a multi-pronged approach for hindering Bd, namely at non-optimal temperatures, conservation efforts such as tadpole removal and water disinfection should be utilized consistently, and at optimal temperatures, they should be timed to when they generate the greatest benefit with respect to the elimination of Bd zoospores.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation and spatio-temporal spread of -synuclein (-syn) oligomers and a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. To investigate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of -syn oligomer spreading, we employed spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a transgenic PD mouse model. We identified -syn spreading to the substantia nigra and defined a transcriptional \"Spreading Signature\" associated with -syn pathology. We found an age specific increase in reactive astrocytes, close interactions between reactive astrocytes and -syn, and transcriptional dysregulation of the astrocyte-glutamatergic neuron network. We further identified two subtypes of glutamatergic neurons that are vulnerable to astrocytic changes. Comparative analysis with human PD snRNA-seq data revealed conserved astrocytic dysfunctions, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. Based on our results, we propose a revised model of -syn spreading and highlight 36 genes as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating astrocyte-neuron dysfunction in PD.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Yu, J.", "abstract": "Neural activity at goal locations contributes to learning by providing feedback on the success of preceding actions. This period engages neocortical and hippocampal networks, which serve distinct functions in processing reward and forming associations with experience that lead to reward. A neocortical network signature for reward feedback processing is beta oscillations (15-30Hz). Beta oscillations are thought to coordinate distributed neural processes across brain regions. However, it is unknown whether beta oscillations coordinate hippocampal-neocortical networks during the goal period, or how their dynamics relate to learning. Here, we show that beta oscillations occur in both hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when rats reach goal locations in spatial navigation tasks. Despite the presence of beta oscillations in both regions after goal entry, beta activity in each region differed in spectral and temporal properties. These differences suggest that the hippocampus and PFC are not strongly coupled at the beta frequency. We found the strengths of PFC and CA1 beta oscillations across learning were inversely related: PFC beta activity increasing in strength and CA1 beta activity decreasing in strength. Beta burst properties in PFC also had an inverse relationship to those of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), a prominent hippocampal process required for learning. We found a subset of PFC neurons modulated by both beta and hippocampal SWRs, which had distinct task-related firing patterns. Our results suggest that during outcome processing at goal locations, the neocortex and hippocampus are independently modulated by beta oscillations before becoming coordinated for memory-related processes during SWRs.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A novel deep learning-based framework reveals a continuum of chromatinsensitivities across transcription factors", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.11.669605", "authors": "Burger, L.; Gil, N.; Schubeler, D.", "abstract": "The genome-wide binding of many transcription factors (TFs) depends not only on the presence of their recognition motifs, but also on the surrounding chromatin context. This raises the question of how binding specificity is achieved, which is essential for the proper activation of regulatory regions during developmental and differentiation processes. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed: either opening is a hierarchical process, whereby chromatin-insensitive TFs bind initially and make the DNA accessible for other TFs; or multiple chromatin-sensitive TFs bind cooperatively, enabling them to overcome the chromatin barrier. Here, using complementary genomic- and deep-learning-based techniques, we provide a quantitative framework to assess chromatin sensitivity of individual TFs, and hone in on the definitions and implications of such sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate that the degree of chromatin sensitivity is a continuum across TFs, showing that regulatory regions are activated neither by a purely hierarchical nor purely cooperative mechanism, but by a mixture of both mechanisms. The presented framework allows for a locus-specific as well as global, quantitative assessment of chromatin sensitivity and should help in understanding the binding behaviour of individual TFs as well as their potential contribution to gene regulation.", "date": "2025-08-11", "journal": ""}
