Here, we report that importin , a key nuclear transport factor, is highly concentrated in a distinct subset of MN in cultured human cancer cells. This selective localization is not governed by classical nuclear transport pathways. Live-cell photobleaching revealed remarkably reduced mobility of importin  between MN and cytoplasm. In addition, the subset of importin -positive MN exhibited collapsed nuclear envelopes and compromised barrier functions. Importin  was also enriched in euchromatin regions, where it colocalized with chromatin-regulating molecules. Importantly, importin  and DNA repair/sensing molecules such as RAD51, RPA2, and cGAS showed mutually exclusive localization in MN, indicating that MN comprise distinct internal environments. These findings identify importin  as a molecular marker of the restricted MN state, representing a previously unrecognized microenvironment distinct from subsets characterized by conventional molecular markers of disrupted MN. This framework provides new insights into how MN heterogeneity underlies genome instability and immune evasion during cancer progression.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Given the inherent physiological variability within a population of genetically identical bacterial cells, we ask how the phage infection dynamic reflects such heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a timelapse imaging assay for investigating the dynamics of individual infection steps by a single T7 phage on a single bacterium. This high-throughput, time-resolved assay enables us to monitor the infection progression simultaneously in multiple cells, uncovering substantial heterogeneity at each step and revealing correlations between infection dynamics and the physiological state of the infected cell. Simulations of competing phage populations with different lysis time distributions reveal that heterogeneity in infection dynamics can significantly impact phage fitness, highlighting it as a potential evolutionary driver of phage-bacteria interactions.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

During immune responses, plasmodesmata close, but how this contributes towards a full immune response is unknown. To investigate this, we developed two transgenic lines with which we could induce plasmodesmal closure independently of immune elicitors, using the over-active CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 allele icals3m and the C-terminus of PDLP1 to drive callose deposition at plasmodesmata. Induction of plasmodesmal closure increased the expression of stress responsive genes, salicylic acid accumulation and resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. More homogeneous plasmodesmal closure using icals3m also led to the accumulation of starch and sugars, decreased leaf growth, as well as hypersusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. Based on the profile of responses, we conclude that plasmodesmal closure itself activates stress signaling, raising questions of what signals mediate this response and whether these responses occur in all circumstances when plasmodesmata close.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Models that deal with misidentification have been proposed. However, these models assume that only one sample can be collected per individual at one occasion. This is not true for several monitoring programs based on DNA, for example for those that extract the DNA from faecal samples. The models do not take repeated observations into account, leading to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop an approach that extends the latent multinomial model (LMM) of Link et al. (2010) using a Poisson distribution to model the number of samplings of the same individual on a given occasion. We then conduct simulations to test how our new model performs. As an illustration, we applied the new Poisson model to a collection of Eurasian otter faeces (Lampa et al., 2015). Our model yields unbiased estimates of population size when the expected number of samples per individual ({lambda}) is sufficiently high: simulations with {lambda} [&ge;] 0.36 and five capture occasions or with {lambda} [&ge;] 0.23 and seven or more occasions. In contrast, when {lambda} = 0.11 (corresponding to about 42%, 53% and 62% of the individuals being detected with respectively 5, 7 and 9 occasions), the population size is consistently underestimated. Applying the model to the otter dataset confirms the presence of misidentifications, consistent with the authors' expectations. Our findings indicate that repeated observations can be modelled without bias. The application on otters shows that our model is necessary to accurately estimate population size in presence of misidentification and repeated observations.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

However, the specific effects that these factors have on brain health are still poorly understood, delaying their implementation in precision brain health. Here, we studied the multivariate relationships between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain structure, including cortical thickness (CT) and grey matter volume (GMV). Furthermore, we adopted a systems-level perspective to understand such relationships, by characterizing the cortical patterns (yielded in association to risk factors) with regards to brain morphological and functional features, as well as with neurotransmitter systems. Similarly, we related the pattern of risk/protective factors dimensions with a peripheral marker of inflammation.\n\nFirst, we identified latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT and GMV across the whole cortex. Data was obtained from the UK Biobank (n=7370, age range=46-81 years). We used regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA) embedded in a machine learning framework. This approach allows us to capture inter-individual variability in a multivariate association and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk/protective factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by performing correlations (spin tests) between them and different brain patterns of structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. The association between the risk/protective factors pattern and C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation) was examined using Spearman correlation.\n\nWe found two significant and partly replicable latent dimensions. One latent dimension linked cardiometabolic health to brain patterns of CT and GMV and was consistent across sexes. The other latent dimension linked physical robustness (including non-fat mass and strength) to patterns of CT and GMV, with the association to GMV being consistent across sexes and the association to CT appearing only in men. The CT and GMV patterns of both latent dimensions were associated to the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems. Finally, the cardiometabolic health dimension was correlated to CRP, while physical robustness was only very weakly associated to it.\n\nWe observed robust, multi-level and multivariate links between both cardiometabolic health and physical robustness with respect to CT, GMV, and neurotransmitter systems. Interestingly, we found that cardiometabolic health and physical robustness are associated with not only increases in CT or GMV, but also with decreases of CT or GMV in some brain regions. Our results also suggested a role for low-grade chronic inflammation in the association between cardiometabolic health and brain structural health. These findings support the relevance of adopting a holistic perspective in health, by integrating neurocognitive and physical health. Moreover, our findings contribute to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. In this perspective, future studies should further examine the effects of risk/protective factors on different brain regions in order to deepen our understanding of the clinical significance of such increased and decreased CT and GMV.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Despite its significant importance in crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis remain debated, mainly attributable to discrepancies across genotypes, traits, tissues, populations, developmental stages, growth environments, and species. In this study, we systematically identified heterosis-associated genes and metabolites from parental molecular differences in rice and functionally validated three genes for heterosis of seedling length. We incorporated these heterosis-associated molecules into network modules and explained the variance of heterosis. The predominant inheritance patterns of these molecules were additive and partially dominant effects, namely at mid-parent levels or values between mid-parent and parental levels, respectively. These two genetic effects contributed to heterosis of 17 agronomic traits in rice, including grain yield and plant height across developmental stages. They also explained yield heterosis in diverse hybrid populations and distinct growth environments in both rice and maize, as well as biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis. Notably, additive and partially dominant effects were associated with parental genomic variants in rice, and the number of these variants correlated significantly with heterosis of agronomic traits. Furthermore, we demonstrated the significant impact of parental genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic variation in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis on heterosis for seedling length/plant height. Unlike classical heterosis models primarily focused on genomic sequence variation, our findings provide quantitative insights from genomic downstream information into the molecular mechanisms of plant heterosis, highlighting their potential for improving breeding efficiency of hybrid crops.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate this question in plant cells, which lack centrosomes and form cortical microtubule arrays. We identify KEULE, an essential SEC/MUNC protein, as a dynamic marker for exocytosis that forms clusters associated with and is required for discrete exocytotic events. Live cell imaging revealed that these clusters have stereotyped patterns of protein accumulation and loss, suggesting distinct phases in the assembly and function of exocytotic protein complexes. Super-resolution analysis and Bayesian inference for distance distributions revealed that exocytotic events are not randomly distributed but are significantly enriched in [~]180 nm wide linear domains flanking cortical microtubules, while being under-represented in adjacent [~]520 nm domains. Thus, plant cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional spatial templates for patterning exocytosis, representing a fundamentally different organizational modality that may be shared by other non-centrosomal arrays.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

X-ray irradiation enhances TM formation, thereby increasing radioresistance. We hypothesize that high linear energy transfer (LET) particle radiotherapy is less affected by TM mediated resistance due to its reduced reliance on indirect DNA damage. This study explores the impact of LET-induced DNA damage on TMs formation and GB survival Material and Methods: Formation of TMs was investigated in the primary patient derived glioblastoma stem-like cell lines (S24 and T269) irradiated with different LET, ranging from 3 - 107 keV/m, across dose series (1, 2, 4, 6 Gy) of clinical proton, helium, and carbon ion beams. TM networks and DNA damage patterns, specifically {gamma}H2AX foci, were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Cell survival was evaluated through clonogenic survival assays. Results: The formation of TMs, radiation-induced nuclear DNA damage repair foci, and GB cell survival were correlated with a gradual increase in LET. Consistent with conventional photon/X-rays, low LET proton irradiation promoted TMs formation in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, an anticorrelation between LET and TMs induction was found, i.e., a decreased network connectivity with gradual increase of LET and formation of complex DNA damage. Consequently, LET increase correlated with reduced cell survival, with the most pronounced cell killing observed after high LET carbon irradiation. Moreover, the inverse correlation between LET and TMs density was further confirmed for a broad range of LET modulated within the carbon ion irradiation. Conclusion: This is the first report on the relevance of LET as a novel mean to overcome TMs network-mediated radioresistance in GB, with ramifications for the clinical translation of high LET particle radiotherapy to further improve outcome in this still devastating disease.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

This study explores the predictability of bird migratory behaviour from the oxygen isotope composition of their bone apatite phosphate ({delta}18Op), a promising approach in this regard because: (i) sedentary and migratory birds tend to occupy distinct climatic niches year-round; (ii) their {delta}18Op values primarily reflect the climate-driven isotopic composition of their drinking water; and (iii) this isotopic signature can persist through fossilisation. Bone tissues were categorised based on their potential to yield spatio-temporally distinct climatic records: Early Bone Tissues (EBT), deposited before somatic maturity, and Late Bone Tissues (LBT), formed through bone remodelling over the lifespan. The predictability of migratory behaviour was theoretically assessed by modelling tissue-specific {delta}18Op values for thousands of birds across 77 migratory and sedentary species, using tracking and observational data along with a revised phosphate-water fractionation equation. These theoretical results were confronted with data from 11 extant bird species, obtained using a new experimental framework combining histological and isotopic analyses. A significantly positive correlation between {delta}18Op and the proportion of LBT in bone samples was observed both theoretically and experimentally in migratory birds - particularly in long-distance migrants - and is predicted to be virtually absent in sedentary species at temperate latitudes. Migratory birds that died outside their natal sites can also be identified when their {delta}18Op,EBT values fall outside the range observed in local juvenile and sedentary birds. We conclude that bird migratory behaviour can be inferred from the {delta}18Op values of their skeletal remains, provided the individuals migrated across sufficiently contrasting climatic zones. While this approach cannot detect all migratory behaviours - such as short-distance or longitudinal movements - it is unlikely to misclassify sedentary birds as migratory at temperate latitudes. We therefore argue that this approach can be extended to well-preserved fossil bones to infer past bird migratory behaviours, as long as the palaeoclimatic context is carefully considered. More broadly, this study establishes a framework for inferring migratory behaviour in any vertebrate from non-fully remodelled biomineralised remains.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

SC-islet organoids form normally from DEC1-ablated human pluripotent stem cells, but their insulin release capacity and glucose threshold fail to increase during in vitro culture and upon transplant.

This previously unrecognized terminal forms an enveloping axo-somatic specialization with mixed glutamatergic and cholinergic identities, co-expressing VGluT1, VGluT2, VAChT, and the neuropeptides PACAP, CGRP, and neurotensin, together with calretinin in the presynaptic compartment.

Recent studies have revealed a collection of cytoplasmic and secretory abundant soluble proteins (CAHSs and SAHSs, respectively) that contribute to the extreme resilience of tardigrades. Using computational tools, I examined 39 CAHSs and 28 SAHSs from three representative tardigrade species. Both protein families possess a conserved central region and two highly variable terminal regions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CAHSs and SAHSs have distinct sequences despite functional similarity. Modeling by AlphaFold shows that the central region of CAHSs forms an -helix, whereas that of SAHSs folds into {beta}-barrels. Since dehydration leads to an increase in intracellular protein concentration, I used AlphaFold to simulate CAHS oligomerization and found that they preferably dimerize via their central helix motifs. Examination of CAHS dimers reveals a strong inter-helix interaction and an alternating pattern of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity along the helix bundle. The latter is a common feature found in proteins that interact with lipids. Empirical tests using mammalian cells expressing the representative RvCAHS3 show that CAHSs concentrate on intracellular membranes instead of in proteinaceous condensates during dehydration. Moreover, RvCAHS3 significantly improves cell survival as measured by the stimulation-evoked release of calcium from membrane-bound internal stores like endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these results suggest that CAHS dimers form a mesh covering cell membranes and thus protect the integrity as well as function of membrane-bound organelles during anhydrobiosis.

Although the sequence conserved membrane proximal external domain (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 is partially occluded on the virion surface, epitope-focused immunogens could mitigate access limitations. Here, we found that a MPER/liposome vaccine delivered with single CD4 T cell helper epitope results in a post-priming response hierarchy, eliciting low affinity MPER-specific B cells. Heterologous boosting, however, promotes MPER-specific B cell clonal expansion and enhances plasma antibody functionality. This improvement is associated with increased B cell affinity for MPER and reduced competition from B cells targeting the helper epitope. While helper peptide co-delivery increases affinity of serum antibodies, the outcome of subsequent MPER antibody responses is shaped by the priming antigen. Our results offer insights into heterologous immunization strategies to potentiate subdominant B cell responses against frequently mutating viruses.\n\nSignificance StatementA key challenge in vaccination against mutable viruses like HIV-1 is the immune systems focus on highly variable regions. The conserved MPER segment of gp41 elicits weak antibody responses due to poor B cell accessibility. This study evaluated a liposome-based MPER vaccine strategy. Initial priming generated low-affinity MPER-specific memory B cells, influenced by strong B cell affinity for a dominant T cell helper peptide. However, heterologous boosting overcomes subdominant MPER responses by increasing B cell affinity for booster immunogens while also reducing competition from other helper peptides. Co-delivery of helper peptides enhanced antibody affinity, though the priming antigen was critical in shaping responses.

In this work, using the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome, we found that 39 out of 46 subtelomeres contain TERRA promoters and grouped them in classes depending on their organization. We then discovered 106 intrachromosomal TERRA-like promoters, adjacent to interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) or far away from them. Fortyseven of these promoters are flanked and may regulate the transcription of coding genes, ncRNAs or pseudogenes. Comparative sequence analysis showed that interstitial and subtelomeric promoters belong to a previously undescribed family of segmental duplications deriving from common ancestral sequences. RT-PCR experiments in seven cell lines demonstrated that TERRA transcripts can be synthesized from ITSs. TERRA expression was always low in primary fibroblasts and HeLa cells while highly variable in the other two telomerase positive (HT1080 and HEK293) and in the three telomerase negative ALT cell lines (GM847, U2OS and VA13). The analysis of RNA-seq data from U2OS, HeLa and HEK293 cells showed that 205 ITSs were transcribed in at least one cell lines. The fraction of transcribed ITSs and the level of their transcription increased with the length of the telomeric repeat stretch. Given the large number of transcribed ITSs, we propose that these loci contribute significantly to the production of the TERRA pool.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

This limitation has spurred the development of quicker, alignment-free alternatives, such as k-mer analysis, which are crucial for studying long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in plants. These lncRNAs play critical roles in regulating gene expression at both the epigenetic and transcriptomic levels. However, existing alignment-free approaches typically lose positional information, which can be vital for achieving accurate classification. We propose positional frequency chaos game representation (PFCGR), a novel encoding that improves the traditional frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) by incorporating four statistical moments of k-mer positions: mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. This creates a multi-channel image representation of genomic sequences, enabling machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify plant lncRNAs directly from raw genomic sequences. Tested on seven major crop species, our PFCGR-based classifiers achieve classification accuracies comparable to or exceeding those of the computationally intensive DNABERT- based model, while requiring 80% to 95% less computational time. These results demonstrate PFCGR's potential as an efficient and accurate tool for plant lncRNA identification, as well as its ability to facilitate large-scale computational studies in genomics.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

This systematic review aims to define the neural signatures of temporal prediction in newborns and infants and to discuss them in the context of the development of proximal cognitive and affective neural functions. Eight peer-reviewed studies were included, with 228 infants from birth to 9 months of age. Studies have evidenced that neural signatures of temporal prediction in infants present a broad cerebral localization, including the anterior and medial parts of the brain, especially in the frontal and central areas. Temporal prediction mechanisms emerge well before birth and evolve from early sensory-driven responses to complex top-down processing within the first year, shaped by both innate and experience-dependent factors, with influences like wakefulness and musical exposure that modulate neural integration across sensory and higher-order brain regions.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

E.; Campbell, J. R.; LeGates, T. A.", "abstract": "Background: Chronic alcohol exposure is a major driver of alcohol use disorders (AUD), in part through its ability to induce maladaptive plasticity within neural circuits that regulate reward, motivation, and affect. Excitatory projections from the hippocampus (Hipp) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play a pivotal role in regulating reward-related behaviors, and this pathway serves as a key locus for establishing associations between rewarding stimuli and related contextual information. Regulation of the strength of Hipp-NAc synapses is critical for supporting these behaviors, and aberrant Hipp-NAc plasticity is associated with anhedonia and disrupted reward learning. Methods: To examine acute ethanol effects, we used whole-cell electrophysiology to record Hipp-NAc synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices in the presence or absence of 50mM ethanol. To examine the effects of chronic ethanol administration, mice were exposed to ethanol vapor in a 3-week chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigm. Slices from ethanol and air exposed mice were used for whole-cell electrophysiology to examine Hipp-NAc synaptic plasticity. Results: Here, we demonstrate that acute ethanol application to ex vivo brain slices prevents long-term potentiation (LTP) at Hipp-NAc synapses, without altering presynaptic release probability. Furthermore, chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol abolishes LTP at these synapses, even during abstinence, indicating persistent synaptic dysfunction. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that ethanol has immediate and long-lasting effects on Hipp-NAc plasticity. Given the behavioral relevance of these synapses, this work has important implications for the mechanisms underlying ethanol-dependent effects on reward processing and negative affective states associated with AUD.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

L.; Escudero, M.; Lucek, K.; Marques, A.", "abstract": "Recombination is a fundamental evolutionary process essential for generating genetic diversity, facilitating adaptation, and driving speciation. However, direct measurement of recombination rate remains challenging, as standard methods--such as chiasma counts or genetic linkage maps--are labor-intensive and often infeasible for non-model species. In this study, we identify chromosome number and mean chromosome size as practical proxies for genome-wide recombination rate by analyzing genetic map data from 73 insect species and supplementary analyses of 157 monocentric flowering plants. We confirm the long-standing hypothesis that monocentric species have nearly twice as many crossovers per chromosome as holocentric species, reflecting structural constraints imposed by diffuse centromeres. Using both ordinary and phylogenetically informed Bayesian regression models, we show that recombination rate increases with chromosome number and decreases with mean chromosome size. Crucially, mean chromosome size is a significantly better predictor, particularly in holocentric species. This insight enables recombination rate estimation in thousands of species with known genome and chromosome sizes, thereby allowing hypothesis testing at scales previously unattainable. Building on these results, we present predictive models applicable to poorly studied holocentric plants. Overall, our study highlights the pivotal role of chromosome architecture in recombination evolution and provides an accessible framework for evolutionary genomic research across diverse lineages.\n\nArticle summaryWhy do some species have more genetic shuffling than others? We investigated 73 insect species with detailed genetic maps and found that mean chromosome size is the best predictor of genome-wide recombination rate, not the number of chromosomes. This means we can now estimate recombination rates even in species where genetic maps are unavailable, using only genome size and chromosome number. We also show that chromosome structure matters--species with a single centromere per chromosome (monocentric) have nearly double the recombination compared to those with diffuse centromeres (holocentric). These insights open new doors for studying evolution across many organisms.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate spatial transcriptomics, single cell RNA sequencing, and high resolution imaging of human lung biopsies to map early TB pneumonia and compare with adjacent granulomas within the same tissues. Pneumonic alveolar spaces were dominated by TREM2-associated macrophages, characterized by sparse T cell infiltration, minimal antimicrobial gene expression, and abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and transcripts. In contrast, granuloma cores were enriched for antimicrobial pathways, were surrounded by multiple cell types that walled off infection, and contained comparatively fewer bacterial markers. Our findings identify TREM2 positive  foamy macrophages as a key permissive alveolar niche for M. tuberculosis survival and growth.

High resolution live imaging reveals nuclear accumulation of Fgf3 in producing cells, whereas neighbors receive only extracellular ligand, a feature also observed in other embryonic tissues.

PI4KA is primarily recruited to the plasma membrane through the targeted recruitment by the proteins, EFR3A and EFR3B, which bind to the PI4KA accessory proteins TTC7 (TTC7A/B) and FAM126 (FAM126A/B). Here we characterised how both EFR3 isoforms interact with all possible TTC7-FAM126 combinations and developed a nanobody that specifically blocked EFR3-mediated PI4KA recruitment in TTC7B containing complexes. Most EFR3-TTC7-FAM126 combinations show similar binding affinities, with the exception of EFR3A-TTC7B-FAM126A, which binds with a ~10-fold higher affinity. Moreover, we showed that EFR3B phosphorylation markedly decreased binding to TTC7-FAM126. Using a yeast display approach, we isolated a TTC7B selective nanobody that blocked EFR3 binding. Cryo-electron microscopy and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry showed an extended interface with both PI4KA and TTC7B that sterically blocks EFR3 binding. The nanobody caused decreased membrane recruitment both on lipid bilayers and in cells, with decreased PM production of PI4P.

The wild crucifer Barbarea vulgaris comprises two ecotypes, an insect-resistant G-type and a susceptible P-type, characterized by distinct triterpenoid saponin profiles. To investigate the causal relationship between saponin composition and insect resistance, we established a stable transformation system for B. vulgaris. Expression of the G-type {beta}-amyrin synthase gene LUP5 in the susceptible P-type conferred up to a 95% reduction in Plutella xylostella feeding, accompanied by increased accumulation of three hederagenin-derived monodesmosidic saponins. Comparison of LUP5 expression driven by its native promoter and by the constitutive 35S promoter revealed that the native promoter leads to increased hederagenin accumulation and is activated later in development, which may prevent early metabolic stress and allow coordinated expression of downstream pathway genes. In contrast, silencing of CYP72A552 by RNAi decreased total hederagenin levels by approximately 40% without affecting resistance, indicating threshold-dependent defense. Our results provide direct in planta evidence that LUP5 is a key determinant of natural variation in insect resistance in B. vulgaris, underscoring the pivotal role of the saponin backbone in herbivore deterrence.

However, the extent to which disease progression and antiparkinsonian therapies contribute to this systemic dysregulation remains unclear. To address these issues, in the present study we measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography the concentrations of glutamatergic system-related D- and L-amino acids and their precursors in the plasma of male and female healthy controls (HC) and PD patients across three distinct clinical stages and treatment conditions: (1) early stage L-DOPA naive patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors; (2) mid-stage patients treated with L-DOPA; and (3) advanced stage patients receiving Deep Brain Stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) plus L-DOPA. Our results reveal notable reduction of circulating neuroactive D- and L-amino acids exclusively in male PD patients, while female patients remain unaffected regardless of disease stage or treatment. In male patients, this dysregulation manifests early, with L-DOPA-naive individuals showing decreased plasma levels of L-glutamate and L-aspartate. In mid stage L-DOPA-treated PD patients, amino acid reductions extend to L-alanine, L-serine, L-glutamine, L-asparagine, and L-threonine. Remarkably, in advanced PD patients, with a median disease duration of ~23 years, STN-DBS normalizes the blood concentrations of these amino acids to those observed in HC. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of circulating D- and L-amino acid dysregulation as an early biomarker of PD and demonstrates that, in contrast to L-DOPA therapy, the STN-DBS confers systemic metabolic benefits even at advanced stages of the disease.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Understanding how such functions arise from individual species and their interactions remains a major challenge, limiting efforts to rationally understand microbial roles in both natural and engineered ecosystems. Because current holistic (meta-omics) and reductionist (isolation- or single-cell-based) approaches struggle to capture these emergent microbial community functions, this study explores an intermediate strategy: analyzing simple sub-community combinations to enable a bottom-up understanding of community-level functions. To examine the validity of this approach, we used a nine-member synthetic microbial community capable of degrading the environmental pollutant aniline, and systematically generated a dataset of 256 sub-community combinations and their associated functions. Analyses using random forest models revealed that the sub-community combinations of just three to four species enabled the quantitative prediction of functions in larger communities (5-9-member; r = 0.78-0.80). Prediction performance remained robust even with limited sub-community data, suggesting applicability to more diverse microbial communities where exhaustive sub-community observation is infeasible. Moreover, interpreting models trained on these simple sub-community combinations enabled the identification of key species and interspecies interactions that strongly influence the overall community function.

Location: circumpolar terrestrial Arctic (boreal forest, taiga and tundra). Taxon: 1,550 plant species. Methods: We developed climate-driven species distribution models (SDM) to predict species-specific emerging climate niches under different climate scenarios. The model was parameterized using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database (GBIF) and temperature and bioclimatic variables from the CHELSA data set. Dispersal rates were assigned to each species using a trait-based approach and were used to predict future habitat with a distance-based probability over time. Results: Plant species are predicted to occupy on average only 12.3% (1.5-53.9 95% CI) of their emerging climate niches, with half of the species unable to colonize new habitat by 2100 due to limited dispersal distances. In dispersal limited predictions migration to higher altitudes played a greater role than northward shifts. Decolonization by species (extirpation) due to decreasing climate suitability had a larger effect on species composition change compared to dispersal limitations. Boreal tree species were predicted to expand into the tundra shrinking the treeless areas. Main conclusions: Future plant species distributions and resulting large-scale compositions are affected by species-specific dispersal rates. Even though new suitable niches emerge prominently towards the north, higher altitudes might be more relevant given their accessibility by dispersal over the next century. Although climate niche dynamics could support higher plant species richness across the Arctic, overall richness is expected to decline with climate warming due to dispersal limitations. The colonization of new habitats via dispersal in combination with the decolonization of former habitats due to declining climatic suitability on species level are predicted to cause large-scale changes in species composition, especially at the boundary between the boreal forest and the tundra biome.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, and octopus) provide a unique system to study these processes due to a large-scale chromosomal rearrangement in the coleoid ancestor that resulted in highly modified karyotypes, followed by lineage-specific fusions, translocations, and repeat expansions. How these events have shaped gene regulatory patterns underlying the evolution of coleoid innovations, including their large and elaborately structured nervous systems, novel organs, and complex behaviours, remains poorly understood. To address this, we integrate Micro-C, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq across multiple coleoid species, developmental stages, and tissues. We find that while topological compartments are broadly conserved, hundreds of chromatin loops are species- and context-specific, with distinct regulation signatures and dynamic expression profiles. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of a putative regulatory sequence within a conserved region demonstrates the role of loops in neural development and the prevalence of long-range, inter-compartmental interactions.

While human Cathepsin L (hCatL) has long been regarded as the principal endosomal protease for spike processing, inhibition of hCatK with the selective inhibitor Odanacatib suppressed viral infection in endothelial cells as effectively as the broad-spectrum cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d, implicating hCatK as a key driver of spike processing during the endosomal viral entry. Comprehensive enzymatic profiling demonstrated that hCatK exhibits 24- to 63-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward the Furin-cleavage site (FCS) sequence than hCatL and displays a distinct substrate-recognition pattern at the Omicron FCS relative to the Wuhan variant. We further demonstrate that hCatK is an off-target of Nirmatrelvir, a clinically approved 3CL-Mpro inhibitor, with a sub-micromolar potency (Ki = 0.6 +/- 0.1 uM). A 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of the hCatK-Nirmatrelvir complex delineates the molecular basis of inhibitor binding and supports the rational design of dual-acting antivirals.

A subset of tumors was profiled with spatial single-cell proteomics pre-(n = 13) and on-treatment (n = 11). Cell phenotypes, spatial location and activation states were determined, and cellular colocalization assessed with spatial metrics. Bulk and spatial features were evaluated against treatment response defined by residual cancer burden.\n\nResultsTreatment with bevacizumab amplified chemotherapy effects on proteomic signaling. The immune contexture shifted from suppressive to supportive during treatment through decreased macrophage, regulatory and anergic T-cell density and increased colocalization between epithelial cells and CD8+, CD4+ T-cells and dendritic cells. At baseline, responders had high density of effector memory T-cells, while non-responders had more naive T-cells. In addition, responders had increased colocalization of epithelial cells with macrophages, and effector memory T-cells with M1-like macrophages compared to non-responders.\n\nConclusionsSpatially distinct tumor-immune microenvironments influence response to neoadjuvant treatment, offering valuable insights for guiding treatment decisions.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12s role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.\n\nSummaryOverexpression of the transcriptional regulator Prdm12 in knee-innervating neurons of mice reduces inflammatory joint pain and counteracts inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Immunohistochemical reactivity of Abs against A{beta} peptides is critical for accurate and reliable evaluation of A{beta} burden in patients as well as models of AD. Here, we examined immunohistochemical reactivity of two mouse and one rabbit monoclonal antibodies against A{beta} N-terminal regions using two AD mouse models, AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F. 6E10, 82E1 and D54D2 A{beta} antibodies were used in this study.

Interestingly, the latter two Abs showed blurred filamentous immunoreactivity beyond amyloid plaque cores. Double immunostaining using a tyramide signal amplification method, Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase (FT-GO), suggested that the differential immunohistochemical outcomes were only partially attributable to their sensitivity.

Here, we investigated whether autistic traits in neurotypical individuals are associated with neural responses to a broad array of social perceptual features during viewing naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also tested the generalizability of these effects across two experiments. Ninety-seven participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and watched a set of 96 movie clips and a full movie during an fMRI scan. Intensity of 126 social features in the movie stimuli was continuously annotated by independent observers, and 44 most reliably rated features were used to model neural responses. We examined how consistently the responses to each social feature were dependent on the participant's AQ scores. Replicable AQ-dependent neural responses to social features were found in both datasets. The temporal cortex and especially the superior temporal gyrus (STG), served as a central \"hub\" where autistic traits consistently modulated responses to social features across datasets. Different AQ subscales also revealed distinct association patterns in other brain regions.

L.; Wright, S.; Baucom, R. S.", "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists have long been intrigued by the factors that sustain genetic and phenotypic variation within and among natural populations. Polymorphisms underlying components of floral display -- such as floral color, size, and shape -- are uniquely of interest since variation in these traits impact pollinator attraction, rates of visitation, and pollinator efficiency, which ultimately influence patterns of plant reproduction and therefore fitness. We leverage existing floral variation present within and among populations of Hesperis matronalis (Dames Rocket) to disentangle the relative influence of natural selection and genetic drift in shaping floral trait variation. We employ a multi-tiered approach: we determine if variation in floral traits (color, size, and petal shape) is influenced by geography or environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation, we evaluate whether selection underlies trait variation by comparing phenotypic divergence (PST) with neutral genetic structure (FST), and we perform a Lande-Arnold selection analysis to explore the relationship between fitness and floral trait variation within natural populations. We find that selection underlies the divergence of floral color, floral size, and petal width among H. matronalis populations, with PST > FST for each trait. We find no indication, however, that variation in size in this species is influenced by the environment, but some evidence that variation in floral color and petal shape may be influenced by temperature. Finally, selection analyses of contemporary populations indicate divergent selection affecting combinations of color, petal shape, and plant size. These results suggest that the variation in floral shape in this species may be maintained due to environmental pressures, whereas floral color is influenced by pollinator visibility and the presence of different pollinator groups.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

ASX-173 reduces cellular asparagine levels, induces the integrated stress response (ISR), and reduces cell growth in HEK-293A cells. A cryo-EM structure reveals that ASX-173 engages a unique, hydrophobic pocket formed by AMP, Mg2+, and pyrophosphate in the C-terminal synthetase domain of ASNS, thereby enabling multivalent, high-affinity binding. Based on in vitro kinetic and thermal shift assays, we find that ASX-173 binds to the ASNS/Mg2+/ATP complex and is therefore a rare example of an uncompetitive enzyme inhibitor with potential therapeutic use.

Loss or gain of function SCN1A variants are reported in different syndromes including Dravet syndrome, which is associated with loss-of-function whereas neonatal/infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is associated with gain-of-function. Strategies to predict SCN1A variant pathogenicity and dysfunction have been proposed but are limited by available training data. We investigated the functional properties of four epilepsy-associated SCN1A variants affecting the same codon and sought to correlate channel dysfunction with phenotype. Methods: Whole-cell manual patch-clamp recording was performed on heterologously-expressed NaV1.1 variants. Structural modeling of NaV1.1 variant proteins was conducted using AlphaFold 3. Results: We describe an individual with early infantile onset DEE associated with SCN1A-I1347T, and identified three additional cases from the literature or ClinVar with distinct variation of the same codon (I1347N, I1347V, I1347F). Functional studies demonstrated mixed gain and loss of function properties for I1347T, I1347V, and I1347F, but complete loss-of-function for I1347N. Structural models suggest important interactions between isoleucine-1347 and the sixth transmembrane helices of domains 3 and 4 that are disrupted most significantly with asparagine replacement at this position (I1347N). Interpretation: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A involving the same codon can produce divergent functional effects.

Using a modified, microfluidic-free PIPseq workflow and computational pipeline adapted for Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, we generated the largest long-read single-cell dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to date. This study profiles isoform usage among immune cell marker genes in primary PBMCs and incorporates isoform discovery. We identified 128 previously unannotated genes from known and new genes, several with distinct cell-type-specific patterns across immune cell types, and characterized the expression of marker gene isoforms across cell-types and T cell subtypes. We identified non-canonical protein-coding variants of GZMB and CD3G enriched in unexpected cell-types, including megakaryocytes and monocyte-derived cells.

ACC was also sensitive to conversational dynamics by encoding turn-taking structure. These findings reveal that the ACC regulates dynamic vocal interactions in complex social soundscapes in which parsing meaningful calls from competing sounds is essential for effective communication.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

P.; Ren, C.; Taylor, A.", "abstract": "BackgroundHigh-throughput affinity and mass-spectrometry-based proteomic studies of large clinical cohorts generate high-dimensional proteomic data useful for accelerated disease biomarker discovery. A powerful approach to realizing the potential of these big, complex, and non-linear data, whilst ensuring reproducible results, is to use automated machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) pipelines for their analysis. However, there remains a gap in comprehensive ML workflows tailored to proteomic biomarker discovery and designed for biomedical researchers who need pipelines to optimally self-configure and automatically avoid over-fitting.\n\nFindingsWe present BiomarkerML, a cloud-based workflow for automated, reproducible, and efficient ML/DL analysis of proteomic data for biomarker discovery, designed for novice-ML users and implemented in Python, R and Workflow Description Language (WDL). BiomarkerML: ingests proteomic and clinical data alongside sample labels; pre-processes data for model fitting and optionally performs dimensionality reduction and visualization; fits a catalogue of ML and DL classification and regression models; and calculates model performance metrics for model comparison. Next, the workflow applies mean SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of each protein to model predictions across all samples. Finally, proteins with high mean SHAP values, and their co-expressed protein network interactors, are identified as candidate biomarkers. Importantly, hyperparameters - configuration variables set prior to training models - are automatically fine-tuned via grid-search, and BiomarkerML employs weighted, nested cross-validation to avoid model over-fitting and data leakage.\n\nConclusionsBiomarkerML is scalable, provides a standardized, user-friendly interface, and streamlines analyses to ensure reproducibility of results. Overall, BiomarkerML is a significant advancement, enabling novice-ML researchers to use cutting-edge ML/DL tools to identify disease biomarkers in complex proteomic data.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Life is sustained by the dynamic flow of energy through adenosine triphosphate (ATP), redox carriers such as NADH, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These molecules not only fuel biochemical reactions but also encode information that regulates gene expression, DNA repair, and replication. Despite decades of biochemical study, the mathematical principles linking cellular energetics to genetic regulation remain unknown. Here we present a hybrid neural-symbolic framework that discovers the governing equations of energy-dependent genetic processes. Using simulated time-series data capturing oscillations in ATP, NADH, and ROS, we trained a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) model to learn the temporal dynamics of gene expression, repair, and replication. The trained model was then analyzed by symbolic regression to extract explicit, interpretable equations describing how energy flow constrains molecular behavior. The resulting system revealed an energetic hierarchy in which transcription dominates during high ATP availability, repair increases under oxidative stress, and replication scales with the NADH/ROS ratio. The symbolic equations recovered exponential and sinusoidal dependencies suggestive of rhythmic, quantum-informed energy coupling. Taken together, these results reveal a mechanistic framework describing how cells distribute energy across competing genetic processes. This work introduces generative bioenergetics, a computational paradigm that unifies machine learning, quantum biology, and mitochondrial systems theory. By translating energy flow into interpretable equations, this approach moves toward a unified model of life as a self-organizing, energy-efficient system where computation and metabolism are fundamentally intertwined.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

D.; Guo, J.-Z.; Richardson, P. R.; Cortina, K. E.; Smith, I. H.; Eijogu, D. C.; Hantman, A. W.; Hoekstra, H. E.", "abstract": "Animals have evolved behavioral variation to adapt to distinct environmental features. The expansion of neuron number is a potential neural mechanism underlying this behavioral adaptation. Corticospinal neurons (CSNs) are a classic example: an expansion in the corticospinal system in the primate lineage has been hypothesized to underlie their exceptional dexterity. However, the role of CSN number in behavior has been difficult to assess due to the large evolutionary distance between primates and less dexterous taxa with fewer CSNs. Here, we use deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) to overcome this challenge. We compared two closely related subspecies of deer mice: forest mice, which evolved dexterous climbing to support a semi-arboreal lifestyle, and prairie mice, which are less dexterous. We find that forest mice have about two-fold larger corticospinal tracts (CSTs) driven by an increase in CSN number in secondary motor and sensory cortical areas (M2 and S2). Furthermore, in a reach-to-grasp test of dexterity, forest mice display higher success and greater grasping flexibility, using multiple grasp types. In contrast, prairie mice use a stereotyped scooping motion, consistent with the idea that an increase in CSN number supports more dexterous movement. High-throughput neural recordings during this task revealed a difference in the timing of neural activity between forest and prairie mice in M2, but not in primary motor cortex (M1): in forest mice, the peak of activity was shifted towards the time of grasp. Forest mice also outperform their prairie counterparts on an ecologically relevant climbing task, where they spend more time upright crossing a thin rod, move faster, and right themselves more quickly when they fall, suggesting a general difference in motor dexterity not restricted to hand use. To assess whether the increase in CSN number contributes to observed behavioral adaptations, we generated forest-prairie F2 hybrid animals with shuffled genomes, neural features, and behavior. We find that the F2 hybrids with larger CSTs perform better on the rod crossing task, suggesting that expansion of the CS system likely supports the adaptive increase in climbing dexterity in forest mice. Together, our work establishes the forest-prairie deer mouse system as a novel model to investigate the role of neuron number expansion, and CSNs in particular, in dexterous movement.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Research into the vascular endothelium and its components may improve disease management and patient outcomes. Objective: We investigated the endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX) and its pathophysiological role in murine anaphylaxis, aiming to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Methods: Active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) and passive systemic anaphylaxis (IgE-PSA and IgG1-PSA) models were evaluated in mice. Sulodexide (Sdx) was administered as a prophylactic treatment. eGCX structure and N-acetylglucosamine residues in mouse aortic tissue were analyzed by electron microscopy and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining. Endocan (ESM-1) levels in mouse aorta and plasma were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA. Human sera from beta-lactam-induced anaphylaxis and endothelial cell (EC) secretome samples were also analyzed. Results: ASA, IgE-PSA, and IgG1-PSA models showed reduced eGCX surface area and thickness. N-acetylglucosamine and ESM-1 levels decreased in aortic tissue but increased in plasma, indicating glycocalyx shedding. Consistently, ESM-1 secretion was enhanced in ECs exposed to acute anaphylactic sera. ESM-1 and hyaluronic acid levels differed significantly between anaphylactic patients and non-allergic controls. Sdx reduced reaction severity in ASA and IgE-PSA, increased survival in ASA, and prevented eGCX disruption and ESM-1 release. Conclusions: eGCX shedding, particularly of ESM-1, acts as a key mediator in murine anaphylaxis. Sdx prophylaxis protects against severe reactions and improves survival. Clinical Implication: Therapies based on glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans may mitigate anaphylaxis severity, and monitoring eGCX dynamics could aid diagnosis.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Specifically, Uterine deletion of Erbb3, a member of the ERBB receptor family, using Pgr-Cre (Erbb3d/d or Erbb3f/f PgrCre/+) results in approximately 70% of plug-positive females failing to deliver any live progeny, whereas uterine epithelial deletion of Erbb3 using Ltf-Cre (Erbb3epi/epi or Erbb3f/f LtfCre/+) show normal fertility. Here, we identify stromal Erbb3 as a key regulator of uterine gland branching and embryo implantation. Tridimensional visualization reveals that Erbb3d/d uterine glands lack normal branching, accompanied by reduced in Lif mRNA expression. However, LIF supplementation only partially rescues implantation. Transcriptomic profiling of day 3 stromal cells identified Igf1 as one of the downregulated growth factors in Erbb3d/d females, implicating its involvement in gland development. Moreover, uterine deletion of Igf1r (Igf1rf/f PgrCre/+) leads to a reduced gland branching phenotype similar to that observed in Erbb3d/d uteri.

P. S.", "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass is a vastly abundant renewable carbon source for biofuel production but its conversion to fermentable sugars is significantly hindered by an inherent recalcitrance to enzymatic degradation. Pretreatment technologies are successful in alleviating some challenges related to substrate recalcitrance, yet enzymes like cellulases still exhibit poor activity on highly crystalline and insoluble cellulose. Both cellulose and lignin present several issues with productive enzyme binding and efficient catalytic turnover. To address these bottlenecks, we employed protein supercharging to rationally design a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family-6 exocellulase (Cel6B) and its native fused family-2a carbohydrate binding module (CBM2a) from the thermophilic cellulolytic microbe Thermobifida fusca. A total of 16 supercharged variants were designed across both GH/CBM domains and a chimeric library of 32 constructs, including the native enzyme, were synthesized and expressed in E. coli. The entire library of supercharged enzymes was tested for activity on several cellulosic substrates to identify one key construct, D5 CBM2a -- WT Cel6B, that had a positively supercharged CBM2a that showed 2-3-fold higher activity on all substrates tested at pH 5.5. Purified enzyme assays confirmed that exocellulases behave quite different from their endocellulase counterparts when supercharged using similar protocols. Still, the purified D5 CBM2a -- WT Cel6B mutant showed a 2.3-fold improvement in specific activity compared to native enzyme on crystalline cellulose. Analysis of melt curves depict that, while all other constructs tested have one distinct melt peak near the expected CBM melting point, domain melting is decoupled for the D5 CBM2a mutant. This effect reveals an intrinsic melting temperature of the Cel6B CD nearly 18 {degrees}C higher than the coupled melting temperature of the full-length enzyme. This unexpected catalytic domain stabilization effect of supercharged CBM2a domain is likely the driving force for activity improvements seen for this exocellulase that is otherwise prone to stalling and denaturation on the cellulose surface during processive catalytic turnover cycles. When combining this supercharged exocellulase construct with its endocellulase counterpart, our results show that supercharged enzymes that show the highest activity alone, produced the best synergistic partners. This study highlights another successful implementation of protein supercharging strategy for cellulases and provides another key piece towards building an effective synergistic cellulase cocktail for lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that gut-derived bacterial endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS), may breach the intestinal barriers in PCOS patients and trigger systemic inflammation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition receptor of the innate immune system. This study investigated whether TLR4 serves as a critical mechanistic driver of PCOS pathogenesis by examining the effect of genetic TLR4 knockout (TLR4-/-) in a letrozole (LET)-induced mouse model of PCOS. Our results demonstrate that TLR4 deficiency reduces many PCOS-like symptoms, including elevated luteinizing hormone, anovulation, and metabolic dysfunction. TLR4 knockout also preserved estrous cycling and fertility, improved glucose tolerance, maintained gut barrier integrity, and reduced inflammatory markers in LET-treated females.

Differences in functional pathways between low- and normal-fertility cattle were also investigated. Core ruminal microbes were identified with Bacteroidota being predominant across sites and fertility levels. Alpha and beta diversity metrics showed that the site explained a substantial variation in microbiome composition, while fertility had a minimal impact. Differential abundance analysis using LEfSe identified distinct microbial profiles for each site. Notably, taxa such as Fibrobacterota and Negativicutes were more abundant on one site, whereas Acholeplasmataceae and Lentisphaeria were more prevalent on the other site.

They are among the most mobile and evolvable genetic elements, with broad host ranges and high rates of gene turnover, making them especially effective in spreading antibiotic resistance across bacterial lineages. Using the phylogeny-aware gene gain and loss model applied to 6,895 Enterobacteriaceae genomes, we quantified four evolutionary processes--gene gain, loss, expansion, and reduction-- for plasmid-borne genes. We found that, overall, plasmid-borne ARGs (pARGs) exhibit similar gain and loss rates compared with other plasmid genes, but significantly higher expansion and reduction rates. All four processes were strongly species dependent, with only a minor influence of antibiotic class. Further, pARGs were co-transferred with a broad range of plasmid functional genes, including defense, metabolic, and mobilome modules throughout evolutionary history. Moreover, bacterial clades harboring chromosomal ARGs (cARGs) showed significantly higher acquisition of plasmid-borne resistance than did their sister clades lacking corresponding cARGs. Our results demonstrate that pARGs in Enterobacteriaceae are co-transferred with the broader plasmid gene repertoire on an evolutionary timescale, whereas copy-number dynamics are distinct from plasmids. Moreover, cARGs can serve as markers of lineages predisposed to accumulate plasmid-mediated resistance.\n\nImportancePlasmids play a central role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and the long-term evolutionary behavior of plasmid-borne ARGs (pARGs) could provide insights into the emergence of novel multidrug resistance. We studied nearly 7,000 Enterobacteriaceae genomes and show that pARGs evolve through the same gain and loss processes as other plasmid genes but exhibit markedly higher and species-dependent copy number changes. Moreover, bacterial lineages carrying chromosomal ARGs are significantly more likely to acquire additional plasmid-mediated resistance. This association suggests that plasmid and chromosomal ARGs could act synergistically to accelerate resistance accumulation within specific lineages.

Here we performed a host-cell directed genome-wide screen for host factors required for rhoptry discharge from Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. The screen identified host N-glycosylation and cholesterol biosynthesis as pathways required for normal rhoptry discharge. A trimeric microneme complex, MIC1/4/6, interfaces with both pathways by binding host N-glycans to cluster proteins in a process dependent on host plasma membrane cholesterol. The process can be inhibited by depletion of host cholesterol or competition with exogenous glycans. This clustering of host factors by MIC1/4/6 likely prepares the host membrane for rhoptry discharge, delineating a new step in the Toxoplasma invasion process.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

However, it is not clear how distinct bacterial strains interact with host aging pathways and different healthspan metrics. To investigate this question, we chose Bifidobacteria as our bacterial model. The Bifidobacteria genus contains diverse species that are enriched in both human infants and centenarians, suggesting that they may confer \"youthful\" effects in aging adults. We selected eleven strains from nine Bifidobacteria species that are commonly detected in human fecal samples. Using our human anaerobic gut bacteria-C. elegans aging platform, we examined 1) individual Bifidobacteria strains' contribution to lifespan and healthspan and 2) their genetic interactions with the conserved, longevity-associated transcriptional regulators. We identified two B. longum and B. infantis strains that most strongly increased lifespan and stress resistance. Notably, these two strains act through shared (e.g., ATFS-1/ATF5, HSF-1/HFS1, and SKN-1/NRF2) and yet strain-specific pathways (e.g., NHR-49/PPAR for B. infantis) to enhance both lifespan and oxidative stress protection. Lastly, both strains activate a panel of genes involved in molecular chaperone, antioxidant, and lipid remodeling activities, serving as candidate cytoprotective mechanisms for further investigations. In summary, this study establishes a framework of dissecting the mechanistic links between human anaerobic gut bacteria and conserved host aging pathways that can be applicable beyond Bifidobacteria. While the connections between gut microbiome and aging in humans are complex, our approach provides the beginning steps to uncover strain-level interactions that may ultimately inform targeted probiotic strategies for promoting healthy aging.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Tissues rely on unique landscapes of gene regulation to allow the organism to correctly develop, function, and respond to changes. One component of these gene regulatory networks is RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) which bind and modify RNA molecules leading to changes in the cellular fate of transcripts. The Adenosine DeAminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of RBPs modify RNAs by catalyzing the deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I), known as A-to-I RNA editing. Prompted by recent evidence that ADARs play important roles in germline biology, we profiled editing activity of the A-to-I editing enzyme ADR-2 on transcripts in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. These analyses revealed that many germline editing events are distinct from editing events in other tissues; however, the previously described role of the inactive deaminase ADR-1 in regulating editing activity by ADR-2 is conserved in the germline. We find that complete loss or misregulation of editing has little effect on the expression of edited transcripts within the germline; however, loss of ADARs results in the misexpression of several unedited germline transcripts. Intriguingly, further investigation reveals that these expression changes are buffered at the translational level. In all, the results of this study suggest that ADARs show unique activity in the C. elegans germline and that compensatory mechanisms exist to lessen the immediate consequences of loss of ADAR function within the germline.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

The class IA PI3Ks are a heterodimer composed of a p110 catalytic subunit and one of five possible regulatory subunits (p85, p85{beta}, p55{gamma}, p55, p50). The regulatory subunit plays critical roles in stability, inhibition, and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit. The p110 catalytic subunit frequently contains activating mutations in human cancer, with many of these mutations altering the interaction between catalytic and regulatory subunits. It has been found that different regulatory subunits play unique roles in human disease, but it is unknown how these different subunits regulate p110. Here, using a synergy of biochemical assays and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) we examined how the five different regulatory subunits inhibit, activate, and interact with the p110 catalytic subunit. We find that there are no significant differences in lipid kinase activity or in membrane recruitment between the different heterodimer complexes. HDX-MS in the presence and absence of an activating phosphopeptide also showed only minor conformational differences between different regulatory subunit complexes.

Previous studies links these lipidated neurotransmitters to beneficial outcomes in neurological diseases. Here, we focus on two such endogenous lipidated neurotransmitters, arachidonoyl glycine (NA-Gly) and docosahexaenoyl glycine (DHA-Gly) and demonstrate their further biotransformation by cytochrome P450 enzymes into epoxidized metabolites.

Despite being a vaccine-preventable disease, influenza-related complications from secondary bacterial infections are an important cause of death, particularly among the elderly population. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is the most common agent responsible for influenza-related secondary bacterial infections. Influenza virus vaccination serves as an effective prophylactic strategy for preventing influenza and reducing the burden of influenza-associated pathology, including secondary bacterial infection. However, whether the protective effects of influenza virus vaccination differ in the context of a secondary Spn infection at the level of the host response remains poorly characterized. Here, we present a preclinical mouse model to examine the impact of influenza vaccination in scenarios involving single infections with influenza A virus H1N1 (NC99) or Spn serotype 1; simultaneous infection with both NC99 and Spn (coinfection), or NC99 infection followed by Spn infection seven days later (superinfection). A single dose of trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine (TIV) is able to decrease infection lethality in both secondary bacterial infection scenarios. Protection is associated with reduction in both viral and bacterial titers, decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, protection of alveolar macrophages, prevention of exacerbated lung neutrophil recruitment, modulation of neutrophil activation status and induction of lung eosinophil recruitment and activation.

Here, community composition was characterized using 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding, and analyzed in the context of environmental parameters and chlorophyll a-derived trophic status throughout an 18-month sampling period. Microeukaryote assemblages were dominated by Cryptophyceae, Spirotrichea, Chrysophyceae, and Chlorophyceae, with mixotrophic and heterotrophic taxa dominating across all lakes. Taxa richness peaked at intermediate trophic levels, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Beta-diversity and network analyses revealed increasing community modularity, reduced connectivity, and enhanced temporal variability with higher trophic status. In lakes reaching the hypereutrophic status, communities diverged progressively over time, suggesting the onset of regime shifts. Conversely, oligo- to mesotrophic lakes maintained more connected and stable assemblages.

The granuloma presents a variety of environments differing in levels of oxygen, ions, nutrients, and intra versus extracellular residence, which determine the physiological state of the infecting bacillus and its susceptibility to immune or drug control. Recently, alternative mouse strains such as C3HeB/FeJ have allowed the study of infection and treatment in the context of these varied environments but exhibit substantial inconsistency in development of human-like lesions, both within and between individual mice. Building on the observation that inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2)-deficient mice consistently develop hypoxic necrotic lesions, we have established two simplified models with infection by the aerosol route. The first uses the slightly attenuated M. tuberculosis R1Rv strain, which produces a progressive infection that is contained at a high stable burden by an adaptive immune response. In the second model, vaccination with the attenuated {Delta}RD1, pantothenate auxotroph mc2 6230 protects from an otherwise lethal infection with virulent M. tuberculosis Erdman. This model reflects most contemporary tuberculosis infections, which take place in the context of a pre-existing immune response from vaccination.

In this study, we explore the transcriptomic responses of virgin and mated flies to changes in nutritional environments. We confirm previous phenotypic findings by observing responses to dietary preferences and nutritional needs. Our results indicate that both nutritional conditions and mating status lead to significant changes in gene expression in females.

Conventional transformation methods rely on purified DNA and physical force to drive uptake into the chloroplast, often resulting in DNA shearing and thus low transfer efficiency for large constructs. Bacterial conjugation offers an attractive alternative as this is an entirely in vivo process, enabling DNA transfer without any physical manipulation. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attempted to generate an Escherichia coli donor strain carrying both the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pTA-Mob (52.7 kb) and the cloned Phaeodactylum tricornutum chloroplast genome (pPt_Cp, 132.9 kb). Unexpectedly, pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp proved incompatible: co-maintenance could not be achieved via electroporation, and conjugation with a self-transmissible pTA-Mob variant resulted in a ~10-fold decrease in transfer efficiency. Systematic testing of pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp plasmid variants as well as sequence analysis of evolved transconjugants revealed that the incompatibility arose from the pBBR1 replicon present in pTA-Mob. Guided by these insights, we identified an alternative conjugative plasmid, pRL443, that was compatible with pPt_Cp. Together, these findings provide a framework for dissecting plasmid incompatibility when working with large constructs and establish a functional conjugative system capable of mobilizing the P. tricornutum chloroplast genome.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Individuals vary markedly in the sensitivity of their circadian system to light. Whether these differences contribute to the interindividual variability in chronotype, a behavioural manifestation of internal circadian timing, is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity and chronotype across the general population.\n\nMethods: Participants (adults and children aged [&ge;] 8 years) were recruited in a science museum. Chronotype was determined using the {micro}MCTQ and the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR) to short and long-wavelength light stimuli was used as a measure of melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity. The relationship between PIPR and chronotype and their interaction with age and sex were assessed using multiple linear regression.\n\nResults: Pupil recordings and questionnaires were available from 457 participants, including 284 adults and 173 children. In adults, the relationship between melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity and chronotype depends on sex and age: in young adult men, greater light sensitivity is linked to a significantly later chronotype, whereas it is significantly associated with an earlier chronotype in older adult women. In children, no evidence was found for a relationship between light sensitivity and chronotype.\n\nConclusions: These findings suggest that individual variation in light sensitivity interacts with sex and age-specific differences in the circadian system and light exposure behaviour to influence circadian timing. Light exposure recommendations should be personalised to take into account these sex and age-specific effects.\n\nStatement of significanceWhile individuals differ widely in how their circadian system responds to light, to what extent these individual responses influence internal circadian timing remains unclear. By studying a large and diverse sample of children and adults, our findings reveal that the relationship between light sensitivity and chronotype, a behavioural manifestation of circadian timing, is shaped by both age and sex, offering a more comprehensive understanding of this relationship than previously recognised. Specifically, greater light sensitivity is linked to later chronotype in young men but to earlier chronotype in older women.

Regional cortical GM volumes were derived using FreeSurfer v7.1 for, and WMH volumes were derived using UBO Detector. On follow-up four years later, CE was indexed via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET; a behavioural task) and Interpersonal Reactivity Index - Perspective Taking subscale (IRI-PT; an informant-reported measure). RESULTS: In 129 participants (mean age 87.01 years), Structural equation modelling (SEM) showed associations between insula GM volumes and RMET scores (p=0.001), and between supramarginal gyrus (SMG) GM volumes and IRI-PT scores (p=0.016). Associations remained significant after inclusion of covariates accounting for age, global cognition, affective symptoms, and social networks. DISCUSSION: CE abilities assessed with RMET (a behavioural task) were positively associated with insula GM volumes. CE abilities on the IRI-PT (an informant-reported measure) were positively associated with SMG GM volumes. No associations between WMH volumes and CE measures were found. These findings may inform clinical workflows that use structural MRI investigations looking at social cognitive disturbances in older adults and provide further evidence of the divergent nature of behavioural and self-report measures of CE.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Some visual behaviours are sexually dimorphic, including for example male hoverfly high-speed pursuit of conspecifics, matched by improved optics, and faster photoreceptors. Other visual behaviours are monomorphic, with for example similar foraging flight speeds in male and female hoverflies. However, whether the descending neurons responsible for sensorimotor transformation of optic flow are sexually dimorphic is unknown. To redress this, we combined morphological analysis with electrophysiology of optic flow sensitive descending neurons and compared neural responses to the wing beat amplitude in tethered hoverflies. We found that while optomotor flight behaviour is largely sexually monomorphic, the underlying neural responses are sexually dimorphic, especially at higher optic flow velocities. Additionally, neural and behavioural responses to roll stimuli had a slower onset compared to lift, revealing stimulus specific encoding. Together, our findings uncover a nuanced, sex- and stimulus- dependant sensorimotor transformation, shaped by both neural architecture and behavioural demands.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

R.; Giacometti, L. L.; Barson, J.

Various neuropeptides, often within the limbic system, have been implicated in the regulation of depression-related behaviors. To identify potential neuropeptide involvement in behavioral effects of mTBI, this study used adolescent-age male and female rats to compare the effects of single and repetitive mTBI on depression-like behavior and limbic neuropeptide expression. Female but not male rats displayed increased immobility in the forced swim test compared to sham-injured rats at 5-weeks (chronic), but not 2-weeks (acute) following closed-head injury, and this effect was estrous cycle-dependent following single but not repetitive injury. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major limbic nucleus, mRNA expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin (DYN) was decreased after single injury only in female rats, particularly during the estrus phase, while expression of enkephalin (ENK) was decreased after repetitive injury. In the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), another limbic nucleus, mRNA expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was increased in repetitively injured female but not male rats at 2- and 5-weeks but was unchanged in single injured female rats compared to sham-injured rats. These data suggest that depression-like behavior emerges in the chronic phase following adolescent mTBI only in females, being estrous cycle-dependent following single-injury. Moreover, reduced ENK in the NAc and elevated PACAP in the PVT may contribute to depression-like behavior in females following repetitive mTBI.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated large-scale brain network reorganization using structural connectivity derived from diffusion MRI in patients with 30 hyperthyroidism and 28 matched control participants. Subject level connectomes were analyzed to characterize network topology, with a specific focus on hub architecture, nodal alterations, and hemispheric reorganization. To probe molecular underpinnings, we integrated normative neurotransmitter receptor and transporter density maps with network metrics, assessing their correspondence to observed connectomic disruptions. Individuals with hyperthyroidism exhibited increased structural connectivity, particularly in mid- and long-range connections, alongside disrupted network topology. These changes were characterized by reduced modularity, increased characteristic path length and hub reorganization, most prominently in subcortical and right-hemisphere regions. Importantly, network alterations were functionally relevant, as metrics showed significant associations with clinical and cognitive variables, including FT4 levels, BMI, and perceptuomotor performance in the hyperthyroid group. Spatial neuromolecular correspondence analyses further revealed that DAT, 5-HT2A, and NET were closely aligned with topological changes. Moreover, neurotransmitter-weighted within-module degree z-scores moderately predicted TSH levels in HT. Our findings demonstrate that hyperthyroidism is associated with an increase in redundant, spatially extended white matter connections and a marked right-lateralized asymmetry in network organization. Furthermore, serotonergic (5-HT1a) and dopaminergic (DAT) systems consistently contributed to the modulation of intra-modular hubness, suggesting their role in maladaptive structural reorganization that may underlie perceptuomotor dysfunction in hyperthyroidism.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Many bacteria rely on efflux pumps to survive antibiotic stress, and exposure to antibiotics often leads to mutations in pump genes or their regulators that increase pump expression. Predicting the spectrum of these mutations is important for designing effective antibiotic treatments, but the underlying regulatory networks are large and complex, making them difficult to map experimentally. To address this challenge, we developed a mathematical framework that integrates dynamical equations for efflux pump regulation with a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation and evolutionary simulations. Using this framework, we simulated in silico evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under exposure to the antibiotics meropenem, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin. The simulations revealed mutational spectra affecting the expression of four RND efflux pumps and their shared regulatory network. The most frequently mutated genes were single-target regulators that matched well with previous observations in clinical and in vitro studies. The model also showed that the shared use of the OprM protein by two pumps is a key factor shaping their distinct mutational patterns. Mutations often produced multi-trait phenotypes, manifesting as collateral sensitivity or cross-resistance to antibiotics not used for selection. While cross-resistance evolved readily, its extent depended on initial pump expression levels and thus may vary between strains. Finally, simulations of changing environments showed that efflux pump genes tend to be lost in the absence of antibiotics, suggesting a potential strategy to steer bacterial evolution toward reduced capacity to re-evolve resistance.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Using lectin microarray technology, this study characterized glycosylation patterns in synovial fluid samples from healthy and OA-affected joints in horses, dogs, and humans. Comparative glycan-binding profiles within and between species revealed conserved and distinct glycomic signatures associated with OA. Machine learning models, including classification algorithms, effectively distinguished OA from healthy joints, identifying key lectins and glycan epitopes crucial to these predictions. The identified lectin markers reflect specific glycosylation pathways and potential inflammatory mechanisms, demonstrating their value in differentiating between healthy and OA phenotypes.

In this study, we confirm the ubiquitous expression of ZNF16 in a variety of cancer and non-cancer cell lines and show that ZNF16 depletion reduces cell viability in all cell lines tested. Furthermore, we show that ZNF16 localizes to the nucleolus in a transcription-dependent manner, interacts with the intergenic spacer region of the rDNA and promotes rDNA transcription.

These findings are consistent with broader roles for ZNF16, including the regulation of nucleolar function, a process that is essential for all cells, and provide evidence at the cellular/molecular level of its role in the regulation of cancer-associated genes (e.g., NRAS, BIRC3, EGFR).", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

A key profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-{beta}1), upregulates levels of the fibrosis-driving sialidase, neuraminidase 3 (NEU3), and NEU3 can activate latent TGF-{beta}1 to release active TGF-{beta}1 from the sequestering LAP peptide. In the mouse bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, NEU3 is both necessary and sufficient for fibrosis. In this report, we find that NEU3 levels increase both intracellularly and extracellularly in cultures of human lung fibroblasts within 5 minutes of TGF-{beta}1 exposure. This effect is driven by an increase in translation and is independent of new transcription, supporting a model where TGF-{beta}1 causes a pool of weakly translated NEU3 mRNA to increase translation. The RNA helicase DEAD-box helicase 3 (DDX3) mediates NEU3 translation. TGF-{beta}1 induces dephosphorylation of DDX3 within two minutes, and DDX3 inhibitors block the rapid NEU3 upregulation. The NEU3-TGF-{beta}1-NEU3 positive feedback loop is activated within 5 minutes, and the remaining LAP fragment (after NEU3 activation of the latent TGF-{beta}1 complex) appears to potentiate NEU3 upregulation. This feedback loop is blocked by NEU3 inhibitors. These findings suggest that NEU3 is a rapidly acting amplifier of TGF-{beta}1 signaling, likely through TGF-{beta}1-mediated dephosphorylation of DDX3, and this mechanism may be associated with an early tissue-healing response mechanism that drives the initiation and progression of fibrosis.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

This holds great promise for developing data-driven metrics to measure species responses to landscape-level environmental changes, essential for ameliorating the ongoing biodiversity crisis. A primary cause of declines in local, native species is the expansion and intensification of urbanized landscapes. A species response to urbanization can remain consistent across spatial and temporal scales. However, city-specific factors, such as land-use dynamics or local biotic interactions, can profoundly influence species and cause shifts in responses. This underscores the importance of measuring responses to urbanized landscapes at the local population level in a way that facilitates spatial and temporal comparisons. I propose utilizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and its area under the curve (AUC), a statistical classifier, in a novel way for this purpose. Specifically, the disparity in suitable habitat between urban and adjacent non-urban areas is summarized by a single metric, HDURBAN, which facilitates population-level comparisons across time and space. I apply it to geographic predictions of the realized niche of 1,023 species from a highly urbanized landscape in California, USA. Additionally, modeling virtual species for each of the urban response types introduced by Blairs seminal 1996 study provides place-based, expected HDURBAN scores for urban avoider, urban utilizer, and urban dweller species. Validation efforts demonstrate accurate predictions of expected urban responses of real species in three scenarios. First, following a route-of-introduction hypothesis, non-native species exhibit significantly higher HDURBAN than native species. Second, assessing the robustness of urban responses in space and time, HDURBAN is significantly correlated to the urban response of the same 38 bird species from Blairs study, conducted 450 km apart and 25 years earlier. Third, testing for sensitivity to temporal shifts within species, HDURBAN decreases significantly in a species displaced from urban areas due to negative interactions with a recently introduced, congeneric species. In summary, HDURBAN is a versatile metric that provides a data-driven way to compare species responses, supporting future research into the patterns and processes underlying spatial and temporal variation in responses to urbanized landscapes.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

In particular, reversible hydrogel crosslinks formed through dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) can introduce viscoelastic behavior including stress relaxation. However, traditional strategies to in- crease stress-relaxation rates in DCC gels rely on faster bond kinetics, resulting in faster erosion rates that prevent their use for long-term 3D culture. As an alternative strategy, we explore the use of molecular parameters (specifically molecular weight and degree of functionalization) to in- dependently control the stiffness and stress relaxation behavior while preventing rapid erosion. As demonstration, we develop and validate a modified theoretical model of gel viscoelasticity applied to a two-component DCC gel composed of modified hyaluronic acid and elastin-like protein.

Emerging evidence suggests that the UPR regulates the expression of numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which play critical roles in modulating stress responses. Here we show that expression of lncRNA H19 is downregulated in response to ER stress in breast cancer cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that this downregulation is primarily mediated by the PERK arm of the UPR. Specifically, knockdown or chemical inhibition of PERK compromised the ER stress-mediated H19 repression, while PERK activation significantly reduced H19 expression. H19 overexpression promotes the optimal activation of ATF6 and PERK pathways, while it attenuates the signalling by IRE1-XBP1 axis of the UPR. Bioinformatic analyses across multiple breast cancer cohorts revealed that high H19 expression correlates with poor prognosis, particularly in basal-like subtypes. Furthermore, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, H19 was found to provide resistance to ER stress-induced apoptosis.

Proteomic analysis of LyECs and ELISA studies in conditioned media of LyECs revealed that one of the secreted proteins, Wnt7a was uniquely expressed at day 2 post PHx. In vitro studies confirmed that Wnt7a is a potent stimulator of proliferation for both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In vivo inhibition of lymphangiogenesis and reduction in Wnt7a led to a decline in the percentage of CK19+ cholangiocytes and bile ducts. Western blot analysis showed that Wnt7a activated the downstream Frizzled 7 receptor and non-canonical planar-cell-polarity pathway to drive the proliferation of cholangiocytes. In vivo, Wnt7a loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish along with inhibitor studies in rat models of PHx further re-iterated clear links between Wnt7a and proliferation of bile ducts.

This study tested the hypothesis that enhanced hepatic serine synthesis is necessary for glucose and lipid adaptations to SAAR. Hepatocyte-specific PSAT1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) littermates were fed a high-fat control or SAAR diet. In WT mice, SAAR increased liver PSAT1 protein ([~]70-fold), serine concentration ([~]2-fold), and 13C-serine ([~]20-fold) following an intravenous infusion of [U-13C]glucose. The elevated liver serine and partitioning of circulating glucose to liver serine by SAAR were attenuated in KO mice. This was accompanied by a blunted improvement in glucose tolerance in KO mice fed a SAAR diet. Interestingly, SAAR decreased liver lysine lactoylation, a SAA-supported post-translational modification known to inhibit PHGDH enzymatic activity. This suggests dietary SAAR may increase serine synthesis, in part, by lowering lysine lactoylation. Beyond glucose metabolism, dietary SAAR reduced body weight, adiposity, and liver triglycerides similarly in WT and KO mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that hepatic PSAT1 is necessary for glucose, but not lipid, adaptations to SAAR.\n\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSO_LIDietary SAAR increases glucose partitioning to liver de novo serine synthesis\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of liver PSAT1 abrogates improvements in glucose tolerance by SAAR.\nC_LIO_LISAAR lowers lysine lactoylation, a SAA-supported post-translational modification known to inhibit serine synthesis enzymes.\nC_LIO_LIHepatic PSAT1 is not necessary for SAAR to lower adiposity and liver triglycerides.\nC_LI\n\ngraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/682938v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf98org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d0842org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e95d15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1de2f81_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we aimed to characterize the limitations to photosynthesis imposed by stomatal conductance (gs), mesophyll conductance (gm), and biochemical processes under waterlogging and subsequent reoxygenation. Two soybean cultivars (Glycine max L. cv. Fukuyutaka and Iyodaizu) were subjected to 6 days of waterlogging, after which excess water was drained. The responses of Asat, gs, gm, and the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) were investigated. In both cultivars, A declined significantly within 4 days of waterlogging and did not recover completely by two weeks of reoxygenation. During waterlogging, CO2 concentration at carboxylation site decreased in parallel with gs and gm, indicating that photosynthesis was mainly limited by diffusional factors (combination of gs and gm). After drainage, diffusional limitation persisted during early reoxygenation, whereas biochemical limitation due to reduced Vcmax became dominant after 7 days of reoxygenation. Therefore, maintaining high diffusional conductances and Vcmax during waterlogging and reoxygenation, respectively, is important for enhancing photosynthetic tolerance to waterlogging stress. Overall, our results demonstrate that Asat under waterlogging and reoxygenation is dynamically constrained by multiple factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive assessment of gas diffusion and carbon assimilation processes.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, through integrated transcriptomic analyses, we identified a sperm-specific transcription factor in rice that likely functions as a key initiator of embryogenesis. Ectopic expression of this factor in egg cells effectively induces parthenogenesis and produces haploid progeny. When combined with clonal gametogenesis, this system achieved nearly complete synthetic apomixis, with clonal seed production rates exceeding 99% across all derived hybrid rice lines. Moreover, we generated apomictic hybrid lines that not only consistently produced over 99% clonal seeds but also exhibited seed yields comparable to conventional F1 hybrids.

Although individual hand or paw preferences are typically stable, they can be reshaped through experience or training, underscoring the plasticity of lateralized motor circuits2. However, the neural mechanisms that enable this behavioral switching remain unclear. Here we show that experience-driven shifts in paw preference in mice arise from asymmetric cholinergic modulation between the two hemispheres. Using a behavioral paradigm designed to induce paw switching, we found that a subset of animals developed a stable change in preference following training. Selective activation or inhibition of cholinergic neurons on one side of the brain was sufficient to bias this switching behavior. During lateralized movements, an endogenous imbalance in cholinergic activity emerges between the hemispheres, suggesting that interhemispheric cholinergic asymmetry enables motor flexibility. These findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which cholinergic signaling dynamically regulates lateralized motor control, providing insight into how hemispheric imbalances may shape persistent individual motor preferences.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Choi, J. H.", "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia(FCD) is a leading cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, traditionally attributed to impaired inhibition. However, recent ultrastructural evidence suggests excitatory synaptic alterations may also contribute. To investigate this, we performed computational modeling of human pyramidal neurons in NEURON, incorporating electron microscopy derived dendritic spine morphologies. Baseline and FCD-like models were constructed with differences in spine density and morphology while maintaining comparable net synaptic input. Simulations revealed that reduced spine density increased input resistance and amplified excitatory postsynaptic potentials, enhancing dendritic to somatic transmission. Spine neck geometry, but not head size, critically shaped voltage compartmentalization. The altered model required markedly fewer synchronous inputs to reach spiking threshold and exhibited higher firing rates under Poisson distributed synaptic activity, particularly under sparse input conditions. These results demonstrate that excitatory microstructural changes - reduced spine density and weakened neck compartmentalization - can elevate neuronal excitability, in addition to the inhibitory deficit which is the biggest known effect. These findings highlight excitatory spine remodeling as another key driver of epileptogenesis. We speculate that extending this analysis will be essential to fully understand circuit-level hyperexcitability and to identify new therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

A total of 109 thermophilic bacterial isolates were obtained from PAMA and subjected to morphological, biochemical, and molecular characterization at The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. Standard protocols were used for physical and biochemical analysis, while molecular identification involved 16S rRNA profiling, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and DNA sequence analysis. PCR amplicons of selected isolates with distinct RFLP patterns were sequenced, and the DNA sequences were analyzed using BLAST to determine species identity. Results revealed the presence of Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacillus borstelensis, and Paenibacillus dendritiformis in the majority of analyzed rhizosphere samples. Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis were the most dominant species in PAMA, accounting for 45% and 30% of the isolates, respectively. In addition, lower frequencies of other species, such as Paenibacillus dendritiformis (10-15%), were also observed. These findings demonstrate that Panicum antidotale supports a unique rhizospheric bacterial community dominated by thermophilic Bacillus species. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation of PAMA microbiota in the Cholistan desert. The results provide novel insights into bacterial diversity in extreme environments and highlight the potential role of these communities in plant growth promotion and stress adaptation.

Strict control of T3SS expression is critical for facultative pathogens such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, as the T3SS is indispensable for virulence but is metabolically costly. We previously showed that the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-coordinating transcription factor IscR controls expression of LcrF, the master regulator of the Yersinia T3SS and the YadA adhesin. Clusterless apo-IscR, the predominant IscR form during high cellular Fe-S cluster demand (aerobic, low iron conditions), promotes LcrF, T3SS, and YadA expression. Importantly, binding of apo-IscR to the lcrF promoter at a type II IscR binding site facilitates Yersinia disseminated infection. Here, we show that mutating the lcrF promoter to allow only [2Fe-2S]-IscR binding (lcrFpTypeI) results in hyperexpression of LcrF, the T3SS, and YadA during low Fe-S cluster demand (anaerobic, iron replete conditions). These data suggest that switching the form of IscR that can bind to the lcrF promoter reversed how iron and oxygen regulate Yersinia virulence factors. We used barcoded Y. pseudotuberculosis to probe how control of the lcrF promoter in response to iron and oxygen modifies infection dynamics. We found that the lcrFpTypeI mutant experiences a tighter bottleneck in the cecum, where Yersinia is expected to experience a low oxygen, iron replete environment. Taken together, these findings suggest that by tying T3SS and YadA expression to cellular Fe-S cluster demand, Yersinia can fine-tune its virulence repertoire to the host tissue microenvironment.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

These arboviruses are present all over the world, and several members can cause severe disease. New viruses are continuously discovered, but rarely isolated and analysed in cell culture to assess their risk to humans. Here, we describe the in cellulo characteristics for two closely related African phleboviruses, Ntepes virus (NTPV) and Gabek Forest virus (GFV), for which human seroprevalence has been reported but pathogenicity remains unknown. For both viruses, human cell lines from liver, lung, and kidney were permissive, and their capacity to suppress and cope with the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system was comparable to Rift Valley fever phlebovirus MP-12. Consequently, their non-structural protein NSs, a well-known virulence factor of Phenuiviridae, was able to interfere with both the induction and signaling of IFN. Blockade of IFN induction is a conserved NSs activity, and we found that in the case of NTPV and GFV, the NSs targets MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein), a cellular signaling adapter which plays a key role in the induction of IFN gene expression. NTPV and GFV NSs thereby strongly and specifically bind the N-terminal CARD (Caspase recruitment domain) of human MAVS, thus occupying the very domain that is required for MAVS to relay the signal coming from the virus sensor RIG-I. Thus, the cell line tropism, IFN system interactions and NSs mechanisms suggest that NTPV and GFV fulfill the in cellulo criteria for successful infection of humans.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

However, unlike eukaryotes, archaea lack cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases and thus the mechanism of cell cycle regulation remained enigmatic. Here, we show that three essential ribbon-helix-helix domain transcription factors, namely, aCcr1, aCcr2, and aCcr3, play pivotal roles in controlling the cell cycle progression in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Saccharolobus islandicus. Coordinated expression of aCcr1 during M-G1 phase, aCcr3 during G1-S phase, and aCcr2 throughout the cell cycle ensures the timely transcription of the key genes that define the cell cycle phases. These include genes involved in chromosome dimer resolution, chromosome segregation, cell division, chromatin organization, DNA replication and repair, protein phosphorylation and degradation and metabolisms of amino acids, tRNA and carbohydrates. The synergy between aCcr1, aCcr2, and aCcr3 is achieved through their differencial affinities for the promoters and the levels of protein expression. We propose that the global regulation of the Sulfolobales cell cycle may be achieved not through transcriptional activation, but rather by repression of the key genes during strategic moments of the cell cycle. We propose a braking point model for the cell cycle control in Sulfolobales, which may represent a simple evolutionary intermediate on the way to the more complex cell cycle regulation in eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Despite advancements in human organoid technology for modeling pre-implantation blastocyst stage, robust systems that accurately recapitulate MES specification and PS formation during the post-implantation stage remain limited. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to generate three-dimensional MES organoids that faithfully mimic in vivo human MES specification, particularly from the anterior PS. We demonstrate that MES organoid formation is dependent on PTEN expression and that loss of PTEN severely impairs the formation of mesoderm and definitive endoderm derivatives arising from MES organoids. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects, we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis, including transcriptome, chromatin accessibility profiling, metabolism, and phosphoproteomics, on wild-type and PTEN-/- MES cells. These analyses revealed that PTEN suppresses retinoic acid (RA) signaling during MES lineage commitment. Furthermore, we identified the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26A1 as a downstream effector of PTEN. Notably, while excessive RA induced by PTEN ablation is detrimental to MES cell generation, physiological levels of RA are necessary. Collectively, our human MES organoids offer a valuable model for dissecting early human development, and our findings identify PTEN as a key regulator of MES fate commitment through inhibition of RA signaling.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

We found no extinction debt: species richness remained stable, but community composition shifted rapidly. Forest specialists declined non-linearly within three decades post-fragmentation before partially recovering, whereas open-habitat species showed the opposite pattern. Dispersal-limited species lost richness without compositional change, while highly-dispersive species maintained richness but altered community composition.

In particular, introduced rodents represent one of the most serious threats to island ecosystems, affecting a wide range of native plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. While nearly ubiquitous on human-modified islands, the last four decades have seen the advent of targeted rodent eradications, which have generally resulted in positive impacts for biodiversity. Invertebrates, which are crucial to the functioning of island ecosystems, are known to be negatively impacted by rodents, but their response to rodent removal is less well understood. The largest rodent eradication on an inhabited island was undertaken in 2019 on Australia's Lord Howe Island, which successfully extirpated black rats (Rattus rattus) and house mice (Mus musculus) more than a century after their introduction. To examine the impacts of rodents on invertebrates on Lord Howe Island, we collected arboreal and terrestrial species both pre- and post-eradication and identified them to Order. Total invertebrate abundance increased after the eradication of rodents, alongside substantial shifts in assemblage composition, however Ordinal diversity did not change significantly. Orders with large increases in abundance included Isopoda and Blattodea, while the abundance of Coleoptera and Polydesmida did not change. In addition, the abundance of large invertebrates, which are presumably subject to stronger rat predation, rose dramatically following rodent eradication. Our results suggest an ecological rearrangement following the relaxation of predation pressure and augment documented evidence of improved biodiversity outcomes for forest tree species, seabirds and land birds.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

How this balancing is computed is not well understood. We have approached this problem at the level of neural population-coding by examining the effect of progressive starvation on a hypothalamic line attractor that encodes an internal state of aggressiveness. Moderate fasting yielded 'hangry' mice, decreasing attack latency and increasing attack frequency. In parallel, line attractor ramping rate and stability were increased, suggesting that hunger enhances aggressiveness by modifying neural dynamics. In contrast, prolonged starvation inhibited aggression and eliminated the line attractor. In satiated mice, titrated acute chemogenetic activation of arcuate AgRP neurons recapitulated the biphasic effects of progressive starvation, suggesting that a continuous increase in hunger exerts bi-directional influences at different intensities. When confronted with food and an intruder, hangry mice alternated between feeding and fighting. During eating, population neural activity moved out of the line attractor while activity in the attractor dimension remained unchanged. Following feeding, activity rapidly relaxed back into the attractor and aggression resumed. Thus, the line attractor may serve to keep hungry animals primed for aggression during intermittent feeding bouts.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Histopathology imaging is the diagnostic gold standard, involving examination of tissue biopsies to identify characteristic inflammatory patterns, cellular changes, or microbial pathogens. However, its analysis is often limited by variability in tissue sampling and staining, subjective interpretation, inter-observer differences, and the absence of visible microbial grains in early disease stages. To elevate these challenges, we develop the Skin INfectious Diseases Intelligent (SINDI) framework, an integrated machine learning pipeline combining shallow learning, deep learning, stain normalization, and explainable AI to automate and enhance diagnostic accuracy from histopathology images. The SINDI framework is designed to systematically tackle increasingly complex tasks in diagnostics, including (1) disease phenotype classification and pathogen species identification, (2) understanding the importance of disease-specific regions (grains) and classification of grain-free images lacking visible microbial structures, (3) semantic segmentation of pathological features, and (4) explainable AI-driven interpretable decision support. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 1,324 histopathology images representing four predominant mycetoma pathogens that are curated by expert pathologists, alongside 7,000 healthy skin tissue images, SINDI demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in binary and multi-class classification tasks, particularly when employing Macenko stain normalization and domain-specific features. Remarkably, SINDI achieved high accuracy on images with masked grain regions and even on grain-free images, which are considered diagnostically intractable by human experts. Semantic segmentation models accurately delineated phenotype-related regions, while explainable AI methods provided transparent and clinically relevant interpretability of model decisions. Our results indicate that diagnostically relevant information is distributed beyond visible lesion areas, challenging traditional pathology paradigms.

With the rising global demand for rice due to population growth, the need for effective methane mitigation strategies in rice cultivation is increasingly critical. This study investigates the combined impact of irrigation methods, fertiliser combinations, and varietal differences on productivity, water use and methane emissions in rice. Field trials were conducted across five land parcels covering 8 Ha in the Sathyamangalam region of Tamil Nadu, India, from October 2024 to January 2025. Results revealed that drip irrigation significantly reduced seasonal methane emissions by up to 68% (128 kg/ha/season) compared to continuous flood irrigation (402.32 kg/ha/season) offering a sustainable solution to address climate change. Furthermore, our modified package of practices coupled with tailored fertiliser combination, led to a 28% reduction in methane emissions (222 kg/ha/season) relative to continuous flooding methods used by the farmers in the region (309 kg/ha/season). Methane emission differences of up to 23.8% were also evident across rice varieties ADT45 (229.7 kg/ha/season and BPT5204 (301.7 kg/ha/season) for. Although flood irrigation yielded a 5 to 6% higher grain productivity than drip irrigation, the TLL fertiliser package under flood irrigation still provided distinct benefits with a yield increase of 5.4%. Notably, water usage under drip irrigation was 42.5% lower on average across the five locations, with minimal impact on yield, resulting in a marked improvement in water use efficiency (0.62 kg./m3 under drip vs. 0.39 kg./m3 under flood irrigation). Our findings highlight the value of integrating modern irrigation techniques, optimizing fertiliser management, and appropriate varietal selection with higher environmental sustainability and improved farm productivity to mitigate climate impact in rice cultivation.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a new method for identifying these assemblies from analytical tests of pairwise synchrony, benefiting from three rigorous criteria for assembly detection and sensitivity to rare but significant coordinated firing patterns. Following validation through simulations and in vivo recordings, we perform synchrony-based analysis on datasets from both primary (A1) and non-primary (PEG) ferret auditory cortex during passive listening to complex natural sounds. We show that synchrony-driven assemblies (SDAs) in both areas exhibit regular temporal dynamics, including the production of stereotypical spike sequences. In-keeping with their enhanced inter-neuronal reliability, SDAs are observed to outperform random assemblies in two versions of rate-based decoding. We extend these results to temporal decoding, and consistently observe optimal integration windows of 10-20ms. Thus, we suggest that SDAs are sufficient for the accurate representation of diverse sets of complex auditory stimuli, and that this increase in information depends entirely on coordination at very fine temporal scales.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

To investigate this hypothesis, we contrasted functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) responses to compare neural responses to images that are equally well recognized by humans, but that differ in whether they could be solved by a feedforward deep neural network; a computational proxy for ventral stream feedforward processing. We found that when feedforward processing in the ventral visual stream is insufficient, additional parieto-frontal networks are rapidly and transiently recruited, representationally reconfiguring the ventral visual stream.

W.", "abstract": "Calcium imaging (CI) is a standard method for recording neural population activity, as it enables simultaneous recording of hundreds-to-thousands of individual somatic signals. Accordingly, CI recordings are prime candidates for population-level latent variable analyses, for example using models such as Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and latent dynamical systems. However, these models have been primarily developed and fine-tuned for electrophysiological measurements of spiking activity. To adapt these models for use with the calcium signals recorded with CI, per-neuron fluorescence time-traces are typically either de-convolved to approximate spiking events or analyzed directly under Gaussian observation assumptions. The former approach, while enabling the direct application of latent variable methods developed for spiking data, suffers from the imprecise nature of spike estimation from CI. Moreover, isolated spikes can be undetectable in the fluorescence signal, creating additional uncertainty. A more direct model linking observed fluorescence to latent variables would account for these sources of uncertainty. Here, we develop accurate and tractable models for characterizing the latent structure of neural population activity from CI data. We propose to augment HMM, GPFA, and dynamical systems models with a CI observation model that consists of latent Poisson spiking and autoregressive calcium dynamics. Importantly, this model is both more flexible and directly compatible with standard methods for fitting latent models of neural dynamics. We demonstrate that using this more accurate CI observation model improves latent variable inference and model fitting on both CI observations generated using state-of-the-art biophysical simulations as well as imaging data recorded in an experimental setting.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

While gene silencing strategies targeting SOD1 hold therapeutic promise, their clinical translation has been hindered by inefficient delivery to the spinal cord and safety concerns associated with conventional viral vectors. Here, we report a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 suppression. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended survival, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA platform demonstrated a superior safety profile compared to shRNA-based constructs, which caused severe toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice.

However, it is unclear how type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impacts mitochondrial function in human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells (HSVSMCs) responsible for the maladaptive remodelling responsible for VGF. Therefore, identifying and targeting the signalling pathways involved could offer new therapeutic options to limit VGF. Our aim was to identify signalling pathways that mediate any mitochondrial dysfunction in HSVSMCs in vitro and assess the impact of T2DM. Methods and results HSVSMCs explanted from surplus HSV tissues from T2DM and non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were treated with known activators and inhibitors of the JAK/STAT and MAPK/ERK pathways. Following this, real-time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measures of mitochondrial function were then determined. Our findings revealed that both IL-6/sIL-6R trans-signalling complexes and PDGF-BB significantly increased OCR in HSVSMCs from T2DM patients but not non-diabetic controls. Meanwhile, only PDGF-BB increased ECAR in HSVSMCs from T2DM patients but not non-diabetic controls. The observed increases in OCR and ECAR were abolished by JAK1/2-selective inhibitor ruxolitinib. Furthermore, thrombin caused a significant increase in OCR specifically in HSVSMCs from T2DM patients, and this was abolished by MEK1/2-selective inhibitor trametinib. Both ruxolitinib and trametinib significantly reduced basal OCR and ECAR in HSVSMCs from both T2DM and non-diabetic patients.

Avian responses to ALAN defy simple patterns, varying in direction and magnitude, and the consequences of these responses remain unresolved.

We found consistent physiological and behavioural shifts under ALAN, while life-history traits were unaffected. ALAN disrupted molecular and endocrine processes, leading to reduced sleep, higher metabolic rate, and accelerated reproductive maturation. Behaviourally, daily activity was extended, with earlier onset, later offset, and increased nocturnal activity and foraging effort. ALAN effects were stronger in migratory species and more pronounced in adults and females than nestlings and males. Higher light intensities amplified activity shifts, ageing, and sleep disruption, whereas exposure below 2 lux had minimal impact.

To understand the origin and evolution of these unique features, we compared the mitogenomes of three R. phalloides individuals and one individual of a newly discovered congeneric species. These mitogenomes comprise dozens of minicircular chromosomes (~2-8 kb), with fairly small mitogenome sizes between 121.1 and 147.5 kb. Each R. phalloides individual contains extremely conserved regions (CRs) on all chromosomes, yet these CRs vary significantly among individuals, suggesting rapid divergence in a concerted manner. In contrast, the congeneric species lacks such CRs. Although nearly identical gene and intron content, there is significant sequence divergence between the two species. Extremely high mitogenome heteroplasmy was observed in all three individuals of R. phalloides and all the variants of protein coding genes are transcribed, but few heteroplasmic variants are shared among the three individuals. No sequence heteroplasmy was detected in the congeneric species. PacBio sequencing revealed concatenated mitochondrial chromosomes in the two species, suggesting rolling circle replication of mitochondrial DNA. We infer that the origins of the CR and sequence heteroplasmy are later than the origin of all-minicircular chromosomes in Rhopalocnemis, and propose a plasmid incorporation model to explain the origin of the CR. The rapid intraspecific variation in mitogenome structure, sequence and heteroplasmy in R. phalloides may result from relaxed selective constraint. The striking heteroplasmy in the R. phalloides mitogenome can not be explained by mitochondrion-targeted DNA-RRR gene loss characterized in this study.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

However, the effectors responsible for this phenotype have remained unknown. To address this question, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni' PR2021, a strain associated with the high-branching cultivar Princettia Pink. Comparative genomics confirmed its species assignment and revealed an unusual effector repertoire. PR2021 lacks most previously described effectors but encodes two distinct SAP11 homologs, a family of effectors known to induce plant branching. Genomic context analysis showed that one homolog is located within a potential mobile unit (PMU) and is nearly identical to the SAP11 of the distantly related 'Ca. P. asteris', while the other is located outside PMU regions and is divergent in sequence and predicted structure. Functional assays using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that each homolog independently induced significant branching, whereas co-expression did not enhance the phenotype, indicating overlapping functions. These findings establish a direct connection between poinsettia branching and SAP11-homologous effectors, providing the first experimental evidence linking phytoplasma effector activity to this horticulturally important trait.

However, the intrinsic differences between the dynamics of cooperation and coordination remain elusive, particularly from an interpretable perspective that bridges behavioural, psychological, and neural scales. Here, we compare and analyze cooperation and coordination within a unified framework by assigning participants to an adjustable public goods game for iterated real-time interactions. By integrating model-free behavioural patterns and psychological intentions, we show that individuals are driven by increased flexibility and are more susceptible to peer influence in decision-making under cooperation. While under coordination, it is easier to reach the group consensus, inspiring individuals to stick more closely to their existing behavioural patterns and the `default' social norms. Furthermore, although peer punishment can enhance reciprocal contributions in all scenarios, the detailed impact and the resultant adverse phenomena (anti-social punishment) in cooperation and coordination are different. Notably, behavioural motive differences are also reflected in the neural responses recorded via fNIRS, in which coordination is associated with activation of the rTPJ and more consistent inter-brain synchronization in the dmPFC, while there is a negative correlation between dmPFC-rTPJ connectivity and contributions under cooperation. In addition, rTPJ during the punishment phase is significantly activated compared with the investment phase.

The rapid adoption of combinatorial barcoding in recent years is due in part to its scalability across cells and samples. However, small shifts in barcode positions within sequencing reads caused by technical artifacts, e.g. during barcode incorporation or synthesis, can impact the accurate assignment of reads to cell barcodes. Existing processing tools typically assume barcodes contain fixed-length nucleotide sequences located at fixed positions within reads, overlooking any positional variability. Consequently, reads containing truncated or mispositioned barcodes are discarded during initial data processing steps leading to significant data loss. To solve this limitation and maximise the retention of sequencing reads from single-cell combinatorial barcoding experiments, we introduce scarecrow. Our tool screens a subsample of reads to generate position-specific barcode profiles, which are then used to flexibly identify barcode sequences in each read whilst accounting for positional errors, a phenomenon we refer to as 'jitter'. Barcode matches are then prioritised to minimise nucleotide mismatches and the degree of jitter. These initial profiles are subsequently used to extract and error correct barcode combinations in high throughput sequencing libraries. By incorporating jitter into barcode error correction, scarecrow enables greater data recovery and improved downstream single-cell analyses. Scarecrow is fully open access, implemented in Python, and generates output files using standardised sequence file formats for maximal interoperability.

By harnessing the intrinsic long-wavelength fluorescence tail of chloroplasts, this method minimizes scattering, extends imaging depth, and enables simultaneous stimulation-imaging with subcellular resolution--capabilities not attainable with conventional visible fluorescence or multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. Using this approach, we discover that submerged leaves of amphibious plants exhibit remarkably rapid avoidance responses to red light, whereas aerial leaves show negligible relocation. Control experiments exclude influence of the physical structure of leaves, confirming that these contrasting responses reflect distinct physiological adaptations to environmental light regimes.

Mutant strains lacking functional desaturase enzymes (elo-1, fat-1, fat-2, fat-3, fat-4, fat-6/fat-7), and consequently depleted in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid, displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to noxious heat compared to wild-type animals. These findings indicate that intact PUFA biosynthesis is essential for normal thermal nociception in C. elegans. Given that arachidonic acid is a precursor of endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG) known to modulate TRPV1-dependent pain signaling, our results suggest that a conserved lipid-based mechanism regulates heat avoidance in nematodes.

While recent behavioral work has applied innovative multivariate methods for testing these theories, neuroscientific assessments remain limited due to a focus on a small number of emotions, single theoretical perspectives, univariate methods, or small sample sizes. We overcame these limitations in a comprehensive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which participants (N = 136) viewed 150 movie clips and 150 text scenarios that reliably induced 15 different emotional states spanning positive, negative, and neutral valence. For the movie inductions, representational similarity analysis yielded a correspondence between the categorical behavioral responses and the brain activity patterns, and partial least squares discriminant analysis achieved strong decoding performance for all 15 emotions from whole-brain fMRI data, with importance maps encompassing cortical, limbic, and subcortical regions. Classification error analyses and a Bayesian model comparison supported the categorical nature of the emotion representations relative to a 2-dimensional arousal-valence model. Hierarchical clustering of the representational dissimilarity matrices revealed that the 15 emotions were organized into similarly meaningful clusters at both the subjective and neural levels. Results from the scenario inductions, while demonstrating similar behavioral effects and behavioral hierarchical structures, were more difficult to decode from the fMRI data. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into how emotions are organized and represented in the human brain and evidence a relationship between our subjective experience of and brain responses to emotional inductions.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

To prevent interference between these processes, the associated neural dynamics may be organized into orthogonal subspaces. In this subspace model, activity in a movement-null subspace encodes internal processes, while activity in a movement-potent subspace relates to movements. The biological implementation of this model, how activity in different subspaces map onto neural circuits, remains unclear. Particularly, it is unknown whether different cell types, with specific connectivity patterns, preferentially contribute to specific subspaces. Here, we test whether the cell type that directly links motor cortex to motor centers in the medulla and spinal cord, lower layer 5b extratelencephalic neurons (L-ETN), preferentially encodes activity contained in the movement-potent subspace. We performed cell-type-specific recordings in the motor cortex while mice performed a delayed-response licking task, and decomposed population activity into movement-null and movement-potent subspaces. We find that L-ETN activity spans both movement-null and movement-potent subspaces in a manner that could not be distinguished from the broader motor cortex population. Notably, downstream medullary circuits retain a subset of the movement-null dynamics contained in motor cortex, with select movement-null signals specifically filtered out.

Using EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and decoding analysis, we found that attending to rotational sequences led to reduced neural response amplitude and systematic anticipatory shifts in the neural representation of orientation, relative to random sequences.

Despite the high abundance of tRNAs in cells, studying their biology remains challenging due to the repetitive nature of genomic sequences and the numerous modifications of mature molecules. tRNA genes (tDNAs) are transcribed exclusively by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII), which has been recently linked to rare genetic disorders but also longevity. Here, we present the first mapping of actively transcribing RNAPIII in the human, using K562 cell line and UV-crosslinking followed by stringent purification. Our data reveals high variability in expression across tDNAs, common occurrences of transcriptional read-through, and unique transcription dynamics across transcription units, with the lowest kinetics associated with transcription termination. Further analysis revealed that release of the nascent transcript is a critical step in tRNA transcription. Unexpectedly, shorter terminators promote more efficient termination, which becomes the rate-limiting step for human RNAPIII transcription of highly expressed tDNAs. Our dataset provides insights into actively transcribing RNAPIII dynamics in human cells, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of genomic loci transcribed by RNAPIII. Our high resolution data and resulting kinetic information reveal that human RNAPIII contradicts the paradigm that initial steps of transcription are the main determinants of its output. This is significant as RNAPIII is commonly used to transcribe synthetic RNA constructs, such as short hairpin RNAs or guide RNAs used in gene editing technologies.

To move towards high-throughput and single-cell RiboSeq technologies, we developed RiboWich (Ribosome sandWich). By directly ligating adaptors to ribosome-embedded RNA fragments, RiboWich eliminates the need for ribosome purification and size-selecting ribosome footprints and tackles two major bottlenecks, expanding RiboSeq for more advanced technologies. RiboWich offers robustness in profiling and excels in detecting upstream translons in immortalized and primary cells alike. By exploiting a dual-step multiplexing strategy, RiboWich enables the simultaneous profiling of at least 96 samples while retaining sensitivity and capturing condition-specific differences in translation. By enabling scalable, low-input translatome profiling, this advancement empowers proteogenomic approaches and AI/ML-driven data analysis to uncover regulatory dynamics, neoantigens, functional small translons, and drug-responsive signatures across diverse biological contexts and users.

We observe that THAP9, a domesticated DNA transposable element-derived gene, is selectively enriched in PGCs but transiently silenced in somatic lineages. Moreover, the gene exhibits lineage-specific expression during pre-implantation development, peaking at the zygote stage, transiently paused during cleavage, reactivated at the morula, and remains enriched in trophectoderm and embryonic stem cells but repressed in primitive endoderm and epiblast. Interestingly, THAP9 is dynamically regulated across gametogenesis, with prominent expression in spermatids and germinal vesicle oocytes. Epigenomic profiling revealed progressive chromatin remodelling, including early bivalency and enhancer activation, consistent with roles in transcriptional reprogramming.

This raises the possibility that pitcher plants and their arthropod visitors engage in an indirect mutualism in which both insects and plants incur some cost but reap net nutritive benefits, yet evidence that potential prey species derive measurable nutritional benefits from pitcher plants is currently lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we measured levels of nitrogen isotopic enrichment of vespulid wasps residing in dense stands of the naturally 15N-enriched pitcher plant Darlingtonia californica relative to those from adjacent forest patches.

While these features contribute to health risk, they have also been interpreted as adaptive remodeling of the immune system in response to accumulating somatic damage. Here we consider a recently developed theoretical framework to understand these processes as interrelated: the Brain-Body Energy Conservation model of aging. This model views functional declines, such as immunosenescence, as part of an energy conserving response to the rising energy expenditure of inflammaging. This response promotes short term survival against somatic damage at the expense of future health risk. For example, naive T cells, which enhance defense against future infections, decline with age. We find evidence consistent with this model in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and UK Biobank (UKB). TNFR1, a key marker of inflammaging, mediated 10% and 5% of the age-related declines in naive CD4T and CD8T cells respectively in the HRS (n = 8,261).

Their utility has however been limited by the degradation caused by fixation and long-term storage, particularly for samples archived for many decades. Methods: This study evaluates a cohort of 79 FFPE tissue blocks collected and archived in 1973 from the Strasbourg Pathological Tissue Archive (SPTA), and a cohort of 51 FFPE tissue blocks from the Geneva Brain Bank (GBB), collected between 1928 and 1971. DNA was quantified using a forensic-grade quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (QIAGEN Investigator Quantiplex Pro Kit on a Rotor-Gene Q) to precisely measure human DNA concentration, assess degradation, and detect PCR inhibition. Results: A high proportion of the samples yielded human DNA fragments of 80bp and 95bp and very few fragments of 205bp. All organ samples treated with Bouin liquid (n=12) gave poor results, but among samples fixed in formalin (n=117), 58.1% showed over 0.25ng/L of 80bp human DNA fragments and 37.6% over 1ng/L. We propose a model to describe the decay of these samples and estimate the proportion of samples that should yield at least a 0.25ng/L concentration of fragments over 100bp to 45.1%. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that automated extraction methods optimized for FFPE allow for the recovery of usable material even in century-old archived samples with inconsistent conditions of conservation. Our data suggests that the time spent in storage is much less influential on DNA quality than initial fixation time. Crucially, given the fragmented nature of the material recovered (an expected result), future analyses of this material will have to be conducted using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and approaches that rely on short fragments.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is a key organizer of domains and loops, but existing methods either predict contacts without mechanistic insight or simulate extrusion with limited scalability. We present the differentiable loop extrusion model (dLEM), a scalable framework that reformulates extrusion as a smooth, trainable process. dLEM represents extrusion through position-specific velocity profiles for leftward and rightward cohesin movement. Fitting dLEM to chromosome conformation capture data yields a one-dimensional, interpretable description of extrusion dynamics that aligns with genomic and epigenomic features. dLEM parameters also capture architectural changes under CTCF and WAPL perturbations, enabling genome-wide prediction of extrusion disruptions. Extending our observations, we demonstrate that dLEM can be seamlessly incorporated into deep learning models to infer extrusion parameters directly from sequence and chromatin features, reducing model complexity by nearly three orders of magnitude while preserving predictive accuracy. Indeed, when incorporated into deep dLEM, dLEM acts as a biophysically-motivated layer for long range genomic communication, and together they provide a predictive, interpretable framework linking 1D genomic features to 3D chromatin folding and its response to sequence and chromatin state, with dLEM's mechanistic modeling enabling prediction of trans factor perturbation effects.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Its success is linked to a unicolonial structure, where vast supercolonies span thousands of kilometers and ants from different nests coexist without aggression. In Europe, for example, one supercolony stretches over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast. Despite this apparent unity, neighboring nests show subtle genetic and chemical differences, raising the question of whether ants can recognize individuals from other nests within the same supercolony, and whether such recognition influences cooperation, particularly food sharing. We tested this in both a native population (Argentina) and an invasive one (France), combining behavioral assays of food exchange with cuticular hydrocarbon profiling. Argentine ants in both ranges discriminated between nestmates and non-nestmates within supercolonies, but the bias was expressed only during early interactions and did not escalate to aggression. Native ants showed more state-dependent and delayed transfer, whereas invasive ants engaged earlier and involved more partners, revealing distinct regulatory architectures of food sharing. Chemical analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons confirmed that different nests, even when belonging to the same supercolony, remain chemically distinct in both native and invasive ranges despite the absence of aggression. These findings suggest that unicoloniality stems from relaxed acceptance thresholds rather than a collapse of recognition. Our study has implications for invasion biology and management, since the efficiency of toxic baits depends on uniform food distribution. If recognition biases resource sharing, both colony organization and control strategies may need reconsideration.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Additionally, precise transgene control is crucial for optimizing human cell-based gene therapies. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have facilitated major advances in disease modeling and the potential for regenerative medicine. Still, they are significantly limited by the lack of inducible transgenic systems that avoid silencing but maintain robust inducibility after differentiation to defined cell lineages. Here we systematically characterize the leakiness, inducibility, and tunability of multiple existing and novel transgenic systems in hPSCs and differentiated macrophages and microglia. Notably, we report the application of a small molecule-mediated splicing switch (Xon) that allows for tunable transgene expression both before and after differentiation, without the large protein tags required for current state-of-the-art degron-based methods. We use Xon to achieve tight control of reporter genes, overexpression of multiple neurodegeneration-associated genes, and Cas9-mediated genome editing. We also characterize the current limitations of this system and describe approaches that can alleviate some of these limitations. By assessing multiple transgenic systems whose inducibility spans the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels, we highlight and improve upon a major technical challenge that hinders basic, translational, and clinical research in physiological human-based systems.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

M.; Zhang, L.", "abstract": "Human cancer is highly heterogeneous, resulting in variable drug resistance and clinical outcomes. This complexity hinders accurate prognosis prediction and the development of targeted therapies. Molecular subtyping addresses these challenges by grouping cancers into more homogeneous subsets based on molecular characteristics, enabling subtype-specific treatment strategies. Subtyping is crucial for early diagnosis, personalized therapy, and improved survival by capturing differential therapeutic responses. Existing approaches to cancer subtyping fall into supervised and unsupervised categories. Supervised methods, often trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), rely on predefined subtype annotations but face limitations in generalizability and novel subtype discovery. Unsupervised methods, while capable of identifying new subtypes, may overlook widely recognized ones, hindering consistency with established classifications. Multi-omics approaches improve accuracy but are constrained by costs and data collection. We propose CancerSubminer, a hybrid subtyping framework that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning. A subtype classifier is first trained on labeled data, after which clustering is applied to extracted features, with low-confidence samples reassigned to refine subtype boundaries. Model is retrained with the refined subtypes, and adversarial training corrects batch effects and learns domain-invariant features across labeled TCGA and unlabeled external datasets. A subsequent semi-supervised fine-tuning phase aligns subtypes between datasets and designates low-confidence samples as potential novel candidates. CancerSubminer was evaluated on five cancer types, including breast, bladder, brain, kidney, and thyroid cancers, using TCGA methylation data with annotated subtypes and unlabeled datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The framework outperformed state-of-the-art subtyping models (iClusterPlus, iClusterBayes, NEMO) and clustering methods (Spectral, K-means). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significant prognostic separation (p < 0.05) for all cancers, including thyroid cancer where predefined subtypes showed no significance but CancerSubminer-derived subtypes did. These findings highlight CancerSubminer's ability to identify distinct prognostic subtypes, mitigate batch effects, and improve prognostic stratification across heterogeneous datasets.

Gene Space - a multidimensional space based on the frequencies of nucleotide tokens, such as individual nucleotides, codons, or codon pairs. We demonstrate that in this space, genes from each of the studied microorganism species occupy a limited region, and individual genes from different species can be effectively separated. Consequently, a specific Genome Subspace can be defined for each species, which constrains the organism's evolutionary pathways, thereby determining the constraints on gene optimization for these species. Further in- depth analysis is required to test if it's true for other organisms as well.

The structural and sequence diversity of their antigen recognition loops, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality data, pose significant challenges in the development of generalizable predictive models. Here, we present a sequence specific fine-tuning strategy for antibodies that partially bypass the need for generalization. We evaluated this approach in three biologically relevant tasks: antibody structure prediction, zero-shot prediction of beneficial mutation in antibody-antigen complexes and binding affinity prediction. In all three tasks, we observed substantial improvements over pLM baselines without fine-tuning, while using only a fraction of the computational and time resources required for fully fine-tuning antibody-specific pLMs. We further extended our method to layer-wise selective fine-tuning, with the aim of investigating how model size, fine-tuning duration, and fine-tuning depth collectively influence downstream performance. Fine-tuning 50-75% of LoRA layers was found to be optimal for small- to medium-sized pLMs, with the initial perplexity of each sequence providing some guidance for determining the best fine-tuning duration. Building on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting beneficial mutations and binding affinity.

Predictions of such interactions start with data collection. Though there exist reliable resources to identify antibody structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), such data still requires substantial processing to be usable in predictive tasks. Redundancy in sequences needs to be removed to avoid data leakages between train, test and validation sets. Descriptors such as surface accessibility, secondary structure and antibody region information need to be additionally annotated. Information on inter- and intra-molecular contacts, which is crucial to studying paratope/epitope information, needs to be collected. The specialized immunoglobulin format of Nanobodies(R) requires a separate dataset mirroring that of antibodies, given that their structure contains only a single VHH chain. Because antibody-antigen structures account for a small amount of all protein-protein contacts, having a molecular contact reference from other proteins is also desired. To address these issues, we introduce NAStructuralDB (https://naturalantibody.com/na-structural/), a dataset of processed structures of antibodies, Nanobodies(R), proteins and their complexes with molecular contact information and associated annotations.

This approach is intended to meet the requirement for less manual intervention and improved accuracy in critical care settings. Methods: An 8-megapixel camera captures time-lapse images of a simulated monitor display at a rate of 3 frames per second. Images are preprocessed (grayscale conversion, histogram stretching, edge detection, color filtering) before Tesseract OCR reads out vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure). On a synthetic dataset of 3,000 vital sign images, the system achieved 99.87% accuracy. Retrieved information inputs a pre-programmed fuzzy logic controller to adjust syringe pump infusion rates of medications like norepinephrine. The system is designed for non-invasive integration with existing monitors. Results: OCR accuracy improved from 95.43% (without preprocessing) to 99.87% on the test dataset. An optimal focal distance of 11.9 cm was determined, balancing accuracy and compactness. The fuzzy logic controller provided stepwise adjustment of flow rate based on blood pressure thresholds, with simulations using non-biological substitutes demonstrating predictable control around a 3 ml/hour baseline. Conclusion: This framework offers a promising proof-of-concept for ICU automation, with potential extensions to other monitoring areas. The primary limitation is the lack of human trials and validation in a clinical environment, implying the necessity for future clinical validation before any real-world application can be considered.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

To obtain the robust feature for model construction, we successively investigate various classic sequence-based features and embeddings from pre-trained transformer-based protein language models.

Here, we show that cytosolic Ca2+ acts as a universal signal integrating diverse cues for the rapid regulation of root growth. Using live imaging, microfluidics, and optogenetics in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that a swift rise in cytosolic Ca2+ is the primary target of auxin signaling affecting growth inhibition. Disruption of Ca2+ influx abolishes these responses, whereas light-gated Ca2+ influx from the apoplast or endoplasmic reticulum stores inhibits growth. Multiple unrelated stimuli-including auxin, extracellular ATP, RALF peptides, and hydrogen peroxide - converge on this Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Cytosolic Ca2+; elevation thus represents a necessary and sufficient step for rapid growth inhibition, revealing a unifying principle of root signaling.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

We isolated a conformationally selective antibody inhibitor, Fab5, from a fully human naive Fab-phage library that recognizes monomeric human cytomegalovirus protease (HCMV Pr). A 2.6 [A] cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Fab5-HCMV Pr complex revealed that Fab5 binds a flexible loop distal from the active site and dimer interface which we call the latch loop. In HCMV Pr dimers, this loop secures the Cterminal tail to the protein core. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed that the latch loop is essential for HCMV Pr dimerization and activity. This loop is structurally conserved across all HHV Prs, and we show its functional role in Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) Pr as well.

The typical Western diet is high in saturated fats, sugars, and salt. In pre-clinical rodent studies, the Western diet (also called the high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHS)) is high in saturated fats and sugars (typically sucrose) but low in salt (<1% salt). As such, we sought investigate the impact of a chronic 3% NaCl Western diet (high-fat, high-sucrose + high salt (HFHS + Salt)) diet on systemic organ metabolism, liver mitochondrial function, and adipose tissue. Methods: Thirty-six 8 week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD), a HFHS, or a HFHS + Salt diet for 16 weeks. Body weight, body composition, and food intake were monitored weekly. Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and insulin concentrations were measured after 8 weeks of diet intervention to assess glucose and insulin homeostasis. Mice were euthanized at 16 weeks for liver mitochondrial respiration and tissue analysis. Results: Over 16 weeks, the HFHS fed group gained significantly more weight than the other diet groups. Liver weights were similar in LFD and HFHS + Salt groups but higher in the HFHS group. Liver triglycerides (TAGs) were also similar between LFD and HFHS + Salt groups, while HFHS had elevated liver TAGs. Inguinal and brown adipose tissue depots were larger in both HFHS and HFHS + Salt vs. LFD. Surprisingly, the gonadal adipose tissue was significantly larger in the HFHS + Salt compared to HFHS and LFD groups; suggesting that a HFHS + Salt exacerbates gonadal adipose expansion more than typical rodent HFHS. Paradoxically, the addition of salt appears to have dampened expression of inflammation related genes (Ccl2 & Adgre1) in adipose tissue compared to HFHS alone. Metabolically, the HFHS+ Salt fed mice showed the highest glucose intolerance, followed by HFHS and then LFD groups. Liver mitochondrial respiration, assessed by changing ATP/ADP ratios, showed the HFHS group with the highest oxygen consumption, followed by HFHS + Salt, then LFD groups, highlighting differences in respiration with additional salt (HFHS vs HFHS + Salt). Conclusion: While the excess salt mitigated some HFHS effects on weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation, it exacerbated gonadal adipose expansion and impaired glucose tolerance. HFHS increased mitochondrial respiration, but salt addition appeared to dampen this effect. Dietary salt, within a high-fat/high-sucrose context, has differential impacts on metabolic outcomes compared to HFHS alone, underscoring the need for further research to fully understand how Western diets (high-fat, high-sucrose, and high salt) impact all aspects of metabolic health.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Lineage tracing studies have identified a hierarchical developmental progression of GC neurogenesis, transitioning from Sox2+ stem-like cells to Atoh1+ rapidly proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs), and ultimately to NeuN+ mature GCs. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transient, slow-cycling progenitor population defined by co-expression of Sox2 and Atoh1. We show that GC maturation depends critically on the repressive function of the Sin3A/Hdac1 complex, which sequentially silences Sox2 and then Atoh1 to ensure orderly progression through developmental stages.

CD4 T cells, notable in the complexity of their repertoire and functional potential, can most easily be dissected with the ability to identify, quantify, characterize and isolate epitope-specific cells. In the study reported here, we present a systematic and unbiassed strategy that has enabled identification of highly immunogenic peptide epitopes derived from influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, presented by human HLA-DR proteins. Coupling the use of HLA-DR transgenic mice with infection and vaccination with highly sensitive epitope specific cytokine ELISpot assays, we have narrowed the potential epitopes from 450-600 peptides to 5-15 peptides, by an iterative process of elimination and selection which we have termed a funnel approach. These epitopes have been validated in HLA-DR typed human CD4 T cells directly ex vivo and enabled derivation and implementation of HLA-DR peptide tetramers. Tetramer staining of human PBMCs enriched CD4 T memory populations from healthy adult subjects highlighting this approach as a sensitive and specific method of identifying novel epitopes and subsequent CD4 T cell responses to human viral infections.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Clearly, this mass mixing event with hives from across the country has the risk of spreading highly virulent pathogens, including viruses. In addition to their economic benefits, almonds also provide the first major food source for the honeybees emerging from winter. It is essential to weigh the advantages of the almond bloom against the risks of disease in honeybees, which may also impact native pollinators. We conducted an observational longitudinal RNAseq study of viral diversity across multiple honeybee colonies from a California-based beekeeping operation as they participated in almond pollination, compared to control hives that did not. Viral diversity in honeybee colonies increased transiently during almond pollination but returned to pre-bloom levels afterward, indicating a short-lived bloom-associated effect. Directly after the bloom, viral communities became more homogeneous across colonies, consistent with enhanced viral exchange through shared floral resources and inter-colony interactions. Viruses exhibited seasonal patterns in prevalence and abundance, yet no single species dominated the community. Instead, viral composition varied with site location and time, with hives in closer proximity displaying more similar viral dynamics, suggesting local mixing within orchards through drift. These findings indicate that the resource superabundance during almond bloom increases viral diversity and homogenization, but with a short-term effect as diversity and community structure return to pre-bloom conditions once hives leave the orchards.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

J.; Madamanchi, A.; Li, L.; Umulis, D.

One such morphogen is bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), of the TGF-{beta} superfamily, whose signaling network is highly conserved across many species. In Danio rerio (zebrafish), this signaling pathway directs dorsoventral axis formation during early embryogenesis. Many of the molecules that play a role in this network are well-understood; however, the mechanisms through which they achieve noise attenuation and gradient robustness have not been fully defined. Specifically, the heterodimer-heterotetramer complex has been shown to be required for signal transduction, but current understanding and modeling of the BMP membrane receptors at this stage has not given any insight into evolutionary drivers of the requirement. In this study, we develop a stochastic model of receptor oligomerization with the published reports of binding kinetics of BMP ligand-receptor interactions to mechanistically assess zebrafish phenotype variability related to the distributions of noise and stochasticity. We can also analyze time-dependent signaling and frequency metrics that are not available in traditional, deterministic modeling. Fast Fourier Transform and cumulative energy spectral density visualization show that the heterodimer-heterotetramer complex may function as part of a low-pass filter mechanism in the dorsal-ventral axis formation process, specifically tuned to the noise of the system. Under dynamic conditions such as the mid-blastula transition (MBT), wherein the morphogen gradient rapidly changes shape, established metrics of noise and information transduction, such as coefficient of variation and mutual information, overlook important temporal effects that may be particularly relevant during development. As the BMP signaling pathway is highly conserved and has been implicated in human bone growth and wound healing, its study in simpler systems stands to accelerate our comprehension of BMP network structure and molecular mechanisms with potential application in regenerative medical studies.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Accumulating evidence has recently implicated MYRF mutations in the pathogenesis of cardiac urogenital syndrome (CUGS), in which patients exhibit a range of cardiac abnormalities, including atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). However, the mechanisms by which MYRF deficiency leads to cardiac anomalies remain poorly defined. Moreover, in part due to the lack of cell-type specific loss-of-function models, it is unclear which cardiac cell types contribute to the defects observed in MYRF-related CUGS. To address these questions, we examined the expression pattern of MYRF in the heart and found that it is most highly expressed in epicardial cells (EPCs) among all cardiac cell types. Importantly, Myrf global knockout (KO) mice displayed impeded epicardial development, with markedly reduced epicardial coverage of the myocardial surface. Furthermore, specifically deleting MYRF in EPCs results in severely degenerated epicardium, dramatically reduced epicardial derived cells (EPDCs), and thin myocardial wall. Conversely, ablating MYRF in cardiomyocytes (CMs) did not lead to any overt cardiac phenotypes, indicating that MYRF is dispensable for the developing CMs. Taken together, our findings suggest that compromised function of MYRF in EPCs may contribute to the pathogenesis of MYRF-related CUGS.

Here, we constructed a comprehensive cellular atlas of the early postnatal human lung (0 to 2 years) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of histologically normal specimens from 23 individuals. Our analysis identified two previously unknown and mutually exclusive transcriptional states of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, one defined by upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and identified by unique expression of FMO5, and the other defined by upregulation of inflammatory response genes and identified by unique expression of CFTR. Using spatial transcriptomics, we discovered that AT2 cell states reside in specific niches and interact with distinct alveolar fibroblast subtypes. Clinical data and organoid experiments further suggest that the environment dictates which state prevails as the pro-inflammatory/pro-regenerative signals TNF- and IL-1{beta} promoted the CFTR+ state in vitro, while patients treated with the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (Dex) had more abundant FMO5+ AT2 cells, and Dex induced the FMO5+ state in vitro. These observations link inflammatory signaling and anti-inflammatory clinical interventions to shifts in transcriptional state of the alveolar epithelium. We benchmarked two neonatal lung diseases, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, revealing a profound disruption in the balance of AT2 states, a broad arrest of postnatal cellular development, and impaired cellular maturation.

The factors that mediate how foragers locate food supplies are of vital importance in understanding their energy acquisition and survival. Microbes that inhabit floral nectar can play outsized roles in altering nectar chemistry and nutrition, thereby affecting floral visitors. Methodology. Here, we consider one such nectar microbe, the cosmopolitan, specialist nectar yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii (Metschnikowiaceae), by inoculating a nectar analog of the subalpine wildflower, Corydalis caseana ssp. brandegeei (Fumariaceae), and then characterizing the yeast's impacts on floral scent composition and the foraging behavior of its main pollinator, Bombus appositus (Apidae). We assessed foraging behavior of B. appositus in a flower array near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA) to test the hypothesis that foragers preferentially visit yeast-inoculated flowers over sterile controls. Additionally, we assessed whether bees spent more time at, and fed more quickly on, yeast-inoculated flowers. In a separate experiment, we tested whether Corydalis inflorescences inoculated with M. reukaufii had different scent bouquets than sterile inflorescences. Pivotal results. We found that bumble bee pollinators showed no preference for the focal yeast species, with inoculated nectar having no effect on number of flowers visited, time spent on individual flowers, or time spent accessing nectar. Further, the overall scent bouquet compositions of yeast-inoculated Corydalis inflorescences were not statistically significantly different than those of sterile inflorescences, despite increased emissions of several volatiles that are known to be produced by M. reukaufii. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that B. appositus does not respond to the presence of M. reukaufii in the nectar of Corydalis, and instead, yeast-associated volatile emissions may serve as a reliable cue of a nectar reward that is unused by these pollinators. These findings suggest a few avenues for future research, particularly how morphologically complex, highly scented flowers interact with VOCs produced by nectar-inhabiting microbes, and how floral visitors interpret these signals.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

The Geminiviridae and Tolecusatellitidae study group of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) specifies a percent nucleotide identity threshold for species demarcation, but these criteria have not been systematically applied across sweepoviruses. Simultaneously, ICTV aims for species to be monophyletic. A maximum likelihood phylogeny of 398 full genome sequences of sweepoviruses only supported the monophyly of four of 14 ICTV-recognized species. Another species has a well-supported paraphyly, which is a legitimate biological possibility for these viruses. These analyses revealed a distinct difference in isolates of the sweet potato leaf curl Hubei virus (Begomovirus ipomoeahubeiense) versus isolates of all other species, a result substantiated by previous findings that this species is the product of recombination with a non-sweepovirus begomovirus. We found extensive recombination among the sweepoviruses, including across species boundaries, which is at odds with the goal of monophyletic species. Reclassifying the current sequences of sweepoviruses under the ICTV-specified species delineation would cut the number of sweepovirus species in half, and only five of these seven species could be considered monophyletic. Our analyses highlight the failure of a percent nucleotide identity threshold to create monophyletic species. The particularly low threshold for novel species in Begomovirus also conflates lineages that are mostly separately evolving into a single species, leading to average percent nucleotide identities within species that are less than the threshold for being members of the same species (<91%).", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

A prerequisite for successful control by RNAi is the formulation of a highly efficient and stable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here, we investigated the use of magnesium aluminum-layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDH or LDH) nanoparticles complexed with dsRNA, termed BioClayTM, to target the juvenile hormone inducible protein (jhp) and the chitin synthase A (chi) genes of the South American tomato pinworm Phthorimaea (=Tuta) absoluta, a key pest of tomato crop. RESULTS: Degradation assays showed that higher amounts of RNase A degraded dsRNA complexed with the LDH nanoparticles while lower RNase A amounts did not degrade the dsRNA. Furthermore, our findings revealed that dsRNA is stable after 60 min of incubation when in buffer solutions at pH 5 and pH 9, while naked dsRNA showed slight degradation at pH 11. Also, BioClayTM and naked dsRNAs targeting jhp and chi genes did not significantly increase larval mortality in P. absoluta, but induced sublethal phenotypes through reduced pupal weight and adult emergence. Gene expression analysis revealed significant reduction of 73% and 48% in transcript abundance of chi gene in larvae that fed on chi-dsRNA and BioClayTM chi-dsRNA after 72 h, respectively, while a 39% reduction in transcript of jhp gene was recorded only in larvae fed on BioClayTM jhp-dsRNA.

Currently widely used bulk EP methods, while they offer scalability, cost efficiency and simplicity, cannot be used for targeted or selective delivery to a defined subset of a input cell population. Here, we present a Microparticle-Enabled Selectively Permeabilizing Impedance Cytometer (ME-SPICy), a microfluidic single-cell EP platform that enables targeted EP of selected cell subpopulations based on their surface markers. Antibody conjugated microparticles (MPs) are used to label selected cell subpopulations within a larger heterogenous sample. Using multifrequency impedance detection, ME-SPICy discriminates, in real-time, non-labeled and labeled cells within the mixed sample as they flow through a 3D printed biconical micro-aperture. This allows for the system to analyze if a cell is a target cell and selectively apply a low voltage (<16 V) for targeted single-cell EP. Simulations and experimental validation demonstrate that MP binding substantially alters cell impedance and phase signature, enabling accurate label-based discrimination. We demonstrated selective EP first using Jurkat cells by targeting either the labeled or non-labeled populations. Then we demonstrated targeted delivery to primary human lymphocytes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

After validating its performance on a benchmark of experimentally solved dimeric structures with known and predicted glues, we applied GlueFinder to three therapeutically important targets, EGFR, HER2, and KRAS, and predicted candidate glues that recruit 24, 111, and 148 distinct E3 ligases to these targets, respectively. We further demonstrate that GlueFinder can promote the formation of non-native EGFR complexes, possibly enabling ternary assemblies that would not form on their own. Together, these results establish a general, computation-guided strategy for molecular glue discovery that decouples design from legacy degrader scaffolds and specific ligase dependencies, expands the usable E3 ligase repertoire, and enables rational targeting of interfacial binding pockets.

Zinc exerts its biological activity through protein binding, serving as catalytic cofactors and structural stabilizers of many enzymes, transcription factors, and ubiquitin E3 ligases, among others. Despite total cellular zinc concentrations reaching hundreds of micromolar, free zinc levels are tightly buffered. Elevated free zinc promotes mismetalation and protein aggregation. While zinc is redox-inert, its cysteine-based protein ligands are readily oxidized. Oxidative modification of cysteines leads to zinc dissociation and a rapid increase in free zinc. With ~3000 proteins in the human zinc proteome, uncontrolled zinc release could be highly deleterious. Metallothioneins buffer zinc under basal conditions, but their re-synthesis following oxidative inactivation occurs on the scale of hours, raising the question of how free zinc is managed in the interim. Histidine, the second most prevalent zinc-coordinating residue, is resistant to oxidative modification. We characterized zinc binding by the small heat shock protein HSPB5 (B-crystallin), a cysteine-free, histidine-rich protein chaperone that responds to cellular stress and found: (1) HSPB5 binds zinc with high affinity and rapid reversibility; (2) zinc binding requires the disordered HSPB5 N-terminal region; (3) zinc binding increases HSPB5 disorder; and (4) prolonged zinc exposure promotes formation of assemblies of oligomers cross-bridged by zinc. We propose that HSPB5 has evolved specialized zinc-dependent properties distinct among human sHSPs, enabling it to function not only as a protein chaperone but also as a conditional zinc reservoir under oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

The absolute increase in cardiac-output during exercise was found to be uncorrelated with HS (P =0.19) suggesting that the magnitude of the hyperemic response to exercise involving a minor muscle mass is governed by local rather than systemic factors.

It also has the largest range among them. The intraspecific genetic and morphological variability of S. microphthalmus has been poorly studied so far. Previously, animals with 2n = 62 were found in the North Caucasus. This was interpreted as a manifestation of intraspecific polymorphism in greater blind mole rats. We investigated the morphometry, as well as the morphological, molecular, and chromosomal variability of S. microphthalmus using samples collected from across the entire range of the species. Genetic variability of S. microphthalmus was relatively low within the 2n = 60 karyotype range. A comparative, multi-proxy analysis of the species characteristics, as well as phylogenetic analyses within the genus Spalax was also performed. Species-level differences were found in all the characteristics studied in the karyotype of the blind mole rat (2n = 62) from the North Caucasus, compared with all the other Spalax species, including S. microphthalmus. A unique combination of morphological characteristics was described for this blind mole rat, including features that bring it closer to the hypothetical ancestor of all modern species of this genus. A new species is described on this basis: Spalax lyapunovae sp. nov. It is necessary to further study the range and the ecology of the new species, which is endemic to the central part of the North Caucasus.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This work aimed to gain a better mechanistic understanding of infantile amnesia. Microglia, specialized macrophages of the central nervous system, are known to play an important role in synaptic refinement during postnatal development and have recently been implicated in memory related functions. Here, we identified microglia as key regulators of memory accessibility in infancy. We profiled dynamic changes in microglial morphology across the postnatal window that parallelled the onset of infantile forgetting. We found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity during a specific postnatal window prevents infantile amnesia for a contextual fear memory, implicating microglia as active modulators of infant memory persistence. Using activity-dependent tagging of infant encoded engram cells, we demonstrated that microglial inhibition alters engram size and engram reactivation in the amygdala and results in changes in microglia-engram cell interactions. Furthermore, we characterized a relationship between microglial dysfunction and the lack of infantile amnesia in MIA offspring. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for microglia in regulating infant memory retrieval and suggest that microglial dysfunction may contribute to altered memory trajectories in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Despite the widespread use of various tools for orientation, from paper maps to GPS, this fundamental question remains unanswered in our understanding of human spatial navigation. To investigate this, we implemented a perspective-taking task in immersive virtual reality combined with mobile EEG, aiming to disentangle the neurocognitive processes involved. Thirty-eight young adults were presented with a virtual 2D map in which we manipulated both the perspective shift and the physical angle of rotation required to align with a target, as well as the congruency between these two variables. Behaviourally, angular error during pointing increased slightly and linearly with perspective shift. However, the relationship between rotation angle and accuracy revealed a non-linear pattern, with better performance around the antero-posterior bodily-axis. Regarding congruency, angular error increased for incongruent trials, but only when the perspective-taking angle exceeded 90 degrees. At the neural level, activity in the retrosplenial complex (RSC) revealed a sequential organization with alpha-band modulation during perspective shift, followed by beta-band activity reflecting preparation for the required physical rotation. In addition, incongruency between perspective-taking and physical rotation increased beta activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (lTPJ). Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of immersive virtual environments to investigate the neural correlates of real-world navigation and the complexity of perspective-taking mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate how sensory-evoked and chemogenetically altered neuronal activity affect oligodendrocyte maturation in the olfactory system, somatosensory cortex, and corpus callosum in mice. We find that early neuronal activity inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation and that reduced neuronal activity relieves this inhibition, thereby increasing OPC differentiation.

As the body moves, for example, the eyes rotate to explore the environment; these eye rotations, in turn, alter the visual signals used to judge body motion. Yet the practical impact of gaze dynamics on self-motion perception remains poorly understood. We tested how gaze position and gaze velocity shape self-motion perception--specifically heading direction--from visual signals in two behavioral experiments. In Experiment 1, we directly manipulated gaze position and velocity; in Experiment 2, a range of task demands evoked distinct gaze patterns. Across both experiments, heading estimates showed systematic, gaze-dependent errors: these estimates shifted toward the direction of eye motion and grew with horizontal gaze eccentricity and speed. A Bayesian ideal observer reproduced these error patterns across participants and tasks when it included three known features of visuomotor processing: (i) encoding retinal motion with eccentricity-dependent noise, (ii) underestimating eye-rotation speed, and (iii) a prior for moving straight ahead. These results reveal a lawful coupling between oculomotor behavior and heading perception. They further suggest that natural gaze strategies, such as keeping gaze near the optic-flow singularity and limiting pursuit speed, help mitigate gaze-dependent biases during navigation.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

Here we compared cortical morphology between VPT individuals and full-term controls in three datasets spanning birth, childhood and adulthood. We identified a consistent cortical signature of VPT birth, characterized by reduced surface area and cortical folding in the frontal, temporal, parietal and insular regions, which persisted across development. Furthermore, in two large infant cohorts, we found that this cortical signature was significantly associated with neonatal clinical factors and with poorer motor outcomes at follow-up, suggesting its potential as a neuroimaging marker for long-term neurodevelopmental risk.

If so, overlap with linguistic computations should emerge specifically during the initiation and/or reach-to-grasp phase, when tool embedding dynamically updates the relation with the target, rather than when the object is stably held in the tool grip. Forty French native speakers underwent fMRI while performing a sentence comprehension (object vs. subject relatives), and a motor task (with pliers vs. hand).

To resolve this concern, we scanned human PFC at 900 micron resolution using 7T fMRI. We found that population activity in retinotopically-organized superior precentral sulcus, rather than the predicted midlateral PFC, persists during memory, encodes fine-grained information about memorized items, predicts behavioral errors in memory, and forms a stable subspace with a topological organization yoked to visual space.

Homeostasis involves not only reactive feedback but also anticipatory adjustments shaped by experience. Prior homeostatic reinforcement learning (HRL) models have provided a computational account of anticipatory regulation under homeostatic challenges. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for gradual, trial-by-trial adjustment and for extinction learning. To address this issue, we developed a continuous HRL framework that enables trial-wise tuning of anticipatory regulation. The model incorporates biologically informed components: asymmetric reinforcement, weighting negative outcomes more than positive outcomes; and a dual-unit, context-gated inhibitory mechanism. We applied the framework to thermoregulatory conditioning with ethanol-induced hypothermia and successfully reproduced cue-triggered compensation, gradual tolerance, and rapid reacquisition after extinction. We then extended the framework to multiple physiological variables influenced by shared neural or hormonal control signals, and found that when regulatory priorities across variables were uneven, a deviation in one variable propagated through shared control to others, yielding a cascading, system-wide failure to return to ideal state (non-recovery); a pattern reminiscent of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., dysautonomia, ME/CFS).

Yet, most research on the neural mechanisms of attentional disengagement from speech listening has focused on the distraction by one competing speaker, whereas within-situation disengagement is often characterized by distraction towards external visual stimuli or internal thoughts and occurs in situations with ambient, multi-talker background masking. Across three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, the current study examined how disengagement due to external and internal distractions affect the neural tracking of speech masked by different levels of multi-talker babble (speech in quiet, +6 dB, and -3 dB SNR). We observed early (<200 ms), enhanced neural responses to the speech envelope for speech masked by background babble compared to speech in quiet (Experiments 1-3), suggesting stochastic facilitation. Importantly, neural tracking of the speech envelope was reduced when individuals were distracted by a visual-stimulus stream (Experiment 2) and by internal thought and imagination (Experiment 3). There were some indices suggesting the greatest disengagement-related decline in neural speech tracking occurs for the most difficult speech-masking condition, but this was not consistent across all measures. The current data show that disengagement due to external and internal distractions yield decreases in neural speech tracking, potentially suggesting a common neural pathway through which gain is downregulated in auditory cortex.

Iron dysregulation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia. While elevated postmortem iron in Brodmann areas 10-11 has been linked to schizophrenia, this has not been assessed in vivo. We therefore used iron-sensitive MRI to test whether cortical iron is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Study Design We acquired quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI to measure magnetic susceptibility ({chi}), a marker of iron, in 158 participants aged 18-45 (73 with schizophrenia and 76 matched healthy controls). As {chi} is reduced by myelin, we conducted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess mean diffusivity, an iron-insensitive marker also reduced by myelin. Study Results Primary analyses showed no significant case-control differences in {chi} in the whole cortex (p=0.675) or Brodmann areas 10-11 (p=0.537). Exploratory analyses examined {chi} for 362 cortical regions and a voxelwise analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons. Two left temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction regions showed significantly elevated {chi} in schizophrenia: the posterior TPO junction (d=0.752, p<0.001) and the superior temporal visual area (d=0.638, p=0.033), which remained significant after adjusting for mean diffusivity and clinical covariates (p=0.001 and p=0.023, respectively).

One signaling protein that promotes neuronal apoptosis and activates stress-responsive genes is dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), which is a neuron-enriched kinase that responds to extracellular stress by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We hypothesized that SCI would robustly activate DLK signaling and that acute pharmacological inhibition of DLK would suppress JNK pathway activation, thereby enhancing neuroprotection and locomotor recovery in our mouse model of moderate contusion SCI. Using western blotting, we observed that SCI induced strong and sustained activation of the JNK pathway in the injured spinal cord starting at 4 hours post-injury through 7 days. Complementary analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq revealed that DLK expression is highly enriched in neurons across all injury phases. Following SCI, neurons exhibited robust, time-dependent upregulation of multiple DLK-responsive transcripts, consistent with sustained pathway activation during the acute and subacute periods. Systemic treatment with the selective DLK inhibitor IACS'825 effectively suppressed intraspinal JUN activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, unexpectedly, DLK inhibition delayed functional recovery in male mice and expanded lesion volume by 71%, with no significant effect in females. These findings highlight the complex roles of DLK signaling after SCI, revealing a need to understand the sex-specific molecular mechanisms that modulate injury outcomes. Future studies should further optimize timing, location, and cellular targeting of DLK therapeutic strategies to improve neuroprotection and neurologic recovery after SCI.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}

We developed an innovative 3D imaging workflow combining IMARIS and VesselVio software to quantitatively analyze cerebellar vascularization at different postnatal stages (P4, P8, P12, P21, and P70). We correlate these results with a transcriptomic analysis of 23 angiogenesis-related genes in the same stages to uncover the associated molecular pathways. We found that IH induced significant vascular changes, particularly at P4, with a global increase in vascular-network dimensions. By P8, the vascular network normalized, but genes were downregulated in all pathways studied. After P12, at the end of the IH protocol, transcriptional regulations vary but persist long-term. Moreover, differential analysis showed distinct effects on superficial versus deep vascular networks, allowing for a more precise understanding of remodeling patterns throughout development. Overall, transcriptomic changes were associated with morphological alterations in a time-dependent manner, suggesting a multiphasic IH response through development with lasting effects. Key regulations included VEGF, angiopoietin, and matrix metalloprotease signaling. These findings demonstrate that IH disrupts cerebellar angiogenesis in parallel with neurogenesis, potentially contributing to the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in AOP.

In phase one, newly generated astrocytes acquire common transcription profiles despite arising from lineally and transcriptionally distinct progenitors. Convergent differentiation is mediated by the distal-less transcription factor CEH-43. CEH-43 is expressed in astrocytes and their progenitors, binds conserved astrocyte-expressed genes, and cell-autonomously controls astrocyte-specific gene expression. Forced misexpression of CEH-43 in the embryo promotes ectopic expression of astrocyte-specific reporters. The second gene expression phase, directing astrocyte maturation, is also under CEH-43 control.

Two-day old larval zebrafish exhibit burst swimming behaviour that can be elicited by a light touch to the tail. Larval motor touch-responses are frequently video recorded and later analyzed. Methods to robustly analyze these videos in a reproducible and time-efficient manner are reliant on manual tracking, which is prone to experimenter bias and error. Here we present ZebraTrack, a machine learning-based program, which employs Ultralytics YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) object detection algorithm to automatically analyze larval touch response videos. The program breaks down video files into their constituent frames and passes these through a custom-trained YOLOv8n algorithm to detect the presence of a single larval zebrafish. ZebraTrack then refines the tracking data output by the model and tabulates it into an excel spreadsheet. The program then computes and extracts four relevant swim metrics: swim duration (s), swim distance (mm), mean swim velocity (mm/s), and max swim velocity (mm/s). ZebraTrack rapidly accelerates the analysis process, while also eliminating the errors associated with manual tracking. Furthermore, it allows for high-throughput analysis of larval touch response videos and can detect subtle differences in motor metrics arising as a result of temperature differences, demonstrating that utility of this tracking algorithm.

Objective: To compare liquid lung rest versus standard gas rest ventilation in a porcine model of acute lung injury and extracorporeal life support. Methods: Twenty neonatal pigs with lung injury after systemic injection of oleic acid were placed on extracorporeal life support. Pigs were ventilated with standard rest settings (peak inspiratory pressure: 20 cmH2O; end expiratory pressure: 10 cmH2O; rate: 10 breaths/minute) and randomized to receive no additional therapy (gas ventilation) or 5 mL/kg perfluorooctylbromide instilled endotracheally (liquid lung rest). The study continued for 4 hours with hourly pulmonary compliance measurements. After euthanasia, lung samples were taken for histologic analysis. Inflammation was quantified via blood and lung tissue cytokines. Measurements and Main Results: All pigs achieved significant lung injury; static compliance decreased by a mean of 54%. After 4 hours of lung rest, static compliance was higher with liquid lung rest compared to gas ventilation (0.88{+/-}0.05 mL/kg/cmH2O versus 0.57{+/-}0.05, p<0.001). Histology revealed 2.1-fold greater airspace in dependent lung regions with liquid lung rest (p<0.001) and a reduced airspace heterogeneity index (LLR: 0.071{+/-}0.004, gas: 0.095{+/-}0.010, p=0.04), suggesting more uniform alveolar recruitment. Cytokine analysis demonstrated a 3.7-fold decrease in tissue interleukin-10 levels with liquid lung rest (p=0.02).

{"title": "Characterization and deorphanization of RYamide signaling in Aedes aegypti: a potential regulator of hindgut-associated physiology", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.17.683104", "authors": "Tan, J.; Luong, T.; Paluzzi, J.-P. V.", "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y-related signaling, consisting of various neuropeptides and their receptors including, for example, the mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and peptide YY (PYY) families, along with neuropeptide Y-like peptides in insects, is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and invertebrate organisms. Vertebrate NPY is known as an important regulator of energy homeostasis and feeding behaviour, while studies on one NPY-associated signaling system in arthropods, known as RYamide, have mainly focused on functions regulating feeding-related behaviours. The current study aimed to begin exploring an additional functional role of RYamide signaling related to excretory physiology in Aedes aegypti given that a candidate RYamide receptor, RYaR2, is enriched in the hindgut of adult mosquitoes based on publicly available RNA-seq databases. Herein, we report that the RYamide transcript is expressed in all post-embryonic stages with greatest abundance in adult male mosquitoes. Specifically, the central nervous system and the ventral nerve cord were demonstrated as the major sources of RYamide, as supported by RT-qPCR and intense RYamide immunoreactivity observed in the protocerebral posterior dorsomedial neurons and protocerebral anterolateral neurons in the mushroom body region, along with an intensively stained pair of neurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG). The pair of immunoreactive neurons in the TAG contain elaborate processes extending onto the hindgut, with a branch extending posteriorly over the rectum where fine processes are in close proximity to the rectal papillae (pads) while an anterior branch extends over the ileum terminating at the midgut-hindgut junction forming a fine circular plexus over the pyloric valve. Importantly, two orphan GPCRs, previously referred to as NPYLRs, were functionally deorphanized as bona fide RYamide receptors. Their responses to diverse peptidergic ligands were assessed, revealing that RYamides elicited the strongest receptor activation, with half maximal effective concentrations in the pico- to nanomolar range. Notably, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that while only a single RYaR is commonly found across most arthropods, culicine mosquito species including A. aegypti possess two RYaRs. The characterization of RYamide signaling with respect to excretory physiology involving the hindgut, particularly in species having two receptor isoforms such as culicine mosquitos, may provide valuable insights for development of novel, species-specific pest control strategies.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": ""}
