R.", "abstract": "Terminological and conceptual ambiguity surrounding core entities such as colonies and castes continues to hinder comparative analysis, data integration, and ontological interoperability in social insect research. While extensive work has addressed the descriptive and functional aspects of social organization, less attention has been paid to the ontological status of these entities and the consequences this has for formal representation in bio-ontologies. In this study, I provide a realist ontological analysis of colonies and castes grounded in distinctions between natural units, natural kinds, and realizable entities. I argue that insect colonies constitute bona fide biological individuals (natural units) demarcated through relations of causal unity and historical continuity, and therefore suitable for treatment as unified causal systems within ontology frameworks. By contrast, I show that castes fail to satisfy the criteria for either natural units or natural kinds, due to their lack of independent causal cohesion, developmental plasticity, temporal variability, and context sensitivity. Treating castes as autonomous entities or essentialized kinds introduces systematic instability and misrepresentation in bio-ontological models. To address these issues, I propose modeling castes as realizable entities, specifically as roles instantiated in individual organisms and realized in biological processes under colony-regulated developmental and ecological conditions. This approach accommodates morphological canalization, phenotypic plasticity, temporal polyethism, and cross-taxon variability within a unified framework, while remaining consistent with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). My analysis clarifies longstanding conceptual ambiguities in the representation of social insect organization and provides a flexible, biologically faithful foundation for ontology design, supporting robust data interoperability and future empirical refinement.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

If this hypothesis is correct, then the mutation rate is expected to lie near a population-optimal value that depends on several evolutionary and demographic parameters. Using previously published data, these parameters were estimated for several well-studied species pairs, enabling a quantitative evaluation of this prediction. Across the species examined, empirical estimates of mutation rates fall within the range that is predicted by the underlying model to yield appreciable population mean fitness, given substantial uncertainty in several parameter values. The underlying model is consistent with a previously reported inverse relationship between effective population sizes and mutation rates within broad clades. Although not intended to provide precise predictions for individual species, these results are compatible with the hypothesis that macroevolutionary processes contribute to shaping germline mutation rates toward population-optimal values.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing the accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The model's equations enable the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 monomers, dimers, free oligomers, and oligomers deposited in inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid at large times, predicts that the radius of the inclusion body increases proportionally to the cube root of time, whereas the accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, and the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. Sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity become independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that, for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves over time.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

While CAM has evolved repeatedly in land plants, the evolutionary routes enabling this convergence remain elusive. Whereas the same core CAM (de)carboxylation genes are consistently involved, a key question is whether distinct CAM phenotypes also depend on a shared set of auxiliary genes, reflecting a quantitative continuum of expression, or whether they can instead emerge through divergent or redundant peripheral solutions. The bromeliad subgenus Tillandsia, with diverse photosynthetic strategies, offers an ideal system to explore this question. Using physiological and transcriptomic analyses of well-watered and water-limited accessions of two closely related species, we characterized facultative and constitutive CAM. By comparing orthologous gene expression and orthogroup recruitment, we found that while both species performed CAM upon water-withholding, transcriptional shifts in pathways related to stomatal movement, sugar/malate transport, aquaporins and starch metabolism showed minimal overlap. Core enzymes involved in the CAM (de)carboxylation cycle exhibited broadly shared expression patterns, yet the facultative CAM species uniquely up-regulated PPC2 at night instead of the canonical CAM-related PEPC ortholog PPC1. Our study reveals that, while the expression of certain core CAM enzymes is conserved, the surrounding transcriptional architecture can differ substantially even between closely related species. This supports a model in which CAM evolves through a mosaic recruitment of functionally equivalent, yet non-orthologous genes - underscoring its flexible and modular genetic architecture. These insights advance our understanding of the mechanisms enabling the repeated evolution of CAM and its capacity to facilitate adaptive diversification.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The cryo-ET data demonstrates that while attached to the cytoplasmic leaflet in situ, flotillin complexes possess intrinsic structural plasticity on the native membrane. Each flotillin complex may represent a fundamental unit of membrane microdomains, with their clustering enabling the formation of larger and more elaborate domains. We further reveal that phosphorylation at residues Y160 (flotillin-1) and Y163 (flotillin-2) may act as a molecular switch to modulate complex assembly, potentially regulating its function in endocytosis.

In biomedical and health sciences, many articles are published open access (OA). OA publication rates continue to grow, especially for pharmaceutical research. Previous analyses of pharmaceutical OA publication rates were labour-intensive and not easily automated. We aimed to create a free, live, online dashboard comparing OA publication rates between pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. Methods. Using the Lens (an online platform aggregating full-text content and metadata for over 280 million scholarly works) we built a dashboard showing OA publication rates for medical research articles by authors from the top 40 pharmaceutical companies (pharma) and 40 research-intensive academic institutions (academia). The dashboard details OA rates by model, license and therapy area across three time frames: 12-24 months; 0-12 months; 0-10 years. We downloaded data from the dashboard between 24 July and 4 August 2023 and performed further analysis. Results. Of the articles published 12-24 months before data extraction, 76.6% by pharma and 69.5% by academia were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA articles than other therapy areas. In the 10 years before data extraction, growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field (change in overall % OA 2013-2023: pharma, 3.1; academia, 1.6). Conclusions. This dashboard provides novel and regularly updated evidence on the comparative OA publication practices of pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. In our snapshot analysis, the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. Notable differences were observed in approaches, in terms of licenses and OA models, which may reflect different institutional practices and circumstances.

A surprising lacuna in CAN analyses is the lack of quantitative studies assessing the impact of sensory noise in the velocity inputs on the emergence of grid-patterned activity and path integration. In addressing this, we employed an established 2D CAN model which received velocity inputs from a virtual animal traversing a 2D arena to generate grid fields. We introduced different levels of Gaussian noise to the afferent velocity inputs to the model and assessed its impact on the network functions in generating grid fields and performing path-integration. We computed a position estimate at each time step using the network activity and quantified position accuracy using the difference between the real and estimated positions. We performed all simulations using several trajectories for the virtual animal, as computed grid scores and position accuracy showed pronounced trajectory-to-trajectory variability even in noise-free cases. We found that the presence of low levels of sensory noise was beneficial to the generation of grid fields, specifically with trajectories where there was no grid-patterned activity in a no-noise scenario. With trajectories where there was grid-patterned activity in the absence of noise, low levels of noise improved position estimation accuracy. In contrast, high levels of sensory noise impaired position estimates as well as grid-patterned activity, although position estimates were more sensitive to sensory noise compared to grid-patterned activity. Together, these analyses demonstrate the manifestation of stochastic resonance in a 2D CAN model, where low levels of sensory noise were beneficial towards the emergence of grid-patterned firing and in tracking position. Next, motivated by the proposed role of border-cells as an error-correction mechanism, we introduced north and east border cells and connected them to grid cells based on co-activity patterns. For different levels of noise, we computed grid scores and position accuracy in the presence vs. absence of border cells. Interestingly, while border inputs led to grid field formation in cases where grid fields were not generated, their presence only had a marginal impact on position accuracy. Together, our analyses suggest that biological CANs could evolve to yield optimal performance in the presence of noise in biological sensory systems, serving as a stabilizing factor yielding functional robustness through the manifestation of stochastic resonance.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify ICAM1 as a novel EndoA3-dependent cargo, alongside ALCAM. We demonstrate that both proteins subsequently follow retromer-dependent retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in cancer cells. From there, we propose that they undergo polarized redistribution to the plasma membrane, where they contribute to immune synapse formation between cancer cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Disruption of EndoA3 or retromer components significantly affects the response of autologous cytotoxic CD8 T cells, as evidenced by reduced cytokine production and secretion, but increased lytic activity, while proliferation and later activation marker expression remain intact. This is accompanied by diminished ICAM1 density at the immune synapse, where we observe it arriving via polarized vesicular transport, indicating altered synapse organization. Indeed, cancer cells lacking EndoA3-mediated CIE or retromer form enlarged immune synapses that fail to sustain full T cell cytokine secretion, suggesting a compensatory attempt by T cells to overcome the defective synapse, while likely promoting more transient contacts that potentially favor serial killing. Together, these findings reveal that EndoA3-mediated CIE and retrograde transport act in concert in cancer cells to relocate immune synapse components via the Golgi, thereby fine-tuning the balance between cytotoxic T cell cytokine secretion and lytic activity. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms governing immune synapse formation and organization, providing a necessary foundation for the long-term identification of new strategies to enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

By using innate exploratory and hiding behavior, the Barnes maze requires fewer trials, allowing examination of early learning rate and retention, as well as executive and motivational features that can be characteristic of non-amnestic dementias. However, unwanted odor cues may disrupt interpretation of acquisition rate during typical learning trials. We designed and tested our Barnes FIELD protocol (Find the Invisible Exit to Locate the Domicile) to improve reproducibility, allow evaluation of learning trials, and limit experimenter influence. The protocol uses 3D-printed escape shuttles and docking tunnels, allowing mice to exit the maze to the home cage. We show evidence that our shuttles mitigate the possibility of undesired cues. We demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol across several models of cognitive impairment and aging, and develop an additional stage, the STARR (Spatial Training And Rapid Reversal) maze, to better challenge behavioral flexibility. By examining commonly used outcome measures we identify important considerations for interpretation. These insights are used to evaluate several models of cognitive change, including deficits in an Alzheimers disease mouse model, and behavioral flexibility in a model of brainstem dysfunction. This work provides comprehensive instructions to build, perform, and analyze a robust spatial maze that expands the range of behavioral and motivational outcomes that can be identified and screened.

The T. cruzi life cycle includes transitions between epimastigote, metacyclic trypomastigote, amastigote, and blood trypomastigote stages, each marked by distinct morphological and molecular adaptations to different hosts and environments. Unlike other trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi does not employ a monoallelic model of antigenic variation; instead, it relies on a diverse repertoire of cell-surface associated proteins encoded by large multigene families, which are essential for infectivity and immune evasion. This study analyzes cell-specific transcriptomes using single-cell RNA sequencing of amastigote and trypomastigote cells to characterize stage-specific surface protein expression during mammalian infection. Through clustering and identification of cell-specific markers, we assigned cells to distinct parasite developmental forms. Analysis of individual cells revealed that surface protein-coding genes, especially members of the trans-sialidase like superfamily (TcS), are expressed with greater heterogeneity than single-copy genes. Moreover, no recurrent combinations of TcS genes were observed between individual cells in the population. Remarkably, a small subset of TcS mRNAs, encoded by genes preferentially located in the core genomic compartment, are frequently detected across the cell population, whereas the vast majority of TcS mRNAs show low detection frequencies and are mainly encoded in the disruptive compartment. Our findings thus reveal transcriptomic heterogeneity within trypomastigote populations where each cell displays unique TcS expression profiles. Focusing on the diversity of surface protein expression, this research aims to deepen our understanding of T. cruzi cellular biology and infection strategies.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Principal component analysis (PCA)-based techniques, which derive regressors from a noise region of interest (ROI), have been used in both brain (e.g., CompCor) and spinal cord fMRI. However, spinal cord fMRI denoising methods have yet to be systematically evaluated. Here, we formalize and evaluate a PCA-based technique for deriving nuisance regressors for spinal cord fMRI analysis (SpinalCompCor). In this method, regressors are derived with PCA from a noise ROI, an area defined outside of the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid. A parallel analysis is used to systematically determine how many components to retain as regressors for modeling; this designated a median of 9 regressors across four fMRI datasets: motor task (n=26), breathing task (n=27), and resting state (n=15 and n=10). First-level fMRI modeling demonstrated that principal component regressors did fit noise (e.g., physiological noise from blood vessels), though the effectiveness may be dependent upon the acquisition parameters. However, group-level activation maps did not show a clear benefit from including SpinalCompCor regressors. The potential for collinearity of principal component regressors with the task may be a concern, and this should be considered in future implementations for which task-correlated noise is anticipated.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

In this context, the closest analogue to choice is a strategic reweighting of multiple goal-specific control policies in response to shifting environmental pressures. To understand the algorithmic and neural bases of choice in continuous contexts, we examined behavior and brain activity in humans performing a continuous prey-pursuit task. Using a newly developed control-theoretic decomposition of behavior, we find pursuit strategies are well described by a meta-controller dictating a mixture of lower-level controllers, each linked to specific pursuit goals. We find that hippocampal neurons encode the policy blending variable in a value-invariant manner and monitor policy switches after they occur. ACC neurons encode policy switches in a value-dependent manner, with value related modulation detectable several hundred ms before the switch, alongside a ramping increase in mean firing rate toward the switch. Meanwhile, OFC activity is consistent with an encoding of the current value structure of the task, rather than policy switching. Together these results are consistent with a tripartite functional division in which hippocampus serves as a controller over behavior, ACC serves as a meta-controller, and OFC provides a value context signal.

Furthermore, Uev1A and UBE2V1/2 also counteract oncogenic Ras-driven tumorigenesis in diploid cells, suppressing the overgrowth of germline tumors in Drosophila and human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude mice, respectively.

A genetic expansion that increases the number of repeats is associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients suffering from a late-onset vacuolar myopathy (MRUPAV).

By contrast, purified fragments of the PLIN4 repetitive region form amyloid fibrils as characterized by cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy. Repeat expansion strongly accelerates fibril formation, consistent with enhanced self-assembly driven by the accumulation of identical repeats. PLIN4 aggregation is attenuated by the presence of LDs, indicating that lipid binding modulates the balance between membrane association and self-assembly.

Various studies reported high-level visual and cognitive functions under CFS, which, however, has more recently been questioned and at least partially attributed to low-level stimulus properties. A key but unsettled issue is the extent to which the responses of V1 neurons, where inputs from two eyes first merge, are affected, as severely suppressed V1 responses would not sustain high-level processing. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record the responses of large samples of V1 neurons to a grating stimulus under CFS in awake, fixating macaques. The results revealed that CFS substantially suppressed V1 orientation responses. Ocularity-wise, it nearly completely eliminated the orientation responses of V1 neurons preferring the masker eye or both eyes, while also significantly suppressing the responses of those preferring the grating eye. Modeling analyses suggest that, under CFS, the brain retains the ability of classifying coarse orientations, but may become less capable of reconstructing the grating stimulus.

RNA-seq analysis (LSS/MSS) showed that LSS significantly downregulated transcription of cholesterol homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to MSS, Western blot results showed that both LSS and HSS reduced the expression of two key enzymes (MVD and IDI1) in the mevalonate pathway, as well as the expression of two main UPR signaling regulators (PERK and BiP). Based on the binding prediction between transcription factors and gene promoters from differentially expressed genes identified through RNA-seq, we found KLF6 to be a key transcription factor. It regulates the PERK-mediated UPR and the mevalonate pathway, which are associated with SLC7A11 expression and CoQ10 synthesis, respectively. The overexpression of KLF6 restored SLC7A11 and CoQ10 levels under both LSS and HSS, significantly reducing foam cell formation, monocyte adhesion, and lipid peroxidation. Our findings reveal KLF6 as a crucial regulator of atherosclerosis induced by abnormal shear stress.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have lymphatic drainage deficiencies from affected joints, and defects in the synovial lymphatic system exacerbate inflammatory-erosive arthritis in animal models. To understand this, we generated Efhd1-CreERT2 and Myoc-CreERT2 mice for cell-specific genetic gain and loss of function studies. These mice were crossed with tdTomato reporter (Ai9) mice, and studies showed selective tamoxifen-induced transgene expression in CD31-/CD34+ telocyte-like cells in knee and ankle synovium, and in networks physically associated with mast cells proximal to popliteal lymphatic vessels (PLVs). Consistent with the known loss of CD31-/CD34+ telocyte in RA synovium, these cells were also decreased in TNF-tg knees and partially recovered by anti-TNF treatment. Ultrastructural and gene expression studies confirmed a distinct telocyte phenotype versus closely related fibroblasts. In vivo depletion studies in tamoxifen-treated Efhd1-CreERT2 and Myoc-CreERT2 mice crossed to diphtheria toxin alpha-floxed (DTA flox ) mice demonstrated telocyte requirements for physiologic lymphatic drainage and resolution of joint inflammation and focal erosions from zymosan-induced arthritis in the knee. In vitro studies demonstrated increased sensitivity to osmotic shock and decreased motility versus fibroblasts, and telocyte potential to differentiate into myofibroblasts on stiff matrix. Collectively, these findings support a model of joint homeostasis in which osmotic pressure-sensing telocyte networks extend from the synovium into mast cells proximal to joint-draining cLVs, and telocyte loss is associated with defects in the synovial lymphatic system and increased susceptibility to joint inflammation and structural damage from arthritis.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

PKM{zeta}, a persistently active atypical PKC (aPKC), is thought to be crucial for maintaining the late phase of long-term potentiation (late-LTP) and long-term memory through sustained kinase action. However, PKM{zeta}-knockout mice express hippocampal LTP and spatial memory while lacking neocortical LTP, calling into question whether persistent kinases and PKM{zeta} are fundamental to LTP and memory. In Tsokas et al., 2016, we showed PKC{iota}/{lambda}, the other aPKC, becomes persistently active in PKM{zeta}-knockout mice. In wild-type mice, PKC{iota}/{lambda} is critical to the initial generation of early-LTP and short-term memory, and PKM{zeta} compensates for genetic deletion of PKC{iota}/{lambda} by supporting both early- and late-phase processes. Here, we tested whether PKC{iota}/{lambda} compensates for the loss of PKM{zeta} by genetically ablating both aPKCs. Whereas deleting PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota}/{lambda} individually induces compensation, deleting both aPKCs abolishes hippocampal late-LTP. Hippocampal {iota}/{zeta}-double-knockout eliminates spatial long-term memory but not short-term memory. Thus, in the absence of PKM{zeta}, a second persistent biochemical process compensates to maintain late-LTP and long-term memory.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Unlike most of the fungal kingdom, this species exhibits a growth optimum at 45{degrees}C and is intolerant of temperatures below 30{degrees}C. To dissect the mechanisms of thermophilicity in this system, we implemented a large-scale insertional mutagenesis approach. We first made thousands of T. thermophilus mutants and cultured them at different temperature extremes in standard medium. Phenotyping-by-sequencing identified dozens of disrupted loci that represented candidate determinants of thermophilicity, including several annotated in metal transport. We then validated a subset of screen hits with a directed, single-gene knockout paradigm. The results revealed a temperature-dependent regulatory logic for germination, the decision point by which a fungal spore initiates growth in replete conditions. Surprisingly, most of our T. thermophilus mutants germinated far better at 50{degrees}C than the wild-type in standard medium and showed markedly slower germination at lower temperatures. We hypothesized that T. thermophilus has evolved sophisticated regulatory machinery to block germination at high temperature unless conditions are suitable. As a proof of concept, we surveyed media conditions and established that elevated zinc dampened germination of wild-type T. thermophilus at 50{degrees}C but promoted it at lower temperature. We interpret these results under a model in which T. thermophilus integrates information about temperature and nutrients before it commits to exiting the spore stage to start vegetative growth.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, the extent to which local sequence context shapes the likelihood of structural variant formation remains poorly quantified. Here, we develop machine learning models to predict the occurrence of SVs across the human genome and characterize genomic determinants associated with their formation. We developed both a sequence only-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model as well as a random forest approach integrating diverse genomic annotations. Both models achieve high predictive performance individually (>90% AUROC) which can be further improved in an ensemble. The predictive ability of these models demonstrates that SV-prone regions can be accurately inferred from sequence context. Model interpretability techniques reveal key genomic contributors to SVs, including effects of sequence motifs such as microhomology and non-canonical DNA structures, as well as the presence of SV hotspots. We find that different classes of SVs exhibit distinct sequence determinants, with inversions displaying particularly unique signatures. Moreover, predicted SV probability correlates with allele frequency and gene functional constraint, highlighting the utility of the model for variant effect prediction.

The neuronal membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a lattice-like cytoskeletal structure composed of actin and spectrin, has been shown to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the axon initial segment (AIS) of neurons, by gating clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation through membrane-localized \"clearing\" structures that are devoid of MPS. However, the extent to which the MPS regulates diverse forms of endocytosis across neuronal compartments, and how it is dynamically remodeled to permit trafficking on demand, remain unknown. While CME is relatively well characterized in neurons, the subcellular localization and physiological relevance of caveolin-mediated endocytosis, flotillin-mediated endocytosis, and fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME) have remained largely unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways (CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and FEME) are spatially gated by the MPS and occur specifically within MPS-free \"clearing\" zones distributed across both axonal and somatodendritic compartments of mature neurons. These results, for the first time, map the spatial landscape of these lesser-understood pathways in neurons and reveal a unifying principle of cytoskeletal gating across endocytic mechanisms. Disruption of the MPS markedly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis across all four pathways, establishing its broad inhibitory role in pit initiation. We further discover that endocytosis can, in turn, remodel the MPS through a novel signaling-driven feedback loop: ligand-triggered endocytosis activates ERK signaling, which promotes calpain- and caspase-mediated spectrin cleavage. This targeted cytoskeletal degradation facilitates further rounds of endocytosis, forming a self-reinforcing circuit that couples membrane trafficking with cortical architecture remodeling. Finally, we show that the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and thereby suppresses amyloid- {beta}1-42 (A{beta}42) production and neuronal apoptosis, implicating MPS integrity in the regulation of neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease. Together, our findings establish the MPS as a dynamic, signal-responsive modulator of endocytosis and neuronal health. This work uncovers a general spatial gating mechanism that applies to diverse endocytic pathways, introduces a cytoskeleton-centered feedback loop for signal-dependent remodeling, and expands the functional significance of the MPS from passive structural support to active regulation of neuronal homeostasis and disease susceptibility.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Dashehari under medium-density planting. Nine nutrient modules combining 25-100% RDF with soil- and foliar-applied Fe, Zn, B, Cu, and Ca were compared using ANOVA, PCA, and PLS-SEM. Integrated treatments significantly enhanced canopy height, spread, and volume, with the 75% RDF + two foliar micronutrient sprays producing the greatest vegetative growth. Yield attributes, fruit size, retention, and shelf life improved markedly under micronutrient-enriched treatments. The highest fruit yield and benefit-cost ratio was obtained with 75% RDF + two foliar sprays, outperforming the conventional 100% RDF. Soil pH and EC were moderated, and organic carbon improved slightly under integrated nutrient management. Soil and leaf macro- and micronutrient concentrations were consistently higher with combined soil-foliar approaches. PCA clustered high-performing nutrient modules with yield and canopy variables, while PLS-SEM identified plant nutrient status as the strongest predictor of fruit yield. Overall, integrating micronutrient supplementation with 75% RDF improved nutrient-use efficiency, productivity, and economic returns while reducing dependence on full-dose fertilizers.

We found a progressive increase in input resistance, impedance amplitude, and firing rate of granule cells, accompanied by a gradual slowdown in repolarization kinetics of their action potentials along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Our analyses demonstrated that granule cells acted as class I integrators that lacked strong resonance properties across the dorsoventral axis. We performed pairwise correlation and dimensionality reduction analyses to reveal weak dependencies across physiological measurements and the absence of distinct clusters for dorsal, intermediate, or ventral granule cells. Importantly, blade-specific analyses of granule cell physiology revealed that all measurements manifested pronounced heterogeneities even within a given dorsoventral section and a specific blade. Strikingly, ventral granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade manifested higher firing rates compared to their counterparts in the suprapyramidal blade. These blade-specific differences were limited to the ventral granule cells, with negligible distinctions between granule cells in the two blades of either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus.

In the simplest cases where resource availability is stable, animals can learn reward contingencies by integrating outcomes across repeated samples of each option. In more natural settings, however, reward availability is governed by complex contingencies such as depletion and repletion over time. To flexibly adapt to such changing environments, optimal choices require meta-learning wherein animals learn how to learn from external feedback, eventually enabling them to infer reward contingencies from more abstract and generalizable rules rather than relying solely on recent outcomes. The existence of meta-learning in animal behavior is well established, yet the neural circuits and computations that implement it remain poorly understood. Here we investigated meta-learning using a spatial foraging task in which rats acquired a novel depletion-repletion rule, and carried out longitudinal, high-density recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We show that meta-learning engages specific, systematic changes in mPFC neural dynamics that embed the learned rule and thereby alter the way the network learns option values from reward outcomes. These dynamics are based on mixed coding of task structure and value in individual mPFC neurons which, at the population level, organize into low-dimensional dynamical motifs that generalize across task conditions. As meta-learning progresses, these motifs are reshaped to instantiate both rule-guided inference of future states before outcome delivery and rule-based value updating during the outcome period. These results indicate that meta-learning sculpts pre-existing prefrontal dynamics to support the acquisition of new reward-learning strategies.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Besides forcing dispersal, individuals might also improve their neighbours' ability to disperse. Here, we investigate the evolutionary drivers and consequences of socially modulated dispersal. We find that: (1) there are three possible stable evolutionary outcomes, involving only voluntary dispersal, only socially modulated dispersal, or coexistence of the two; (2) although social modulation that does not improve dispersal success can only be favoured if it is less costly than dispersal itself, social modulation that facilitates dispersal can be favoured even if it is highly expensive for the facilitator; (3) facilitated dispersal may, counterintuitively, lead to a reduced overall level of dispersal; and (4) social modulation can be either welcome or unwelcome from the perspective of the disperser.

Spatial transcriptomics confirmed their localization near neural stem and progenitor cells, suggesting proximal neuron-OPC communication during early cortical assembly. Purified eSyn-OPCs differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, confirming their oligodendrocyte lineage identity. Reanalysis of adult human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets uncovered a transcriptionally analogous OPC subset (adult synaptic OPCs, aSyn-OPCs), though with reduced representation of structural synaptic genes and neurotransmitter receptor diversity compared to eSyn-OPCs. Together, these results identify a synaptically specialized OPC population in both developing and adult human cortex and reveal that eSyn-OPCs possess unexpectedly rich synaptic signaling machinery. These findings suggest that human OPCs may participate directly in neuron-glia communication during early cortical development and raise the possibility of developmental stage-specific roles for eSyn-OPCs in shaping neural circuit formation.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

With only five classes of antifungal drugs, treatment options are limited. Here we explore synergistic drug combinations - when the efficacy of two drugs combined is greater than expected based on the sum of each individual drug's efficacy - to improve treatment of drug-resistant Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida species. Chlorpromazine acts synergistically with both amphotericin B and fluconazole against multiple fungal species, including azole-resistant C. neoformans and C. auris. We then performed a genome-wide knockout mutant screen and found that ESCRT pathway mutants are resistant to chlorpromazine and knockout mutants of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis are sensitive. Based on these data, we investigated sterols and fatty acids in chlorpromazine-treated cells and found only minor increases in sterol precursors but a substantial increase in lipid droplet size and decrease lipid droplet number. We conclude that chlorpromazine acts by potentially sequesters lipids, preventing lipolysis and lipid mobilization in response to stress. Together, these data suggest that chlorpromazine and its analogs are potentially promising treatments for systemic fungal infections that act via lipid homeostasis and stress response.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Clinical and dietary assessments were performed, and serum metabolites were measured using targeted metabolomics in 177 patients. Females with ASD had higher rates of GI symptoms and elevated p-cresol compared to males. Multivariable regression analysis showed that serum p-cresol, but not its conjugates, was selectively associated with constipation frequency, independent of sex, age, and diet. No associations were observed with the other GI symptoms. In mice, chronic p-cresol exposure induced constipation-like GI dysfunction, supporting a causal link.

We previously generated a Dock7-floxed allele in which exons 3-4 are flanked by LoxP sites. To validate the utility of this allele for future conditional strategies, we globally deleted exons 3-4 to generate Dock7em2/em2 mice and characterized their skeletal phenotype. Dock7em2/em2 mice exhibited a diluted coat color and white belly spot, consistent with spontaneous Dock7 mutations. Bone microarchitecture was assessed in 21-week-old males and females. Global deletion of Dock7 exons 3-4 resulted in a 30-37% reduction in trabecular bone volume in the distal femur and L5 vertebrae. Cortical bone thickness was unchanged in both sexes; however, male Dock7em2/em2 mice displayed reduced total femoral area, whereas females showed increased medullary area. These data suggest altered appositional bone growth with mutation of Dock7. To assess osteoblast function, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were differentiated in vitro. Dock7em2/em2 BMSCs exhibited reduced mineralization and decreased Bglap expression, indicating attenuated osteoblast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that Dock7 exons 3-4 are required for normal trabecular bone acquisition and osteoblast function. Loss of these exons disrupts DOCK7 activity, supporting the Dock7em2/em2 line as a valid loss-of-function model.

Compared to other sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, the effects of testosterone on the mammary gland have been relatively understudied and there is little data regarding the long term safety of this treatment. Comparison of mammary glands from transgender men on TRT and cisgender women can reveal the effects of testosterone treatment on mammary gland biology and provide critical information regarding the long-term effects of TRT on patient health and disease outcomes. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of breast tissues from a demographics-matched cohort of cisgender women and transgender men on TRT. Surprisingly, participants on TRT had unchanged serum levels of estradiol compared to controls. Among the observed transcriptional differences for participants on TRT were a dramatically reduced expression of genes downstream of estrogen signaling pathways in hormone receptor positive (HR+) luminal epithelial cells, as well as a decreased overall menstrual cycle-related hormone signaling. We confirmed this finding experimentally by showing reduced expression of progesterone receptor a/b, a prominent marker of estrogen signaling, in donors on TRT. Our results support the hypothesis that high levels of testosterone in transgender men on TRT suppress sex hormone signaling in the breast as seen on their impact on HR+ mammary epithelial cells, with implications for TRT as an antagonist of estrogen signaling and protection against breast cancer.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence implicates small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) as key mediators of tumor progression and promising biomarkers for metastatic potential. In this study, we performed iTRAQ-based proteomic profiling of SEVs from metastatic (MOC2) and nonmetastatic (MOC1) HNSCC mouse cell lines and identified multiple cargoes associated with metastatic processes, including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, immune modulation, and perineural invasion. Further, we employed an immune-competent orthotopic mouse oral carcinoma (MOC) model to investigate how exosome biogenesis affects HNSCC metastasis. Loss of the exosome/SEV biogenesis protein HRS in MOC2 HNSCC cells impaired SEV formation in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Consistent with the SEV cargoes enriched in MOC2 EVs, immunohistochemical analyses of MOC2 tumors revealed reduced blood vessel and nerve density in HRS-deficient tumors. Analysis of candidate biomarker SEV cargoes in the circulating EVs from HPV-negative HNSCC patients revealed significant correlations of these proteins with metastatic status.

Unfortunately, established methods of online monitoring primarily involve the use of thresholded neural activity rather than sorted single-neuron spikes. The recent introduction of large-scale, high-density electrophysiology has enabled the recording of activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in both model organisms and human participants. This development highlights the need for a robust and easily implementable system for sorting spikes during data collection for live analyses of neuronal signals. Here, we describe a system for live sorting of neuronal activity (LSS) based on the widely used Kilosort platform. The LSS workflow utilizes an initial period of recorded neural data to identify waveform templates using Kilosort. LSS then interfaces with the SpikeGLX API to retrieve small batches (e.g. 50 ms) of data and for processing online. We measured the similarity of single-neuron activity sorted live by LSS to that sorted offline in neurophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex using Neuropixels probes. We show that LSS closely replicates the post-stimulus time histograms and visual response tuning curves of single-neurons obtained using offline sorting. Furthermore, we show that decoding neural signals online with LSS consistently outperforms online decoding of thresholded activity, and that LSS can achieve the same performance as that obtained with offline sorting.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Modeling showed that such operations can be implemented using the proposed neural module by additionally synchronizing its operation using endogenous pacemakers with a gamma rhythm frequency. The mechanism of such synchronization is similar to the clock sweep mechanism in electronics.

Enhanced early, pre-attentive processing of light and dark blue feature changes compared to light and dark green changes was reported in Greek speakers, who have two basic terms for 'blue' (ghalazio/ble). In the present three-experiment study, we systematically re-evaluate this evidence and test an alternative model that the early difference waves in the human EEG instead mainly reflect contrast adaptation phenomena. We use the same classical oddball paradigm presenting alternating light or dark standards and deviants that systematically differ in colour and/or luminance and chromatic contrast. We then calculate the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), a putative index of pre-attentive feature change processing and predictive coding derived from EEG data, by subtracting the activity elicited by standards from that elicited by task-irrelevant deviants. Our experiments demonstrate the following: 1) vMMN is driven by contrast adaptation, being observable only in the presence of contrast differences between the stimuli and not reliably observed for different hues of equal contrast; 2) there is no reliable difference between green- and blue-related difference waves in speakers with two basic blue colour categories, the difference waves again driven by contrast rather than their categorical content.

Our analysis of the associated cis-regulatory elements and co-expressed transcription factor (TF) families enabled us to construct a gene network regulating basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) differentiation through MYB-related (MYBR) transcription factors and a network of E2F TFs for early endosperm proliferation.

In this context, mountain systems may act both as barriers to spread and as climatic refuges for these species. The Pyrenees, a longitudinal barrier separating the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, are increasingly exposed to alien plant species spreading from lowlands. Several invasive species have already reached high elevations in the massif, raising concerns about how many more may follow and to what extent under future climate change. This study assesses future invasion risks for 35 non-native plant species recognized as invasive on both sides of the Pyrenees. We project future dynamics of their bioclimatic niche suitability to identify which are likely to become widespread and where by 2100. Combining occurrence data with 19 bioclimatic variables at 1x1 km resolution, we model current bioclimatic niches and project its future distribution using an ensemble framework integrating five algorithms under four climate scenarios covering the 2021-2100 period. Projections indicate that 80 % of invasive plant species in the Pyrenees would not be climatic winners under future warming. The centroid of suitable climatic conditions is projected to shift upslope to more than 87 % of species. This upward movement would tend to stall around 2,000 m, as suggested by future hotspot patterns, effectively squeezing suitable areas and constraining future invasions within mountain zones, as climatic pressure increases at lower elevations. Such redistribution would not necessarily imply negative outcomes, and overlapping with endemic species would remain very limited. These results raise a broader question: could today's invasive species become tomorrow's mountain flora? Although climate projections cannot capture the full complexity of invasion processes, they provide a basis for prioritizing surveillance and early action.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

A total of 484 metabolites were detected, of which 147 were significantly altered between cold- and heat-stressed pollen, including 61 upregulated and 86 downregulated metabolites. Differentially regulated metabolites spanned multiple classes, including amino acids, flavonoids, long-chain fatty acids, sugars, and polyamines. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted biologically relevant perturbations in amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism, including purine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate temperature-dependent metabolic adjustments in released pollen and provide new insights into the biochemical strategies underlying pollen tolerance to heat and cold stress. This work advances our understanding of pollen metabolic adaptation during dispersal and provides a foundation for identifying metabolic indicators relevant to crop fertility under changing climatic conditions. These findings provide a metabolomic framework for understanding pollen thermotolerance during dispersal and offer a resource for future studies on reproductive resilience under climate change.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory programs involved in tassel formation, including the initial specification of anther cell types, the transcriptomes, small RNAs (sRNAs), and proteomes were profiled at four developmental stages (0.5-2.0 cm). The RNAseq analysis indicates dynamic shifts in gene expression underlying the transition from indeterminate meristems to organ initiation and germinal cell determination by 2.0 cm. Complementing these data, sRNA sequencing uncovered 182 microRNAs (miRNAs) with distinct temporal patterns. A core set of 126 miRNAs was expressed throughout tassel development, while others displayed strong stage-specific enrichment. Notably, families of miRNAs that target auxin signaling were dynamically regulated, suggesting fine-tuning of hormone signaling in relation to meristem activity. Later stages were enriched for miR2275 and miR11969, which previously have both been associated with meiocytes, indicating the onset of reproductive sRNA pathways during the early stages of anther differentiation. Together, these datasets provide a broad overview of tassel development and form a backbone to enrich existing RNAseq and single cell RNAseq data sets of specific steps in tassel and initial anther development, while also adding new data on sRNA expression.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

During grainfilling, average Tmin explained 40% of yield variation, and 52% considering radiation; generally an increase of 1 degree C reduces yield ~0.5 t/ha. The relation between yield was linear over a 14 degree C range. An average increase of 1.2 degree C at the test sites reduced yield by more than 10%. A shortened grainfilling period is part of the explanation; nocturnal rates of dark respiration are also likely factors.

Although the Arabidopsis genome encodes 31 predicted PLCPs and 7 cystatins, their coordinated regulation has not been systematically evaluated across major stress conditions. Here, we reprocessed and integrated AtGenExpress microarray datasets to analyze the expression patterns of 28 PLCPs and seven cystatins in response to bacterial infection (virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae), wounding, and drought stress. In parallel, we performed in vitro enzyme activity assays to assess inhibition specificity of seven Arabidopsis cystatins against five abundantly expressed PLCPs. Finally, we used the support vector machine (SVM) package e1071 in R to integrate co-expression and inhibition data and to generate a hypothesis-generating PLCP-cystatin interaction network. Together, these analyses suggest that Arabidopsis deploys distinct PLCP and cystatin gene subsets in response to virulent versus avirulent bacterial infection, and that transcriptional modules associated with bacterial infection and wounding are largely distinct. In contrast, several drought-associated PLCP-cystatin modules overlap with those associated with basal defense, suggesting partially shared regulatory programs across abiotic and biotic stress.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

This practice discards experimentally observed variability and obscures the mechanisms by which robustness and degeneracy arise in excitable systems. Here, we reintroduce parameter variability into the Hodgkin-Huxley model and embed uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis into model construction. We digitized sodium and potassium rate constant data from the original Hodgkin and Huxley figures and used bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of the voltage-dependent kinetic parameters. We then propagated these uncertainty estimates through a spatially extended squid axon cable model using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. At the channel level, first-order Sobol sensitivity indices revealed that all kinetic parameters contribute to output variance in a strongly time-dependent manner, with distinct parameters controlling transient and steady-state behavior for potassium and sodium conductances. At the level of neuronal excitability, sampling hundreds of thousands of parameter sets produced a heterogeneous population of firing behaviors, including non-firing, phasic, regular, and spontaneous activity. Across stimulus amplitudes, the dominant firing mode was a single spike at stimulus onset. At the same time, the regularly firing subpopulation exhibited a broad distribution of firing rates, with a mean that matched the classic Hodgkin-Huxley prediction. In the phasic subpopulation, action potential propagation and conduction velocity varied widely yet remained consistent with experimental ranges. Finally, global sensitivity analysis during spiking shows uniformly small first-order indices but large total-order indices, indicating that excitability is primarily governed by strong interactions among parameters rather than by any single conductance or kinetic parameter. These results support a population-based view of conductance-based modeling in which biologically relevant behavior emerges from structured regions of parameter space.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe a protective role for the recently discovered acid-sensitive, proton-activated chloride channel, PACC1 (PAC/ASOR/TMEM206), during sepsis. Initially, we found PACC1 was enriched in healthy human and mouse mononuclear phagocytes, particularly macrophages, and differentially regulated by inflammatory stimuli, suggesting PACC1 involvement in innate immunity. To further investigate, we generated de novo Pacc1 knockout (-/-) mice, which presented without major immunologic abnormalities at baseline. Compared to wildtype (WT), Pacc1-/- myeloid cells showed normal phagocytic uptake of acid-insensitive Escherichia coli BioParticles, but impaired development of the acidifying phagolysosome using pH-sensitive E. coli BioParticles. Transcriptomic profiling of Pacc1-/- macrophages revealed dysregulated phagolysosomal and cytokine networks (e.g., interferons). Because phagolysosomal bacterial clearance is essential to resolve infection, we challenged Pacc1-/- mice with intraperitoneal gram-negative E. coli sepsis. Pacc1-/- mice displayed increased bacterial burden, immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and lethality. Additionally, gram-positive pneumococcal pneumonia was also more severe in Pacc1-/- mice, indicating broad anti-bacterial PACC1 impact. In contrast, phagocytosis-independent E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia yielded comparable WT and Pacc1-/- survival, as well as similar inflammatory responses. Finally, we engineered Pacc1-floxed (fl/fl) mice crossed with a myeloid lineage Cre-deleter strain to interrogate myeloid cell-intrinsic PACC1 in vivo. Consistent with a predominate role for PACC1 during phagocytosis and bacterial clearance in these cells, LysM-Cre/Pacc1fl/fl mice exhibited impaired E. coli sepsis survival but indifferent endotoxemia phenotypes.

We develop statistical models that account for spatial and temporal correlations, and find these approaches substantially improve fit and prediction. After accounting for spatiotemporal random effects, we find that three predictors increased CPB abundance: cumulative growing degree days (GDD), recent potato intensity in the surrounding landscape, and winter coldest-day temperature. Cumulative GDD and potato intensity are positively associated with abundance, and warmer winter minima (higher coldest-day temperatures) are likewise associated with higher abundance, consistent with improved overwintering survival.

Sweepstakes reproduction refers to a highly skewed individual recruitment success without involving natural selection and may apply to individuals in broadcast spawning populations characterised by Type III survivorship. We consider an extension of the Schweinsberg (2003) model of sweepstakes reproduction for a haploid panmictic population of constant size N; the extension also works as an alternative to the Wright-Fisher model. Our model incorporates an upper bound on the random number of potential offspring (juveniles) produced by a given individual. Depending on how the bound behaves relative to the total population size, we obtain the Kingman (1982a,c,b) coalescent, an incomplete Beta-coalescent, or the (complete) Beta-coalescent of Schweinsberg (2003). We argue that applying such an upper bound is biologically reasonable. Moreover, we estimate the error of the coalescent approximation. The error estimates reveal that convergence can be slow, and small sample size can be sufficient to invalidate convergence, for example if the stated bound is of the form N/ log N. We use simulations to investigate the effect of increasing sample size on the site-frequency spectrum. When the limit is a Beta-coalescent, the site frequency spectrum will be as predicted by the limiting tree even though the full coalescent tree may deviate from the limiting one. When in the domain of attraction of the Kingman coalescent the effect of increasing sample size depends on the effective population size as has been noted in the case of the Wright-Fisher model. Conditioning on the population ancestry (the random ancestral relations of the entire population at all times) may have little effect on the site-frequency spectrum for the models considered here (as evidenced by simulation results).", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Segmentation duplication events have played a major role in the expansion of the WRKY gene family in L. siceraria. Phylogenetic comparisons of the Group III WRKY genes provide valuable insights into the evolutionary characteristics of WRKY genes in L. siceraria. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis revealed distinct expression pattern of WRKY genes across different tissues. Conclusions: This study presents a preliminary analysis of the WRKY gene family in L. siceraria, including their structural characteristics, evolutionary traits, and tissue-specific expression patterns.

Ethylene oxide (EtO) is routinely used for sterilizing heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices due to its high penetration efficiency and low thermal load. However, the absence of systematic studies evaluating its impact on PEDOT:PSS raises concerns about the compatibility of EtO sterilization with organic electrophysiology interfaces. Here, we report the first comprehensive evaluation of EtO sterilization on PEDOT:PSS electrodes electrochemically deposited onto cortical interfaces designed for intraoperative monitoring and stimulation. EtO exposure induced only minimal changes in surface topography, with no detectable alteration of the electrical or electrochemical performance of the electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and charge-injection capacity measurements all revealed that EtO-treated electrodes retained properties comparable to untreated controls. Moreover, EtO-sterilized PEDOT:PSS coatings demonstrated robust long-term stability under accelerated lifetime testing, exhibiting negligible degradation over extended operation. These findings demonstrate that EtO sterilization is fully compatible with PEDOT:PSS-based bioelectronic interfaces and constitutes a viable pathway toward their safe and effective integration into clinical electrophysiology.

Building on our previous mapping and modeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons, we developed a statistical approach to generate over 17.99 million predicted post-synaptic sites based on the potential arbor contacts (PPSSPAC) across the dendritic arbors of 155,743 neurons spanning the entire mouse brain. By analyzing the topological features of these sites, we identified three key organizational principles. First, PPSSPAC exhibits a distinct region-specific spatial pattern at the dendritic branch level, preferentially enriching near the distal ends of dendritic segments, in contrast to the valley-like distribution of pre-synaptic sites along axonal branches. Cross-species validation against independent electron microscopy datasets from mouse and human brains, revealed a conserved and previously unquantified pattern of synaptic organization. Second, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC effectively captures variations across cell types in the hippocampus, enabling neuron classification based on synaptic architecture. This serves as a complementary mesoscale descriptor to existing classifications based on global neuronal connectivity (source-target relationships) or local dendritic microenvironments. Third, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC, rather than synapse density, shows remarkable correlation with independent whole-brain electrophysiological activity. The spatial organization of PPSSPAC also correlates with several gene expression datasets. These results suggest the post-synaptic pattern could be mediator linking molecular signatures, neural dynamics, and connectivity types of cells.

While transcriptional heterogeneity among myonuclei has been described, whether local translation contributes to domain identity remains unknown, largely due to the lack of tools for domain-specific manipulation. Here, we introduce MTJ-AAV, a viral system that enables selective genetic targeting of MTJ myonuclei. This approach allowed MTJ-specific ribosome tagging and revealed extensive translational regulation underlying MTJ biology and its remodeling during exercise. Interestingly, untranslated regions of these transcripts were sufficient to control regionalized translation.

Here, we examined how cohesin regulation is remodeled during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into the cardiomyocyte lineage using an in vitro differentiation system. We found that core cohesin subunits remain broadly stable at the protein level. In contrast, the levels of cohesin regulators, including the cohesin removal protein WAPL and the cohesin stabilizing protein ESCO1, decline sharply despite modest transcript-level changes. The cohesion maintenance factor Sororin was also reduced. To better understand the net effect of these changes on cohesin dynamics, we use live-cell FRAP of RAD21, which revealed increased cohesin mobility in differentiated cells without a change in recovery kinetics, consistent with reduced stable chromatin engagement or redistribution into a chromatin-unbound nuclear pool. To test functional consequences, we generated homozygous degron alleles for Wapl and Esco1 and induced acute degradation using a dTAG-based system. Loss of WAPL altered cell-cycle dynamics in stem cells and produced a characteristic \"vermicelli\" chromosome phenotype, consistent with abnormally high and lethal cohesin retention on chromatin. Surprisingly, depletion of ESCO1 had no clear impact on viability and cell cycle progression. Notably, despite loss of detectable WAPL protein in the differentiated cell population, we find that WAPL remains functionally required to maintain a viable interphase chromosome organization. Together, these findings identify cohesin regulators, rather than cohesin abundance, as central drivers of changes in cohesin dynamics during differentiation. They further show that even very low levels of WAPL continue to provide critical structural plasticity of chromosomes following cell cycle exit and lineage commitment.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which normally reduces vasoconstriction, becomes less anticontractile in hypertension due at least in part to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Brown PVAT has emerged as a protective regulator of vascular tone. Follistatin, an activin antagonist, induces browning of peripheral adipose tissue depots via AMPK. We recently reported improved blood pressure, vascular function and reduced vascular ROS by follistatin in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of essential hypertension. Here, we investigate whether follistatin reduces ROS and induces browning in SHR PVAT to restore PVAT function. Methods: SHR were treated with vehicle, follistatin or hydralazine for 8 weeks. Mesenteric white and thoracic brown PVAT from SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto were utilized, with wire myography used to assess vascular function. Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite were measured in PVAT using DAF-2 FM fluorescence or Griess reagent, respectively. PVAT ROS and browning markers were assessed biochemically and via immunohistochemistry. PVAT was treated ex vivo for 3 days to assess mechanisms of browning. Unbiased proteomic analysis of PVAT was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: SHR PVAT dysfunction, manifest as a pro-contractile effect, was inhibited by follistatin through reducing ROS, enhancing NO bioavailability and inducing browning. Activin neutralization and AMPK phosphorylation mediated the beneficial effect of follistatin on SHR PVAT. Hydralazine-induced blood pressure reduction did not replicate follistatin effects, suggesting vascular benefits of follistatin are mediated by direct PVAT modulation. Proteomic analysis showed that follistatin shifts PVAT proteome towards normal state, upregulating processes associated with adipose tissue browning.

Using murine genetic models, we demonstrate that host TMEM33 constrains anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses. Constitutive Tmem33-/- mice exhibited delayed melanoma tumor growth and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Antigen-specific CD8+ compartments in tumors of Tmem33-/- mice showed TCF-1+PD-1+ progenitor-exhausted cell (Tpex) enrichment, elevated effector function and reduced exhaustion, alongside improved effector memory expansion and T-bet expression in draining lymph nodes. We highlight that TMEM33 functions intrinsically within the T cell compartment, as TMEM33 deletion (1) enhanced polyclonal activation of naive CD8+ T cells ex vivo, (2) promoted preferential Tpex accumulation among adoptively transferred naive OT-I cells in B16F10-OVA tumors and draining lymph nodes, and (3) improved the potency of ex vivo-expanded OT-I cells in controlling tumor growth during adoptive cell therapy.

The lower CS in progenitors reflects distributed regulatory redundancy across multilineage programs, not absence of control, while differentiated cells exhibit crystallized, pathway-specific channeling. CE persists after cell cycle residualization (p=0.64), confirming biological rather than proliferative origin.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

In this study we evaluated the efficacy of previously described repurposed drugs against viperid snakes of the medically important Bothrops genus. Despite variable toxin representation and bioactivity across this central and south American genus, we found that the lead inhibitors targeting metalloproteinases (marimastat and DMPS) and phospholipases (varespladib), demonstrated pan-species neutralisation in enzymatic assays, whilst nafamostat (serine protease inhibitor) had variable activity. The metalloproteinase inhibitors protected against the procoagulant and haemorrhagic effects of several venoms in phenotypic assays. Collectively these findings demonstrate that repurposed drugs may be of great value as early interventions for the treatment of bothropic envenoming in the Neotropics and thus provides a strong rationale for their progression into future preclinical and clinical evaluation for snakebite indication.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

While CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have traditionally been viewed as separate lineages, double-positive T (DPT) cells coexpressing both markers have emerged as a rare subset with potential roles in immune modulation, cytotoxicity, and memory. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell TCR sequencing, and supervised machine learning to characterize transcriptionally defined DPT cells in human peripheral blood. DPT cells formed a reproducible transcriptional state distinct from conventional single-positive T cells and exhibited gene expression programs associated with cytotoxic effector potential, antigen experience, and immune cell migration. Clonal repertoire analysis revealed enrichment of expanded clonotypes and sharing of identical TCR clonotypes with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, indicating shared antigen-driven clonal histories rather than a distinct developmental lineage. To enable robust identification of this rare state, we developed a machine learning classifier trained on sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which outperformed marker-based approaches. Application of this framework to public COVID-19 single-cell datasets demonstrated its generalizability under immune perturbation. Together, these findings establish DPT cells as a reproducible, antigen-experienced transcriptional state with cytotoxicity- and migration-associated programs, and provide a framework for systematic identification of rare T cell states, expanding our understanding of T cell diversity.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Smokers with NSCLC, despite a high risk for surgical morbidity, show enhanced responses to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. This study aimed to identify smoking-associated immune cell determinants that could guide treatment strategies. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed on 61 lung tissues from non-smokers and smokers to identify smoking-related immune compositions. The scRNAseq data from 19 invasive lung adenocarcinomas were used to validate their presence in the tumor-immune microenvironment. Bulk RNA sequencing data from 102 resected NSCLC and 24 NSCLC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery were used for in silico cellular deconvolution and outcome analyses. Results: Among 135 lung cellular phenotypes, two natural killer (NK) cell subsets were strongly associated with smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity. Stress-responsive NK (NKSR) cells exhibited immature features and cytokine-responsive features, and Adaptive and immunoregulatory NK (NKAIR) cells showed mature features and elevated multiple immune checkpoint expression. High intratumoral NKSR cells correlated with improved survival after surgery, particularly in current smokers. Conversely, tumors with low NKSR and high NKAIR cells responded more favorably to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Conclusions: Intratumoral NK cell phenotyping may aid in therapeutic stratification in patients with NSCLC. NKSR cell preservation predicts benefit from upfront surgery, while NKAIR cell enrichment indicates improved response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. These NK cell profiles may help optimize treatment by balancing therapeutic benefit and risk.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The IMC is synthesized de novo during the daughter cell budding (endodyogeny) within the mother cell and serves as a crucial scaffold for supporting cytoskeletal structures and the glideosome machinery for the parasite locomotion. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the membrane biogenesis in the IMC are not well understood. Using clinically-relevant and globally-prevalent pathogenic protist model, Toxoplasma gondii, we identified the TgVAP-TgVPS13A-TgDAT1 complex bridging the IMC to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the major site of phospholipid synthesis. Individual components of this complex play a crucial role in the IMC biogenesis, where the multi-modular TgVPS13A protein interacts with the lipid scramblase TgDAT1 in the IMC via its C-terminal VAB domain, and with the ER-resident TgVAP through its N-terminal region. DAT1 is recruited for the progeny formation sites during the early stages of budding. Conditional depletion of TgVPS13A, TgDAT1 or TgVAP results in collapse of the inner membrane complex, leading to parasite death, as visualized by endodyogeny-specific organelle markers. LactC2-GFP, a biosensor of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylthreonine lipids made in the ER and enriched in the IMC, also mislocalizes upon protein depletion. In conclusion, we propose that TgVAP-TgVPS13A-TgDAT1 bridge the ER and IMC and mediate the inter-organelle transport of lipids, thus contributing to the organelle biogenesis and daughter budding in T. gondii.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The RNA-binding protein SGS3 is essential for this pathway, recruiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) to Argonaute-small RNA-bound targets. The N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of SGS3, which contains a prion-like domain (PrLD), has been reported to drive liquid-liquid phase separation, forming siRNA bodies, and to be required for secondary siRNA production. However, the molecular mechanism by which the N-terminal IDR contributes to secondary siRNA production remains unclear. Here, using in vitro reconstitution and in planta assays, we show that the N-terminal IDR comprises two functional modules: the PrLD and a negatively charged region (NCR). The PrLD is required for phase separation and siRNA body formation but is dispensable for secondary siRNA production. In contrast, mutations in the NCR caused SGS3 to form abnormally large cytoplasmic assemblies and markedly impaired secondary siRNA production. These results suggest that the N-terminal IDR helps maintain SGS3 in a functional, soluble state that supports efficient secondary siRNA biogenesis.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

To achieve this, we developed dual-tilt chromatin electron tomography (2T-ChromEMT) that allows multiscale visualization of chromatin architecture. Our analysis reveals that TE cells of both species display denser chromatin with nucleosome aggregation at the nuclear periphery. We show upregulation of the nuclear matrix protein Lamin A/C within the TE lineage across mouse, human, and opossum embryos, indicating that its regulatory role is conserved across eutherian and marsupial species. Loss of Lamin A/C reduces heterochromatin at the nuclear lamina in TE cells, reactivates pluripotency genes, and impairs mouse blastocyst expansion and human blastoid formation.

By processing over 10,000 longitudinally tracked images across murine lung and liver and human cerebral models, we show that this platform achieves human-level segmentation precision (r = 0.99) while uncovering conserved developmental dynamics obscured in manual cultures. We identify a distinct biphasic \"remodeling-to-expansion\" trajectory in microfluidic organoids, characterized by an initial compaction phase underpinned by the transcriptional upregulation of focal adhesion pathways, followed by exponential expansion. We further demonstrate a \"shape relaxation\" phenomenon where tissues converge to spherical equilibrium regardless of initial geometry, indicating intrinsic self-organization. Multi-modal profiling confirms that microfluidic organoids exhibit superior viability, homogeneity (area variability [&le;] 5% upon fabrication, [&le;] 15% across development) and biological fidelity, retaining physiological levels of immune and stromal niche components often lost in conventional culture.

Broader use remains limited by the difficulty of identifying, segmenting, and tracking objects of different size and shape in crowded intracellular environments in low-contrast, anisotropic, monochromatic image volumes. Objects overlap, deform, appear and disappear, and span wide ranges of size and intensity. Classical segmentation pipelines typically require high signal-to-noise data and rely on intensity heuristics with hand-tuned postprocessing that generalize poorly. Supervised deep learning methods require extensive voxel-level annotations that are costly, inconsistent across phenotypes, and rapidly become obsolete as imaging conditions change. We introduce SpatialDINO, a fully automated self-supervised method that trains a native 3D vision transformer, based on a modified version of DINOv2. SpatialDINO yields robust semantic feature maps from single channels of multi-channel microscopy that, irrespective of object shape, support object detection and segmentation directly from naive 3D images across z-spacings and numbers of planes and different imaging modalities, without retraining or voxel annotations. We trained SpatialDINO on a small set of confocal volumes acquired by live-cell fluorescent 3D lattice light-sheet microscopy, spanning targets of different size and shape located in crowded cellular environments, from diffraction-limited clathrin coated pits and clathrin coated vesicles to bigger structures including endosomes and lysosomes, and endosomes and lysosomes pharmacologically enlarged to highlight endosomal membrane profiles. Post-processing of the features generated by SpatialDINO allows detection and unique object identification of these objects in naive 3D images. It also enables detection of significantly different previously unseen object classes, such as cellular plasma membranes and nuclei and even tumors in MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate its value by tracking endosomes in 3D time series, combining SpatialDINO-derived feature similarity with spatial proximity to improve association through occlusion, abrupt appearance changes, and dense packing -- all conditions that have been challenging for existing methods. SpatialDINO therefore lowers a major barrier to quantitative analysis of heterogeneous, monochromatic objects in crowded 3D cellular environments.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

To elucidate the evolutionary events leading to differential psilocybin production in Psilocybe, we produced genome assemblies for two P. fuscofulva strains, one P. polytrichoides strain, and one P. tampanensis strain, complemented by reannotated public genomes and metagenome-derived assemblies from fungarium specimens representing both major Psilocybe clades and related genera. Phylogenomic analysis based on 100 single-copy orthologs curated for high branch support strongly placed P. fuscofulva as the earliest-diverging lineage in Psilocybe Clade I. No psilocybin gene cluster (PGC) homologs, whether clustered or dispersed, were identified in P. fuscofulva, whereas a single intact PGC was present in all other examined Psilocybe genomes. The PGC resides in two distinct, clade-specific genomic loci: one conserved in Clade I and another in Clade II, each displaying characteristic gene orders and orientations consistent with rearrangement through circular intermediates. Time-calibrated phylogenies estimated the Psilocybe crown group at approximately 28 million years ago, with major clade divergences occurring in the Miocene. The absence of the PGC in P. fuscofulva, together with clade-specific structural conservation and the lack of remnant sequences at alternate loci, supports two independent origins of the PGC within Psilocybe: one in the ancestor of Clade II and a subsequent origin in Clade I following divergence from P. fuscofulva, most likely via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Gene phylogenies provide weak support for transfer from Clade I to Clade II, although broader sampling is required for confirmation. These results constrain the timeframe of PGC emergence and dispersal to the Miocene, implying rapid HGT events possibly driven by ecological pressures in expanding grassland ecosystems. This study challenges the assumption of an ancestral psilocybin pathway in Psilocybe and its close relatives and underscores multiple recent acquisitions of an ecologically important metabolic trait.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

While many models describe how echolocating animals react to prior echoes by adjusting subsequent behavior, few explicitly model how they cognitively reason about information embedded in echoes when determining future actions. Here, we extend \"infotaxis,\" an information-greedy algorithm originally developed for olfactory search, to sonar sensing by formulating an echolocating agent searching for a single target under sensory uncertainty characterized by probabilities of miss and false alarm. Through analytical and computational analyses, we show that the characteristic exploration-exploitation balance of infotaxis is conserved across sensory modalities, and that the efficiency and reliability of infotaxis search depend strongly on sensory information quality. Compared with a maximum a posteriori agent that always directs the beam to the most probable target location, the infotaxis agent consistently completes searches with fewer pings and greater robustness to sensory uncertainty. These results highlight information as a powerful concept for understanding active sensing and for revealing principles of sonar-guided autonomy in both biological and engineered systems.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can facilitate tissue repair through immunomodulatory, angiogenic, and anti-fibrotic effects. However, their low yield and poor on-site retention limit their therapeutic efficacy. Hypoxia can boost MSC metabolism, proliferation, and EV production. Hypoxic (3% O2) preconditioning of MSCs increased the yield of EVs (30-300 nm) by 1.5-fold but decreased the expression of characteristic EV markers (i.e., CD81, ICAM, and FLOT1). Fibrin hydrogels promote skeletal muscle regeneration and can sequester EVs via integrins or electrostatic interactions. We hypothesized that encapsulating EVs in fibrin hydrogels would further enhance regeneration and prolong the retention of EVs at the VML injury site. VML was created by removing 20% of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle's mass in mice using a 3 mm biopsy punch. EVs (4.48x1010 particles/mL) derived from MSCs cultured under hypoxic (Hypo-EV) or normoxic (Norm-EV) conditions were encapsulated within fibrin hydrogels and implanted at the VML injury site. Fibrin hydrogels containing PBS (PFG) were used as controls. On day 14 post-injury, Norm-EV treatment resulted in increased muscle mass, angiogenesis, and myofiber regeneration relative to the Hypo-EV group. Both the Norm-EV and Hypo-EV treatment groups reduced macrophage infiltration at the injury site compared to the PFG. These findings highlight that while both Norm-EV and Hypo-EV exhibit immunomodulatory effects, they differ in their regenerative potential. We speculate that hypoxic conditions could have caused MSCs to prioritize survival over repair-promoting activities, thereby producing EVs with less pro-regenerative signals. The increased quantity of EVs in response to hypoxia doesn't compensate for their diminished regenerative potential, highlighting the importance of quality over quantity when considering EVs for therapeutic applications.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Recent rsfMRI foundation models pretrained on large-scale observational cohorts, such ask UK Biobank, offer a potential alternative, yet their validity and generalizability in local intervention studies remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated existing rsfMRI foundation models for classifying intervention responses to changes of episodic memory using data from two independent randomized controlled trials targeting cognitive aging among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. RsfMRI foundation models outperformed conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while performance differed across foundation models with different pretraining objectives. Clinically informed fine-tuning using an external Alzheimer's disease cohort further improved performance and demonstrated robustness to confounders (e.g., head motion during MRI data acquisition, data collection site, intervention arm).

To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed bioactive gibberellin A1 (GA1) and gibberellin A4 (GA4) across multiple maize hybrids grown in diverse field environments using high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study provides comprehensive quantitation of GA1 and GA4 levels in maize tissues across diverse commercial hybrids grown under standard agricultural practices, revealing hormonal variation due to genetic background and environmental conditions. Our findings demonstrate that GA1 and GA4 concentrations from conventional maize samples varied across tissue types and field sites. Analysis of variance components indicated that the site variation was statistically significant at the 5% significance level in five out of ten GA and tissue combinations, while the genetic component was significant only for GA4 in grain samples. Notably, significant interaction between hybrid and site was observed for both GA1 and GA4 in stalk tissue. Positive correlations between GA1 and GA4 were observed consistently across tissues except root. These results underscore the common metabolic pathways involved in regulating GA levels in maize and provide the first comprehensive dataset of GA1 and GA4 variation under real-world agricultural conditions.

Termination of PREP represents a five-year loss of ~$2.7 million USD to CasePREP, a budget that would have trained an additional 30 Scholars. CasePREP was a great success as measured by its major outcomes. CasePREP Scholars have persisted in science and have made substantial contributions to the scientific workforce and enterprise. PREPs in general provided a crucial bridge for research talents who had little prior research opportunities to realize their potential and career goals. NIGMS termination of PREP support has negative economic consequences and endangers an important pathway to a career in science for Americans who would not otherwise have similar opportunities.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Emergence of focal cortical hyperexcitability in the murine tetanus toxin epilepsy model", "doi": "10.64898/2025.12.31.697069", "authors": "Meyer, J.; Smirnakis, S.", "abstract": "Focal epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that may be caused by a large variety of underlying brain lesions. Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

L.; Sipple, K.; Offerman, A.; Moore, D. J.", "abstract": "Background: The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with increased susceptibility to sporadic PD, which likely arises from the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and aging. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for PD, but the potential interaction between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and metabolic stress in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We employed long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to induce metabolic syndrome in aged LRRK2 mutant mice, followed by system-wide characterization using multi-omic approaches, including metabolomic profiling, proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Results: We find that thymidine and deoxyuridine levels are consistently reduced across tissues in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice at baseline, accompanied by increased hepatic expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). HFD exposure further unmasks disruptions in purine and energy metabolism in the brain and lungs of G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ventral midbrain exhibiting the most pronounced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional pathways. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that pre-existing metabolic syndrome unmasks widespread disruptions in systemic nucleotide and energy metabolism and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice. This conditional \"two-hit\" phenotype underscores the critical role of environmental factors, such as diet, in revealing metabolic vulnerabilities associated with PD-linked genetic backgrounds.

D.; Dotson, C. D.", "abstract": "We recently discovered that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces, is expressed in both human and murine TBCs, but how it functions in these cells remains unknown. We postulated that CFTR may impact peripheral taste signaling at the level of taste receptor-expressing cells of the taste bud. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed how pharmacological manipulation of CFTR could affect the functional responses of human fungiform taste bud cells to prototypical taste stimuli (e.g., bitter, sweet, fat) using single cell calcium imaging and neurotransmitter (ATP) release measurements. We first established the presence of CFTR in these cells using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. We next found that CFTR inhibition generally increased stimulus-evoked calcium responses but that the specific response parameters impacted varied across different stimuli, likely due to differences in signal transduction mechanisms and the involvement of store-operated calcium channels. For example, response amplitudes to bitter and sweet stimuli were significantly enhanced with no changes in the proportion of cells responding to these stimuli whereas the opposite trends were observed with a fatty acid stimulus. Additionally, bitter-evoked neurotransmitter release was significantly enhanced by CFTR inhibition, suggesting that this effect is reflected throughout the signal transduction cascade. Ongoing and future experiments are utilizing shRNA knockdown as well as intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology to further interrogate the impacts of CFTR. In addition to human TBCs, we have detected CFTR in mouse taste tissues. Moreover, we have mined mouse TBC RNA sequencing datasets to determine CFTR co-expression patterns to inform future cellular and behavioral experiments in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that CFTR can modulate the signaling output of the taste bud.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

It is now widely recognized that KMTs and KDMs also target non-histone proteins, yet knowledge of how non-histone lysine methylation changes during neuronal differentiation remains limited. Here, we address this gap using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify and measure changes in non-histone lysine methylation at three different stages in the Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) neuronal differentiation model. We identify 74 lysine methylation sites with significant differences in abundance across differentiation. Our analysis reveals lysine methylation on many non-histone proteins involved in neuronal differentiation and neurodevelopment, including signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, RNA splicing factors, and transcription factors.

While path integration has been extensively studied in insects and mammals, its presence and mechanistic basis in non-mammalian vertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, we show that adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) placed in a novel, visually impoverished environment exhibit systematic reorganization of exploratory behavior consistent with path integration-like navigation. Using markerless tracking, we identified a sequence of stereotyped bouts initiated by wall contact that consists of subsequent reorientations followed by a corrective sharp turn, returning the animal toward its initial contact location. Markov chain analyses reveal structured transitions linking wall-touch events, reorientation states, and high-curvature turns early in exploration, followed by a progressive decoupling of turning from boundary contact over time. Angular error-correction analyses demonstrate that cumulative reorientation predicts the magnitude and direction of subsequent sharp turns, consistent with vector-based error compensation. Multivariate analyses further show a graded shift in behavioral state space from early to late exploration, rather than an abrupt strategy switch. Together, these results provide evidence that zebrafish employ a go-and-touch strategy that integrates tactile boundary information with self-motion cues to estimate spatial layout. Our findings establish zebrafish as a vertebrate model for studying the computational and neurogenetic basis of path integration that develops by the fifth week post-fertilization.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

An extended unsupervised approach defined 17 main clusters and 3 sub-clusters in high blast fraction samples. Supervised analysis added an overarching immature \"ETP-like\" definition and resolved the LMO2 gd-like subtype. All clusters were populated by samples from at least two cohorts. Characteristic genomic driver enrichment agreed across cohorts, while gene expression clusters did not correspond exclusively to single driver events but also reflected developmental origins. A machine learning classifier based on ALLCatchR - our B-ALL classifier - identified these 21 transcriptomic definitions with 0.995-1.0 accuracy in a validation set (n=203). Testing the classifier on a hold-out data set (n=265 samples) showed that 92.7% of predictions matched with corresponding driver alterations. Across all samples, 88.5% of cases were high-confidence, 6.5% candidate predictions and 5.0% remained unclassified, largely due to low blast fractions.

Targeted lipidomics revealed changes in the overall phosphoinositide pool consistent with SHIP1 target engagement and reduction of phospho-AKT levels. In a protein-lipid overlay assay, compound 32 induced changes in the relative association of SHIP1 with multiple phosphatidylinositols on a membrane surface.

Here, we report the first intracellular recordings from CIII neurons, allowing us to characterize the membrane potential dynamics underlying their cold-evoked spiking responses. At rest, CIII neurons showed membrane potential fluctuations that occasionally triggered sporadic spikes. Cold stimulation induced a sustained depolarization that evoked a train of spikes, with spike rates peaking at 2-12 spikes/s within the first 5 s, followed by a gradual decline. About half of the neurons exhibited occasional bursts, in which clusters of 2-6 spikes at 10-120 Hz superimposed on a brief depolarizing hump. Cold stimulation also increased input resistance and amplified electrotonically spreading spikes, suggesting enhanced electrotonic signaling from distal sites via an increased space constant.

Two conserved, perinuclear germ granule subcompartments-enriched N-terminal processing peptidases, APP-1 and DPF-3, act cooperatively to trim N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions of the Argonaute proteins WAGO-1, WAGO-3, and WAGO-4. This processing shields these Argonautes from proteasome-mediated protein degradation, prevents the loss of their associated small RNAs, and promotes their accumulation in germ granules subcompartments. In contrast, unprocessed WAGOs are recognized and destabilized by the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF-1 and UBR-7. We propose that this cooperative proteolytic mechanism adds another layer of sspatiotemporal regulation over small RNA-directed epigenetic inheritance and may represents a broadly conserved strategy for regulating protein homeostasis and gene expression programs.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

However, recent studies have reported a direct relationship between dispersal rate and {beta}-diversity, which has been attributed to the influence of priority effects and species sorting. The underlying mechanisms by which dispersal can either increase or decrease {beta}-diversity remain unclear, hindering our understanding of metacommunity assembly and the processes driving biodiversity patterns across time and space. We theoretically evaluated how purely random priority effects, priority effects conditioned by species dispersal abilities, and species sorting shape the {beta}-diversity--dispersal relationship in metacommunities open to exogenous dispersal (i.e., immigration) from a regional species pool. Our results show that the three evaluated processes foster community differentiation at intermediate exogenous dispersal rates when dispersal between communities (i.e. endogenous dispersal) is taking place. Additionally, the interaction between endogenous and exogenous dispersal homogenizes communities at low and high exogenous dispersal rates, determining a unimodal response of {beta}-diversity to increasing exogenous dispersal rates. Our findings contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of metacommunity assembly and offer a coherent explanation for previously observed empirical discrepancies, thereby challenging the traditional view of dispersal as a purely homogenizing process.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The epidemic which started in June 2025 in France illustrates this threat, as the government-imposed mass culling strategy has led to protests by farmers and social unrest throughout the country. Here, we developed an infectious disease modelling framework for evaluating different intervention strategies in an effort to critically evaluate the evidence behind the drastic measures being taken. By simulating epidemics under different response settings, we found that control strategies employing targeted culling were essentially as effective as those requiring mass culling, and did not require significantly more vaccination. These results question the response strategy currently imposed by the French government, and suggest avenues for alternative response strategies which could gain better support from the affected communities.

Although restoration by rewetting can partially improve ecosystem functions, the successful recovery of specialised biota depends on previous land use. Rewetting agriculturally used fens often results in an ecosystem that does not resemble the original fen. The vegetation recovery of rewetted fens used for forestry is more promising, but our knowledge of vegetation development comes from boreal fens. It is unclear whether vegetation can successfully recover after the rewetting of forestry-drained fens in the temperate zone. Our study focused on the recovery of vegetation and peat accumulation in small fens in temperate Europe that had been drained for forestry and restored by rewetting over the 38 years prior to the study. We demonstrate that peat layers continuously increased with time since restoration, possibly indicating peat accumulation, which is crucial for converting drained fens back into carbon sinks. The vegetation composition of the restored sites became increasingly similar to that of the near-natural sites over time, with the steepest change occurring during the first 10 years after restoration. Nevertheless, even after decades, the vegetation did not reach the quality of near-natural sites. Our results highlight that rewetting forestry-drained fens can restore ecosystem services and lead to partial vegetation recovery in both the boreal and temperate zones.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

We examine whether the global clustering coefficient C, a direct measure of triangle density, predicts attractor lengths in synchronous, signed-threshold Boolean networks on Watts-Strogatz (WS) graphs. We generate 330 directed, signed WS networks spanning sizes N=10-100 and mean degrees kbar=2-10, simulate dynamics from M=100 random initial states per graph with exact cycle detection, and summarise each graph by the average log attractor period (equivalently, the geometric mean period). Our primary analysis relates this log-period summary to C while adjusting for N, kbar, the mean directed shortest path length (MSP), and including nonlinear size-degree and clustering-degree interactions. Main finding: Higher clustering robustly shortens attractor periods: a 0.10 increase in C (C in [0,1]) corresponds to about a 13-15% lower expected geometric mean period, and moving from C=0.000 to C=0.460 yields about a 50% reduction, holding other properties fixed. The effect persists when the linear C term is replaced by a nonlinear function of C, and it replicates in held-out graph instances (graphs not used to fit the model). Shorter periods are not explained by an increase in fixed points under the strict comparator (>); rather, higher triangle density shifts mass from long cycles to medium-length cycles. Significance: In threshold-like logic, settling speed and oscillatory stability are central to computation and control. Our results provide a direct, quantitative link between triangle density and these long-run behaviours, showing that C acts as a structural lever on temporal complexity.

H.; Pucker, B.; Kruse, T.", "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis is vitally important for all organisms, yet the domain organization of the eukaryotic molybdenum insertase (Mo-insertase) remains enigmatic. We combine extensive phylogenetic reconstructions, sequence analysis and structural modeling in order to uncover evolutionary and functional principles of eukaryotic Mo-insertases. We note, that the vast majority of plant, fungi and animal species evolved fused E- and G-domains, yet the orientation of both domains in the fusion proteins differs among different eukaryotic lineages. Despite the divergent domain arrangements amongst eukaryotic Mo-insertases the E-domain active site is well conserved, with very few tolerated substitutions in >1,000 sequences. Among the Mo-insertases from different eukaryotic species, vertebrate gephyrin is the only Mo-insertase with a dual function as - next to its metabolic function - it scaffolds inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the post synapsis. Gephyrin is surprisingly high conserved, including surface patches not directly involved in catalysis and receptor clustering. This profile suggests additional, as yet uncharacterized, functional constraints on gephyrins evolution. Together, our results reveal how eukaryotic Mo-insertases combine evolutionary domain organization plasticity with stringent active site conservation and recognize the evolutionary constraint on gephyrins surface conservation to be extreme, likely due to its mutual metabolic and neuronal function.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

In particular, previous studies have noted that viruses with sufficiently high replication rates can induce oscillations reminiscent of predator-prey systems. Here, we extend this analysis to the spatial domain by starting from an established tumor-virus reaction-diffusion model, performing a center-manifold reduction that incorporates nonlinear terms to derive a complex Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation, and estimating its parameters directly from the original kinetics. This reduced normal form equation explains the emergence of experimentally observed patterns, such as hollow rings and target waves, and shows that, at longer timescales, these patterns naturally evolve toward spiral waves and a turbulent regime. Our work provides a mechanistic link between the kinetic Hopf bifurcation and the rich spatiotemporal structures observed in oncolytic virotherapy models, suggesting that these patterns are not numerical artifacts but an intrinsic feature of the system.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The mechanism by which A3B deletion and APOBEC mutagenesis induces immune activation in Asian breast cancers is still unclear, but has been thought to involve increased neoantigen burden. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which A3B deletion and APOBEC mutagenesis may lead to immune activation using Stereo-seq spatial transcriptomics of Malaysian triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumours with and without the A3B deletion to examine the spatial expression patterns of APOBEC3A/B as well the spatial patterns of APOBEC-associated mutations and neoantigens. Unexpectedly, we found only limited associations between A3B deletion, APOBEC-associated neoantigens, and immune activation. Instead, we found strong spatial associations between mitochondrial APOBEC-associations mutations, the cGAS-STING pathway, and the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Our study thus supports a new model whereby APOBEC-mediated activation of the immune system does not occur via neoantigen presentation, but instead occurs via mitochondrial hypermutation that drives cGAS-STING activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway.

Based on a set of 26 marker genes, we proposed a simple method for the rapid identification of cycling-cell types. Comparisons across cycling-cell types uncovered novel gene-regulatory mechanisms underlying the cell cycle, development, and differentiation. Notably, we discovered that the coordinate up-regulation of both TS and TK1 expression is indispensable for securing a robust deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) supply required for DNA replication in cycling cells. The compensatory interplay between salvage and de novo synthesis provides a plausible explanation for resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a TS inhibitor for cancer chemotherapy. Consequently, blocking dTTP synthesis requires co-inhibition of TK1 and TS.

Functional evaluation of TRPC6 missense variants is therefore important for cancer patients undergoing anthracycline treatment. However, traditional electrophysiological methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we compared the functional responses of TRPC6 missense variants to 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a TRPC6 agonist, using molecular docking and patch clamp recording techniques. For the wild-type (WT) TRPC6 structure (PDB ID: 6UZ8), OAG exhibited a binding energy of -4.49 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.511 mM. Twenty TRPC6 missense variants were identified from cancer patients in the Mayo Clinic database. Of these, fifteen variants had resolvable structures, nine of which displayed increased Kd values and six decreased Kd values compared to WT in molecular docking analysis. Patch clamp recordings revealed that TRPC6 WT and mutant channels were inactive at baseline but were activated upon 50 M OAG stimulation, except two loss-of-function variants. Moreover, a 24-h treatment with 0.5 M DOX significantly enhanced OAG-induced channel activation. All three variants identified in patients with heart failure demonstrated gain-of-function properties in both electrophysiological measurements and in-silico predictions. Importantly, the results obtained from molecular docking and patch clamp recordings were strongly correlated, showing an 82% concordance, higher than the predictions from AlphaMissense.

Integration of virulence gene regulatory networks with the conserved global repressor H-NS was critical to achieve this balance. H-NS-mediated repression of virulence genes in non-inducing environments is essential for maintaining virulence genes and has shaped pathogen evolution. However, the role of H-NS-mediated repression in virulence gene activation and pathogen evolution in virulence-inducing conditions is less clear. For instance, although virulence gene expression is often heterogeneous, whether relief of H-NS repression contributes to this heterogeneity remains unknown. Furthermore, whether H-NS repression shapes pathogen evolution in virulence-inducing environments is unclear. Here, we use a Salmonella strain with reduced H-NS DNA-binding affinity to investigate the role of H-NS in virulence gene expression in individual bacteria and pathogen adaptation. We find that reduced H-NS repression increases the fraction of virulence gene expressing cells without eliminating bimodality, resulting in enhanced epithelial cell infection in vitro. Using experimental evolution, we demonstrate that the hns genotype constrains adaptive mutations and that disabling virulence gene expression is a common path to improved fitness in intracellular-like environments.

We recorded scalp EEG in a delayed free-recall task in which participants encoded common noun word lists either under full attention (encoding only) or divided attention (simultaneous target detection task). In the target detection task, participants pressed a response button when a word was paired with a target-colored square but not for words paired with a distractor-colored square (cue condition).

Divided attention attenuated this change in gamma power across the list. Cue condition modulated alpha activity evenly across serial positions, with consistently lower power during target trials than distractor trials. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific characteristics of processing during list encoding may reflect multiple components of attention that vary over different time scales.

A comprehensive morphological, physiological and transcriptomic analysis was performed in wild-type GP compared with hvbzip33 and hvbzip76 mutants under drought stress. The morphological and physiological changes were similar in both mutants and in the wild-type GP. Most strikingly, the mutants exhibited accelerated wilting and increased water loss. This effect was primarily caused by higher stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) in mutants compared to wild-type GP under both control and drought conditions, which in turn had a detrimental effect on the mutant's intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). Likewise, the transcriptome profiles of hvbzip33 and hvbzip76 were more similar to each other than those of wild-type GP. We found that the number of differentially regulated genes under control versus drought-stress conditions was higher in the mutants than in wild-type GP, suggesting that the mutants try to compensate for accelerated foliar water loss.

C.; Gomez, R.", "abstract": "The RhD-negative blood type exhibits statistically anomalous frequency peaks in geographically linked populations. The Basque population shows the world's highest frequency (~30-35%), while specific Berber populations in North Africa also display elevated frequencies (~15-20%). This paper presents a quantitative population genetics model synthesizing recent archaeogenetic data to explain this distribution. We developed a synergistic selection framework where the net selective advantage of the costly RHD deletion becomes positive when statistically associated with other beneficial traits. Our modeling indicates that admixture between indigenous European hunter gatherers (carrying a high frequency of the classic RHD deletion) and migrating Neolithic farmers from the Near East (carrying the SLC24A5 allele for lighter skin) within the Iberian Peninsula created conditions where synergistic survival advantages drove rapid co-amplification of these traits. This pre-adapted lineage was then distributed via documented Neolithic gene flow to Northwest Africa, with molecular evidence confirming the European RHD deletion haplotype in Berber populations. Our quantitative framework explains the trans-Mediterranean allele distribution and provides testable predictions for future validation through ancient DNA analysis and population genetic simulations.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Many lineages, particularly those from these extreme environments, remain uncultured and are known only from metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), limiting their integration into formal taxonomy. Analysis of 46 steam vent associated samples from Hawaii using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that cyanobacteria dominate these communities. Gloeobacter kilaueensis dominated pit-like environments with low-light conditions, while Leptolyngbyaceae and other families are more dominant in structured soil and wall communities. We further reconstructed 38 high-quality cyanobacterial MAGs and incorporated them into a phylogenomic analysis comprising 343 cyanobacterial genomes, followed by genome-based comparisons against 9,026 reference genomes. This revealed eight novel species and one novel genus spanning five orders: Chroococcidiopsidales, Leptolyngbyales, Nostocales, Oculatellales, and Oscillatoriales. Following SeqCode guidelines, we provide the first formal taxonomic descriptions of cyanobacterial MAGs and propose guidelines for integrating genome-based and cultivated material. These findings highlight Hawaiian steam vents as hotspots of previously uncharacterized cyanobacterial diversity and underscore the importance of genome-based nomenclature.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

V.; Ravi, S.", "abstract": "Navigating dense clutter requires honeybees to execute rapid visuomotor comparisons to identify the best route. How they resolve perceptual inputs to make a passage choice from multiple options is an open question. We studied this in a free flying paradigm where bees were challenged to choose between a taller and shorter aperture with varying height difference. We monitored choice across four height difference ratios at three spatial scales. Bees chose the taller aperture in all tests, but the precision of these choices depended heavily on the absolute size of the gap. For each size scale of aperture pairs, psychometric modelling revealed that when making a choice bees generally evaluate the relative height difference, conforming to Weber's law. However, bees' choices were non-uniformly sensitive across aperture size scales. Bees had greater sensitivity at the smallest spatial scale, where the likelihood of collision danger is larger. This deviation in behaviour due to absolute aperture size suggests a dynamic risk-cost trade-off. Bees appear to prioritise costly, high-acuity inspections only when imposed by critical physical constraints of the environment, relaxing this vigilance at safer, larger scales to conserve energy.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

However, the full spectrum of pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their specific structural consequences remain incompletely characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to elucidate pathogenic nsSNPs and their role in the Congenital Sensory Neuropathy (HSAN II) by employing in-silico analysis. Method: The nsSNPs of RETREG1 were retrieved from the dbSNP in NCBI database. Different in silico tools, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, SNP&GO, PHD-SNP, SNAP2, I-mutant, Project Hope, MutPred, ConSurf, phyre2, Chimera, and GeneMANIA, were used for predicting the pathogenicity, protein stability, evolutionary conservation, structural alterations, and protein-protein interaction networks.for RETREG1 gene. Result: Five nsSNPs were identified as \"damaging\" or deleterious by using the above software (Y221C, G216R, G211R, L119V, W107C). Four SNPs (Y221C, G211R, L119V, and W107C) were predicted to decrease protein stability, while the fifth SNP (G216R) was expected to increase it. Structural modeling revealed that all five mutations are located within the critical Reticulon Homology Domain (RHD), where they are predicted to cause steric clashes, disrupt hydrophobic packing, and impair protein-membrane interactions. Conclusion: This integrated in silico analysis identifies four novel deleterious nsSNPs in RETREG1 (W107C, L119V, G211R, Y221C) and confirms the established G216R variant. These mutations are predicted to impair RETREG1 structure and function, providing mechanistic insight into HSAN II pathogenesis and prioritizing candidates for future experimental validation.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

However, their potential against obligate biotrophic pathogens like powdery mildews remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Magnesium Iron-LDH (MgFe-LDH) nanomaterials as carriers of fungal effector dsRNA (Ef-dsRNA) and evaluated the efficacy of the resulting complex in suppressing Erysiphe pisi (powdery mildew) infection in pea (Pisum sativum) via foliar spray application. The synthesized LDH nanomaterial exhibits strong leaf adherence, biocompatibility, and high dsRNA loading capacity, protects the dsRNA against RNase-mediated degradation, and facilitates its sustained release over time. Foliar spray application of the Ef-dsRNA-LDH complex on intact pea plants results in enhanced gene silencing of the target fungal effector and confers greater and prolonged local and systemic powdery mildew disease protection compared to treatments with dsRNA or LDH alone. Following spray application, the LDH nanomaterial is rapidly taken up by intact pea leaf cells and from the plant into E. pisi hyphae via haustoria, enabling efficient dsRNA delivery and silencing of the target gene up to 15 days post-application. Overall, our Ef-dsRNA-LDH formulation offers a robust, sustainable, and targeted approach for RNAi-mediated control of powdery mildews.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Computational modeling revealed that anxious individuals misattribute stochastic fluctuations to environmental change, resulting in elevated reward learning rates and impaired evidence accumulation. In a second experiment combining task performance with overnight sleep EEG, greater N3 sleep was associated with reduced learning rates and improved evidence accumulation.

While differences among autistic children in processing non-linguistic social-emotional cues compared to non-autistic pears are well-documented, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of social-emotional meaning conveyed through the language content remain unclear. In non-autistic adults, the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are sensitive to social-emotional semantics. We investigated whether this neural sensitivity is altered in autistic children. Methods: We recruited 78 children (54 autistic and 24 non-autistic; 68 males, 10 females; mean age 10 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while listening to sentences describing either people in emotional situations (social-emotional sentences) or sentences describing non-human objects, events, or concepts (object sentences). Results: Significant activity was found in the left STG and STS in response to social-emotional sentences across both groups, but the activity was reduced in autistic children compared to non-autistic controls. No significant group difference was found during general auditory or object-sentence processing. The neural activity in the left STG and STS during social-emotional sentence processing was significantly predicted by the degree of autistic social-affective characteristics but was not predicted by general linguistic ability. Conclusions: Autistic children show reduced activity in the left STG and STS compared to non-autistic peers during social-emotional sentence processing. This reduced activity, driven by social-affective characteristics rather than general linguistic ability, may contribute to autistic children's social communication challenges.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

While combining CAR-T cell therapy with chemotherapy can enhance antitumor activity, this often leads to substantial systemic toxicity. In this study, we introduce CAR-T-drug conjugate (CAR-T-D-C), a new class of dual-functional therapeutics that effectively addresses these obstacles by integrating click chemistry for precise conjugation of cytotoxic agents onto antigen-specific CAR-T cells. By transforming the hostile TME into an ally, this approach facilitates localized delivery of cytotoxic payload directly to the tumor site, enhancing the overall effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors. CAR-T-D-Cs with different CAR-T cell binders exhibit robust antitumor activity across diverse solid tumor models, including both human tumor xenografts and syngeneic models. Spatial transcriptomic studies reveals that CAR-T-D-C achieves improved CAR-T tumor infiltration and functional activation within the TME. Compared to conventional CAR-T therapy, CAR-T-D-C markedly enhances immune cell infiltration, augments effector functions, promotes antigen spreading, amplifies systemic immune responses, and improves overall anti-tumor immunity. CAR-T-D-C represents a versatile therapeutic concept that combines the potency of small molecule drugs and the specificity of CAR-T cells as a 2-in-1 immunochemotherapy for treatment of solid tumors.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Using three-spined sticklebacks, where males are the sole providers of energetically costly parental care, we investigated the factors driving patterns of cannibalism in two natural populations in the field. Cannibalism was prevalent in both populations: more than 70% of parenting males contained embryos in their stomach. Neither standard length nor body condition predicted the number of embryos eaten, suggesting that males are not cannibalizing based on energetic need alone. However, males cannibalized significantly more embryos from large compared to small broods, suggesting that greater access to embryos is driving high levels of cannibalism. Using microsatellites to determine parentage, we investigated whether males cannibalize embryos fertilized by other males (heterocannibalism) to mitigate the costs of parental care. In both populations males engaged in both filial and heterocannibalism, but the two populations significantly differed in the relative amount of filial versus heterocannibalism, suggesting that males in these two populations face different reproductive costs.

This study explores the utility of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework for developing thematic urban ecosystem accounts as integrated metrics to inform urban greening in the Western Balkans. We constructed pilot accounts for the Western Balkans for 2018, with particular focus on Horizon-funded CROSS-REIS countries, where local accounts were also developed for representative municipalities (Kranj, Rijeka, Nis, Podgorica, Tirana). The accounts quantify ecosystem extent, four condition metrics (imperviousness, green space, tree cover, and PM10; concentration), and the service air filtration using PM10; deposition onto vegetation as a proxy. Results were benchmarked nationally against EU/EFTA/UK countries and locally against Italian municipalities of the National Biodiversity Future Centre project. The analysis reveals that urban ecosystems in the Western Balkans exist on a continuum with other European countries but exhibit a distinct, more homogeneous profile shaped by geography, climate, and policy legacies. The accounts identify ecological degradation hotspots (e.g., high soil sealing) and areas of high service-delivery capacity, supporting translation of spatial diagnosis into targeted greening priorities.

The specific factors that contribute to the higher incidence of AA and its complications with aging remain unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated in AA. However, the connection between aging, aortic MMP activity, and the increased prevalence of AA and its complications has not been systematically evaluated. This study leveraged MMP-targeted molecular imaging to investigate how aging affects aortic MMP expression and activity, as well as aneurysm development and survival. Methods: AA development and animal survival were monitored for 28 days after Angiotensin (Ang)-II infusion in 8-10-week-old (young) and >51-week-old (old) Apoe-/- mice. Aortic MMP activation was quantified by PET/CT using an MMP-targeted tracer, 64Cu-RYM2, at baseline and 1 week after Ang II infusion. MMP activity and expression were quantified by tissue zymography and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared between different segments of the aorta in young and old animals, and before and after Ang II infusion. Results: Old animal survival to 28 days was significantly lower than that of young Ang-II-infused Apoe-/- mice (P < 0.05). 64Cu-RYM2 PET/CT showed significantly higher aortic MMP activation before and 1 week after Ang-II infusion in old compared to young Apoe-/- mice. The 64Cu-RYM2 signal was significantly higher in animals that did not survive 28 days than those that did (P < 0.01). MMP activity significantly increased by 4 days after Ang-II infusion, when dissection was found in a subset of Apoe-/- mice; and was significantly higher in the dissected, compared to adjacent, apparently normal, segments of the aorta. MMP activity was also significantly higher in the ascending thoracic aorta of untreated young and old mice, as well as of Ang-II-treated Apoe-/- mice (which was associated with significantly higher Mmp2 gene expression), and of old wild-type mice.

L.; Bann, Y.; Hecht, M. H.", "abstract": "De novo proteins that share no ancestry with natural sequences can serve as additions to the evolved proteomes of living cells. Upon expression in cells, these novel proteins can provide biological functions that alter cell viability and growth. To isolate such proteins, we searched a combinatorial library of novel sequences by selecting for sequences that sustain the growth of E. coli under conditions where the recipient cell would otherwise be inviable. This led to the discovery of Resc4 (Rescuer 4), a de novo protein that sustains growth on minimal medium of an E. coli strain harboring a lethal deletion of metC, which encodes cystathionine {beta}-lyase, an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of methionine. Surprisingly, despite its ability to rescue the deletion of a biosynthetic enzyme, Resc4 is insoluble. Nonetheless, Resc4 sustains the growth of {Delta}metC cells by upregulating expression of metB, which encodes a different enzyme, cystathionine {gamma}-synthase, which has a moonlighting activity that compensates for the deleted activity encoded by metC. Proteomic analysis revealed that Resc4 co-precipitates MetJ, the repressor of the methionine biosynthesis operon. Precipitation of MetJ leads to overproduction of cystathionine {gamma}-synthase, thereby allowing it to rescue the deletion of metC. These results, taken together with previous findings on other de novo proteins, demonstrate that novel proteins added to a cell's proteome can perform life sustaining functions, and may shed light on de novo gene birth -- both in synthetic biology and in natural evolution.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

The complex behavior of this molecular system, resulting in three different phases (i.e., nucleation, elongation, and steady state) is clear by looking at the way these dynamics emerge from a large number of interactions between different proteins, regulatory elements, and signaling pathways. In this article, we present an agent-based model of actin polymerization dynamics implemented with the NetLogo simulation platform and focus on the time evolution of actin filaments length distribution in two dimensions starting from a pool of free G-actin monomers. Stochastic simulations were able to reproduce the three main steps of the in vitro process, i.e., nucleation, extension, and steady state. In the steady state phase, simultaneous treadmilling of subpopulations of F-actin filaments spontaneously occurs as an emergent property of the system, as shown by several diagnostic criteria. We also found that during the early phases of polymerization the dynamics are characterized by the competition between the formation of new polymers and the elongation of pre-existing ones. In this regard, we highlighted that the balance between nucleation and elongation is particularly sensitive to variation in the initial number of free monomers available for association, as well as on other parameters included in the model. Altogether, our observations are consistent with the experimental findings and confirm the satisfactory performance of the model, as well as its ability to simulate complex mechanisms by manipulating a few parameters.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Astrocytes were recruited at stimulation intensities as low as 10A, thresholds sufficient to activate neurons, indicating that astrocytes robustly sense electrical perturbation. Unlike neurons, however, astrocytic responses were spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable across trials. At higher stimulation intensities (>=50A), astrocytic responsiveness, i.e., response peak amplitude, and number of responsive trials, progressively attenuated across repeated trials, in contrast to the stable and consistent neuronal responses. Although neuronally driven, astrocytes exhibited a distinct response profile under the same stimulation parameter, revealing a unique component of electrically evoked cortical activity that underscores the importance of incorporating glial physiology into future neuroprosthetic strategies.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Purpose: Speech perception requires that listeners classify sensory information into smaller groupings while also coping with noise that often corrupts the speech signal. The strength of categorization and speech-in-noise (SIN) abilities show stark individual differences. Some listeners perceive speech sounds in a gradient fashion, while others categorize in a discrete/binary manner, favoring fine acoustic details vs. a more abstract phonetic code, respectively. Prior work suggests SIN processing is (i) related to more gradient phonetic perception and (ii) varies with musical training. Method: To further probe relations between perceptual gradiency and noise-degraded listening, we measured phoneme categorization, SIN recognition (QuickSIN), and sentence recognition in listeners with varying musical backgrounds. Categorization was measured for vowels and stops using standard labeling tasks. Speech recognition and discrimination were assessed using 'elliptical speech' sentences that use featural substitutions which renders them meaningless under clean conditions but surprisingly improves their recognition under noise degradation. We hypothesized listeners who use broader perceptual equivalency classes in hearing elliptical speech would show better SIN perception, indicative of a more gradient listening strategy. Results: Listeners perceived elliptical sentences as sounding different than their intact counterparts in the clear but as the same under noise degradation. But this elliptical benefit varied with music background. Nonmusicians showed larger susceptibility and noise-related benefit of ellipses than musicians, consistent with the notion they used broader phonetic categories (i.e., more gradient listening). Elliptical speech perception was also associated with QuickSIN performance in both groups but in opposite ways. Conclusions: Use of broader categories was related to better SIN processing in nonmusicians but poorer SIN processing in musicians. Findings suggest listeners can use broader perceptual equivalence classes to deal with degraded listening situations but this depends critically on their auditory demographics. Nonmusicians might use broader phonetic categories to aid SIN perception while musicians might use narrower categories or otherwise similar speech contexts.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Women with endometriosis who are trying to conceive may experience infertility and have a higher risk of obstetric complications. They are also more likely to miscarry and to have placental defects during pregnancy. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy remains unclear. Defects in implantation and placentation may be present, but these processes are difficult to study in humans. To address this issue, we created a mouse model of endometriosis and examined pregnancy using the CBAxDBA crossbreed, which is commonly employed to study the immunology of pregnancy. We examined early and late gestational stages using this model. In our model, we confirmed that the presence of endometriosis-like lesions resulted in fewer implantations and a higher proportion of fetal resorptions, which are analogous to miscarriages. We also used a model of endometriosis in which the immune system had been preconceptionally trained to induce immune tolerance. We observed that endometriotic lesions were smaller in mice with this immunomodulation, and gestational complications were corrected. At early gestation (E9.5), fetal-maternal interfaces were retrieved to assess a potential impact of endometriosis and immunomodulation on placental development through single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Our data shows that most of the changes induced by endometriosis occur in the decidual stromal cells, which originate from the endometrium. In these cells, we observe a consistent upregulation of Gata4, a transcription factor previously found to be elevated in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. We also observed a downregulation of Prap1, which is an indicator of uterine receptivity and successful implantation in mice. The transcriptomic changes induced by endometriosis were partially reversed when immune tolerance was induced in mice. In immune cells, endometriosis leads to inflammation associated signature. Additionally, the interferon gamma response is reduced in NK cells, which has been shown to be crucial for spiral artery remodelling and decidual integrity, which may be involved in the observed increased resorption rate.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

From structural considerations, we hypothesized that certain mutations in the VHL gene thermodynamically destabilize the folded protein product; these mutations would increase the ratio of unfolded:folded pVHL, and thus cause loss of function. To test this, we used computational structure-based screening followed by biophysical characterization and cellular assays to identify small molecules that bind to the folded (native) conformation of pVHL and stabilize it. These studies led to creation of an agent, CP4.29, that stabilized the native folded structure of mutant pVHL, that restores wild-type pVHL activities to cells that harbor mutant VHL. These compounds may serve as starting points for further development into an unprecedented new class of kidney cancer drugs. The approach described herein may also serve as a blueprint for developing agents to correct destabilized mutations underlying other human diseases.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Leshchiner, I.; Flynn, R. L.", "abstract": "Activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway accounts for cellular immortalization in 75% of pediatric osteosarcoma. ALT does not rely on a single enzyme but instead, catalyzes telomere elongation via homologous recombination. There has been steady progress in defining the mechanisms that regulate the ALT pathway. However, the spectrum of genetic mutations that underlie activation of ALT remains unclear. Osteosarcomas, like many cancers, frequently harbor inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53. However, instead of single nucleotide variants that lead to expression of mutant TP53 protein, osteosarcoma tumors often acquire unique structural variations within the first intron of the TP53 gene leading to complete gene inactivation. TP53 is located on chromosome 17p13.1 in a head-to-head orientation and partially overlapping with the gene WRAP53 (WD repeat containing antisense to TP53). WRAP53, also known as TCAB1, is an RNA chaperone that is an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme. TCAB1 functions to facilitate trafficking of the telomerase RNA (hTR) within the nucleus to ensure assembly and localization of the telomerase enzyme to telomere ends to promote telomere elongation. Loss of TCAB1 function abolishes telomerase activity, driving progressive telomere attrition. Here, using whole-genome sequencing of osteosarcoma samples we identified SVs within the TP53 gene that not only compromise TP53, but also inactivate TCAB1. These TCAB1 SVs were prevalent in approximately 40% of ALT positive osteosarcoma tumors suggesting that functional inactivation of the telomerase holoenzyme may be an early and previously unrecognized event contributing to the activation of the ALT pathway.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

S.; Visvabharathy, L.", "abstract": "Infection rates involving bacterial and viral pathogens have increased precipitously after the COVID-19 pandemic. While it has been speculated that higher infection rates resulted from increased hospitalizations throughout the pandemic or greater use of antibiotics, precisely why rates remain high today has remained unexplained. Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to occur post-COVID and may disrupt immune responses. Within T cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to low mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial apoptosis, and decreased mitochondrial respiration, which together impact cellular activation and function beyond the acute phase of illness. Here, we demonstrate that decreased mitochondrial function in antigen-specific T cells post-COVID may contribute to higher infection susceptibility by metabolically immobilizing T cell memory responses. Using donor-matched peripheral blood samples from 31 COVID-naive individuals who subsequently contracted COVID-19, we tracked how influenza A (IAV), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) T cell responses were impacted by COVID-19 infection. We found that gene expression linked to T cell activation decreased but mitochondrial redox pathways increased in CD4 memory T cells post-COVID. However, mitochondrial flux and reactive oxygen species production were limited in a plurality of post-COVID memory T cells after stimulation with IAV, SA, and VZV. Furthermore, we found a disordered relationship between memory T cell mobilization of glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways post-COVID which resulted in diminished use of catabolic pathways including glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in antigen-specific T cells. Modulation of mitochondrial function with metformin and ubiquinol partially rescued the post-COVID decline in T cell catabolism. Collectively, these findings indicate that COVID-19 infection may have lasting effects on inhibiting T cell memory responses to commonly encountered community-acquired pathogens which can be corrected with commonly available medications. This has significant implications for the clinical care of immunologically vulnerable populations in the post-pandemic era.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Upon infection, cytokines secreted by the immune system regulate redistribution of glucose to meet new metabolic needs associated with clearing the pathogen. We develop a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of such adaptation of metabolic pathways mediated by the immune response and its impact on the ability to clear pathogen and restore health. We find that cytokine-regulated redistribution of glucose resources in different tissues is critical for an effective immune response to pathogen as strictly clamping plasma glucose levels to homeostatic levels results in an ineffective immune response. By studying the effects of various parameters in our model, we describe how aberrant regulation of adaptation mechanisms affect outcomes of infection. Too high a glucose consumption rate by innate immune cells to mediate functions results in failure to clear pathogen. Pathogens with a very high replication rate can be controlled to low levels, but at a very high metabolic cost. Too low a pathogen replication rate allows the pathogen to hide from the immune system and rebound to high levels at later times. Finally, the strength of the innate immune response must be regulated to not be too high, not only to limit immunopathogenesis, but also for mediating an effective adaptive immune response.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

IC/BPS symptoms can be localized to the pelvic-region or have co-occurring widespread pain. Importantly, response to treatment depends on pain localization phenotype. The etiology of IC/BPS remains elusive, and whether bacteria contribute to IC/BPS pathophysiology remains uncertain. Materials and Methods: We used urine samples collected from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial of individuals with IC/BPS to study the association of the urobiome and IC/BPS symptoms over time. Individuals provided urine samples at baseline, post-treatment, and at five months. We performed a secondary analysis on urine samples applying 16S rRNA sequencing and assigned bacterial taxonomy to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) to characterize the urobiome. We then compared urobiome bacterial diversity, stability, and its association with IC/BPS symptoms over time. We also assessed the relationship between pain localization and the urobiome. Results: As validation of this dataset, we noted a strong influence of menopausal status and recent urinary tract infection on the composition of the urobiome. We did not detect widespread differences in the urobiome that correlated with subjects' pain localization or severity. Instead, we observed specific bacterial sequences that were altered in abundance in relation to symptomatology, such as reduced abundance of a Dialister ASV in persons with localized pelvic pain.

Using structural analysis, single molecule imaging, and synthetic CTD-engineered Pol II constructs, we defined the minimal sequence requirements across transcriptional stages. We show that while SP motifs are essential phosphorylation sites, flanking residues tolerate variability. In contrast, the periodic positioning of tyrosine residues is indispensable for pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly through interactions with the Mediator, which are disrupted upon Ser5 phosphorylation triggering promoter escape. This supports a 'zipper' model where sequential tyrosine engagement stabilizes PIC assembly and progressive phosphorylation propels Pol II escape.

BAT is pre-market approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of heart failure and received an FDA humanitarian device exemption for drug resistant hypertension. However, responder rates are limited by side-effects including numbness in the head and neck, altered speech, respiratory constriction, dry cough, vomiting, and altered sensory and motor function of the tongue. We hypothesized that these side-effects are driven by activation of other nearby nerve fibers of similar or lower threshold than the carotid sinus nerve. In this study, we sought to identify the neural sources responsible for off-target muscle activation contributing to these side-effects. These sources would inform strategies mitigating off-target activation in BAT therapy. Methods: Domestic swine were used in this work as the diameter and thickness of the swine carotid artery are closer to human than those of canine models. A monopolar disk electrode mimicking the clinical CVRx (R) Neo electrode was surgically placed proximal to the carotid bifurcation with the position optimized for stimulation dose responsive changes in blood pressure. Evoked responses were recorded during dose response testing from multiple neck muscles, and the corresponding off-target nerve pathways were identified by sequential transection of nearby nerves. Results: The following activated off-target muscle groups and their corresponding nerve pathways were verified which included 1) the cricoarytenoid via recurrent laryngeal nerve, 2) cricothyroid via superior laryngeal nerve, 3) sternocleidomastoid via accessory nerve, and 4) the tongue via hypoglossal nerve. The constrictor muscle group was also activated through a more complex neural pathway. Conclusion: We identified multiple sources of therapy-limiting side effects of BAT in the swine model.

Despite this potential, their inherent cross-reactivity limits tumor specificity, while single-antigen targeting provides limited coverage of intratumoral heterogeneity. Dual-TCR therapeutics comprising two distinct TCRs could enhance tumor specificity via combinatorial recognition while broadening coverage across heterogeneous antigens. However, practical development of dual-TCR therapeutics has been limited by /{beta} subunit mispairing that prevents efficient production and creates undesired binding properties. Here, we develop orthogonal TCR /{beta} interfaces that prevent subunit mispairing. Using computational multistate design and second-site suppressor strategies implemented in Rosetta, we identified over 250 TCR variants for experimental screening to assess protein stability and pairing fidelity. The top-performing designs achieved approximately 95% correct pairing, as validated by mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Focusing mutations on constant domains and conserved framework regions of variable domains enabled broad applicability across diverse TCRs while preserving antigen recognition. Using these orthogonal interfaces, we developed trispecific T-cell engagers (TriTEs) that target two cancer-testis antigens and CD3 on T cells, demonstrating enhanced potency under dual-antigen engagement (EC50 of 380 fM) while maintaining high activity when targeting cells displaying a single antigen (EC50s of 48 pM and 20 pM).

Notably, this condition increases the risk of developing an aggressive ovarian cancer (OC) subtype known as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The impact of progesterone (P4) on the development of OC subtypes remains unclear. Research suggests a potential interplay between Progesterone Receptor (PR) signaling and BRCA1/2 actions. BRCA1 regulates PR expression and transcriptional activity, while P4 can drive estrogen receptor/PR complexes to BRCA1 DNA binding motifs. Normal fallopian tube tissues from healthy BRCA1/2 carriers (the cells of origin for HGSOC) exhibit gene signatures similar to those in HGSOC only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, when circulating P4 levels are elevated. This implies a potential role for PR/BRCA complexes in modulating OC initiation and progression. To explore this interaction, BRCA1 was depleted in an ES-2 PR-B+ OC cell models using CRISPR-mediated gene editing. We hypothesized that BRCA1 depletion would alter PR-mediated signaling and reveal novel regulatory mechanisms. Depletion of BRCA1 led to increased total basal PR protein levels and site-specific hyperphosphorylation at S294 and S81 following R5020 (synthetic progestin) treatment. RNA sequencing of NE-1 and KO-BRCA1 pools treated with R5020 identified a high-confidence set of BRCA1-dependent, R5020-induced genes predominately involved with migration and cytoskeletal organization. Transwell assays revealed that R5020 treatment stimulates migration, an effect amplified upon BRCA1 depletion. Inhibition of PIP5K1C using UNC3230 blocked R5020-induced migration in one of the KO-BRCA1 cell pools with pan-Rho inhibitor CT04 showing 3 similar results. The Rac1 inhibitor EHT-1864 suppressed all R5020-induced migration. In contrast, co-treatment with a pan-ROCK1/2 inhibitor Y-27632 resulted in an increase in R5020-induced migration, which was further enhanced with BRCA1 depletion.

The contribution of platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR or PDGFR{beta}) to muscle fibrosis is yet to be clarified. We hypothesized that both receptors would promote ECM deposition and fibrosis, causing muscle stiffening and weakness, with sex-specific differences arising due to hormonal influences on receptors. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model with inducible overactive PDGFR or PDGFR{beta} signaling and assessed various indicators of muscle function, metabolism, motor coordination, exercise capacity, collagen deposition, and muscle stiffness. Results: Overactive PDGFR led to more collagen deposition, increased collagen crosslinking, and higher AGE/LOX protein levels, all of which correlated with greater muscle stiffness compared to CON. Overactive PDGFR{beta} resulted in greater muscle mass and lower fat mass, and had higher collagen deposition in female mice compared to CON. There were also sex-specific differences with fibrotic remodeling, muscle stiffness, and muscle size in response to overactive PDGFR and PDGFR{beta} signaling.

We find that growth rate fluctuations are largely uncorrelated with protein production and contribute substantially to noise in protein concentrations. In addition, as nutrients are varied, growth rate fluctuations decrease both in amplitude and duration with the mean growth rate. In contrast, fluctuations in production do not show a systematic dependence on mean growth rate, but exhibit surprisingly variable behaviors, even across different constitutive promoters. Moreover, although production and growth rate fluctuations are only weakly correlated, they exhibit complex cross-correlation patterns with growth rate that are both condition- and promoter-dependent. These observations suggest that, while growth rate fluctuations might be dominated by a single underlying mechanism, there are multiple sources of protein production fluctuations that vary in strength across conditions and affect different promoters to different extents. Finally, the sampling noise of proteins at cell division only contributes substantially to protein concentration noise for low-expressed genes with ten or fewer molecules per cell.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) have emerged as reproducible methods for capturing spatiotemporal network interactions in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). However, these methods remain sensitive to methodological factors such as scan duration, repetition time (TR), and frequency band selection. This study systematically evaluates how these parameters influence the stability and reliability of QPP- and cPCA-derived functional connectivity patterns across multiple datasets. Using five independent rs-fMRI datasets, we evaluate the impact of scan length on pattern reliability, explore the effects of TR on spatiotemporal patterns, and compare the sensitivity of different frequency bands (Slow-5, Slow-4, infraslow) in capturing network dynamics. Our findings reveal that while both QPPs and cPCA detect intrinsic network activity, their reliability varies with acquisition parameters. QPPs exhibit greater stability in shorter scans, making them suitable for individual-level analyses, whereas cPCA provides a broader representation of phase-coherent fluctuations but shows greater between-subject variability and benefits more from longer, group-level acquisitions. Additionally, frequency band selection significantly influences the temporal structure of extracted patterns: in our analyses, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) tended to emphasize more recurrent, synchronized network configurations, whereas Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) more often revealed transitions between connectivity states. These results provide critical insights into optimizing methodological choices for dynamic functional connectivity analysis, enhancing the interpretability of spatiotemporal patterns in both basic and clinical neuroimaging research.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Our findings demonstrate that ABCC1 operates on a dual level: intracellularly, by transporting toxic FITC and fluorescein out of DCs, and extracellularly, by contributing to a glutathione (GSH) buffer zone that protects surrounding cells. DCs are particularly susceptible to FITC-mediated toxicity, possibly due to their high endocytic activity. This study elucidates the critical dependence of DCs on ABCC1 and extracellular GSH for resistance to toxic organic molecules and thereby identifies potential therapeutic avenues targeting ABCC1 to modulate immune responses.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

To determine the phenotypic potential of viruses, deep mutational scanning (DMS) can be used. This approach measures the effects of all amino acid changes at sites of interest on protein function, virus infectivity, or resistance to therapeutics. A virus library that contains all possible variants is produced and used to infect a culture of cells. The frequency of each amino acid at the DMS site in the infected culture relative to the input stock captures the relative fitness for each form under the selective pressure applied. Current DMS protocols are complex and costly due to reliance on deep sequencing for genomic characterization. They also require expertise in bioinformatics to process and analyze the data, thus limiting the number of labs that can apply the technology. Here, we describe a simple and efficient protocol to perform DMS on single sites and on two-site combinations in the Env protein of HIV-1. Dual-site DMS allows probing for epistatic effects. The protocol greatly reduces recombination of the proviral genome in transformed bacteria, thus efficiency of the method. Sequencing is performed using Oxford Nanopore technology, and the data are uploaded to a graphical user interface-based platform that calculates the amino acid preferences, which describe the relative fitness of all amino acids under the experimental conditions tested (e.g., under selection pressure of a drug). The protocol does not require expertise in bioinformatics and can be completed in approximately 16 days, with 3-4 days of laboratory activity and 12-13 days of incubation, with considerably lower costs than existing systems.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we define design principles that maximize IVT mRNA performance across diverse cellular and organismal systems. Through systematic comparison of capping strategies and base modifications, including N1-methyl-pseudouridine, 5-methylcytidine, and 5-methoxyuridine, we identify modifications that enhance translation while minimizing activation of cellular stress responses. Optimized transcripts drive robust protein expression within four hours, persist for up to one week, and support multiplexed expression of structurally and functionally distinct proteins in mammalian cells, including cancer cell lines, iPSC-derived systems, primary cells, and organoids, as well as in vivo in zebrafish embryos and in less genetically tractable models such as Danionella cerebrum and sea urchin embryos. To further expand accessibility for community use, we developed mRNAbow, a platform for generating low-toxicity mRNAs encoding organelle-targeted fluorescent proteins and biosensors for multiplex imaging, with corresponding plasmids made publicly available.

For example, variation must be minimized to build organs with consistent size and shape, yet the initiation of organogenesis requires a subset of cells to take on a new fate, a process that often relies on small differences between cells. In plants, much of development is controlled by the hormone auxin, which has been hypothesized to coordinate cell responses by inducing degradation of transcriptional repressors. To quantify the level of cell-to-cell variation and directly test its connection to auxin signaling, we assessed variation in expression of a lateral root founder cell marker GATA23 when auxin levels or responsiveness was modulated. We found that auxin acted as both an amplifier and a constrainer of transcriptional variation during the initiation of a new root. We then extended this work to analysis of root regeneration, where auxin was also found to play a critical role in coordinating cells during fate transitions.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

However, the extremely limited protein content of individual cells (femtogram to picogram levels) pushes current mass spectrometry instrumentation to its sensitivity limits, creating a critical analytical bottleneck. While selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using triple quadrupole (QqQ) instruments offers advantages in sensitivity and reproducibility for targeted proteomics quantification, SRM still struggles with sensitivity for quantification of moderate- or low-abundance proteins from single-cell sample amounts. Here, we report the development and systematic evaluation of a dual ion funnel interface designed to address the sensitivity limitation by significantly enhancing ion transmission efficiency in commercial QqQ mass spectrometers. The dual ion funnel interface, composed of a curved S-funnel followed by a conventional ion funnel, improves ion transmission efficiency while reducing chemical noise through selective ion focusing. The performance of the dual ion funnel interface was systematically compared to standard interface on a TSQ Vantage platform across samples with different levels of complexity. The dual funnel interface demonstrated to provide up to 25-fold improvement in sensitivity across a wide range of protein concentrations in different biological matrices (low complex mouse macrophage and high complex human cells). Critically, enhanced sensitivity was accompanied by increased analytical reproducibility with lower coefficient of variations. Most importantly, the dual funnel interface enabled reliable quantification of low-abundance proteins that were barely detectable or not detected by the standard interface, extending analysis to single-cell equivalent amounts while maintaining excellent reproducibility. These results demonstrate that the dual funnel interface addresses the critical bottleneck in quantitative targeted proteomics, providing a technological foundation for ultrasensitive targeted SCP that requires both high sensitivity and robust quantitative performance.", "date": "2026-01-02", "journal": ""}

We analyzed genome-wide experimental data on oxidative DNA damage and found that the highest damage levels occur in regions with low vIP values, supporting a causal link between them. The analysis of cancer mutational signatures and their annotated aetiologies revealed strong anticorrelations between mutation frequency and vIP values, particularly in cancers driven by oxidative DNA damage, such as lung cancer. We further computed anticorrelations between vIP values and the frequencies of mutated motifs across coding and non-coding regions and across different mutation types, observing the strongest anticorrelations for silent mutations, consistent with their reduced selective pressure. Moreover, similar anticorrelations were observed for somatic mutations in cancer and normal tissues, as well as for germline mutations, suggesting that they arise from similar mutagenesis processes.

Greater time outdoors was linked to earlier sleep timing and fewer sleep complaints, whereas more frequent device use in bed was associated with greater sleep disturbance and daytime impairment.

Translational profiling of PL Camk2a cells uncovered a biphasic consolidation program, with an early phase characterized by ER stress-linked translational repression and robust oligodendrocyte plasticity, followed by a delayed phase engaging synaptic growth pathways. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that eIF2-regulated, cap-independent translation is essential for recent consolidation and for the enduring stabilization of remote memory, whereas retrieval-induced destabilization engages a mechanistically distinct, eIF4E-dependent translational pathway required for reconsolidation.

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ascl1SA6-induced neurons only partially recapitulated canonical interneuron programs and failed to induce the transcription factor Dlx2 and its downstream targets.

However, most existing region-based methods characterize methylation dysregulation primarily through changes in mean methylation levels associated with a phenotype of interest. Substantial evidence indicates that phenotype-associated methylation alterations may also manifest through changes in methylation variability or through joint shifts in mean and variability. Despite this, no existing statistical framework jointly models mean-variance methylation changes in a region-based manner. We propose ReMeDy, a flexible statistical framework that uses a hierarchical likelihood approach within a generalized linear model setting to identify differentially methylated regions, variably methylated regions, and regions exhibiting joint differential and variable methylation at a genome-wide scale. Unlike existing models, ReMeDy operates directly on biologically defined co-methylated regions, allowing it to naturally capture spatial correlation inherent in DNA methylation array data, while avoiding reliance on heuristic, user-defined tuning parameters such as smoothing spans and kernel bandwidths that can substantially influence results and introduce subjectivity. Through extensive simulation studies and comprehensive benchmarking against popular models, we demonstrate that ReMeDy maintains false discovery and type-I error rates at nominal levels while achieving consistently higher statistical power across a wide range of realistic scenarios. Application to population-level DNA methylation data further shows that ReMeDy identifies biologically meaningful regions and pathways implicated in complex human diseases that are not captured by conventional mean-based analyses alone.
