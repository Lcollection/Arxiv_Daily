J. A.; Morcom, A. M.", "abstract": "1.For past experiences to guide our actions we need to retrieve the relevant memories. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how memories are selected for retrieval, and to test how current goals and external retrieval cues drive selection during the retrieval cascade. We analysed data from two studies in which people studied objects in picture or auditory word formats and later recalled them using either written words (Experiment 1, n = 28) or line drawings (Experiment 2, n = 28) as retrieval cues. We used multivariate decoding to quantify the reinstatement of study phase neural patterns when people successfully identified items that had been studied in a format currently designated as targeted, compared with non-targeted items. Neural reinstatement emerged at around 500 ms post-stimulus, like the established left parietal event-related potential (ERP) signature of recollection. Reinstatement was target-selective (greater for targets than non-targets) when test cues overlapped more with targets, a pattern previously shown for the left parietal ERP (Moccia & Morcom, 2021). In contrast, when cues overlapped more with non-targets, neural reinstatement was reversed - greater for non-targets - unlike the left parietal ERP. We also tested for goal-directed mental reinstatement proposed to guide selection prior to retrieval cues. When words were cues there was strong evidence of this proactive reinstatement, but it was not detected when pictures were cues. Together, the data suggest that selection can act at multiple stages of memory retrieval and depends on both external cues and goal-directed control.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Here we show the surprising results that while not expressing G6PC1, primary skin fibroblasts isolated from GSD1a patients skin biopsies preserve a distinctive disease phenotype irrespective of the different culture conditions under which they grow. This discovery was initially made by phenotypic image-based high content analysis (HCA). Deeper analysis into this disease phenotype, revealed impaired lysosomal and mitochondrial functions in GSD1a cells, which were driven by a transcriptional dysregulation of the NAD+/NADH-Sirt-1-TFEB regulatory axis. This dysregulation impacts the normal balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in the patients cells. The distinctive GSD1a fibroblasts phenotype involves elevated H3 histone acetylation, global DNA hypomethylation, differences in the chromatin accessibility and different RNA-seq and metabolomic profiles, all of which suggesting that in some way a distinctive disease cell phenotype is programmed in these cells in vivo and that this phenotype is maintained in vitro. Supporting this notion, reversing H3 acetylation in these cells erased the original cellular phenotype in GSD1a cells. Remarkably, GHF201, an established glycogen reducing molecule, which ameliorated GSD1a pathology in a liver-targeted inducible L.G6pc- knockout mouse model, also reversed impaired cellular functions in GSD1a patients fibroblasts. Altogether, this experimental evidence strongly suggests that GSD1a fibroblasts express a strong and reversible disease phenotype without expressing the causal G6PC1 gene.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Recent studies also suggest loss of somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition. However, establishing the link between reduced interneuron inhibition and reduced MMN experimentally in humans is currently not possible. To overcome these challenges, we simulated spiking activity and EEG during baseline and oddball response in detailed models of human prefrontal microcircuits in health and schizophrenia, with reduced PV and SST interneuron inhibition as constrained by postmortem patient data. We showed that reduced PV interneuron inhibition can account for the decreased MMN amplitude seen in schizophrenia, with a threshold below which the amplitude effect was low as seen in at-risk patients. In contrast, reduced SST interneuron inhibition did not affect the MMN amplitude. We further showed that both types of inhibition loss were necessary to account for changes in resting EEG in schizophrenia, with reduced SST interneuron inhibition increasing theta power, and reduced PV interneuron inhibition leading to a right shift from alpha to beta frequencies. Our study thus links reduced PV and SST interneuron inhibition in schizophrenia to distinct EEG biomarkers that can serve to improve stratification and early detection using non-invasive brain signals.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

We address this question in Drosophila larvae by focusing on segmentally homologous Wave command-like neurons, which diversify their wiring and function in a segment-specific manner. Anterior Wave (a-Wave) neurons extend axons anteriorly and connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, whereas posterior Wave (p-Wave) neurons extend axons posteriorly and trigger forward locomotion. Here, we show that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4, together with the DWnt4 ligand, regulate the segment-specific Wave axon projection. DFz2 knock-down (KD) not only reroutes Wave axons to posterior neuromeres but also biases its motor command to induce forward instead of backward locomotion as tactile response. Thus, segment-specific axon guidance diversifies the function of homologous command neurons in behavioral regulation. Since control of anterior-posterior (A-P) axon guidance by Wnt/Fz-signaling is evolutionarily conserved, our results reveal a potentially universal molecular principle for formation and diversification of the command system in the nerve cord. Furthermore, this work indicates that sensorimotor transduction can be rerouted by manipulating a single gene in a single class of neurons, potentially facilitating the evolutionary flexibility in action selection.\n\nImpact statementRewiring the command neurons in the tactile circuit suffices to change the behavioral strategy of a whole animal, implying a \"plug-and-play\" flexibility in sensorimotor circuits.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

While euchromatin and heterochromatin display preferential compartmental contacts, S domains are remarkably devoid of contacts with other regions, including with other S domains. Polymer simulations show that this contact pattern can only be explained by high loop-extrusion activity within compartment S, combined with low extrusion elsewhere through the genome.

Territorial species like the Scops Owl are expected to exhibit low distinctiveness. Contrary to what was expected, spectrographic analysis of the food-begging calls of young Scops Owls revealed previously unknown, complex acoustic structure.\n\nWithin recording sessions, call duration exhibited the highest repeatability (average R 0.82), followed by the peak frequency in the last third of the call (0.61). Other spectral measures showed low to moderate repeatability (0.32 - 0.57), while the time between subsequent calls was the least repeatable (0.15). When comparing recordings made on different nights, Linear Discriminant Analysis assigned 55.7% of the calls to the correct individual, and 73.1% when restricting analysis within broods. When analyzing variability across recordings, individuals explained most of the variation in Call duration and Peak frequency in the last third of the call (89.5 % and 81.2 %, respectively), while recordings explained little variation (3.4 % and 1.3 %, respectively), suggesting that those acoustic features were the most important in vocal stability and distinctiveness. The calculated information capacity HS was 4.48 bits, i.e. within the range of values found in loosely-colonial species. The results suggest that the vocalizations of young Scops Owls show moderate individuality that could only help offspring recognition among a small number of individuals.\n\nHowever, the functional significance of call distinctiveness remains unclear; a few hypotheses are discussed.

Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung samples, and observed a decrease in YAP target gene expression. In screening SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, we found that nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13), a conserved coronavirus helicase, inhibits YAP transcriptional activity independent of the upstream Hippo kinases LATS1/2. Consistently, introducing NSP13 into cardiomyocytes suppresses an active form of YAP (YAP5SA) in vivo. Subsequent investigations on NSP13 mutants revealed that NSP13 helicase activity, including DNA binding and unwinding, is crucial for suppressing YAP transactivation. Mechanistically, TEAD4 serves as a platform to recruit NSP13 and YAP. NSP13 likely inactivates the YAP/TEAD4 transcription complex by remodeling chromatin to recruit proteins, such as transcription termination factor 2 (TTF2), to bind the YAP/TEAD/NSP13 complex.

To evaluate existing models of neurocognitive ageing such as compensation, maintenance, or reserve, we explore how various known brain-based and cardiorespiratory fitness factors intersect to better understand cognitive decline. In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/6fqg7), we tested 73 healthy older adults aged 60 to 81 (M = 65.51, SD = 4.94) and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and cognitive data to investigate a prominent challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. fMRI signal was recorded while participants responded to a definition-based tip-of-the-tongue task, T1-weighted imaging estimated grey matter volume, and cerebral blood flow was indexed using multi-delay pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling. Commonality analyses were used to analyse these multi-domain data (neuroimaging, cardiorespiratory fitness, language skills, demographic characteristics) and uncover associations between predictors in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates. Commonality analyses revealed that functional activation of language networks associated with tip-of-the-tongue states is in part linked with age and, interestingly, cardiorespiratory fitness: the combination of higher cardiorespiratory fitness and functional recruitment in some older adults offsets part of the age-related variance in tip-of-the-tongues. Moreover, age-associated atrophy and perfusion in regions other than those showing functional differences accounted for variance in tip-of-the-tongues. Our findings can be interpreted in the context of the classic models of neurocognitive ageing, suggesting compensation.

Here, we tracked brain network and behavioral dysfunction in a murine model of CTD at two stages of disease progression. fMRI mapping revealed widespread disruption of brain connectivity in Slc6a8-KO mice, with robust somatomotor hypoconnectivity in juvenile animals, and weaker and more focal alterations of cortical and subcortical connectivity in adulthood. Notably, perinatal AAV-mediated expression of human SLC6A8 in Slc6a8-KO mice robustly prevented juvenile fMRI hypoconnectivity, an effect accompanied by the regression of multiple translationally relevant phenotypes, including reduced stereotyped movements, improved declarative memory and increased body weight, all of which persisted into adulthood. However, early cognitive deficits, impairments in working memory and residual fMRI hypoconnectivity in adult mice were not ameliorated by gene therapy. Furthermore, significant cognitive impairments were observed in WT mice receiving gene therapy, highlighting a potential detrimental effect of ectopic expression of SLC6A8 in healthy brain circuits. Finally, multivariate modeling in adult mice revealed a basal forebrain network whose activity was associated with behavioral performance and modulated by brain creatine levels. This brain-behavior relationship was disrupted in Slc6a8-KO mice.

Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observe daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to night-restricted feeding (NRF) using label-free global O-GlcNAc proteomics. Additional site-specific O-GlcNAc analysis by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry further supports temporal differences in O-GlcNAcylation by revealing day-night differences. Proteins involved in gene expression are enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly regulate the daily rhythmicity of the hepatic transcriptome. We show that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate the hepatic transcriptome by interacting with phosphorylation. Several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that O-GlcNAcylation occurs at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that day-restricted feeding (DRF) in the nocturnal mouse significantly alters O-GlcNAcylation rhythm. Whereas global O-GlcNAcylation analysis indicates dampening of global O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mice fed under DRF, site-specific analysis reveals differential responses of O-GlcNAc sites when timing of food intake is altered. Notably, a substantial number of O-GlcNAcylation sites exhibit inverted day-night profiles when mice are subjected to DRF. This suggests the dysregulation of daily nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm may contribute to the disruption in liver transcriptomic rhythm previously observed in DRF condition.

For example, social behavior requires information about conspecifics and internal physiological states. Like many other mammals, female mice undergo a reproductive cycle during which their physiology and behavioral responses to males change dramatically: during estrus, they are more receptive to male mating attempts. A critical element in reproductive behavior is the investigative stage, which in mice, and many other species, strongly relies on chemosensation. While the initial approach mostly involves the main olfactory system (MOS), once physical contact is established, the vomeronasal system (VNS) is engaged to provide information about potential partners characteristics. Given the estrus-stage dependent behavioral response, we asked whether representations of male features in the first brain relay of the VNS, namely, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), change during the cycle. To this end, we used a stimulus set comprising urine samples from males from different strains and virility levels, and from estrus and non-estrus females. The stimulus set was designed to reveal if response patterns of AOB neurons conform to ethologically relevant dimensions such as sex, strain, and particularly, male virility state. Using extracellular recordings in anesthetized female mice, we find that most ethological categories contained in our data set are not over-represented by AOB neurons, suggesting that early stages of VNS processing encode conspecific information efficiently. Then, comparing neuronal activity in estrus and non-estrus females, we found that overall, response characteristics at the single neuron and population levels remain stable during the reproductive cycle. The few changes that do occur, are not consistent with a systematic modulation of responses to male features. Our findings imply that the AOB presents a stable account of conspecific features to more advanced processing stages.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we answer the question of whether interactions between genetic variants can activate unique pathways and if such pathways can be targeted to modulate phenotypic outcomes. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to dissect how two causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MKT189G and TAO34477C, interact to modulate metabolic and phenotypic outcomes during sporulation. By integrating time-resolved transcriptomics, absolute proteomics, and targeted metabolomics in isogenic allele replacement yeast strains, we show that the combined presence of these SNPs uniquely activates the arginine biosynthesis pathway and suppresses ribosome biogenesis, reflecting a metabolic trade-off that enhances sporulation efficiency. Functional validation demonstrates that the arginine pathway is essential for mitochondrial activity and efficient sporulation only in the double-SNP background. Our findings reveal how genetic variant interactions can rewire core metabolic networks, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding polygenic trait regulation and the emergence of additive effects in complex traits.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "From atomic spins in magnets to galaxies, and from embryonic development to patchy vegetation in arid environments, the physical world is filled with complex systems that spontaneously form spatial patterns. While simple mathematical models, such as reaction-diffusion systems, can explain the formation of such patterns, the complexity of the physical systems these models aim to describe necessitates the analysis of model robustness. Our work utilizes random matrix theory to provide arguably the first definition of robustness that is analytically tractable, providing an easy guide for identifying spatial interactions that robustly generate spatial patterns. We illustrate our theory on examples from mathematical biology, showing that diffusion alone cannot robustly generate spatial Turing patterns in large and unstructured systems, while advection, chemotaxis and non-local interactions can robustly promote pattern formation. Furthermore, we use our theory to prove that the spinodal decompositon of soft condensed matter is dynamically robust and predict the dynamics beyond regimes permitted by the standard Landau-Ginzburg theory. By classifying different spatial interactions based on the robustness of pattern formation, this work provides insights into which mechanisms are fundamental for pattern formation in large and unstructured physical systems.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between biological organization and Open-Ended Evolution (OEE), with a particular focus on the causal connection between the two. To quantitatively investigate the causal relation within a chemical system, we utilize assembly theory to assess the influence of auto-catalytic sets on the complexity dynamics of Kauffman model. In the second part of the paper, we strengthen this conjecture by analyzing the effects of the simplest auto-catalytic set on the complexity dynamics in Kauffman model, specifically in the absence of parametric correlation. By interpreting auto-catalytic sets as organizational structures in chemical systems, our findings provide the first numerical support for investigating the causal relationship between biological organization and OEE.

Mitochondrial genome damage, particularly DNA strand breaks (SBs), is a potential cause for its compromised functionality. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP), a critical DNA end-processing enzyme, is significantly decreased in the nuclear extract of HD patients brain due to lower level of a metabolite, fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a biosynthetic product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), leading to persistent DNA SBs with 3-phosphate termini, refractory to subsequent steps for repair completion. PNKP also plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity. In this report, we provide evidence that both PFKFB3 and F2,6BP, an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are also present in the mitochondria and PFKFB3 is part of a mitochondrial DNA repair complex containing HTT, PNKP, DNA polymerase Gamma and Lig 3. PNKP binds F2,6BP (Kd= 525 nM) and utilizes it as a cofactor. Notably, the levels of both F2,6BP and PFKFB3 are significantly decreased in the mitochondrial extract of HD patients brain. PNKP activity is thus severely decreased in the mitochondrial extract; however, addition of F2,6BP restored PNKP activity. Moreover, supplementation of F2,6BP in HD mouse striatal neuronal cells restored PFKFB3 level, mitochondrial genome integrity and partially restored mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration and prevented pathogenic aggregate formation. We also observed that supplementation with F2,6BP restored mitochondrial genome integrity in HD drosophila model. Our findings, therefore, suggest that F2,6BP-mediated restoration of PNKP activity will have a profound impact in ameliorating neurodegenerative symptoms in HD.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

The tension-induced flattening of the nanodome is associated with Piezo activation and driven by the energy gammaDeltaA where DeltaA is the excess area of the curved nanodome relative to its planar projected area. Based on extensive coarse-grained and atomistic simulations of membrane-embedded Piezo 1 and 2 proteins, we report here an an excess area DeltaA for the Piezo protein-membrane nanodome of about 40 nm2 in tensionless membranes, and a half-maximal reduction of DeltaA at tension values of about 3 to 4 mN/m, which is within the range of experimentally determined values for the half-maximal activation of Piezo 1. In line with recent experimental investigations of Piezo proteins in cell membranes and membrane vesicles, the membrane-embedded Piezo proteins adopt conformations in our simulations that are significantly less curved than the protein conformation in the detergent micelles of cryo-EM structures. An elasticity analysis of the nanodome shapes and protein conformations obtained from our simulations leads to an elastic model for Piezo activation that distinguishes the different energy components of the protein and the membrane in the tension-induced flattening of the nanodome.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Its transmembrane domain (TMD) is usually considered to be a passive physical anchor that attaches the protein to the viral envelope. However, current knowledge of the dynamics and biogenesis of integral membrane proteins indicates that TMDs generally play key functions beyond membrane anchoring. Here, we explored the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD during viral entry. To do so, we generated a series of amino acid substitutions and insertions within the hydrophobic core of the TMD and analyzed their impact on protein function. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly susceptible to changes in its TMD. Furthermore, the TMD sequence and structural parameters relevant for viral entry are distributed across the entire segment, albeit with a stronger implication of the N-terminal portion. The relative orientation of the regions before and after the TMD was also found to be relevant for particle entry. Finally, our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD can form homo-oligomers through a motif in which small residues are necessary.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Relative to CD43 1B11- populations, CD43 1B11+ CD8+ T cells maintained high T-bet expression along with stem-like molecules IL-7R and TCF-1 at both effector and memory timepoints, and were more persistent following adoptive transfer. In kidney transplant patients, graft-infiltrating CD8+ T cells that expressed CD43 and the glycosyltransferase GCNT1 had an effector phenotype that includes high expression of IFNG, ICOS, and perforins/granzymes. In healthy human donors and transplant candidates, the CD43 1D4 mAb clone defined antigen-experienced cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells.

A paradigm shift - language model (LM) -based methods - offer promising avenues for reference-free analysis of metagenomic reads. Here, we introduce two LMs, a pretrained foundation model REMME, aimed at understanding the DNA context of metagenomic reads, and the fine-tuned REBEAN for predicting the enzymatic potential encoded within the read corresponding genes. By emphasizing function recognition over gene identification, REBEAN labels gene-encoded molecular functions of previously explored and new (orphan) sequences. Even though it was not trained to do so, REBEAN identifies the gene's function-relevant parts. It thus expands enzymatic annotation of unassembled metagenomic reads.

However, their transition from a functional liquid-like phase into a solid-like state - usually termed as condensate ageing - represents a hallmark associated with the onset of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we design a computational pipeline to explore potential candidates, in the form of small peptides, to regulate ageing kinetics in biomolecular condensates. By combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of a sequence-dependent residue-resolution force field, we investigate the impact of peptide insertion - with different composition, patterning, and net charge - in the condensate phase diagram and ageing kinetics of archetypal proteins driving condensate ageing: TDP-43 and FUS. We reveal that small peptides composed of a specific balance of aromatic and charged residues can substantially decelerate ageing over an order of magnitude. The mechanism is controlled through condensate density reduction induced by peptide self-repulsive electrostatic interactions that specifically target protein regions prone to form cross-{beta}-sheet fibrils.

In addition, exploration of the role of MHC in other mating strategies, such as divorce, is rare. We investigated whether MHC-IIB dissimilarity is associated with mate choice and divorce probability in the genetically monogamous black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). We found that first-time male breeders, as well as divorced males, were paired with more MHC-IIB dissimilar females than expected under random mating. We did not find evidence for mate choice based on MHC-IIB dissimilarity when considering females. In addition, in the studied population, divorce probability was very low compared to other populations and did not significantly vary with the MHC-IIB dissimilarity of the pair.

The hindbrain herniates through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal leading to frequent hydrocephalus and occasional respiratory emergency. Chiari II is not confined to the back of the brain, but is a global brain syndrome with cerebral cortical and other defects implicated in learning disability, which affects 20-25% of children with open spina bifida. The reason for the association between Chiari II and spina bifida has long been debated. Separate effects on the brain and spinal cord of causative genetic or non-genetic factor(s) are possible. Conversely, Chiari II may be secondary to open spina bifida, and a prominent hypothesis cites chronic leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the open spinal lesion as causative. To resolve the issue of causation, we bred mice in which Pax3 gene function is conditionally deleted by Cdx2cre, specifically in the lower body, leaving the head genetically intact. Open spina bifida is seen in all Cdx2cre/+; Pax3fl/fl fetuses, together with many of the features of Chiari II in the wild-type brain of the mice. These include: hindbrain and cerebellar herniation, cortical thinning, callosal and hippocampal hypogenesis, heterotopic neurons in the cerebral cortex and habenula, and thickening of the ventricular zone. We conclude that the brain defects of Chiari II arise secondary to open spina bifida, with the implication that these may occur early in human gestation through disturbed neurogenesis.

The mechanisms underlying this transition remain unclear, but metabolic adaptations to the bioenergy demands imposed by injury are plausible contributors. Here we show that peripheral injury activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the mouse spinal cord, redirecting local core metabolism toward biomass production while simultaneously suppressing autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation. This metabolic shift supports neuroplasticity, but creates a resource bottleneck that depletes critical spinal cord nutrients. Preventing this depletion with a modified diet normalizes biomass generation and autophagy and halts the transition to chronic pain. This effect, observed across multiple pain models, requires activation of the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 and AMPK, as well as restoration of autophagy. The findings identify metabolic reprogramming and consequent autophagy suppression as key drivers of the progression to pain chronicity and highlight nutritional and pharmacological interventions that could prevent this progression after surgery or other physical traumas.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Results: We introduce FlatProt, a tool designed to complement 3D viewers by enabling standardized 2D visualization of individual protein structures or large sets thereof. By including Foldseek-based family rotation alignment or an inertia-based fallback, FlatProt creates consistent and scalable visual representations for user-defined protein structures.

FlatProt processes proteins efficiently, as showcased on a subset of the human-proteome. Conclusion: FlatProt provides clear, consistent, user-friendly visualizations that support rapid, comparative inspection of protein structures at scale.

They had removed 39.2+-0.5 billion tonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) per year from the atmosphere, more than global emissions from hydrocarbon combustion. The time distribution allowed by this simulation suggests that cultivated plants would have biofixed a cumulative net total of 455 GtCO2 in 2023, or 14% of the mass of atmospheric CO2. Given the importance of this anthropogenic carbon capture and storage by cultivated plants, both in duration and quantity, rural activities should be integrated into carbon budgets and the resulting climate strategies, and recognized as a carbon capture and storage (CCS) device in carbon cycle regulation policies. This recognition would allow for the fair valuation of the work of farmers and foresters as part of the ecological transition, particularly through remuneration mechanisms such as carbon credits.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Through systematic X-ray crystallographic analysis of human syntenin-1's PDZ1-PDZ2 tandem, we resolve nine high-resolution structures that uncover fundamental differences in conformational plasticity between these sequentially similar domains. Pairwise root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) analysis of 20 PDZ1 structures across multiple crystal forms reveals substantial structural variability concentrated in the Lys119-Ile125 and Ala181-Glu184 loops - key regions governing ligand specificity within PDZ1's binding cleft. In stark contrast, PDZ2 maintains remarkable structural conservation across all crystallographic environments, indicating divergent evolutionary constraints on these tandem domains. Crucially, comparative analysis of isotropic B-factors demonstrates their inadequacy in capturing the full scope of conformational heterogeneity, emphasizing the necessity of multi-structure comparisons for mapping dynamic landscapes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations implemented through GROMACS corroborate these crystallographic observations, showing elevated residue-specific fluctuation (RMSF) values in PDZ1's ligand-binding interface compared to analogous PDZ2 regions. This consistency across experimental and computational approaches confirms that PDZ1's conformational diversity represents an inherent biophysical property rather than crystallographic artifact. The observed dynamic asymmetry suggests a functional division of labor: PDZ1's structural plasticity enables broad ligand recognition via conformational selection mechanisms, while PDZ2's rigid architecture likely stabilizes the tandem domain arrangement. These findings provide an atomic-level rationale for syntenin-1's pleiotropic roles in cellular signaling and establish a structural blueprint for developing domain-selective therapeutics. Given syntenin-1's clinical relevance in cancer metastasis, viral pathogenesis, and neurodevelopmental disorders, our work advances strategies for selectively modulating PDZ1-mediated interactions while preserving PDZ2's scaffolding functions through structure-guided inhibitor design.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Different strategies are currently evaluated to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, among which the development of vector molecules that target specific receptors expressed by BBB endothelial cells and involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In this process, therapeutic cargos conjugated to optimized molecular vectors can undergo trans-endothelial transport and delivery in the brain parenchyma. The transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is enriched in brain endothelial cells and is one of the most studied receptors for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Several antibodies and molecules derived thereof that target TfR1 have been developed, but few display trans-species reactivity, hindering preclinical or clinical development. In the present study, we selected and characterized cross-species reactive Variable domain of Heavy chain only antibody from camelids (VHH), and in particular the C5 and B8, that bind rodent, rhesus monkey and human TfR1. When fused to a human Immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) Fc region, the C5 or B8 monomers or homodimers were up taken by engineered CHO cells expressing the rodent, human and rhesus monkey TfR1, and by rodent or human brain endothelial cells. Key human TfR1 amino-acid residues of the C5 and B8 epitopes were identified based on the generation of human TfR1 mutants. Assessment of their functional binding revealed an original binding region at the interface of the TfR1 dimer. Following systemic injection in mice of VHH-Fc fusions displaying different properties in terms of affinity and avidity toward TfR1, we demonstrated improved brain uptake compared to control molecules encompassing an irrelevant VHH. Brain delivery efficiency of the parental and optimized VHHTfR1 was further demonstrated using Neurotensin (NT)-induced hypothermia as a read-out in wild-type mice and in B-hTfR transgenic mice expressing the human TfR1 ectodomain. We established in vitro-in vivo correlations between the human TfR1 binding properties determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of VHH-NT affinity variants, and their potential to induce hypothermia in B-hTfR mice. We identified key human TfR1 binding parameters leading to efficient BBB transcytosis i.e: a rapid dissociation rate and intermediate affinity. Some of the C5 and B8 variants we engineered presented promising cross-species reactivity towards the murine but also rhesus monkey TfR1. We also generated variants with very similar human-rhesus monkey TfR1 binding properties and optimal affinities for TfR1-dependant transcytosis. These VHH could be further developed as molecular shuttles for the transport of imaging or therapeutic agents, including biomolecules, across the rodent, non-human primate and human BBB, allowing straightforward preclinical to clinical translation.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

To address this, we isolated, identified and characterised the bioactivity of the serine proteases within the venom of the Nigerian puff adder which we had previously shown to be especially rich in this class of toxin. Two distinct groups were identified, each with different protein substrate specificities. Both had similar molecular weights of 52-62 kDa, with 4-6 N-glycans, but one group consisted of trypsin-like acidic SVSPs and the other were chymotrypsin-like basic SVSPs. Each acted differently on fibrinogen: the acidic SVSPs showed thrombin-like alpha/beta-fibrinogenase activity, whereas the basic forms were shown to be alpha-fibrinogenases. The acidic SVSPs possess gelatinase activity - a novel activity for SVSPs and the first example of an SVSP acting on proteins other than those of the haemostatic system. Analysis of the transcripts of both sets of SVSPs revealed structural details of the substrate-binding sites that supported the experimental findings. The activity and sequences of the basic SVSPs show that they are very like the alpha-fibrinogenase ML-AF of M. lebetina, which until now was considered to be a unique SVSP. Thus, this basic SVSP and the acidic SVSP with its gelatinase activity can be considered to be atypical viper serine proteases. The gelatinase activity of the acidic SVSPs was found to vary geographically and this, alongside the regional variation in the SVMP activities that we observed previous study, is discussed with reference to the potential implications on pathology of envenoming and the development of therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

However, the consequences of metal exposure are variable among individuals, with susceptibility to metal toxicity representing a complex trait influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. To uncover toxicity response genes, and better understand responses to metal toxicity, we sought to dissect resistance to zinc, a metal required for normal cellular function, which can be toxic at high doses. To facilitate efficient, powerful discovery of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) we employed extreme, or X-QTL mapping, leveraging a multiparental, recombinant Drosophila melanogaster population. Our approach involved bulk selection of zinc-resistant individuals, sequencing several replicate pools of selected and control animals, and identified QTL as genomic positions showing consistent allele frequency shifts between treatments. We successfully identified seven regions segregating for resistance/susceptibility alleles, and implicated several strong candidate genes. Phenotypic characterization of populations derived from selected or control animals revealed that our selection procedure resulted in greater egg-to-adult emergence, and a reduced developmental delay on zinc media. We subsequently measured emergence and development time for a series of midgut-specific RNAi gene knockdowns and matched genetic controls raised in both zinc-supplemented and normal media. This identified ten genes with significant genotype-by-treatment effects, including pHCl-2, which encodes a zinc sensor protein. Our work highlights recognized and novel contributors to zinc toxicity resistance in flies, and provides a pathway to a broader understanding of the biological impact of metal toxicity.\n\nARTICLE SUMMARYStarting with an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population we repeatedly selected for groups of individuals showing high resistance to toxic levels of zinc during development.

Despite growing concern, the mechanisms underlying these wounds remain unclear. To investigate how xylazine and fentanyl affect wound healing, we administered subcutaneous injections of saline, xylazine (3.2 mg/kg), fentanyl (1.0 mg/kg), or their combination to female C57BL/6J mice for 28 days. After a standardized punch biopsy, wound closure was tracked for 14 days, with continued drug exposure. Mice receiving the xylazine-fentanyl combination exhibited significantly delayed wound healing compared to all other groups, as shown by slower closure rates and increased area under the healing curve. A follow-up study without chronic pretreatment showed that acute xylazine-fentanyl exposure still altered healing dynamics, although it did not significantly delay time to closure. Neither drug alone impaired healing at the tested doses. These findings suggest that prior exposure to xylazine and fentanyl contributes to impaired wound healing and support the hypothesis that xylazine-associated wounds may arise from delayed healing of pre-existing skin injuries rather than spontaneous formation. This is the first preclinical model of xylazine-related wound impairment and provides a foundation for future research into biological mechanisms and potential interventions for these emerging soft tissue injuries.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

The discovery, first in flies and later in nematodes and zebrafish, of the \"Smurf phenotype\" is a central tool for picking this complex \"lock of biology\", that one of ageing. Using the Smurfs, we have shown an evolutionarily conserved end-of-life transition across Drosophilids, nematodes and zebrafish. This tool has been key to identify the discontinuous nature of ageing and predict impending death from natural causes as well as from environmental stresses. This phenotype allowed us to discover that ageing is made up of two successive phases : a first phase where individuals are healthy and have no risk of mortality, but show an age-dependent and increasing risk of entering a second phase, characterized by the so-called hallmarks of ageing and a high risk of death. Here, we test whether these two consecutive phases of ageing separated by the Smurf transition are a conserved feature of ageing in the mammals using Mus musculus as a model. We performed a longitudinal longevity study using both males and females from two different mouse genetic backgrounds and by integrating physiological, metabolic and molecular measurements with the life history of approximately 150 mice. We show the existence of a phenotypic signature typical of the last phase of life, observable at any chronological age. Validating the two-phase ageing model in a mammalian organism allows better characterized the high risk of imminent death and would extend its implications to a broader range of species for ageing research.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

To address these, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses based on three high-quality chromosome-level assemblies, including two newly generated ones. We find that insular species experienced a reduction in genome size, affecting all genomic elements, including intronic and intergenic regions, with transposable element (TE) loss accounting for most of this contraction. Additionally, autosomes experienced a disproportionate reduction compared to the X chromosome. Paradoxically, island species exhibit higher levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination, lower TE activity in recent times, and evidence of intensified natural selection, collectively pointing to larger long-term effective population sizes in species from the Canary Islands.

Thereto, we conducted time-course whole-genome bisulfite sequencing following Setdb1 knockout (KO) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In serum-cultured ESCs, nearly half of SetDB1 binding sites are DNA methylated, coinciding with H3K9me3, mainly silencing retrotransposons and imprinting control regions.

SetDB1-mediated regulation via H3K27me3, CTCF, SMAD3, and histone acetylation are uncoupled from the DNAme-H3K9me3 axis. Hypomethylated naive ESCs show massive reactivation of retrotransposons upon Setdb1 KO, providing functional evidence that DNAme adds a protective layer against such activity.

During the prodromal phase, leukocytes accumulate within the retina and vitreous. Using the adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune uveitis, we can analyse the disease course by tracking the transferred cells during disease initiation being recruited to the ocular environment throughout peak of disease to secondary regulation. During initiation (the prodrome) of disease pathogenic transferred CD4 T cells can be detected within the retina as well as an endogenous CD4 infiltrate and as disease reaches peak, both transferred and endogenous CD4 T cells can be found in large numbers in the retina. Active clinical disease resolves by day 21 but transferred CD4 T cells persist within the retina when disease is in a clinically quiescent state. Concurrent transfer of RBP3 specific and OVA specific activated cells induces a similar clinical disease phenotype and time course. Both RBP3 and OVA specific cells are recruited during active clinical disease in equal measure showing that autoantigen specific CD4 T cells induce susceptibility for recruitment of other activated CD4 T cells. When analysing the endogenous and transferred CD4 T cells by RNA sequencing, differences between the two sets of gene signatures highlight genes found in pathogenic T cells in other models, including upregulation of markers associated with cytokine interactions and NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. Due to the persistence of the original transferred population throughout clinical disease, in depth analysis of this population could suggest pathways contributing to ocular autoimmunity.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, CaFire, which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca2+ signals. Using CaFire, we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca2+ changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca2+ dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

At the presynaptic release site, an interplay between distinct (M)Unc13 protein isoforms is suggested to orchestrate depressing and facilitating components of STP. In this study, we introduce a modification of the well-established Tsodyks-Markram Model (TMM) for STP. We constrain our model by in vivo intracellular recordings in the olfactory system of the fruit fly, where previous work suggested Unc13A to provide a phasic, depressing and Unc13B a tonic, facilitating release component. A combination of a facilitating and a depressing model component indeed allowed for accurate model fits. Differential knock-down experiments of the Unc13A and Unc13B gene variants provide biological model interpretation, linking the protein-specific molecular mechanisms to synaptic function and STP.

To improve the speed of volumetric imaging in Drosophila, we leverage the recently introduced light beads microscopy (LBM) method. We built a microscope and a LBM module tailored to fly brain experiments and used it to record brain-wide calcium signals in adult behaving flies at 28 volumes per second and at 60 volumes per second when selecting the central brain alone. We uncover fast-timescale auditory responses that are missed with standard volumetric imaging. We also demonstrate how temporal super-resolution can be combined with LBM data to uncover responses to single Drosophila courtship song pulses.

We show here that a genetic driver of early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE), SLC13A5, a Na+/citrate cotransporter (NaCT), is critical for gating the activation of local presynaptic glycolysis. We show that SLC13A5 is in part localized to a presynaptic pool of membrane-bound organelles and acts to transiently clear axonal citrate during electrical activity, in turn activating phosphofructokinase 1.

Notably, epitopes derived from these tumor-resident microbial species can mimic tumor neoantigens through cross-reactive mechanisms, a phenomenon termed molecular mimicry. Unlike neoantigens, which are highly patient-specific, microbial antigens exhibit lower personalization, as shared microbial species are frequently enriched across various patients and cancer types. This conservation enables the identification of recurrent microbial antigen mimics that are common to multiple cancers, thereby providing potential targets for broad-spectrum immunotherapies. Despite the growing recognition of microbial antigens in cancer immunity, the field currently lacks dedicated computational tools for systematically characterizing tumor-associated microbial antigens and their potential mimicry candidates. To address this gap, we present MimicNeoAI, a computational pipeline that integrates sequencing data to concurrently identify microbial antigens and tumor neoantigens. Additionally, it predicts the immunogenic potential of peptide- Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complexes using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network model, which is trained on immunogenic epitope datasets from both hosts and microbes. Furthermore, this pipeline assesses microbial mimicry antigens and tumor neoantigen pairs through sequence similarity, allowing for the identification of candidates that may elicit cross-reactive immune responses and enhance immunotherapy. In cross-validation, MimicNeoAI achieved an average AUC of 0.90, successfully predicting 91% of microbial antigen-positive data. When applied to colorectal cancer (CRC), it identified five high-confidence microbial mimicry antigens associated with increased T cell clonal expansion, as evidenced by single-cell T Cell Receptor (TCR) sequencing, highlighting their biological relevance and potential as targets for immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

These challenges are well illustrated in the context of polygenic prediction for diverse ancestry groups, though the underlying mechanisms are broadly applicable to machine learning with population-stratified data. Using synthetic genotype-phenotype datasets representing five continental populations, we evaluate three approaches for utilizing population-stratified data, mixture learning, independent learning, and transfer learning, to systematically investigate how data representation bias and distribution shifts influence polygenic across ancestry groups. Our results show that conditional distribution shifts, in combination with data representation bias, significantly influence machine learning model performance disparities across diverse populations and the effectiveness of transfer learning as a disparity mitigation strategy, while marginal distribution shifts have a limited effect.

Traditionally, this  structure-function relation has been inferred when assessing a muscles architecture at rest, often using muscle images or geometrical measurements obtained from anatomical dissections or medical imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, a more contemporary view recognises that muscles display a remarkable capacity to dynamically change shape-and therefore architecture-during contraction, quite literally allowing them to change gears as contractile conditions change. Muscle gearing refers to the velocity and force advantages obtained through the effects of fibre rotation and shape changes on muscle and fibre velocities, which significantly influence the length and velocity operations of both the fibres and whole muscle during contraction. This phenomenon can be characterised by the ratio of the velocities or displacement of the muscle to the fascicle. Given its function importance, muscle gearing should be considered an integral part of a comprehensive framework for understanding dynamic muscle function, as both fibre length and architecture, along with muscle shape changes, respond to varying mechanical demands and influence functionality in both normal and pathological conditions. The present review aims to (i) present a historical overview of our understanding of the muscle structure-function relation from measurements obtained in resting muscle as well as during dynamic, active contractions and (ii) define  muscle gear, explain how muscle gear impacts muscle function under various movement conditions, describe intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine or influence gearing, and overview the literature reporting gearing in animal and human studies while raising hypotheses in an attempt to explain the gearing differences identified across the literature. Given the current challenges in experimentally quantifying the unique influence of each identified factor, we employ a computational modelling approach using a previously validated three-dimensional finite element muscle model to gain a better understanding of the mechanical phenomena underlying muscle gearing. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential role of gearing in the observed changes in muscle function with ageing, injury, and exercise training. Overall, muscle gearing is a distinctive feature of skeletal muscles, with the modelling demonstrating that it is an emergent property of the physics of muscle contraction. A greater understanding of this phenomenon may provide significant insight into human muscle function and movement performance that cannot be predicted from examination of the architectural features of resting (non-contracting) muscles.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

We evaluated whether enzymology defined precursor product correlations are consistently detectable in human plasma LCMS data and explored their potential to enhance pathway analysis and metabolite identification. Using a high resolution LCMS platform, we detected amino acids and carnitine related metabolites in one individual sampled eight times over five years and in 50 adults sampled 6 to 8 times each. Spearman correlations were calculated for longitudinal and cross sectional data. In the single participant repeated measures, strong positive correlations were observed for every direct precursor product pair except the branch point metabolite palmitoylcarnitine. The longitudinal analysis reproduced these patterns, and the same relationships were retained when analysis was cross sectional. Despite contributions from multiple organ systems, plasma thus preserved core enzymatic relationships. Precursor product proportionality, a fundamental principle of enzymology, is readily detectable in large scale LCMS datasets and remains robust across longitudinal and cross sectional designs. Applying these correlations to metabolomics workflows can improve pathway analysis, help metabolite identification, and reveal how genetic variations, diets, therapeutic drugs, and environmental exposures jointly impact metabolic pathways.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Compared to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), tb-fMRI provides greater specificity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for examining task-relevant networks and individual differences in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the BOLD-filter-a method originally developed to extract reliable BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) components from rs-fMRI-by applying it to tb-fMRI data as a preprocessing step for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The goal was to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of detecting task-induced functional activity. Compared to the conventional preprocessing method, the BOLD-filter substantially improved the isolation of task-evoked BOLD signals. It identified over eleven times more activation voxels at a high statistical threshold and more than twice as many at a lower threshold. Moreover, FC networks derived from BOLD-filtered signals revealed clearer task-related patterns, including gender-specific differences in brain regions linked to everyday behaviors. These patterns were not detectable using standard preprocessing approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the BOLD-filter enhances the robustness and interpretability of FC analysis in tb-fMRI. By effectively isolating meaningful functional networks, this approach offers significant advantages over conventional preprocessing methods.

High levels of the heterochromatin mark H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) at telomeres are critical for ALT, but how that is achieved remains unclear. Telomeric association of orphan nuclear receptors (NRs), such as COUP-TF1, COUP-TF2, TR2, and TR4, has been shown previously to promote ALT activation. Here, we show that orphan NRs regulate telomeric H3K9me3 through TRIM28, a corepressor of ZNF transcription factors, to drive ALT. We report that H3K9me3 is induced by telomeric association of orphan NRs in cultured human fibroblast and ALT cancer cell lines. Moreover, TRIM28 is required for the orphan NR-induced H3K9me3 and ALT phenotypes. Importantly, physical interaction of TRIM28 with orphan NRs facilitates a telomeric localization of TRIM28. A TRIM28 variant defective in orphan NR interaction fails to localize to telomeres and is unable to promote H3K9me3 and ALT phenotypes. These findings indicate that telomeric orphan NRs recruit TRIM28, driving telomeric H3K9me3 and ALT activation, emphasizing the role of changes in chromatin structure in ALT activation.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Many DOC compounds escape microbial degradation and persist for thousands of years in the ocean. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the mechanisms responsible for this long-term stability remain unresolved. Heterotrophic microorganisms in the deep ocean are energetically starved and exhibit low metabolic activity. Here, we investigated whether the severe energy limitation in deep sea environments acts as a barrier to microbial degradation of DOC. We hypothesized that alleviating this energetic barrier through the addition of labile compounds (i.e., the priming effect) could stimulate microbial consumption of DOC. We conducted 62-day bottle incubations with deep seawater from the Southern Ocean that were amended with simple organic carbon, nitrogen- and/or phosphorus-containing compounds. We tracked DOC concentration, cell abundance and microbial community structure over the course of the experiment. Our results show no evidence of a priming effect regardless of the priming compound. However, priming compounds selected for distinct microbial populations with little overlap among amended bottles even when compounds were chemically similar. Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas were enriched across all amended bottles, and their competition for labile substrates likely contributed to observed variations in DOC consumption. Our results reveal that the persistence of DOC is not driven by the energetic state of deep-sea microbes. In contrast, our results suggest that inputs of fresh carbon to the deep ocean are more likely to increase DOC sequestration, via the microbial carbon pump, rather than stimulate DOC consumption.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Thus, planning effective culling responses to diseases in wildlife hosts requires a thorough understanding of the potential impacts of culling on the target wildlife host species. We conducted a BACI design study of behavioral response to culling in wild pigs. We examined movement and contact responses in the populations using GPS-collared wild pigs and three different culling methods (aerial operations, trapping, and an experimental toxic bait). Movement metrics included home range area, net-squared displacement (i.e., home range shift), movement speed, and distance. We estimated contact as the total weekly pairwise number of contacts per day, and median number of unique individuals per day. We evaluated change in movement during and after culling treatments relative to control individuals, and how these changes varied by sex, using generalized linear mixed models. We observed increased movement distances during and after trapping treatments, and home range shifts and reduced area size after the toxicant treatment. We also observed increases in total contacts and number of unique contacts during trapping removals. Movement and contact responses varied by sex.

To address this, we applied a genotype-first approach by developing a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based targeted sequencing method for dogs, analyzing 203 genes--most of which are related to human disease--from 6,333 dogs collected from a veterinary hospital, and characterizing pathogenic variant carriers. In total, 120 pathogenic variants in 83 genes were identified. Frequent pathogenic variants were enriched in specific dog breeds. Dogs homozygous for a pathogenic CHEK2 variant, frequently identified in French Bulldogs (5.74%, homozygous), showed a five-fold increased risk of cancer (P = 3.45 x 10-2). A pathogenic NOD2 variant was detected in half of the Italian Greyhounds. However, their medical records did not document the typical clinical symptoms observed in humans with NOD2 deficiency. Some pathogenic variants were present in three or fewer dogs, and 11.0% of these dogs exhibited symptoms potentially associated with gene defects. These rare variants could become common within a short period due to the canine breeding system to induce breed-specific genetic diseases.

These mutations are primarily introduced by the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral replication. It has been demonstrated that conventional RNA sequencing methodologies frequently result in the masking of low-frequency mutations, a phenomenon that can be attributed to technical inaccuracies. This limitation impedes the acquisition of comprehensive knowledge regarding the early-stage evolution of viruses. A major challenge in mutation analysis is distinguishing true biological variants from sequencing artifacts, especially when assessing rare mutations within viral populations. To address this, we applied a single-UMI (sUMI) sequencing method to influenza virus populations derived from single particles, achieving an error rate of ~10- per base. The findings of this study demonstrate that the efficacy of the sUMI method in facilitating precise detection of low-frequency mutations. These results indicate that the observed mutations are not merely a result of technical noise but rather are indicative of biological variation. Information-theoretic analyses, including Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence, showed non-random mutation distributions and enhanced sequence diversity in viral samples relative to in vitro controls. These findings imply that selective pressures act during replication, influencing mutation retention and propagation. This study proposes a high-precision framework for the quantification of viral genome diversity and the identification of early adaptive mutations. This finding also substantiates the approach's viability in the context of mutation prediction through the utilization of logistic models. Collectively, these results contribute to a deeper understanding of viral evolution and provide a foundation for real-time surveillance of emerging variants, resistance mutations, and vaccine escape potential.

The bacterial trimethylamine monooxygenase mFMO can oxidize TMA into TMAO using molecular oxygen and the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We have established an enzyme cascade which takes advantage of glucose dehydrogenase to recycle NADPH from NADP+, significantly decreasing the cost of the reaction and paving the way for using the enzyme system in fish protein hydrolysates targeted for human consumption. We demonstrate that the dual enzyme system works in an industrially relevant substrate. Salmon protein hydrolysate treated with an mFMO/glucose dehydrogenase cocktail showed a 75% reduction in TMA. A trained sensory panel perceived an improved odor across several parameters, including a reduction in the characteristic TMA smell.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

However, with genome-wide coverage of only 0.1-5x, sWGS data exhibit a pronounced zero-inflation phenomenon, whereby a large fraction of loci contains zero sequencing reads. Zero-inflation causes read counts to fluctuate by several-fold between adjacent windows. As a result, random upward blips in coverage can be misinterpreted as copy-number gains (false positives), and true deletions often become indistinguishable from pervasive zero-coverage noise. In addition, existing CNV detection tools developed for sWGS data often struggle to adapt across different CNV sizes. These combined effects severely constrain the accuracy of CNV inference. To address above challenges, we propose ZIPcnv, a novel CNV detection tool specifically designed for sWGS data. First, we apply a large sliding window to smooth the raw read depth signal, which transforms the original zero-inflated statistical characteristics into approximately normal distribution characteristics. We then design a statistical process model that robustly detects persistent shifts under high background noise using a cumulative sum strategy, classifying genomic regions into candidate and non-candidate CNV regions. Finally, dynamic sliding windows are used for one-pass detection of CNVs of varying lengths, with window size adapting to the CNV region size. We evaluated the performance of ZIPcnv on simulated data and 190 real whole-genome sequencing samples. Experimental results show that ZIPcnv consistently outperforms currently popular CNV detection tools.

Emerging biological foundation models and patient-derived technologies offer a promising solution. Here, we present UniCure, a pre-trained foundation model that predicts transcriptomic responses to drugs across diverse cellular/tissue contexts, enabling personalized cancer therapy or drug prioritization at the individual level. Rather than encoder/decoder used in traditional models, UniCure utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques for optimizing the foundation model, a novel FlexPert module for modeling flexible drug-cell interactions, and a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss for learning unpaired data. Trained on over 1.8 million perturbation RNA-seq profiles (across over 22,000 compounds, 166 cell types, and 24 tissues), UniCure achieves high accuracy in predicting both dose-dependent responses and drug combination effects, demonstrating strong generalization across bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data. In particular, fine-tuning on our patient-derived tumor-like clusters and real-world data (800 profiles) enables UniCure to generate individualized therapeutic predictions on patient's tissue samples. In addition, UniCure enables patient stratification based on the predicted drug response, providing a new way for patient subtyping. UniCure's drug prioritization was validated across over 1000 patients from public pan-cancer cohorts and supported by experimental confirmation of candidate therapeutics. By screening millions of compounds per patient at scale, UniCure provides a biologically grounded tool for advancing precision oncology and accelerating drug discovery.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

However, due to their nanoscale dimensions, OMDs remain challenging to visualize using conventional light microscopy. Here, we used fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B (CTxB) and the palmitoylated peptide Lck-10 (L10) as probes to visualize OMDs and quantified their size via confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Pharmacological inhibition of RhoA significantly reduced OMD sizes in both human cell lines and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. To achieve better spatiotemporal control of specific RhoA activation, we employed an improved light-inducible dimerization (iLID) system. Optogenetic activation of RhoA rapidly increased FRET efficiency between CTxB probes, indicating OMD coalescence. Functionally, RhoA inhibition potentiated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel activity in nociceptive DRG neurons, increasing spontaneous action potential firing. Conversely, in a spared nerve injury rat model, RhoA activation expanded OMDs in nociceptive DRG neurons. Constitutive RhoA activation suppressed HCN channel activity and decreased membrane excitability.

C.; Garcia, M. E.; Stengl, M.", "abstract": "The mating behavior of nocturnal Manduca sexta hawkmoths is under strict temporal control. It is orchestrated via circadian- and ultradian oscillations in sex-pheromone stimuli as social zeitgeber. The extremely sensitive pheromone-detecting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that innervate the long trichoid sensilla on the males antennae are peripheral circadian clocks. They express the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) circadian clockwork, best characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. In hawkmoths, it is still unknown whether or how the ORNs TTFL clockwork regulates the daily rhythms in pheromone-sensitivity and in temporal resolution of ultradian pheromone pulses as prerequisites to the temporal regulation of hawkmoth mating behavior.\n\nWe hypothesize that, rather than the slow TTFL clock, a more rapidly adaptive post- translational feedback loop (PTFL) clockwork, associated with the ORNs plasma membrane, allows for temporal control of pheromone detection via generation of multiscale endogenous membrane potential oscillations. The potential oscillations of the PTFL clock could rapidly synchronize to oscillations of pheromone stimuli at different timescales, thus enable the prediction of stimulus patterns as a mechanism for active sensing. With in vivo long-term tip recordings of long trichoid sensilla of male hawkmoths, we analyzed the spontaneous spiking activity indicative of the ORNs endogenous membrane potential oscillations. Consistent with our hypothesis of a multiscale PTFL clock in hawkmoth ORNs, spontaneous spiking was modulated on ultradian and circadian timescales, with maximum activity at night. When we blocked the evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptor coreceptor (Orco), the circadian modulation was abolished but the ultradian frequency modulation of the spontaneous activity remained. Consistent with PTFL control, Orco was not under the circadian control of the TTFL clock. We could replicate the experimental data in a conductance-based computational model of Orco. In this model, Orco conductivity changed as a function of fluctuating 2nd messenger levels. This study demonstrates that a PTFL is sufficient to impose a circadian pattern on ORN sensitivity.\n\nSignificance statementIt is generally assumed that all circadian rhythms in an organism are driven by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) clock. In this study, we demonstrate with in vivo recordings of hawkmoth pheromone-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that the olfactory receptor coreceptor (Orco) is the key pacemaker channel for controlling circadian but not ultradian rhythms in spontaneous spiking activity. Since Orco expression is not driven by the TTFL clock, its conductance is rather controlled by a post-translational feedback loop (PTFL) membrane clock. Accordingly, our computational model suggests that periodic changes in the conductivity of an Orco ion channel, which is mediated by cycling levels of cyclic nucleotides, tune ORN sensitivity. This highlights the role of the contribution of posttranslational modifications to the generation of circadian rhythmicity.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Central to this resilience is the egg stage, which must withstand fluctuating moisture and temperature conditions. Environmental transitions, particularly changes in moisture availability, significantly influence egg hatching success in mosquitoes. This study investigates how parental exposure to variable hydration conditions shapes key reproductive traits in Ae. aegypti. Using four environmental regimes, continuous wet, continuous dry, wet-to-dry, and dry-to-wet, we assessed egg output, hatching success, thermotolerance, and egg nutrient composition across three Ae. aegypti populations. Our results show that oviposition timing and egg production are significantly affected by the hydration environment experienced by the parental generation. While the wet, dry, and dry-to-wet groups exhibited a consistent oviposition peak beginning four days post-blood feeding, the wet-to-dry group showed delayed reproductive investment, with peak egg production occurring later. Egg output was highest under continuous wet conditions and significantly reduced in the dry and wet-to-dry treatments across all populations. Interestingly, the wet-to-dry group showed significantly higher egg-thermotolerance than any other group, and this pattern was consistent across all three populations under high-temperature stress conditions (41{degrees}C and 45{degrees}C). Despite these environmental effects on reproduction, egg hatching success, and nutritional composition, there was minimal variation among populations and treatment effects. By integrating physiological and ecological metrics such as hatching rates and thermal stress resilience, we demonstrate how parental environments shape offspring performance, highlighting adaptive responses that enable Ae. aegypti persistence under increasing climate variability.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

In this study, we report the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of hairs from wild chimpanzees and four other primate species in the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda. Bulk analysis revealed that both plant foods and chimpanzees in Kalinzu exhibited lower carbon isotope ratios than expected for the region's rainfall. Additionally, preliminary compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids was conducted, revealing that chimpanzees in Kalinzu have a lower degree of faunivory than the sympatric Cercopithecus primates. Furthermore, ultra-fine sectioning of a hair sample was conducted to investigate dietary variation over daily to weekly timescales. In one adult male chimpanzee, carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios fluctuated by more than 1{per thousand} within approximately 10 days.

This is typically done by fitting various evolutionary models to observed trait changes along a species tree. For instance, under neutral evolution, trait values are modelled as changing randomly along the branches of the tree. In contrast, for a trait under selection, species are typically assumed to track an optimal trait value, which itself may shift along the tree. Here, rather than relying on alternative models to discriminate among evolutionary scenarios, we focus on the underlying species tree, and specifically the units in which its branch lengths are measured. Species trees are usually represented as chronograms, with branch lengths proportional to time. The rationale is that time correlates with trait changes through its connection to the number of generations. However, since the generation time of species can also vary along the phylogenetic tree, we argue that chronograms introduces biases. In contrast, phylograms with branch lengths in units of sequence divergence will account for the effect of changing generation time. In this study, we develop a method to test whether a phylogram provides a better fit than a chronogram for modelling trait evolution. We show using simulations that, for a trait evolving neutrally, the fit of a random evolution model has more support on a phylogram than on a chronogram. However, comparing models and testing different scenarios of selection using a phylogram leads to incorrect predictions. Given these results, we argue that we should use phylograms instead of chronograms when assessing the neutral evolution of a trait. Nevertheless, we support the fact that we should generally continue to use chronograms to model selection acting on a quantitative trait.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Through simulations and experiments, we show that the scaling of mutation-biased adaptation with population size is complex, highly dependent on biological details, and - most critically - on how closely mutation bias aligns with selection. Contrary to the common view, we find that mutation-biased adaptation may not wane in large populations but instead intensify depending on the nature of the bias. Crucially, we demonstrate that distinct mutation biases can produce markedly different collateral sensitivity profiles to multiple antibiotics, even at large population sizes. These findings suggest that mutation-biased adaptation may not only be widespread but also have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences both within and beyond the original selective context.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Genomic data has emerged as a key tool to inform ESU decisions due to the increased resolution of information, yet little is known about how genomic data is being used in practice to inform these decisions. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review and found that genomic data is increasingly being used to inform ESUs globally and across plant and animal taxa. We identified a lack of consistency in the methods used to analyze the genomic data, although with reduced representation sequencing and whole genome sequencing improving the ability to infer evolutionary significance. Adaptive loci, a key advantage of genomic data, need to be interpreted with caution and simply identifying these loci may lead to the inflation of ESUs. Our review further revealed inconsistencies in how ESUs are defined and that conclusions do not always meet the criteria outlined in the definition provided. For instance, the amount of gene flow determined rarely influenced the number of ESUs recommended. Overall, 67% of the studies included in this review suggested an increase in the number of ESUs regardless of vast differences across studies. A unifying definition of what constitutes an ESU and a detailed workflow that can provide reliable support to assess the evolutionary significance of these units is still needed.

Results: Therefore, we apply virtual reality as a method to visualise and derive higher-level anatomical features from low-level descriptors. Following voxel-size calibration, scalable delineations and measurements are performed in virtual reality. The data representation for delineation is volume visualisation: a volume rendering or an isosurface mesh. Two delineation techniques are proposed for the placement and editing of points and segments in virtual reality. For quantification, different measures and metrics can be computed for each delineated region.

We uncover a sharp dynamical distinction between the two classes. Bacteriostatic antibiotics reduce the initial growth rate in a dose-dependent manner, similar to nutrient limitation physiological responses. In contrast, bactericidal antibiotics do not alter initial growth rates - cells continue to grow as fast as untreated cells - until an abrupt slowdown in growth rate. The onset of slowdown occurs earlier with increasing dose, suggesting a damage accumulation mechanism leading to a lethal threshold. Cidals also show a steeper dose-response curve. We propose that bacteria respond to cidal antibiotics with a \"grow-fast-then-crash\" strategy that is adaptive for transient lethal threats, whereas static antibiotics trigger stress adaptation and slower growth.

While P. aeruginosa is a known opportunistic pathogen that employs a diverse array of virulence factors to cause airway infections, its ability to thrive in the sinonasal environment is also likely influenced by its local microbial ecology. For instance, anaerobic bacterial genera, such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella, are also commonly found in CRS and may contribute to P. aeruginosa persistence. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that anaerobes promote P. aeruginosa colonization of the upper airways, specifically through degradation of mucin glycoproteins that decorate the epithelial surface. Using a novel dual oxic-anoxic culture platform termed DOAC, we co-cultured Calu-3 epithelial cells with a CRS-derived anaerobic microbial community. We observed increased expression of inflammatory marker genes and degradation of mucin glycoproteins, along with enhanced P. aeruginosa colonization of the epithelial surface after anaerobe pre-treatment. Furthermore, mucins isolated from anaerobe-treated Calu-3 cells promoted greater P. aeruginosa attachment to microtiter plates in vitro compared to intact mucins.

MGS provides broad functional insights but suffers from high cost, computational burden, and reliance on incomplete reference databases. rRNA amplicon sequencing, while more taxonomically targeted, typically profiles either prokaryotes or eukaryotes separately, depending on the chosen primer sets, and thus lacks simultaneous cross-domain resolution. To address these limitations, we developed PAMA-seq, a droplet-digital multiplex PCR technique.

We validated PAMA-seq on a synthetic microbial community, a stool sample from a patient with colorectal cancer, and a coastal seawater sample. The method provided stable, cross-domain taxonomic profiles at sequencing depths as low as 10E3; reads--one to two orders of magnitude fewer than comparable shotgun metagenomics approaches--while significantly reducing variability between replicates.

Using broth cultures, cell-free supernatants, and co-culture on primary human airway epithelial cells, we identify bidirectional interactions that shape nutrient acquisition, biofilm formation, gene expression, and host responses. While mucin or S. oris supernatants modestly enhanced F. nucleatum growth, both conditions triggered transcriptional remodeling, including induction of the nan opeon for sialic acid catabolism, suggesting reliance on glycan degradation by S. oris.

Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was strongly inhibited by S. oris, indicative of antagonistic interactions. Dual and triple RNA-seq revealed that epithelial responses were predominately shaped by F. nucleatum, with enrichment of inflammatory and cancer-associated pathways; however, co-colonization with S. oris modulated the magnitude and specificity of host gene expression. These findings demonstrate that glycan-mediated cross-feeding and microbial interactions shape the physiology and pathogenic potential of F. nucleatum in mucosal environments. This work underscores the importance of modeling polymicrobial communities under host-relevant conditions to better understand pathobiont behavior at the epithelial interface.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

R.; San Millan, A.; Blazquez, J.; Gullon, S.", "abstract": "DNA surveillance mechanisms play a vital role in maintaining genome stability and minimizing mutation rates. One such mechanism, post-replicative mismatch repair (MMR), corrects replication errors that escape DNA polymerase proofreading activity. In most bacteria and eukaryotes, MMR is orchestrated by MutS and MutL proteins. However, certain archaeal and actinobacterial species, including the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, lack these components. Instead, they rely on the nuclease EndoMS/NucS, a structurally distinct enzyme that governs a non-canonical MMR pathway. Given that M. tuberculosis acquires drug resistance exclusively through chromosomal mutations, understanding mutation rate regulation in this pathogen is critical. Nevertheless, despite its anticipated significance, the role of NucS in drug resistance evolution remains largely unexplored in this organism. This study investigates NucS function in M. tuberculosis and uncovers a unique resistance dynamic distinct from other Actinobacteria. While nucS deletion alters the mutational spectrum, it minimally affects the emergence of rifampicin-, isoniazid-, and ethambutol-resistant mutations, in stark contrast to its role in other Actinobacteria. We demonstrated that this atypical behaviour is not attributable to the presence of a single NucS polymorphism, R144S, in the NucS sequence of the M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv, which differs from the NucS consensus sequence. Constructing and analysing an H37Rv variant possessing the NucS consensus sequence revealed a subtly altered mutational spectrum but unchanged mutation rates. Notably, database analysis of the R144S polymorphism in clinical isolates revealed its prevalence and significant association with ethambutol resistance. These findings challenge the established view that nucS serves as a genome stability guardian that minimizes mutation rates in M. tuberculosis, suggesting additional mismatch repair mechanisms beyond NucS or a highly efficient replication system in this pathogen.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

F.; Hunt-Serracin, A. C.; Biboy, J.; Pybus, C.; Vollmer, W.; Boll, J. M.", "abstract": "The bacterial cell envelope is a critical interface with the environment, particularly in Gram-negative species where the outer membrane and peptidoglycan layers coordinate to maintain structural integrity and resist turgor. Although this coordination is essential for survival, the molecular mechanisms linking outer membrane and peptidoglycan homeostasis remain poorly understood. LD-transpeptidases (LDTs) are enzymes that crosslink peptides in peptidoglycan and incorporate D-amino acids, but their physiological roles are not fully defined. Here, we characterize the activity of the LDT enzyme LdtJ in Acinetobacter baumannii and investigate the consequences of its deletion. Loss of LdtJ disrupts cell morphology, downregulates peptidoglycan precursor genes (e.g., dadA, alr), and activates the stringent response, including elevated ppGpp levels and dksA upregulation. These defects are fully suppressed in a {Delta}ldtJ {Delta}mla double mutant, implicating the outer membrane lipid transport Mla pathway in compensatory regulation. RNA sequencing revealed that transcriptional changes in the {Delta}ldtJ mutant are reversed in the double mutant, highlighting a functional interplay between peptidoglycan remodeling and outer membrane lipid asymmetry. Our findings suggest that LdtJ contributes to envelope integrity not only through peptidoglycan modification but also by influencing broader regulatory and metabolic networks.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and is highly resistant to antibiotics. Its survival relies on the integrity of the cell envelope, composed of the peptidoglycan layer and outer membrane. While LD-transpeptidases (LDTs) are traditionally known for reinforcing peptidoglycan structure through non-canonical crosslinking, our findings reveal that the LdtJ enzyme also plays a critical role in regulating cellular metabolism and stress responses. Deletion of ldtJ results in pronounced growth defects and abnormal cell morphology - phenotypes that are fully suppressed by disrupting the outer membrane lipid asymmetry transport system, Mla. This genetic interaction uncovers a previously unrecognized link between peptidoglycan remodeling and outer membrane lipid homeostasis. These insights deepen our understanding of envelope coordination in Gram-negative bacteria and suggest that targeting interconnected stress response pathways could offer novel strategies to undermine bacterial resilience.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

P. gingivalis growth can be stimulated by 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a menaquinone precursor from various oral bacteria, yet its impact on biofilm formation remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate P. gingivalis growth and metabolic activity over six days in response to DHNA on two titanium grade IV surfaces with different roughness using a hybrid in vitro - in silico approach. P. gingivalis growth was modestly stimulated by DHNA and exhibited an inverse correlation with ammonia concentration in culture medium. Notably, this growth pattern transitioned from an initial linear phase to a later exponential phase, with DHNA-treated biofilms reaching this exponential shift at an earlier stage than untreated controls. Confocal microscopy revealed that DHNA-treated biofilms exhibited surface-dependent growth patterns, with larger biofilm volumes observed on rougher surfaces in later biofilm stages, compared to smoother surfaces. Regardless of surface characteristics, the area occupied by biofilms and the size of the aggregates exhibited a consistent and progressive increase over time and was larger in late DHNA-treated biofilms. The experimental data were used to calibrate a coupled finite element method (FEM)-based model that simulated P. gingivalis biofilm dynamics and nutrient utilization. Summarizing, DHNA moderately stimulated P. gingivalis growth, accelerated its transition to ammonia-independent growth, and promoted an increase in biofilm area and aggregate size. Our coupled approach offers significant potential for advancing in vitro biofilm research. Importance: Results of our hybrid in vitro - in silico experiments advance the research on P. gingivalis physiology and its DHNA-dependent colonization of implant surfaces. Our findings reveal that DHNA accelerates P. gingivalis growth, induces aggregation and promotes colonization of titanium surfaces. For the first time, DHNA-induced P. gingivalis growth acceleration and an earlier shift away from ammonia dependency were observed fluorometrically, highlighting ammonia assimilation as a promising marker of P. gingivalis physiology during early biofilm expansion. Understanding how growth factors together with surface properties influence P. gingivalis colonization offers a basis for future preventive strategies. Our study's stringent characterization of 3D surface texture parameters is expected to improve reproducibility of biofilm-surface interactions experiments. The findings were validated using a continuum-based in silico model, initiating a hybrid approach where computational models complement in vitro research.

L.", "abstract": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a spectrum of disease outcomes in infected humans, ranging from asymptomatic or tolerant to lethal. While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the host response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Determining the impact of the proviral integration site on viral expression has been challenging due to difficulty in measuring integration site and viral expression from the same cell. To investigate the influence of the HIV integration site on HIV expression, we analyzed a combined scRNAseq/scATACseq dataset from 117,610 HIV infected primary CD4 T cells. We used the scATACseq data to recover HIV integration site information from 1530 cells, and correlated this information with viral RNA reads in the scRNAseq data. We observed that, overall, HIV expression did not differ depending on the genomic features of viral integration, such as genic vs non genic, intron vs exon and forward versus reverse orientation. Furthermore, we found that there was no significant difference in HIV expression across 15 distinct chromatin compartments. Additionally, analysis of expression for host genes that were the target of proviral integration revealed strong upregulation of expression of the targeted host gene in [~]5% of the infected cells. This insertional activation occurred almost exclusively when HIV was integrated in the same orientation as the host cell gene and occurred as a result of integration within diverse positions across a gene. These findings suggest that HIV expression is relatively robust to the genomic context of the HIV integration site, and that HIV can strongly upregulate expression of integration site genes during infection.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

In the CF lung, however, P. aeruginosa may access preferred carbon sources (e.g., amino acids and short-chain fatty acids) through metabolic cross-feeding with co-colonizing mucin-degrading microbes. Although host-derived enzymes such as neutrophil elastase can also degrade mucins, the extent to which host-mediated mucin breakdown supports P. aeruginosa growth remains unclear. Thus, here we compared the nutritional impact of microbial versus host mucolytic activity on P. aeruginosa physiology. Analyses of CF sputum revealed patient-specific variability in mucin integrity that is shaped by both host and microbial factors. We demonstrate that mucin degradation by anaerobic bacteria through proteolysis, glycolysis, and fermentation, promotes robust P. aeruginosa growth, unlike mucin processed by neutrophil elastase alone. Targeted metabolomics identified acetate and propionate as key metabolites driving this cross-feeding, while transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses revealed that P. aeruginosa engages in diauxic growth on a broader set of mucin-derived substrates. Unexpectedly, cross-feeding with anaerobes triggered the induction of P. aeruginosa denitrification and fermentation pathways, suggesting redox remodeling despite being cultured under oxygen-replete conditions. Finally, the transcriptional profile of P. aeruginosa grown on anaerobe-conditioned mucins more closely resembled its in vivo gene expression, more so than when grown on intact or neutrophil-degraded mucins. Together, these findings provide new insight into the potential role of interspecies metabolic interactions in shaping pathogen physiology in the inflammatory, polymicrobial, and mucus-rich environment of the CF airways.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based target engagement assay in live intact cells to identify and validate cell-permeable, ATP-competitive inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana (Lmx)CLK1. LmxCLK2, a closely related paralogue with an identical protein kinase domain, is also considered in our analysis. Genetic and pharmacological evidence indicates that simultaneous deletion or inhibition of both LmxCLK1/2 is lethal to the parasite. Using our newly developed assay, we screened a library of human kinase inhibitors and identified WZ8040, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, as a potent LmxCLK1 ligand. WZ8040 demonstrated robust target engagement in both promastigotes and macrophage-internalized amastigotes, with low micromolar EC50 values for parasite killing and minimal toxicity to host macrophages. Biochemical assays confirmed that WZ8040 covalently binds and inhibits LmxCLK1, with mass spectrometry identifying Cys172 as the primary site of modification. Genetic validation using overexpression and knockout lines supports LmxCLK1 as the primary target of WZ8040. However, the retained activity of WZ8040 in mutant lines with the Cys172Ala substitution suggests that covalent binding is not essential for compound efficacy.

However, this activity requires additional DNA linker interactions, using MeCP2 regions beyond its canonical methyl binding domain. We mapped a novel DNA-binding region in MeCP2 required for this function. Furthermore, histone H1 antagonises the MeCP2-nucleosome interaction by competing for linker DNA.

Materials and Methods: Impacted 6 x 6 mm cylindrical BegoStone samples embedded in a hydrogel ureter model were treated using either Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) laser or Thulium Fiber Laser (TFL) via three clinical strategies: \"drill and core\", contact, and non-contact modes. Laser pulses were delivered using three pulse energy/frequency settings: 0.8 J/12 Hz, 1.0 J/10 Hz, and 1.2 J/8 Hz with a 3 s on/3 s off protocol, under continuous irrigation at 40 mL/min. Crater formation, surface crack development, and bubble dynamics were assessed via optical coherence tomography, video, and high-speed photography. To delineate the contributions of different plausible damage mechanisms, bubble collapse was suppressed by leveraging the ureteroscope's proximity effect, and thermal ablation was minimized by treating donut-shaped stones with a central tunnel. The role of bubble expansion in stone fracture was further evaluated by systematically varying tunnel size or pulse energy. Results: Surface cracks and stone fracture were observed exclusively in Ho:YAG laser-treated stones using the \"drill and core\", but not the other two strategies. TFL produced deeper craters yet failed to induce any significant crack formation or propagation under all conditions. Suppression of bubble collapse or thermal ablation had minimal effect on surface crack formation and growth. In contrast, the extent and number of surface cracks correlated strongly with the maximum lateral diameter and expansion rate of the vapor bubbles - two parameters that were significantly greater for Ho:YAG laser than TFL. Importantly, the crack formation also showed an inverse correlation with the size of the initial crater or tunnel in the stone. Conclusion: Intra-crater bubble expansion, rather than thermal ablation or bubble collapse, is the primary mechanism driving the fracture of impacted ureteral stone in LL.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

L.-s.", "abstract": "BackgroundNon-translated transcripts (nt-RNAs) with frame-shifts or premature termination codons resulting from alternative splicing events (ASE), have been recently found at unexpectedly abundant in transcriptomes of cancer tissue. However, their full genomic spectrum has not yet been fully elucidated. This study comprehensively characterised the expression of signature junctions of these nt-RNA (termed \"toxic junctions\" here) of both known and novel nt-RNA across multiple cancer types and investigated their potential as biomarkers.\n\nMethodsRNA-seq data of [~]6,000 samples, including the tumor and normal samples for 13 cancer types were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) together with data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. Due to the difficulty in quantifying the entire transcript isoform of nt-RNA, we pioneered an algorithm to focus exclusively on the expression of junctional reads, which also circumvented the limitation of non-directional RNA- seq of TCGA data. We showed that the majority of nt-RNA is associated with at least one toxic junction. We built a comprehensive catalogue of known nt-RNA toxic junctions from genome databases. And novel toxic junctions were also identified by a new junction-focused algorithm from the higher quality discovery subsets of TCGA data. Splicing in Ratio (SiR) was used to quantify ASE leading to nt-RNA, enabling:\n\nDifferential expression analysis between cancer and normal tissue and across cancer types.\n\nIdentification of different profiles of nt-RNA abundance and various factor which may be the causes of differential nt-RNA abundance and SiR results\n\nIdentification of specific nt-RNA and toxic junctions that were expressed in various cancer (and/or normal tissue) types.\n\nAssessment of nt-RNA and their toxic junction expression as biomarkers or prognosis indicators.\n\nResultsWe profiled the expressed known nt-RNA (toxic) junctions of known transcripts and discovered [~]22,000 novel toxic junctions out of [~]250,000 novel junctions found in the transcriptome data. The expression of nt-RNA was as high as 10% of all transcripts of the corresponding gene in cancer transcriptomes. Interestingly, some signature toxic junctions of nt-RNA are expressed in even higher quantities, e.g. up to 50% or more, which is reminiscent of a heterozygous mutation. We identified distinct patterns between cancer and normal samples, including example of nt-RNA expressing toxic junctions exclusively in normal or tumor samples. Clinically relevant examples included ANXA6 in breast cancer, where the nt-RNA isoform showed significantly higher expression in tumors (p=1.8e-15). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), a significant isoform switch of ESYT2 based on the RNA-seq data was confirmed. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that samples with the higher expression ratio of ESYT2-L are associated with better survival (p=2.0e-06). Unsupervised clustering showed that SiR results of 150 toxic signatures defined 4 subgroups of patients with different prognosis. Through principal component analysis (PCA), PC1 and PC2 can be used as an independent prognosis biomarkers. nt-RNA accounting for these PCs included splicing factors SRSF3 and CLK1, where CLK1 phosphorylates SRSF3 to promote exon 4 inclusion in both genes.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, the expression profiles of all known and novel toxic junctions were explored using pan-cancer RNA-seq data. A dual 10% rule emerged from this study: [~]10% of novel junctions were toxic junctions associated with nt-RNA, and up to 10% of RNA transcripts inside a cell were also nt-RNA. The SiR metric enables accurate quantification of unproductive splicing and identification of cancer biomarkers. Our findings reveal that unproductive splicing represents functionally important post-transcriptional regulation in cancer. These expression profiles allow researchers to study the expression of nt-RNA signature junctions or novel signature junctions in or near the genes they are interested in, which could provide a new direction for their research. The SRSF3-CLK1 regulatory mechanism provides insights into splicing dysregulation. Our comprehensive toxic junction catalogue serves as a valuable resource, suggesting that targeting unproductive splicing pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\n\nData availabilityThe catalogue is available on GitHub and UCSC browser. https://github.com/danhuang0909/nt_database for GitHub overview https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/dandan_0909/hg38_all_new_nr for genome browsing of all novel (unannotated) toxic junctions https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/dandan_0909/hg38_5_26 for toxic junctions in known (annotated) nt-RNA.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

In this study, we focused on 79 conserved putative lipoproteins, shared between Mtb and the closely related M. marinum.

Interestingly, despite having homology to periplasmic substrate binding proteins (SBPs), neither protein is associated with any inner membrane transporter complex. Instead, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LpqZ interacts with AftA and FecB interacts with AftB. Both these interaction partners are essential enzymes involved in arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan synthesis.

K.; Vassover, D.; Singla, H.; Shukrun, H.; Gophna, U.", "abstract": "Cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling systems (CBASS) are widespread prokaryotic antiviral defense mechanisms that function through coordinated cyclase-effector interactions. Upon sensing viral infection, the cyclase produces a signal molecule that activates effector function and causes cell dormancy or death. However, the evolutionary origins and functional independence of CBASS components remain unclear. Type II CBASS systems commonly employ TIR-SAVED domain effector proteins that deplete cellular NAD during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that a TIR-SAVED effector protein can operate as a standalone antiviral defense, causing significant growth inhibition and approximately 50% viral clearance during infection in the complete absence of its cognate cyclase. Remarkably, we show that the TIR-SAVED effector can sense cyclic di-AMP, a conserved second messenger produced by the host diadenylate cyclase DacZ, when the canonical CBASS signal is absent. This antiviral activity was associated with depletion of cellular NAD and required intact conserved functional residues within both the TIR and SAVED domains. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of antiviral signalling that expands the functional repertoire of CBASS. They also provide insights into the modular evolution of complex prokaryotic immune systems, suggesting that what are now CBASS effectors might have evolved as independent defense components before being integrated into multi-protein systems.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduced a novel {gamma}-amino carboxylic acid ({gamma}-ACA) modification to PNAs targeting miR-221-3p, a key miRNA implicated in various pathological processes. The modified PNAs showed significantly improved binding affinity to their targets and more efficient inhibition of miR-221-3p expression compared to unmodified PNAs in A549 cells, leading to effective regulation of downstream gene and protein expression.

However, the pathways controlling tRNA and pre-tRNA degradation in mammals have not yet been defined and the relevance of pre-tRNA surveillance pathways for normal cell physiology remains largely unknown. The RNA Exosome comprises a core of nine non-catalytic subunits (EXOSC1-9) to which the distinct, DIS3 and EXOSC10, 3'- 5' exonucleases associate. Here we find that EXOSC10 deficiency leads to accumulation of unspliced precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and is required for pre-tRNA decay in biochemical assays. Pre-tRNA overexpression causes diminished motor neuronal survival in a mouse ESC differentiation model. Our results identify a pre-tRNA decay pathway that links Exosome deficiency with neuron survival and provides insight into possible pathological mechanisms underlying human neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in Exosome subunits and genes involved in tRNA biogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Over recent decades, considerable research has focused on the individual roles of key biomolecules - such as RNA, lipids, and proteins - in early biogenesis. However, this reductionist view offers only a partial picture; the emergence of life likely involved networks of molecular interactions that collectively shaped early functional assemblies. In this study, we examine the potential of peptides - arguably the most abundant early polymers - to interact with mineral surfaces and lipid vesicles, representing prebiotically plausible interfaces and compartments. Focusing on peptide compositions derived from prebiotically plausible amino acids, we demonstrate that such early peptides could bind mineral surfaces (e.g., fluorapatite) via negatively charged residues. Nevertheless, the recruitment of amino acids from the modern alphabet was likely adaptive for favorable interactions with lipid vesicles and could lead to enhanced functional behavior, such as promoting phosphate release. Our findings suggest that the evolving complexity of the peptide/protein alphabet was a key factor in the evolution of protocells and could enhance early catalytic functions at the interface of geochemistry and biochemistry.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

We show here that the Cdk8/19-CycC kinase uses mutually exclusive targeting and activation factors to facilitate distinct cellular roles. The Med12 protein is known to target Cdk8/19-CycC to the mediator of transcription complex to control the transcription of specific gene sets upon respective stimuli. We describe that a second Cdk8/19-CycC targeting factor exists, the replication origin firing regulator MTBP that targets the kinase to Med12-independent cellular roles. Both Med12 and MTBP constitute allosteric activators of the enzymatic Cdk8/19-CycC kinase activity in vitro. We describe the structural basis of this activation that involves distinct mechanisms how Med12 and MTBP reposition the T-loop of the kinase independently of T-loop phosphorylation - the canonical mechanism of CDK kinase activation. Our results support the following model: the Cdk8/19-CycC dimer alone has low enzymatic activity, which may help avoid off-target phosphorylation. Med12, MTBP and potentially other as yet unidentified accessory factors, target the kinase to distinct molecular environments, at the same time activating kinase activity for efficient substrate phosphorylation. Our work establishes an unusual mechanism of CDK kinase control and change the current paradigm how Cdk8/19-CycC selects its substrates. Substrate selection of the kinase may be relevant for cancer biology and therapy because Cdk8 is a well-established colorectal cancer promoting factor.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

To mimic endogenous degradation conditions and TPD amenability, we established a fusion protein expression system consisting of a lysine-free FKBP12 F36V PROTAC handle (FKBPVK0) and used a HiBiT/akaLuc dual luciferase reporter to accurately measure degradation dynamics. This set-up identified a VHL-dependent NUDT5 PROTAC, DDD2, that induced robust NUDT5 degradation, despite impaired NUDT5 binding in vitro and in cellulo, but no CRBN-dependent degraders. NUDT5 lysine availability mapping with DDD2 and FKBP12 F36V-directed PROTACs suggested that the CRL4CRBN complex is more sensitive to target lysine accessibility than CRL2VHL, which may have implications for E3 ligase choice and therapeutic resistance. CeTEAM drug biosensors were also established towards CRBN and VHL to quantitatively monitor degrader engagement in living cells and confirmed that the tested CRBN-directed NUDT5 PROTACs poorly engaged the E3.

While TCF4 is known to function through sequence-specific DNA binding, the influence of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) on its molecular behavior remains scattered. The TCF4 deletion mutant, lacking a fragment of the bHLH domain, forms puncta in the nucleus, which are reminiscent of patterns observed in disease-associated TCF4 mutants. Our in vitro analyses have demonstrated that the shortest human isoform of TCF4 (TCF4-I-), which is predominant in the brain and contains extensive IDRs, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. LLPS is promoted by increased ionic strength and molecular crowding, resulting in dynamic, liquid-like condensates that coalesce and display rapid fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Over time, these condensates mature, exhibiting increased viscosity while retaining molecular mobility. Importantly, we show that both specific and non-specific DNA sequences dissolve TCF4 condensates. This suggests that DNA binding competitively inhibits the multivalent interactions necessary for phase separation. These findings indicate that LLPS driven by TCF4 is a reversible process, likely involved in transcriptional activation bursts. We propose that mutations that disrupt DNA binding or localization may trap TCF4 in aberrant condensates, contributing to PTHS pathogenesis through dysregulated phase behavior. Our findings offer a mechanistic link between TCF4 structural features, phase separation, and its transcriptional function, providing novel insight into how mutations in this TF may drive neurological disease through aberrant biomolecular condensation.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

This cascade involves a series of enzymatic steps, including activation by the E1 enzyme Uba7, conjugation by the E2 enzyme UbcH8, and ligation by an E3 ligase. Central to this process is the ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) of Uba7, which facilitates the transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8. However, the structural and mechanistic details of this interaction remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the solution NMR structure and functional analysis of the ubiquitin-fold domain of human Uba7, the E1 enzyme in the ISGylation cascade. Through detailed NMR titration experiments and mutational studies, we mapped the interaction surface of Uba7-UFD with UbcH8, identifying key residues and their contributions to the E1-E2 interaction. Our results reveal that Uba7-UFD exhibits flexibility in its free form, adopting a more ordered conformation upon binding UbcH8. Chemical shift perturbation and mutational analysis further demonstrate the importance of specific residues, particularly Cys996, in maintaining UFDs structural integrity and binding capacity. Additionally, mutations designed to alter the flexibility and length of the loop region between UFD and UbcH8 show significant effects on binding, indicating that these regions are crucial for efficient E2 recruitment.

Oxidoreductase enzymes are especially useful for carrying out key electron transfer (redox) steps towards a wide range of chemical transformations (e.g., asymmetric hydrogenation, oxygenation, hydroxylation, epoxidation, or Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) that might not otherwise be available to chemists through conventional (nonbiological) synthetic approaches. The ability to screen oxidoreductase activity is important in identifying useful biocatalysts from nature, and also towards engineering novel ones through directed evolution. Many valuable redox enzymes are dependent upon NAD(P)H as an electron donating co-substrate (or conversely, upon NAD(P)+ as an electron acceptor), and the common method to detect their activity is to monitor the change in absorbance at 340 nm as NAD(P)H is converted to NAD(P)+ (or vice versa). The limited sensitivity of this method presents a challenge in detecting very low levels of oxidoreductase activity, and this can prove very difficult to begin engineering enzymes as improved biocatalysts when the rates of natural enzymes may be slow for a desired redox reaction. Herein, we report a fluorescence-based, enzyme cascade-coupled system that we have developed to detect oxidoreductase activity with orders of magnitude more sensitivity than conventional absorbance-based assays. While recycling NAD(P)H from NAD(P)+, the coupled enzyme cascade triggers cleavage of a fluorogenically labeled probe, releasing a strong fluorescent signal. This allows detection of very low levels of a specific oxidoreductase activity that we may wish to magnify by directed evolution using our assay in high-throughput screening.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

I.; Fakler, M.; Fried, S. D.", "abstract": "Many proteins require molecular chaperones to fold into their functional native forms. Previously we used limited proteolysis mass-spectrometry (LiP-MS) to find that ca. 40% of the E. coli proteome do not efficiently refold spontaneously following dilution from denaturation, a frequency that drops to ca. 15% once molecular chaperones like DnaK or GroEL are provided. However, the roles of chaperones during primary biogenesis in vivo can differ from the functions they play during in vitro refolding experiments. Here, we used LiP-MS to probe structural changes incurred by the E. coli proteome when two key chaperones, trigger factor and DnaKJ, are deleted. While knocking out DnaKJ induces pervasive structural perturbations across the soluble E. coli proteome, trigger factor deletion only impacts a small number of proteins structures. Overall, proteins which cannot spontaneously refold (or require chaperones to refold in vitro) are not more likely to be dependent on chaperones to fold in vivo. For instance, the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), cannot refold to its native form in vitro following denaturation (even with chaperones), but by LiP-MS we find that its structure is unperturbed upon DnaKJ or Tig deletion, which is further supported with biochemical and biophysical assays. Thus, PGK folds to its native structure most efficiently during co-translational folding and does so without chaperone assistance. This behaviour is generally found among chaperone-nonrefolders (proteins that cannot refold even with chaperone assistance), strengthening the view that chaperone-nonrefolders are obligate co-translational folders. Hence, for some E. coli proteins, the vectorial nature of co-translational folding is the most important \"chaperone.\"\n\nHighlights- LiP-MS is used to identify which proteins in E. coli are structurally perturbed when DnaKJ or trigger factor is deleted\n- Very few proteins require trigger factor to assume their native structures\n- The proteomes dependence on DnaKJ is increased at lower growth temperature\n- The enzyme PGK does not need chaperones to fold, but it cannot refold from denaturant, even with chaperone assistance\n- For some E. coli proteins (such as PGK) co-translational folding during primary biogenesis is the most important \"chaperone\"", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Vermelha and Grande are natural, remote, and minimally impacted by human activity, whereas Furnas is an artificial pond with greater human accessibility and long-term anthropogenic influence. Using a long-read nanopore shotgun metagenomics approach, we sequenced DNA extracted from pond water, assembled metagenomes, and performed taxonomic classification and functional annotation. From these datasets, 21 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered. Our results reveal pond-specific microbial community compositions and functional profiles. Although a direct temporal comparison would require synchronized sampling, the current data offer compelling snapshots of microbial diversity. Vermelha was characterized by high cyanobacterial diversity and exclusive Planctomycetes, while Furnas displayed broader taxonomic diversity, and more notable Actinobacteria and Patescibacteria. Viral communities, including dsDNA bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, also varied across sites, with Prasinovirus consistently detected in all ponds. Functional annotation identified putative antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), most of them in Furnas, potentially reflecting human impact. Besides ARGs, cyanotoxin biosynthesis genes-especially those linked to microcystin production- were predominantly found in Vermelha.

Our study investigated the molecular changes in the protein and lipid compositions of plastoglobules and thylakoids at six time points over the course of an imposed heat stress and recovery treatment in B73 inbred maize. Results indicate a progressive increase in plastoglobule size and number, and proliferation of adjacent cytosolic lipid droplets, correlating with the duration of heat exposure. Significant alterations in lipid composition, particularly in levels of triacylglycerol, plastoquinone derivatives (PQ-C, B & E) and the fatty acid phytol ester, 12:0-phytol, suggest a protective role in membrane remodeling and oxidative defense.

Next, we performed a transposon screen in M. smegmatis to uncover these putative regulatory nodes.

Realizing that the only genes we hit in purine or pyrimidine biosynthesis were those that utilized glutamine as a nitrogen donor, we pivoted to the hypothesis that intracellular glutamine could be a nitrogen-responsive node affecting aggregation. We tested this hypothesis in defined M63 medium using targeted mass spectrometry. Indeed, intracellular glutamine increased with nitrogen availability and correlated with planktonic growth. Furthermore, a garA mutant, which has an artificially expanded glutamine pool in growth phase, grew solely as planktonic cells even without nitrogen supplementation.

Previous studies based on bioacoustics and telemetry data suggest the presence of resident and migratory subgroups, but the genetic isolation of this population remains uncertain. Here, we sequenced and analysed for the first time whole genomes of the Mediterranean fin whale to provide a comprehensive genomic characterization of this population, assessing its genomic variability, genetic load, population structure and potential for adaptation to environmental stressors. By comparing genomic data from Mediterranean fin whales with populations from the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and the Sea of Cortez (also sequenced in the present study), we aim to determine the degree of genetic isolation and contextualize the Mediterranean population within a broader evolutionary and conservation framework. Our results showed that while Mediterranean fin whales form a distinct genetic cluster, they are not entirely isolated from North Atlantic populations, with gene flow persisting at low levels. Furthermore, we identified a complex substructure within the Mediterranean, supporting the existence of a resident subpopulation. Although this population preserves moderate levels of genomic diversity and adaptive potential, it remains vulnerable to genomic erosion due to continued demographic decline, limited connectivity, and increasing environmental stressors.

This article presents an analytical model of the selective cutting mechanism inspired by sawfly ovipositors. Substrate cutting is shown to depend on an ultimate stress threshold determined by the interaction between blade geometry and substrate properties. The model captures the transition between cutting and ejection as a competition between a failure and an ejection criterion. Morphological modifiers, including serrulae and banding patterns, are shown to influence the ultimate stress threshold and are strongly dependent on both substrate hardness and elastic modulus.

M.", "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly hinders the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and brain tumors with intact BBB by restricting the entry of most therapeutic agents, including small-molecule drugs and particularly larger macromolecules. Liposomal formulations, such as PEGylated liposomes with long blood half-lives, high drug-carrying capacity, and reduced off-site toxicity, can be useful for brain drug delivery, but their large size often limits BBB penetration. A novel liposomal doxorubicin formulation, Talidox (Innomedica), with a smaller size (~36 nm), increased blood circulation half-life, and better stability than previous clinical formulations, can be a suitable choice for brain delivery. This study investigated Talidox delivery to the brain through focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated BBB transient opening. Radiolabelling of Talidox via intraliposomal 89Zr enabled Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for whole-body non-invasive, real-time monitoring of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Following FUS-mediated BBB opening in mice, PET imaging revealed a significant increase in brain uptake compared to non-FUS controls, achieving a 14-fold higher accumulation. Additional validation using passive acoustic detection, microscopy, autoradiography, and cryo-fluorescence tomography demonstrated successful brain distribution that correlated with PET imaging results. These findings underscore the potential of combining Talidox with FUS for effective, non-invasive drug delivery to the brain and highlight the advantages of PET imaging as a modality for non-invasive, longitudinal quantification of drug delivery to the brain.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

While Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers valuable insights into gene expression patterns within their native tissue context, its widespread adoption is hindered by high costs and limited gene detection capabilities. Here we introduce CarHE (Contrastive Alignment of gene expRession for hematoxylin and eosin image), a method that overcomes these limitations by accurately predicting high-dimensional ST data (over 10,000 genes) solely from readily available H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) stained images. This novel pre-trained architecture employs contrastive learning through two mechanisms: cell-type-based transcriptomics information transfer and image-based histology information transfer. These mechanisms precisely align image features with spatial single-cell gene expressions, achieving prediction accuracies exceeding 0.7 (up to 1.7 folds compared to second best) across diverse tissue types and species. CarHE's superior performance extends to identifying subtle pathological features such as tertiary lymphoid structures in various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), and reconstructing 3D spatial transcriptomics from images alone, offering a cost-effective and robust alternative for large-scale spatial transcriptomics. We further validated CarHE's effectiveness by predicting DFS (Disease-Free Survival) from >1,600 lung cancer patients HE images, achieving a significantly higher AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.73 compared to state-of-the-art alternatives (0.58-0.64).", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Its speed is due to (a) a carefully engineered architecture involving only cache-coherent MSD radix sorts and merges, (b) a novel algorithm for finding adaptive seed hits in a linear merge of sorted k-mer tables, and (c) a variant of the Myers adaptive wave algorithm to find alignments around a chain of seed hits that detects alignments with up to 25-30% variation. It further does not require pre-masking of repetitive sequence, and stores millions of alignments in a fraction of the space of a conventional CIGAR-string using a trace-point encoding that is further compressed by the ONEcode data system introduced here. As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome.

M.; Moscovitz, O.", "abstract": "Background Sialyl Lewis A (sLeA), or the CA 19-9 marker, is a tetrasaccharide and a tumour-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) overexpressed and abnormally secreted as a serum-borne marker in gastrointestinal malignancies. CA 19-9 is the best validated and only FDA-approved serologic marker clinically used to monitor recurrence, progression, and therapy efficiency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Due to its altered expression on cancer cells, sLeA is also an attractive target for antibody development. Although recent clinical trials have demonstrated insufficient efficacy of the fully human anti-sLeA 5B1 (MVT-5873) format as a stand-alone drug or an adjuvant therapy in PDAC [1], its safety profile and unique expression in additional malignancies keep CA 19-9 an attractive TACA. Hence, we set out to explore the use of synthetic sLeA to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with improved sLeA recognition and better efficacy. Methods Two mAbs targeting sLeA were generated through mice immunisation with synthetic sLeA glycoconjugates, synthetic glycan arrays, and hybridoma technology. We then compared the antigen-binding properties of the newly developed mAbs with the widely used mAb 1116-NS-19-9 via synthetic glycan arrays, immunohistochemistry (IHC), X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and Saturation Transfer Difference Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (STD NMR) spectroscopy. Results The newly generated mAbs demonstrated improved affinity and specificity for both synthetic and native sLeA, surpassing the performance of the established mAb 1116-NS-19-9. First, synthetic glycan arrays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays confirmed superior antigen-binding properties to synthetic sLeA. In particular, the mAb designated GB11 demonstrated markedly enhanced binding to native sLeA ectopically expressed in B16 melanoma cells. To elucidate the structural origin of GB11`s improved antigen binding, we conducted high-resolution mapping of the molecular recognition patterns between sLeA and the different antibodies using X-ray crystallography and STD NMR. These analyses revealed subtle yet critical differences in the glycan engagement and identified key structural features underlying GB11`s enhanced recognition of sLeA. MD simulations further supported these observations, indicating distinct orientations of sLeA within the binding pockets of each mAb. Conclusion Our results suggest better recognition of the sLeA antigen by the newly generated GB11 antibody and provide a detailed high-resolution elucidation of the molecular interactions behind it. Our study may provide a novel tool with improved theranostic properties against sLeA-overexpressing malignancies.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Whether this variability arises from noise in cell growth or cell division processes, or originates from cell-size-dependent growth rates, remains unclear. To separate these potential sources of growth variability, single-cell growth rates need to be examined across different timescales. Here, we study cell-intrinsic size and growth regulation by tracking lymphocytic leukemia cell mass accumulation with high precision and minute-scale temporal resolution along long ancestral lineages. We first show that cell-size-dependent growth regulation and asymmetric division of cell size do not explain cell-to-cell growth variability. We then isolate growth fluctuations from overlapping cell-cycle-dependent growth using a Gaussian process regression analysis. We find that these growth fluctuations drive cell-to-cell growth variability within ancestral lineages despite being independent of cell divisions, cell cycle, and cell size.

RSFC is often used to indicate the statistical dependencies among different brain regions of interest, whereas rsEC describes the causal influences among them. Many studies have explored utilities of rsFC and rsEC measures for classifying psychiatric conditions. Several studies showed that rsEC were better than rsFC features for classifying major depression (Frassle et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2018) and schizophrenia ((Brodersen et al., 2014)). However, no study to-date has investigated whether rsEC is inherently better than rsFC for classifying psychiatric conditions or the impact of autocorrelation on classifying rsFC, even though autocorrelation is known to be present in rs-fMRI data. To fill these gaps, we performed a series of computational experiments, by varying the size of the network and the number of participants, to gain some insight into these two aspects of supervised classification with resting state connectivity. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, the results from our study suggest that rsEC cannot be, in principle, better than rsFC features for classification. In fact, rsEC measures led to systematically worse classification results, compared to rsFC features. In terms of the impact of autocorrelation, we found that lag-one autocorrelation could lead to both false negative and false positive classification results for studies with a small sample size.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

To better understand the extent and mechanisms behind helminth-mediated immunosuppression, we used an emerging model of host-parasite interactions, threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and its tapeworm parasite Schistocephalus solidus. We examined the impacts of exposure to ESPs of S. solidus (SsESPs) originating from four Canadian lakes on the viability and function of threespine stickleback splenocytes. We found that 24 hours of exposure to low concentrations of SsESPs significantly increased overall splenocyte viability with the greatest impact on the lymphocyte population. While SsESP exposure did not alter baseline splenocyte respiratory burst activity, SsESP-treated splenic cultures demonstrated significant increases in ROS production in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, suggesting that SsESPs may lower the threshold for activation of the respiratory burst. These results in splenocytes contrast with previous studies demonstrating that SsESPs suppress head kidney leukocytes (HKL) viability and function, suggest that S. solidus-derived excretory secretory products may have cell- or tissue-specific immunomodulatory effects, and highlight the importance of studying host-parasite interactions across diverse immune tissues.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th to June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave, including school groups, tourists, and local trainees-the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans.

How early-life exploration shapes the adult annual cycle routines of migratory animals remains challenging to study, especially in long-lived species. Delayed recruitment often observed in long-lived migratory birds suggests that the first breeding attempt may be constrained by a protracted learning process in which individuals develop their annual itinerary, which may involve extensive exploration of the winter and breeding sites, potentially causing inexperienced young to wander beyond traditional population areas. 2. Using greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus GPS tracking data from 83 individuals tagged as nestlings in the Mediterranean, we analyzed ontogenetic changes in mobility and space use for up to 8 years of age. We segmented autumn-winter and spring-summer tracks (n = 223 device-bird-year combinations) into staging events (n = 1914). We then computed seasonal staging metrics and analysed how they changed with age. We map the traditional congregation sites of flamingos to investigate age-related changes in space use between males and females. 3. Flamingos were more exploratory during their early years, gradually transitioning to a more sedentary lifestyle as they grew older. With each additional year of age, the number of staging events decreased by 16%, while the average duration of staging events increased by 8 days. 4. Birds remained faithful to the non-breeding staging sites where they spent most of their time during the first year of life. Over time, they returned progressively closer to their natal sites, even after years of exploration at non-traditional locations. Breeding was rare (8%) and occurred at a relatively late age ([&ge;]5 years), highlighting an extended exploratory phase, a pattern observed in other long-lived species. 5. Older birds were more likely to use traditional sites and spent more time at these sites, particularly after age 5.

We introduced high throughput fluorescence microscopy of well-plates, to measure sinking velocities of three diatom strains, and three cyanobacteria strains, with cell radii spanning an order of magnitude, all grown under three different light levels. Cultures were measured for sinking velocities repeatedly across their growth trajectories. Tracking multiple fluorescence wavebands allowed us to simultaneously determine sinking velocities for living vs. dead cells. Sinking velocities varied strongly across growth light levels, and across growth stages. These monoclonal cultures furthermore show distinct sub-populations of slow- and fast-sinking cells.

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

As thermal tolerance in corals is partially heritable, identifying genes under thermal selection is critical for targeted biodiversity management. However, it remains unclear how large breaks in connectivity (>100 km of open sea) affect the spread of adaptive alleles for different coral species in discontinuous reef networks such as the West Indian Ocean (WIO). To address this, we applied a seascape genomics approach to model (i) population connectivity and (ii) thermal adaptive potentials for two keystone coral species, Acropora muricata and Pocillopora damicornis, across the WIO. For both species, corals from the Seychelles were predominantly genetically isolated from corals in Rodrigues and Mauritius, putatively an effect of regional oceanographic barriers. Furthermore, sea currents during reproductive periods better predicted genetic connectivity than did Euclidean distances for both species, highlighting that connectivity models can serve as proxies to understand dispersal potential depending on reproductive strategies. Spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation were best explained by sea surface temperature variability and mean degree heating weeks. When used in genotype- environment association (GEA) analyses, we identified hundreds of loci under putative thermal selection from linked to known heat stress responses. In A. muricata, five Sacsin genes--co-chaperones of the Hsp70 heat-shock protein involved in thermal stress response--were identified, alongside genes related to immune defence, antioxidant response, signalling, and protein folding. In contrast, only the centromere protein V, involved in mitosis, was enriched in P. damicornis. By integrating patterns of gene flow with molecular adaptations to estimate species-specific adaptive potentials, we found that large sea distances and strong oceanographic barriers inhibit the genetic exchange of adapted genotypes across the WIO, providing valuable insights to guide local and regional biodiversity management in this region.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "In response to the emerging threat of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, insecticides are being repurposed for vector control or developed de novo. Good stewardship of these finite new resources is essential if disease control programmes are to remain effective. This is dependent on timely data to help guide evidence-based decision-making for National Malaria Control programmes (NMCPs). By embedding genomics into cluster randomized control trials (cRCTs), we can perform surveillance and early detection of insecticide resistance variants to new and repurposed chemicals in natural field conditions, supporting effective stewardship. The LLIN Evaluation Uganda Project (LLINEUP) trial evaluated the efficacy of pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and pyrethroids-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). It was conducted in Uganda between 2017-2020 and was the largest cRCT to date, covering 40% of the country in 104 health sub-districts. We embedded genomic surveillance within LLINEUP to detect and track insecticide resistance variants. At baseline and throughout the trial, we sampled Anopheles mosquitoes with Prokopack aspirators and performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing. We show that An. funestus populations were relatively unaffected by the interventions, compared to An. gambiae s.l., which were markedly reduced six months following LLIN deployment. Standard approaches for describing genetic diversity and population structure e.g. fixation index (FST), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees, were consistent with the density observations and suggestive of a single large An. funestus population in Uganda with little genetic differentiation. Genome-wide selection scans revealed strong signals of selection at the Resistance to pyrethroid-1 (RP1) locus and Cyp9k1, both loci previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance. We report two additional loci, eye diacylglycerol kinase (Dgk) ({cong} 13.5Mb on the X chromosome) and O-mannosyl-transferase (TMC-like) ({cong} 67.9Mb on 3RL) that showed signals of selection. Known DDT and permethrin resistance-associated variants at the Gste2 locus, L119F and L119V, were also identified. Over the trial period, changes in haplotype frequencies were observed in regions under selection, with more pronounced shifts in the PBO arm. Notably, there were significant reductions in the frequencies of swept haplotypes (measured by delta ({Delta}) H12) in the Dgk and Cyp6p9a regions, while significant increases in haplotype frequency were observed at Gste2 and Cyp9k1 loci. Our findings reveal the differential impact of the trial on An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus densities and the differing responses of An. funestus populations to pyrethroid and pyrethroid-PBO selection pressure. These insights underscore the potential value of tailored, species- and region-specific vector control strategies, supported by regional genetic surveillance, to better control insecticide resistance evolution and spread. By embedding genomic surveillance in cRCTs we can facilitate the discovery of putative resistance variants and can provide evidence of their impact on vector control tool efficacy; both of crucial importance to evidence-based deployment of vector control tools by NMCPs.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

We describe a buffer centric, fully miniaturized, 96-well plate workflow to map protein solubility across a large number of conditions in a single working day. Liquid-nitrogen-frozen E. coli pellets are cryogenically bead-milled with stainless-steel beads at sub-zero temperature, retaining the native intracellular milieu while ensuring uniform disruption. The resulting dry powder can therefore be extracted with any buffer of choice, enabling systematic exploration of pH, ionic strength, detergents, and chaotropes. Protein solubility is quantified by a one-microliter chemiluminescent anti-His dot-blot. Using a His-Ruby2 reporter panel, we show that dot-blot intensity can be used as a quantitative proxy of protein solubility. We also provide experimentally supported guidelines on the influence of those buffer reagents on subsequent steps of protein production, SDS-PAGE and Ni-NTA purification. This workflow is compatible with upstream genetic solubility-enhancement strategies, and enables direct transition to scale-up, the same day that soluble hits are identified.

We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

It is the primary building block of capsids that protect the genome of viruses in the Duplodnaviria realm, infecting organisms across all domains of life. It is also the primary building block of encapsulins, compartments that confine biochemical reactions in prokaryotes. Recent genomic studies have hypothesized that encapsulins evolved from HK97-fold viruses. However, this evolutionary pathway is challenging to justify biophysically because HK97-fold viruses form larger and more complex protein shells than encapsulins. We addressed this paradox by searching for smaller and simpler HK97-fold viral entities in metagenomes across ecosystems. The investigation yielded a well-defined group of viral entities, which encode HK97-fold proteins displaying significant molecular similarities with encapsulins and lacking tail genes. The structural phylogenetic analysis of HK97-fold entities revealed likely bidirectional evolutionary transitions between encapsulins and HK97-fold viruses. A potential evolutionary mechanism responsible for such transitions was identified based on the presence of lysogeny-associated genes in the viral entities and the structural and molecular parallels between encapsulins and procapsids, the immature state of viral capsids before genome packaging. Structural comparisons indicated that procapsids are akin to the common HK97-fold protein shell ancestor and might still facilitate transitions between modern viruses and encapsulins. This also implies that viral procapsids may retain the ability to carry out biochemical reactions during infections or when released in the environment, which, if confirmed, would require a fundamental revision of the role of viral capsids in the biosphere.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

There is a need for biomarkers able to provide earlier and more accurate insights into pathogen viability and response to therapy. We analyzed publicly available whole-blood RNA-seq data from 79 TB patients sampled at diagnosis, and weeks 1, 4, and 24 of standard anti-TB treatment. After aligning human reads and filtering, remaining reads were mapped to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome to quantify rRNA subunit transcripts (16S, 23S, 5S, ITS1, ITS2). Microbiome profiles were assessed using Kraken2/Bracken, with alpha/beta diversity analyses and differential abundance (ANCOM-BC2). 16S and 23S rRNA transcripts were consistently detected across all treatment times, with 23S reads dominating in diagnosis and early stages of treatment shifting toward a significant predominance of 16S reads at week 24. 5S and ITS1 were inconsistently detected, whereas ITS2 was undetectable. Alpha diversity (Shannon index) increased during treatment (significant at weeks 1 and 4), while beta diversity showed significant shifts over time despite no significant differences in total M. tuberculosis abundance. Our findings suggest that it may be feasible to detect M. tuberculosis rRNA signatures in blood RNA-seq and suggest dynamic transcriptomic changes during treatment. The 16S/23S ratio and minor rRNA units may serve as complementary biomarkers for treatment monitoring and other transcriptomic-based biomarkers. Future work should validate these findings in larger cohorts using optimized RNA-seq protocols focusing on the pathogen.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

L.; Reis, C.", "abstract": "Submarines pose significant physiological and behavioral challenges due to their dimly lit, isolated, confined, and extreme (DICE) environment, which deprives individuals from exposure to a natural light-dark cycle and limits opportunities for physical activity. In this study, we developed a minimal yet robust exploratory feature-screening approach to identify candidate actigraphy markers of split shift work during a three-week military submarine mission. Actigraphy data was collected across the pre-mission, mission and post-mission periods. During the mission, crew members followed a 6-hours-on/6-hours-off split shift schedule, except for submariners with on-call duty or extended hours. Forty-one actigraphy features were screened for their ability to differentiate between study periods and shifts. A Monte Carlo permutation test was used for this initial screening, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for pairwise comparisons. Light-related features, the slopes of regression lines fitted to the daily predicted dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) trajectories, and Pearson correlation coefficients between each recording day and its corresponding predicted DLMO demonstrated the greatest potential to distinguish between study periods. Among shifts, most high-performing features discriminated between split shift work schedules and on-call or extended-hours schedules. Only the relative amplitude (RA) and the average light intensity during the five least-illuminated hours of the day (L5) reliably distinguished between the shift performing the bulk of nighttime work and its counterpart. Given its robustness under conditions of low activity and light exposure, our methodology may be applicable to other operational or clinical populations with reduced activity levels, such as individuals with depression or dementia.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Individuals carrying an APOE4 allele have an increased risk of AD and exhibit deficits in energy metabolism, including glucose utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction. While the role of APOE in the liver is well characterized, the impact of APOE genetic variation on hepatic health and metabolism remains poorly understood. We sought to investigate this using young female and male APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice. We also used APOE isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) to examine specific effects in a human-relevant cell model. Proteomic and functional assays show that APOE4 causes extensive changes to liver mitochondrial function in a sex-specific manner in mice and alters glucose and lipid metabolism. APOE4 also impairs mitochondrial function in iHLCs and shifts metabolism towards glycolysis while modifying expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Additionally, APOE4 iHLCs display a greater reliance on fatty acids as an energy source and show increased lipid accumulation. Taken together, our findings show that APOE genetic variation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and rewires hepatic metabolism.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Our aim was to identify areas with a high concentration of EDGE species and to evaluate how effectively the current protected area network encompasses them. Our findings reveal that threatened evolutionary history is primarily concentrated in mountainous and coastal regions. While several EDGE zones -areas containing unique and jeopardized evolutionary lineages- overlap with existing protected areas, particularly in mountains, others harbouring few but evolutionarily unique and highly threatened taxa remain largely unprotected. This study highlights the value of applying global conservation metrics such as EDGE at regional scales.

This study aimed to develop a structured, multi-parental mapping population to enhance the resolution of quantitative trait dissection, based on the hypothesis that a Nested Association Mapping (NAM) design would enable the detection of minor-effect loci often overlooked by traditional biparental or diversity panel-based approaches. A lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) NAM population was developed by crossing the Canadian cultivar CDC Redberry with 32 diverse genotypes sourced globally from three major lentil-growing macro-environments: Northern temperate, Mediterranean, and South Asia. The resulting recombinant inbred lines were phenotyped for key phenological traits, days to emergence (DTE), flowering (DTF), and maturity (DTM), under field conditions, and genotyped using exome capture sequencing. Genome-wide association studies for DTF identified 14 significant loci across six chromosomes, including the known FTb locus and novel associations near AP3a, HUB2a, and PIF6 genes. These results demonstrate the utility of the NAM design in detecting both major and minor-effect loci that underlie complex trait variation. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available NAM population in lentil. It provides a high-resolution, globally representative platform for trait discovery, pre-breeding, and collaborative genetic improvement of this nutritionally and agronomically important legume.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have reported that carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation that catalyzes the conversion of acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, is involved in various senescence-related diseases. Although solar lentigo (SL) is an age-related pigmentary disorder characterized by the accumulation of senescent cells, its role in metabolic dysregulation has rarely been investigated. Methods and Results: Integrated transcriptomic profiling of SL skin samples, combining mRNA sequencing, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment analyses, metabolic flux simulations, and protein-protein interaction analysis, was conducted to demonstrate the molecular alterations in SL compared to perilesional normal skin. We found transcriptomic alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism-associated genes. Metabolic flux simulations revealed that carnitine-associated reactions involved in fatty acid oxidation were upregulated. Using a multi-omics approach, CPT1B was selected as a potential marker for SL, which was confirmed via its overexpression in immunohistochemical studies. Using a zebrafish model, CPT1B was implicated in melanogenesis. Discussion: CPT1B-mediated metabolic alteration is a key driver of SL pathogenesis. Targeting CPT1B and the associated lipid metabolism pathways is a novel therapeutic approach for managing SL and age-related pigmentation disorders.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": ""}

By establishing a continuous surface characterization system for protein-ligand interfaces, we concurrently incorporate geometric curvature features (radius, shape index) and chemical interaction fields (electrostatic potential, hydrogen-bond networks, hydrophobicity gradients). A contrastive learning architecture based on Siamese equivariant graph neural networks was developed to enable discriminative analysis between co-crystal conformations and parameter-perturbed pseudo-conformations generated through inverse docking. The five-channel fusion model demonstrates robust performance on the time-split PoseBuster validation set (AUC=0.91), with predicted Euclidean distance deviation ({Delta}E) effectively distinguishing native co-crystal conformations from aberrant docking poses in 80% of samples. Notably, 71% of {Delta}E-negative samples concentrate within the [-0.3, 0] interval, reflecting physical consistency between model predictions and conformational transition processes.
