Recent observations in humans and Fmr1 knockout (KO) models of FXS suggest abnormal GABAergic signaling may underlie pathophysiology of FXS. However, the role of astrocytes in mediating defective inhibition in FXS is unknown. Here we show that human FXS astrocytes derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mouse Fmr1 KO astrocytes show a significant increase in levels of GABA and GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD65/67. Our study implicates reverse GABA transport in astrocytes in suppressing PV expression and increasing cortical cell activity in astrocyte-specific Fmr1 KO mice, which also show reduced inhibitory connectivity and impaired cortical sound-evoked gamma synchronization, as well as increased locomotor activity and altered social behaviors. Our findings suggest astrocytes play a key role in the development and function of inhibitory circuits, and contribute to FXS-associated phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we interrogated the mechanotransductive feedback dynamics that govern endothelial cell motility and vascular morphogenesis. We show that the transcriptional regulators, YAP and TAZ, are activated by mechanical cues to transcriptionally limit cytoskeletal and focal adhesion maturation, forming a conserved mechanotransductive feedback loop that mediates human endothelial cell motility in vitro and zebrafish intersegmental vessel (ISV) morphogenesis in vivo. This feedback loop closes in 4 hours, achieving cytoskeletal equilibrium in 8 hours. Feedback loop inhibition arrested endothelial cell migration in vitro and ISV morphogenesis in vivo. Inhibitor washout at 3 hrs, prior to feedback loop closure, restored vessel growth, but washout at 8 hours, longer than the feedback timescale, did not, establishing lower and upper bounds for feedback kinetics in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP and TAZ induced transcriptional suppression of RhoA signaling to maintain dynamic cytoskeletal equilibria. Together, these data establish the mechanoresponsive dynamics of a transcriptional feedback loop necessary for persistent endothelial cell migration and vascular morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive mechanistic model of a neuron with plasticity that explains how information input as time-varying signals is processed and stored. Additionally, the model addresses two long-standing, specific biological challenges: Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, and identifying a concise synaptic learning rule. A biologically accurate electric-circuit equivalent is derived through a one-to-one mapping from the known properties of ion channels. The often-overlooked dynamics of the synaptic cleft is essential in this process. Analysis of the model reveals a simple and succinct learning rule, indicating that the neuron functions as an internal-feedback adaptive filter, a common concept in signal processing. Simulations confirm the model's functionality, stability, and convergence, demonstrating that even a single neuron without external feedback can act as a potent signal processor. The model replicates several key characteristics typical of biological neurons, which are seldom captured in other neuron models. It can encode time-varying functions, learn without risking instability, and bootstrap from a state where all synaptic weights are zero. This paper explores the function of neurons with a focus on biological accuracy, not computational efficiency. Unlike neuromorphic models, it does not aim to design devices. The electronic circuit analogy aids understanding by leveraging decades of electronics expertise but is not intended for physical implementation.

Several neuromodulatory systems are implicated in exploration, based, in part, on work linking exploration to pupil size-a peripheral correlate of neuromodulatory tone and index of arousal. However, pupil size could instead track variables that make exploration more likely, like volatility or reward, without directly predicting either exploration or its neural bases. Here, we simultaneously measured pupil size, exploration, and neural population activity in the prefrontal cortex while two rhesus macaques explored and exploited in a dynamic environment. We found that pupil size under constant luminance specifically predicted the onset of exploration, the first exploratory trial in a sequence, beyond what could be explained by reward history. Pupil size also predicted disorganized patterns of prefrontal neural activity at both the single neuron and population levels, even within periods of exploitation. Ultimately, our results support a model in which pupil-linked mechanisms promote the onset of exploration via driving the prefrontal cortex through a critical tipping point where prefrontal control dynamics become disorganized and exploratory decisions are possible.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans and other animals learn about the world through exploration: through making decisions that offer the opportunity to learn and discover, even when these decisions are not the best option in the moment. Neuroscience research has historically focused on understanding good choices, delivering many key insights into the neural mechanisms involved in these calculations. However, much less is known about how the brain generates exploratory decisions. This study identifies certain \"early warning signs\" of exploratory decisions in the brain and body, including certain signals in size of the pupil and the speed of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. These early warning signs suggest that exploration may be the result of a critical tipping point in prefrontal brain states.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers to journals of the highest impact (e.g., Science, Nature, or PNAS) andto submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men when they do submit. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to high-impact journals because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals.

This class of enzymes has attracted considerable attention due to their ability to convert biomaterials of high abundance into oligosaccharides that can be useful for producing biofuels and bioplastics. However, processes at the interface between solution and insoluble substrates represent a major challenge to biochemical and structural characterization. Here, we investigated the four-domain LPMO from Vibrio cholerae, N-acetyl glucosamine binding protein A (GbpA), to elucidate how it docks onto its insoluble substrate with its two terminal domains. First, we developed a protocol that allowed GbpA and chitin to form a stable complex in suspension, overcoming incompatibilities of the two binding partners with respect to pH. Using contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), after determining the neutron scattering contrast match point for chitin (47% D2O), we characterized the structure of GbpA in complex with chitin by SANS, and by electron microscopy. We found that GbpA binds rapidly to chitin, where it spreads out on the chitin fibers, and smoothens their surface. In some locations, GbpA binding induces the formation of protein-chitin clumps containing hundreds of GbpA molecules. Together, this suggests how the secretion of GbpA efficiently prepares the ground for microcolony formation by the bacteria.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

The resulting deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), have a profound impact on brain development, which manifests as developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and behavioral deficits. To understand how the brain regions are differentially affected by the defective Dhcr7, we aim to map the regional distribution of sterols and other lipids in neonatal brains from a Dhcr7-KO mouse model of SLOS, using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). MSI enables spatial localization of biomolecules in situ on the surface of a tissue section, which is particularly useful for mapping the changes that occur within a metabolic disorder such as SLOS, and in an anatomically complex organ such as the brain. In this work, using MALDI-ion mobility (IM)-MSI, we successfully determined the regional distribution of features that correspond to cholesterol, 7-DHC/desmosterol, and the precursor of desmosterol, 7-dehydrodesmosterol, in WT and Dhcr7-KO mice. Interestingly, we also observed m/z values that match the major oxysterol metabolites of 7-DHC (DHCEO and hydroxy-7-DHC), which displayed similar patterns to 7-DHC. We then identified brain lipids using m/z and CCS at the Lipid Species-level and curated a database of MALDI-IM-MS-derived lipid CCS values. Subsequent statistical analysis of regions-of-interest allowed us to identify differentially expressed lipids between Dhcr7-KO and WT brains, which could contribute to defects in myelination, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and learning and memory in SLOS.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

We report here a previously undescribed phenomenon in which the autofluorescence of these granules displays a \"flash\" phenomenon in which fluorescence decreases are preceded by sharp increases in fluorescence intensity that expand into the surrounding area when the granules are stimulated with blue light. Autofluorescent granules are present in the intestinal cells of all six nematode species examined, with differences in morphology and distribution pattern. Five species exhibit the flash phenomenon: Panagrellus redivivus (Clade IV), Steinernema hermaphroditum (Clade IV), C. elegans (Clade V), Oscheius tipulae (Clade V), and Pristionchus pacificus (Clade V). The reaction of the granules to blue light stimulation greatly differs among different developmental stages and may also be dependent on physiological conditions. In addition, even within the same animal, the sensitivity of individual granules differs, with some of the variation associated with other characteristics of the granules, such as their overall location within the intestine. We hypothesize that the differences in response to blue light indicate the existence of different sub-populations of gut granules in nematode intestines, and the visually spectacular dynamic fluorescence phenomenon we describe might provide a handle on their eventual characterization.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, an in-depth study on the temporal changes of gene expression in the developing brains has not been done before. In this work, we carried out the transcriptomic analysis of whole brains from WT and Dhcr7-KO mice at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), E14.5, E16.5, and postnatal day 0 (PND0). First, we observed the expected downregulation of the Dhcr7 gene in the Dhcr7-KO brains, as well as changes of other genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis at all time points. Pathway and GO term enrichment analyses revealed affected signaling pathways and biological processes that were shared amongst time points and unique to individual time points. Specifically, the pathways important for embryonic development, including Hippo, Wnt, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, are the most significantly affected at the earliest time point, E12.5. Additionally, neurogenesis-related GO terms were enriched in earlier time points, consistent with the timing of development. Conversely, pathways related to synaptogenesis, which occurs later in development compared to neurogenesis, are significantly affected at the later time points, E16.5 and PND0, including the cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic synapses.

Although senescent cells are non-proliferative, they remain biologically active and secrete a complex and diverse array of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretome (SAS), which exerts pro-tumorigenic effects. Here, we aimed to mechanistically investigate how the SAS contributes to metastatic dissemination of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using standard-of-care cisplatin as a senescence inducer. Our findings demonstrate that the cisplatin-induced SAS enhances the dissemination of HGSOC in vivo without affecting cell proliferation or viability. We found that the SAS facilitates cell detachment, an effect that is mediated by a metabolic component. Using a metabolically focused CRISPR knockout screen, we identified complex I as the key driver of SAS-mediated cell detachment in bystander cells and validated that inhibition of complex I activity decreases HGSOC dissemination in vivo. Mechanistically, this effect was driven by SAS-mediated inhibition of an NAD+-SIRT-SREBP axis, leading to decreased plasma membrane cholesterol that increased cell detachment. Excitingly, we found that fructose is the key SAS component upstream of the NAD+-SIRT-SREBP-cholesterol axis mediating increased detachment of bystander cells, and a high fructose diet increases HGSOC dissemination in vivo. These findings reveal that the cisplatin-induced SAS reprograms the metabolic microenvironment in HGSOC, driving cancer cell detachment and promoting metastatic dissemination in a paracrine fashion. They also point to a previously unrecognized pro-tumorigenic effect of the SAS that may contribute to the high recurrence rate of HGSOC patients.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Previous studies of membrane potential and cytoplasmic Ca2+ at the soma suggested that sLNv neuron activity peaks at night4,5, but exocytosis of neuropeptide-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs) at their terminals peaks hours later at midmorning6. To resolve the basis of the timing mismatch between somatic physiology and terminal exocytosis, recently developed probes were used to measure daily rhythms in sLNv neuron synaptic Ca2+ and sNPF release. Remarkably, at midmorning after soma Ca2+ has dropped, both Ca2+ spiking and clock-dependent native neuropeptide release peak in the distal terminals of the protocerebrum. Furthermore, Ca2+ in the soma and terminals differ in dependence on Ca2+ influx. Finally, synaptic DCV exocytosis requires Ca2+ spike activity at terminals that is not evident at the soma. These results lead to two striking conclusions. First, soma Ca2+ recording, which is the focus of many circuit studies, is not indicative of presynaptic Ca2+ and neuropeptide release in distal sLNv terminals. Second, daily clock- and activity-dependent sLNv terminal neuropeptide release occurs ~9-18 hours in advance of known sLNv neuropeptide effects on nighttime sleep and morning behavior.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

To address these questions, we conducted integrative analyses of high-resolution TSS maps and translation efficiency data from multiple eukaryotic organisms. Our results reveal that most ATU events co-occur with differential gene expression and that the direction of ATU is largely consistent with changes in transcription levels. These findings suggest that ATU likely works in concert with transcriptional activity to fine-tune protein production, modulating translation efficiency and mRNA stability through alterations in 5'UTR sequence and structural features. Given its functional importance, the evolution of TSS locations may have been shaped by natural selection, leading to heterogeneous 5'UTR lengths in genes with distinct expression demands.

Leishmania, causative agents of the neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis, are intra-phagosomal parasites that establish a replicative niche within macrophages.

Parasite burden was significantly higher in B6.Edil3-/- (Del1-KO) compared to wild type B6 mice, as determined by whole body IVIS imaging, largely as a result of increased liver parasite load. However, lack of DEL-1 enhanced hepatomegaly and enhanced granulomatous inflammation. Conversely, parasite burden and the formation of large granulomas was reduced in mice overexpressing DEL-1 in macrophages but not in endothelial cells.

Indeed, we demonstrate that augmented mitochondrial pyruvate import prevented cell growth in fat body cells in vivo as well as in cultured mammalian hepatocytes and human hepatocyte-derived cells in vitro. We hypothesize that this effect on cell size was caused by an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio, which rewired metabolism toward gluconeogenesis and suppressed the biomass-supporting glycolytic pathway. Amino acid synthesis was decreased, and the resulting loss of protein synthesis prevented cell growth. Surprisingly, this all occurred in the face of activated pro-growth signaling pathways, including mTORC1, Myc, and PI3K/Akt.

Yet, in plants, the enzymes responsible for their turnover remain largely unknown. Using a non-hydrolysable PP-InsP analog in a pull-down approach, we identified a family of Arabidopsis NUDIX hydrolases (NUDTs) that group into two closely related subclades. Through in vitro assays, heterologous expression systems, and higher-order gene-edited mutants, we explored the substrate specificities and physiological roles of these hydrolases. Using a combination of strong anion exchange (SAX)-HPLC, PAGE, and capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that their PP-InsP pyrophosphatase activity is enantiomer-selective and Mg2+-dependent. Specifically, subclade I NUDTs preferentially hydrolyze 4-InsP7, while subclade II NUDTs target 3-InsP7, with minor activity against other PP-InsPs, including 5-InsP7. In higher-order mutants of subclade II NUDTs, we observed defects in both Pi and iron homeostasis, accompanied by increased levels of 1/3-InsP7 and 5-InsP7, with a markedly larger increase in 1/3-InsP7. Ectopic expression of NUDTs from both subclades induced local Pi starvation responses (PSRs), while RNA-seq analysis comparing wildtype (WT) and subclade II nudt12/13/16 loss-of-function plants indicates additional PSR-independent roles, potentially involving 1/3-InsP7 in the regulation of plant defense. Consistently, nudt12/13/16 mutants displayed enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae infection, indicating a role in bacterial pathogen susceptibility. Expanding beyond subclade II NUDTs, we demonstrated susceptibility of the 3PP-position of PP-InsPs to enzymatic activities unrelated to NUDTs, and found that such activities are conserved across plants and humans. Additionally, we found that NUDT effectors from pathogenic ascomycete fungi exhibit a substrate specificity similar to subclade I NUDTs. Collectively, our findings reveal new roles for NUDTs in PP-InsP signaling, plant nutrient and immune responses, and highlight a cross-kingdom conservation of PP-InsP-metabolizing enzymes.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, the specific contributions of JA signaling itself on eATP signaling are unexplored. Here, we report that JA primes plant responses to eATP through P2K1. Our findings show that JA treatment significantly upregulates P2K1 transcription, corroborating our observation that JA facilitates eATP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation and transcriptional reprogramming in a JA signaling-dependent manner.

Volatile chemicals form gradients that differ from soluble compounds, potentially making navigation based on comparisons between spatially separated sensors unreliable for small-bodied animals. Contrary to this model of simple spatial comparison, C. elegans employs an antagonistic strategy, comparing inputs from head (AWA) and tail (PHD) sensory neurons with distinct response properties. Despite sharing a receptor, SRD-1, these detectors play different roles: AWA head neurons promote forward movement and acceleration, while tail PHD neurons induce reversals and deceleration. In increasing pheromone gradients AWA dominates; whereas decreasing gradients inactivate AWAs, allowing PHDs to fine-tune the response and correct the trajectory. Head AWAs are essential for mate-searching, while tail PHDs are crucial for complex tasks. Using a minimal-parameter computational model that recapitulates key findings, we infer the interplay between head and tail signals in adaptive navigation. This study reveals a sexually dimorphic dual-detector system that integrates antagonistic sensory inputs from head and tail neurons to enable adaptive navigation strategies essential for efficient free-moving target location in dynamic environments.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Computational modeling suggests that the load-dependent off-rate is the strongest determinant of which motor wins a kinesin-dynein tug-of-war, and optical tweezer experiments find family-dependent differences in the sensitivity of detachment to load, with kinesin-3 > kinesin-2 > kinesin-1. However, in reconstituted kinesin-dynein pairs vitro, all three kinesin families compete nearly equally well against dynein. Modeling and experiments have confirmed that vertical forces inherent to the large trapping beads enhance kinesin-1 dissociation rates. In vivo, vertical forces are expected to range from negligible to dominant, depending on cargo and microtubule geometries. To investigate the detachment and reattachment kinetics of kinesin-1, 2 and 3 motors against loads oriented parallel to the microtubule, we created a DNA tensiometer comprising a DNA entropic spring attached to the microtubule on one end and a motor on the other. Kinesin dissociation rates at stall were slower than detachment rates during unloaded runs, and the complex reattachment kinetics were consistent with a weakly-bound slip state preceding detachment. Kinesin-3 behaviors under load suggested that long KIF1A run lengths result from the concatenation of multiple short runs connected by diffusive episodes. Stochastic simulations were able to recapitulate the load-dependent detachment and reattachment kinetics for all three motors and provide direct comparison of key transition rates between families. These results provide insight into how kinesin-1, -2 and -3 families transport cargo in complex cellular geometries and compete against dynein during bidirectional transport.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to learn how this motor output is shaped by concurrent premotor signals. Specifically, we analyzed how electrophysiological manipulation of a premotor nonspiking (NS) neuron, that forms a recurrent inhibitory circuit (analogous to that formed by vertebrate Renshaw cells), shapes the leech crawling motor pattern. The study included a quantitative analysis of putative motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows that the rhythmic motor output in isolated ganglia mirrors the phase relationships observed in vivo.

This creates a significant gene product dosage imbalance of the X and Z chromosomes between the sexes as well as between the single sex chromosome and the autosomes in the heterogametic sex, making its resolution essential. Dosage compensation and its molecular mechanisms have primarily been studied in select organisms, such as primates, rodents, birds, fruit flies, and Caenorhabditis elegans, while the extent and mechanisms of dosage compensation remain largely unexplored in the vast majority of animal taxa. Recently, coleoid cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish, were reported to possess a ZZ/Z0 sex chromosome system1, where males carry two copies of the Z chromosome while females carry only one. However, whether dosage compensation occurs in these species remains unexplored. Here, we show, for the first time, that Z-chromosome dosage compensation is achieved in octopus. Using both original RNA-seq data from O.vulgaris paralarvae as well as publicly available datasets from O.vulgaris and O.sinensis, we report extensive but incomplete dosage compensation of the Z-chromosome in female octopus at the RNA level, similar to Z-chromosome dosage compensation in avian ZW systems. Furthermore, we identify two evolutionarily conserved Z-linked lncRNAs, one featuring strong male-biased expression patterns, that we termed Zmast and another with strong female-biased expression patterns that we termed Zfest. Our results provide the first evidence of sex chromosome dosage compensation in octopus, representing one of the most ancient known animal sex-chromosome systems, and raise the possibility that non-coding RNA may play a role in its regulation, akin that observed in younger animal taxa.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed advanced information-theoretic analyses, including mutual information (MI) and co-information (co-I), alongside event-related potential (ERP) and temporal generalization analyses (TGA), to characterize auditory prediction error processing across wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that a shared neural code would be present across sleep stages, with deeper sleep being associated with reduced information content and increased information redundancy. To investigate this, twenty-nine young healthy participants were exposed to an auditory local-global oddball paradigm during wakefulness and during an 8-hour sleep opportunity monitored via polysomnography in a cross-sectional study. We focused on local mismatch responses to a deviating fifth tone following four standard tones. ERP analyses showed that prediction error processing continued throughout all sleep stages (N1-N3, REM). Mutual information analyses revealed a substantial reduction in the amount of encoded prediction error information particularly during N3 and REM, although ERP amplitudes increased with deeper NREM sleep. In addition, we observed delayed information encoding during sleep and co-information analyses showed that neural dynamics became increasingly redundant with increasing sleep depth. Temporal generalisation analyses revealed a largely shared neural code between N2 and N3 sleep, although it differed between wakefulness and sleep. Here, we showed how the neural code of the sentinel processing mode changes from wake to light to deep sleep and REM, characterised by delayed processing, more redundant and less rich neural information in the human cortex as consciousness wanes.

In this study, we design a computational pipeline to explore potential candidates, in the form of small peptides, to regulate ageing kinetics in biomolecular condensates. By combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of a sequence-dependent residue-resolution force field, we investigate the impact of peptide insertion - with different composition, patterning, and net charge - in the condensate phase diagram and ageing kinetics of archetypal proteins driving condensate ageing: TDP-43 and FUS. We reveal that small peptides composed of a specific balance of aromatic and charged residues can substantially decelerate ageing over an order of magnitude. The mechanism is controlled through condensate density reduction induced by peptide self-repulsive electrostatic interactions that specifically target protein regions prone to form cross-{beta}-sheet fibrils. Our work proposes an efficient computational framework to rapidly scan the impact of small molecule insertion in condensate ageing and develop novel pathways for controlling phase transitions relevant to disease prevention.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Beyond mapping brain functional architecture at unprecedented scales, high-spatial-resolution acquisitions have also inspired and enabled several novel analytical strategies that can potentially improve the sensitivity and neuronal specificity of fMRI. With small voxels, one can sample from different levels of the vascular hierarchy within the cerebral cortex and resolve the temporal progression of hemodynamic changes from parenchymal to pial vessels. We propose that this characteristic pattern of temporal progression across cortical depths can aid in distinguishing neurogenic blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from typical nuisance factors arising from non-BOLD origins, such as head motion and pulsatility. In this study, we examine the feasibility of applying cross-cortical depth temporal lag (CortiLag) patterns to automatically categorize BOLD and non-BOLD signal components in modern-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. We construct an independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework for fMRI de-noising, analogous to previously proposed multi-echo (ME) ICA, except that here we explore the across-depth instead of across-echo dependence to distinguish BOLD and non-BOLD components. The efficacy of this framework is demonstrated using visual task data at three graded spatiotemporal resolutions (voxel sizes = 1.1, 1.5, and 2.0 mm isotropic at temporal intervals = 1700, 1120, and 928 ms). The proposed CortiLag-ICA framework leverages prior knowledge of the spatiotemporal properties of BOLD-fMRI and serves as an alternative to ME-ICA for cleaning moderate- and high-spatial-resolution fMRI data when multi-echo acquisitions are not available.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

We asked how this process shapes the collective phenotype. Using multi-animal pose tracking to quantify social behaviors, we compared matched queenright and queenless partitions from the same source colonies. Queenless colonies were more interactive and contained a subset of behaviorally extreme queen-like workers with higher movement, spatial centrality, and reproductive potential. Such variation, absent in queenright colonies, coincided with a shift to decentralized, efficient network structures.

While dairy remains a component of the human diet beyond weaning, the impact of continued milk supplementation on gut epithelial homeostasis remains poorly understood.

This pathway enhances barrier integrity and suppresses inflammation induced by mild Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS) treatment. In contrast, feeding a lard-based high-fat diet or transient pharmacologic inhibition of JNK2 induces epithelial P38 activation, resulting in barrier disruption and inflammation. Importantly, the beneficial effects of milk were observed only if initiated during the weaning period, when the microbiome is in a metastable transitional state. Initiation of the same intervention two weeks after weaning led to P38 activation and inflammatory responses.

In an attempt to model these multicellular responses reliably in cell culture, we compare here the global transcriptional antimicrobial response to infection with influenza A virus (IAV) in precision cult lung slices (PCLS), volume defined organ discs largely maintaining the cellular composition and 3D architecture of the donor lung. To permit a fair comparison of host responses in an isogenic background we first challenged mice in vivo and murine PCLS (mPCLS) and assess host transciptomic changes by unbiased RNAseq. While core antiviral responses overlapped substantially, mPCLS lacked certain features--such as type II interferon expression--likely due to the absence of infiltrating immune cells responses. Importantly, when expanding our findings to immune experienced human precision cut lung slices (hPCLS), we find a much broader antiviral response after IAV challenge, including type I, II and III interferons, suggesting the presence of responsive tissue resident lymphocytes. To prove specificity of this response we infected hPCLS with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ex vivo tissues responded with a distinct proinflammatory gene profile including IL1A, IL1B and IL17 expression. Blocking of IL-1 signaling partially inhibited the proinflammatory response, suggesting cellular cross-talk and a complex and specific antimicrobial reaction in this ex vivo model.

We use here ex vivo cultured PCLS and use transcriptomics to assess the global tissue resident host response to viral and bacterial challenge. Our data show 1) that murine PCLS faithfully reflect core responses to viral infection, while missing proinflammatory responses linked to infiltrating immune cells and 2) that human PCLS show a highly diversified tissue resident immune response to viral infection due to previous exposures of the host to this pathogen.

Ecdysone hormones play a crucial role in regulating the molting process of different ecdysozoan taxa. Interestingly, despite this highly conserved function of ecdysone, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has lost the ecdysone receptor (ECR) genes and their molting appears to be ecdysone-independent. The loss of ecr has only been reported in Caenorhabditis within ecdysozoans, and the evolutionary background behind this loss has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that loss of ecr is not exceptional in Caenorhabditis, but has occurred at least three times in Rhabditina and Tylenchina nematodes. Our genome-wide analysis of 160 nematode species revealed multiple losses of ecr and its typical heterodimer partner usp during nematode evolution. Furthermore, using transcriptomic and in silico protein structural analyses, we identified two factors that potentially underlie and buffer the loss of ECR gene/function: (1) molting regulation by an alternative nuclear receptor HR3 (NHR-23) and (2) a lineage-specific expansion of nuclear receptors in the ecr-deficient taxa.

Understanding the ecology and biology of A. variegatum is thus crucial to developing effective control methods to limit its geographic spread. A key initial step in this endeavor involves the precise isolation and detailed functional characterization of tick organs to better understand vector competence. However, complete anatomical descriptions of internal structures within the Amblyomma genus remain scarce. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of the internal anatomy of unfed nymphs, partially engorged males, and unfed and partially engorged females of the tick species A. variegatum. By accurately identifying and mapping organs of interest, we highlight notable morphological differences from other tick species. This foundational work not only enhances our understanding of A. variegatum anatomy but also serves as a crucial resource for investigating tick-borne disease transmission. Ultimately, these findings support the development of targeted vector control strategies, applicable to both endemic and non-endemic regions.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Memory and gaze behavior are intricately linked, guiding one another to extract information and create mental representations of our environment for subsequent retrieval. Recent findings from functional neuroimaging and computational modeling suggest that reciprocal interactions between the extended hippocampal system and visuo-oculomotor regions are functionally relevant for building these mental representations during visual exploration. Yet, evidence for the directionality of information flow during encoding within this reciprocal architecture in humans is limited. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to give a non-invasive account for the directional influences between these systems when new memories are created. Here, we provide novel evidence demonstrating how unrestricted, naturalistic visual exploration induces changes in this connectivity. Subsequent memory retrieval performance was also predicted by the pattern of connectivity modulated by unrestricted visual exploration, identifying the mechanism underlying a rich history of previous work linking increased gaze behavior during encoding to later memory. Together, these findings suggest that gaze behavior shapes the ways in which brain dynamics within and between the hippocampal system and early visual cortex unfold during encoding in humans. Importantly, these directional interactions support the building of coherent, lasting mental representations.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Given the functional importance of phase separation of IDRs, it has been proposed that mutations that modulate phase separation might preferentially lead to disease. To examine this idea, we used the robust predictability of phase-separating (PS) IDRs and annotation of disease-associated proteins and mutations to map the correlation between disease and phase separation. Consistent with previous work linking phase separation to cancer and autism spectrum disorder, we find a higher prevalence of predicted phase separation behavior in disease-associated proteins than typical for human proteins. We map the prevalence of phase separation across a wide range of diseases, finding that many, but not all, show an enrichment of phase separation in the proteins associated with them. Strikingly, the pathogenic mutation rate in predicted PS IDRs was elevated three-fold relative to IDRs not predicted to phase separate. Substitutions involving arginine and the aromatic types were among the most pathogenic for PS IDRs, while substitutions involving serine, threonine, and alanine the most benign. We applied these trends to mutations of uncertain clinical significance and predict that half found in PS IDRs are likely pathogenic. We find that phosphorylation sites were enriched in PS IDRs when compared to other protein regions, though mutations at such sites were mostly benign. Pathogenicity was highest for mutations in predicted PS IDRs when also found in a short linear motif, known mediators of protein-protein interactions.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate for feedback-driven classification learning, whether sleep integrates explicit and implicit aspects of memory. The negative relationship between implicit and explicit memory components was resolved over sleep, but not wakefulness. Additionally, sleep benefitted performance on a task that allows the cooperative use of explicit and implicit memory, and participants who slept showed superior performance in generalizing their knowledge to unseen exemplars.

The coupling of neuronal spiking in neocortex to the phase of alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) has been well studied in nonhuman primates but remains largely unexplored in other mammals. How this alpha modulation of spiking differs between brain areas and cell types, as well as its role in sensory processing and decision making, are not well understood. We used Neuropixels 1.0 probes to chronically record neural activity from somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala in mice performing a whisker-based selective detection task. We observed strong spontaneous alpha modulation of single-neuron spiking activity during inter-trial intervals while mice performed the task. The prevalence and strength of alpha phase modulation differed significantly across regions and between cell types. Phase modulated neurons exhibited stronger responses to both go and no-go stimuli, as well as stronger motor- and reward-related changes in firing rate, than their unmodulated counterparts. The increased responsiveness of phase modulated neurons suggests they are innervated by more diverse populations. Alpha modulation of neuronal spiking during baseline activity also correlated with task performance. In particular, many neurons exhibited strong alpha modulation before correct trials, but not before incorrect trials. These data suggest that dysregulation of spiking activity with respect to alpha oscillations may characterize lapses in attention.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

By leveraging top-down feedback, human vision excels in constructing meaningful interpretations even in challenging scenarios. In this work, we investigate a computational implementation of the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm using search in a generative model applied to an underspecified image dataset inspired by star constellations. The search is guided by low-level cues based on the structural fitness of solutions to the test images. This dataset serves as a testbed for exploring how inferred signals can guide the synthesis of suitable solutions in ambiguous conditions.

E.; Esni, F.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The exocrine pancreas has a limited regenerative capacity, but to what extent all acinar cells are involved in this process is unclear. Nevertheless, the heterogenous nature of acinar cells suggests that cells exhibiting higher plasticity might play a more prominent role in acinar regeneration. In that regard, Stmn1-expressing acinar cells have been identified as potential facultative progenitor-like cells in the adult pancreas. Here, we studied Stmn1-progeny under physiological conditions, during regeneration, and in the context of KrasG12D expression. METHODS: We followed the fate of Stmn1-progenies both under baseline conditions, following caerulein-induced acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic duct ligation, and in the context of KrasG12D expression. RESULTS: The Stmn1-lineage contributes to baseline acinar cell turnover under physiological conditions. Furthermore, these cells rapidly proliferate and repopulate the acinar compartment in response to acute injury in an ADM-independent manner. Moreover, acinar regeneration during chronic pancreatitis progression is in conjunction with a decline in the proliferative capacity of the Stmn1-lineage. Interestingly, newly generated acinar cells display increased susceptibility to additional injury during recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP). Finally, given their inability to form ADMs, the Stmn1-lineage fails to form PanINs upon oncogenic Kras expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings establish the Stmn1-lineage as a pivotal subpopulation for acinar tissue homeostasis and regeneration. The ability of these cells to restore acinar tissue in an ADM-independent manner distinguishes them as a critical regenerative population. This study presents a new paradigm for acinar regeneration and repair in the context of pancreatitis and neoplasia.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsim's core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps.

C.; Koelle, K.", "abstract": "In an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aimed at identifying zoonotic viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans act to monitor the \"viral chatter\" at the animal-human interface. These studies are hampered, however, by the diversity of zoonotic viruses and the limited tools available to assess pandemic risk. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using in vitro laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outputs that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we use within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals to estimate parameters relevant to transmission, including an estimate of transmissibility. We then extended this model to estimate epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproductive number and generation interval. To illustrate these approaches, we present them in the context of two influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (Cal/2009) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (Hong Kong/1968). Despite estimating broadly similar transmissibilities for Cal/2009 and Hong Kong/1968, we conclude that Cal/2009 has a higher pandemic potential. This difference in pandemic potential seems to be primarily driven by its more robust within-host replication. Our results critically depend on several assumptions, namely that the within-host viral dynamics in humans and those in the model animal used (here, ferrets) share quantitative similarities and that viral transmissibility between model animals reflects viral transmissibility between humans. The methods we present to assess relative pandemic risk across viral isolates can be used to improve quantitative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we show in mice that feeding of antigen-containing diet generates peripherally derived regulatory T (pTreg) cells that exhibit a tissue-adapted effector phenotype. The antigen feeding also enables the generated pTreg cells to acquire Treg-specific epigenomic changes in Treg signature genes including Foxp3, hence the stability of Treg-specific function. Cessation of antigen feeding, however, results in decline in oral tolerance with diminution of pTreg cells. Transcriptomic analysis has revealed that the induced pTreg cells predominantly express CD101. CD101+ Treg cells with a similar phenotype and epigenetic alterations can also be generated in vitro from antigen-primed naive CD4+ T cells by blockade of CD28-mediated co-stimulation during TGF-{beta}-dependent Treg induction. Furthermore, in vivo CD28 signal blockade by CTLA-4-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) before antigen feeding can establish oral tolerance in the mice precedingly antigen-sensitized by a non-oral route. The blockade facilitates differentiation of antigen-specific conventional T cells into CD101+ pTreg cells. Thus, continuous oral antigen administration combined with CD28 co-stimulation blockade generates CD101+ antigen-specific functionally stable pTreg cells, which can establish long-term systemic antigen-specific immune tolerance even in antigen-pre-sensitized animals.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization - loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of VEGF signaling - shows that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling.

Most genetic studies focus on DNA mutations or changes in overall gene expression levels. However, genes can also alter the form in which they are expressed through alternative splicing. Using RNA sequencing data from prenatal and postnatal human DLPFCs, we observed that many genes undergo dramatic shifts in their isoform preferences around the time of birth. We further found that thousands of genes continue to undergo gradual, temporally regulated changes in their preferred isoforms, a phenomenon we term 'isoswitching'.

One important aspect of the biotic environment is the microbiome: interactions between microbiomes and their hosts are critical for host fitness and trait expression. Hosts may adapt to their local microbiomes, and hosts may depend on interactions with microbes for adaptation to the local environment. Using Lemna minor (duckweed) as a model host organism, we examined differences in host fitness when grown in local and nonlocal microbiomes and in local and nonlocal water. We experimentally recombined duckweeds, microbes, and water from 4 different ponds around Durham, New Hampshire in well-plate microcosms in a growth chamber. Duckweed, microbe, and water source all affected microbial and duckweed growth, as well as duckweed traits. However, we observed only weak positive local adaptation that resulted in higher frond final area when duckweeds were paired with their local water and microbes. We also found that microbial growth was reduced when duckweeds were paired with microbes or water from their local site.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

In this study, ex vivo tumor emboli were generated from patient-derived cell lines cultured in a lymphatic-like environment, which was compared to 2D monolayer cultures, revealing upregulation of TNFR signaling networks, CXCL8, and immune cell chemotaxis genes. Spatial immunophenotyping of IBC patient tumors demonstrated high levels of CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).

J.; Sepulveda, H.; Villalobos Reveles, B.; Suzuki, K.; Kalunian, K. C.; Ay, F.; Boothby, M. R.; Rao, A.", "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a spontaneous systemic auto-immune condition for which the inciting factors and genetic basis are generally unknown. Although heterogeneous in its manifestations and severity, SLE involves chronic inflammation along with sustained autoantibody production. The root causes and pathophysiology of the inflammation and breaches of tolerance are incompletely understood, but neutrophils are thought to be important elements of the pathophysiology. Type I interferons (IFN) in the bloodstream and an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, are common features in many patients. Earlier work with unfractionated peripheral blood cells of SLE patients has provided evidence of increased levels of transcripts derived from transposable elements (TEs). We sought to elucidate the relative extents of de-repression of different TE classes in neutrophils of SLE patients, and to explore the relationships between the increased ISG and TE expression as well as their correlation with the severity of the SLE disease. Published RNA-seq data obtained from neutrophils (also termed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or PMN) were analyzed with pipelines designed to detect TEs in samples from 23 patients with SLE and healthy controls (n = 10). SLE samples were sub-divided into \"IFN-positive\" (IFNpos, n=12) and \"IFN-negative\" (IFNneg, n=11) patients, as defined in the original study based on gene expression analysis. An independent interferon-regulated gene signature was also determined for each sample. In PMN of IFNpos SLE patients, expression of ISGs and TE families were increased compared to healthy controls (HC) and IFNneg SLE patients. No TE families showed significantly increased expression in SLE patients pre-stratified as IFNneg. Increased expression of a majority of individually-mapped TEs correlated with upregulated expression of nearby genes. The majority (~80%) of upregulated TEs were present in introns of upregulated genes, and ~67% of these upregulated genes were ISGs. Of the ~20% of mapped TEs that were in the introns of genes whose expression did not change significantly, only ~28% were ISGs. Analyses of all SLE patients identified a strong correlation between expression of several specific TE families and disease activity assessed at the time of the visit. Detailed inspection of individually mapped TEs in the introns of ISGs showed a remarkable correlation of high TE expression with selective but partial intron retention as well as with annotated splicing alterations of the flanking exons in these ISGs. Neutrophils of SLE patients independently pre-classified as being IFNpos have increased expression of multiple TE classes and families, but this manifestation is not present in patients of the IFNneg stratum. The expression of only some TE families correlated with the disease activity, showing a complex relationship between TEs and SLE. The findings suggest a mechanistic relationship between the degree of IFN response and increased TE expression in a cell type centrally involved in SLE pathogenesis. The presence of highly expressed TEs in ISG introns, and the correlation of TE expression levels with partial intron retention and with splicing variations in adjacent exons, are unexpected findings that need to be further explored.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Resting-state (RS) electroencephalography (EEG) studies have revealed abnormal brain activity in chronic pain conditions, with anxiety and symptom duration potentially exacerbating these alterations. This study applied multivariate pattern analysis to differentiate RS-EEG signals between FM patients and healthy controls across frequency bands associated with pain processing, incorporating state and trait anxiety scores. It also examined differences between patients with short and long duration symptoms and identified the most relevant scalp regions contributing to the models. Fifty-one female participants (25 FM patients, 26 controls; aged 35-65) were included. Patients were classified into short-term (12) and long-term (13) groups. Normalized power spectral density values were extracted from EEG data and used to train machine learning classifiers, with Haufe-transformed weights computed to determine key scalp contributions. The models distinguished patients from controls with accuracies exceeding 0.70 across all frequency bands, reaching 0.99 in beta and gamma bands when anxiety was included. Symptom duration was also a relevant factor, as the model differentiated short- from long-term FM patients with accuracies up to 0.96 in beta and gamma bands. Alterations in theta power within frontal and parietal regions, along with frequency-specific contributions, highlight disrupted pain processing in FM and suggest cumulative effects of prolonged symptom duration.

Yet the cognition driving this dynamic--and its broader implications--remains poorly understood. We tested whether zebra finches use a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy by manipulating the quality of their initial nest-building or reproductive experience, showing them a conspecific demonstrator, and tracking subsequent material choices. Builder-males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly at first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms shaped decisions, identifying two asocial and two social parameters. These estimates provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed behaviour, supporting their causal role. We then used these parameters in exploratory simulations to test how choices might shift under novel payoff contexts. We found that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--was the primary driver of social material use, though higher rewards did not proportionally increase copying. These exploratory simulation results offer preliminary insight into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation.

J.; Smith, I. T.; Olson, B. S.; Alessi, A. F.; Galagali, H.; Lalk, K.; Schmidt, M. N.; Ranke, K. J.; Kim, J. K.; Karp, X.", "abstract": "The mechanisms by which developmental pathways are modulated to accommodate periods of arrest are poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans larvae that encounter adverse environments, dauer diapause can interrupt developmental progression after the second larval molt. During continuous (non-dauer) development, a heterochronic molecular timer comprised primarily of microRNAs and their targets controls the progression of stage-specific cell fates in lateral hypodermal seam cells. In unfavorable conditions, the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor and the DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor in its ligand-free state promote dauer formation and oppose the expression of let-7 family microRNAs, thus pausing developmental progression during dauer. Surprisingly, we found that daf-16(0) post-dauer adults showed reiterative heterochronic defects including missing or gapped adult alae, lack of seam-cell fusion, and reduced expression of the adult-specific col-19p::gfp marker. Consistent with these adult cell fate defects, let-7-family microRNA expression was reduced in daf-16(0) post-dauer larvae. Addition of the DAF-12 ligand, dafachronic acid, suppressed the reiterative phenotypes in daf-16(0) post-dauer animals. Notably, addition of dafachronic acid to daf-16 mutants rescued levels of let-7 family transcriptional reporters but did not affect levels of these reporters in daf-16(+) control strains. Dafachronic acid is synthesized from cholesterol, which is normally sequestered in the intestinal lumen until dauer exit. We found that a fluorescent cholesterol analog was not retained in daf-16 mutant larvae during dauer recovery. Timed auxin-mediated depletion of DAF-16 indicated that daf-16 is required before dauer formation, rather than after dauer, to prevent reiterative seam cell fates in post-dauer larvae and adults. Furthermore, depletion of DAF-16 from the intestine partially recapitulated defects in adult cell fate. Taken together, we propose a model whereby daf-16 acts prior to dauer formation to enable dafachronic acid synthesis by retaining cholesterol during dauer recovery. Ligand-bound DAF-12 then promotes dauer recovery and expression of let-7 family microRNAs, thereby promoting adult cell fate. Thus, daf-16 and daf-12 coordinate dauer exit with the resumption of a developmental pathway.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

To assess genetic diversity of Tb s.l. strains circulating in three endemic or historical HAT foci in Cote Ivoire, we conducted a population genetics study of these parasites. Biological and isolated stock samples collected from pigs and reference stocks were tested with the primers of the Trypanosoma gambiense-specific-glycoprotein gene (TgsGP) and were genetically characterized with eighteen microsatellite primers. TgsGP positive samples did not fit into Tbg as regard to their microsatellite profile.

Earlier studies revealed that Salmonella deploys ethanolamine (EA) metabolic machinery to disseminate in the intestine. Salmonella with a defect in EA metabolism manifests with lower intestinal colonization efficiency. Remarkably, the potential of EA metabolism as a therapeutic target is yet to explore. Our study revealed that supplementation of EA and vitamin B12 in both rich and minimal media enhanced biofilm formation, increased motility, and increased tolerance of Salmonella to some antibiotics. Conversely, mutants deficient in EA metabolic enzymes exhibited no physiological fitness. In Salmonella, EA metabolic enzymes are localized within a proteinaceous microcompartment (MCP) shell composed of thousands of copies of shell proteins encoded by five genes from the eut operon. Fascinatingly, bacterial cells with defective MCP shell due to mutation in the major shell proteins showed enhanced susceptibility towards a number of antibiotics in minimal media. The mutants were unable to form biofilm, produced lower curli expression and were defective in flagellar motility. Also, mutation in one of the major shell proteins reduced intramacrophagic viability of Salmonella. Notably, phenotypes were restored upon ectopic expression of corresponding genes. It was evident that mutation in the MCP shell proteins downregulated the expression of genes related to pathogenicity. Overall, this study sheds new light on understanding the relationship between EA metabolism and bacterial physiology that would pave the way for developing novel therapeutic interventions against Salmonella.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

We identified four consortia with similar taxonomic and functional profiles, but distinctly different distributions within the sedimentary layers. Microbial members common to each of these consortia included novel members of Bathyarchaeia BA1, Desulfatiglandales, Chloroflexota, Caldatribacteriota (JS1), Planctomycetota, and WOR3. The collective metabolic potential of these core consortia contained the capacity to decompose complex carbon and aromatics through syntrophic interactions. The composition and functional potential of these co-occurring members are most similar to communities inhabiting sediment hundreds of meters beneath the surface of deep-sea sediments.

This requires associating internal position estimates with external cues to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. However, how grid cell representations evolve in novel spaces to support map formation is unclear. To address this question, we longitudinally record grid cells with two-photon calcium imaging over 10 days as mice learn operant tasks in novel virtual linear tracks. We observe that spatial tuning of grid cells is present immediately in novel tracks but evolves as a significant fraction of spatial fields shift backward on a run-by-run basis, within and across days. Backward shifts are more prevalent and persistent in successful learners. The fields gradually stabilize across days, anchored by landmarks, suggesting a slow plasticity mechanism that results in an increasingly fragmented and stable map. The backward shifts partially reset daily, reflecting a slower consolidation timescale. We show that though individual fields of a cell shift differentially, co-active fields of co-modular grid cells shift together, indicating their coupled dynamics keep them on the same two-dimensional torus during this plastic period. Next, we build an entorhinal-hippocampal model that provides a mechanistic explanation of the diverse phenomena - grid field shifts, fragmentation, and increasing fidelity of the spatial map - and predicts slow Hebbian plasticity in the return hippocampus-to-entorhinal pathway. Finally, using ex vivo slice electrophysiology, we show that plasticity in an indirect hippocampus-to-MEC pathway correlates with spatial learning performance and could account for the hypothesized slow plasticity of the model. Together, our study provides multifaceted evidence of slow plasticity in synapses from the hippocampus to the MEC, elucidating the formation of stable and fragmented maps that combine internal and cue-driven positional estimates in rich environments, elucidating cognitive map formation during spatial learning.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

T.; Bazant, V.; Gago, J.", "abstract": "Understanding how tropical trees respond to complex environmental gradients is essential for predicting forest resilience under climate change. We examined variation in key leaf traits - specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, C:N and N:P ratios, and stable isotope composition (delta13C, delta15N) - in 160 tree species along a 3,200-meter elevational transect on Mount Cameroon. This gradient spans hyper-humid coastal rainforests to arid Afroalpine savannas, capturing sharp transitions in climate, soils, and forest structure. Leaf traits shifted nonlinearly with elevation, from acquisitive strategies at mid-elevations to conservative syndromes in both lowlands and highlands. Mid-elevation forests (approximately 1,000-1,500 m), characterized by moderate climate and canopy disturbance by elephants, supported nutrient-rich, high-SLA foliage. In contrast, high-elevation forests above 2,000 m exhibited low SLA, high C:N ratios, and enriched delta13C, consistent with stress tolerance under cold, dry, and fire-prone conditions. The strongest phosphorus limitation occurred in hyper-humid lowlands, where extreme rainfall (greater than 12,000 mm per year) drives leaching losses. Foliar delta15N declined markedly with elevation (from +5 per mil to -5 per mil), indicating a shift from mineral nitrogen uptake and nitrogen fixation in lowland Fabaceae to ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal associations in montane Ericaceae. A bimodal delta15N pattern - enrichment in both lowland and upper montane forests - reflects nitrogen fixation under leaching and fire-driven nitrogen scarcity. Phylogenetic analyses showed that climate, soils, forest structure, and lineage jointly shaped trait-environment relationships. Traits related to delta13C, C:N, and delta15N exhibited strong phylogenetic signal, highlighting evolutionary constraints. These findings underscore the value of integrating functional traits, isotopes, and phylogeny to predict tropical forest responses to global change.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Genes encode proteins whose functions are tightly coupled to their three-dimensional structures via non-bonded interactions. Since the late 1970s, the advent of macromolecular crystallography inspired the notion that structural knowledge alone could enable a \"lock-and-key\" approach to drug design. However, this framework has failed to catalyze a step-change in the generation of new chemical matter. Drug discovery continues to depend on costly and largely serendipitous screening campaigns. Our understanding of, and reasoning from, non-bonded interaction chemistry is still too limited. Compounding this is the scarcity of novel chemistry and infinitesimal coverage of the chemical combinatorial space by current experimental data. To alleviate these problems, we show that a machine learning model can successfully learn and infer the principles of non-bonded interactions in the drug-receptor space. A reductionist approach to training data led to a model generalizing drug-target interactions to truly novel chemical matter without suffering from memorization bias.

Yet information on the spectra themselves are already encoded in the data and do not require pre-calibration. What is more, efficient photon-by-photon analyses are possible reducing both the required photon budget and making it possible to use larger budgets in order to discriminate small differences in spectra to resolve spatially co-localized fluorophore species. To achieve this, we propose a Bayesian S-FLIM framework capable of simultaneously learning spectra and lifetimes photon-by-photon ultimately using limited photon counts and being highly data efficient.

Green fluorescent protein-autophagy-related gene 8 (GFP-Atg8) processing assay revealed a significant defect in the macroautophagic activity of the cho1{Delta} mutant, regardless of the presence or absence of ethanolamine (Etn). Notably, autophagosomes were absent in the cytosol, and macroautophagic bodies were not observed in the vacuoles of the starved cho1{Delta} mutant, underscoring the essential role of PtdSer synthesized using Cho1 in autophagosome biogenesis. In contrast, numerous microautophagic vesicles containing lipid droplets were observed in the vacuoles of cho1{Delta} mutants starved in the presence of Etn, suggesting the crucial role of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) synthesized via the Kennedy pathway in microautophagic lipophagy when PtdSer synthesis using Cho1 is disrupted. Given recent evidence pointing to the involvement of the ubiquitination system in various autophagy-related processes, we also examined the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 gene ubc4. Moreover, microautophagic lipophagy was significantly diminished in starved cho1{Delta} yeast with ubc4 knockout.

Mutations in the human Jagged1 (Jag1) gene, which encodes a ligand of the Notch receptor, cause Alagille syndrome--an autosomal dominant disorder frequently associated with congenital heart diseases (CHDs) such as Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nTo investigate the role of Jag1 in cardiac development, we generated Jag1flox/flox Islet1-cre+ mice with a conditional deletion of the Jag1 gene in the cardiac outflow tract. Mice carrying this targeted deletion exhibited severe cardiac malformations characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot. The predominant defect observed was a double outlet right ventricle (DORV), in which both the aorta and pulmonary trunk arise from the right ventricle. This abnormality was consistently associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), present in 100% of homozygous mutants. Additional defects included abnormalities in the morphology of atrioventricular and semilunar valves, most commonly presenting as myxomatous mitral valves or altered leaflet numbers.\n\nSince Islet1 is also expressed in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, we employed optical mapping to visualize the cardiac conduction system. Analysis of E14.5 embryos and adult mice revealed altered activation patterns. While control hearts displayed a mature apex-to-base activation with conduction through both bundle branches, mutant embryos exhibited abnormal activation initiating exclusively from the left ventricle, indicating right bundle branch block (RBBB). In adult heterozygotes, electrical activation was asynchronous and often originated from ectopic sites, particularly in the posterior ventricular wall, deviating from the normal apical initiation observed in controls.\n\nFor functional analysis, we employed high-resolution ultrasound (Vevo imaging) on adult heterozygotes, as homozygotes did not survive postnatally. Most hemodynamic parameters showed no significant changes, suggesting early compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output under compromised conditions. However, speckle-tracking strain analysis identified localized contractile defects and mechanical dyssynchrony, particularly affecting the anterior wall.\n\nIn summary, our study demonstrates that conditional deletion of Jag1 leads to both morphological and electrophysiological abnormalities in the heart. These defects were evident in both homozygous and heterozygous embryos, with adult heterozygotes displaying persistent electrophysiological and mechanical alterations.

The original model of physical-chemical mechanisms [5] underlying the FLASH effect was modified to include a two-compartment (aqueous/lipid) system to take into account key interfacial reactions, and the pulsed nature of the beam. Materials and Methods: The model predictions were tested by showing a linear correlation between experimentally measured biological outcomes reported in the literature and the final hydroperoxyl lipid [LOOH]f predicted by the model for the different irradiation timing patterns and oxygen concentrations. Results: The primary, carbon-centered lipid radical [L*] fades away in less than 5 ms, reproducing the experimental observation. The model predicts a linear correlation of [LOOH]f with the inverse of the square root of the dose rate, as experimentally observed. The predicted [LOOH]f correlates with the recognition ratio of mice irradiated at different dose rates and oxygen concentrations; with zebrafish embryos mean body length for different beam timing structures; with mouse skin toxicity even with dose splitting; and with the survival of mice for different doses per pulse and average dose rates. Conclusions: The proposed radio-kinetic model attempts to synthesize the experimental results for different beam timing patterns. It successfully shows a correlation between the predicted [LOOH]f and the experimentally observed biological outcomes following irradiation with different dose rates, beam timing structures and oxygen concentrations.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

This system begins with the controlled differentiation of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which can proliferate and generate all types of mature blood cells. Identifying the underlying factors and mechanisms that allow HSPCs to differentiate and proliferate is an essential issue in stem cell biology and tissue homeostasis; disruptions in these processes can cause severe diseases. A transcriptomic screen of hematopoietic-supportive zebrafish stromal tissues identified rapunzel5 (rpz5) was likely involved in vertebrate hematopoiesis. We performed loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish embryos at the one-cell-stage with morpholinos to determine if blood cell production was affected by rpz5. rpz5 knockdown resulted in reduced amounts of red blood cells, myeloid cells, and thrombocytes, and adding back exogenous rpz5 rescued these deficiencies. Further analysis with methylcellulose assays indicated that there was also a significant reduction in HSPCs following rpz5 reduction. Together, these findings suggest that zebrafish rpz5 is essential for normal formation, differentiation, and proliferation of HSPCs, specifically down the erythroid and myeloid pathway. Fully understanding the roles of novel genes such as rpz5 is essential for understanding the evolution of vertebrate hematopoiesis and for treating hematological diseases in the future.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

To investigate how legumes regulate immune responses through post-translational mechanisms during the infection, we focused on Cyclophilin A (CyPA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase. The model legume Lotus japonicus encodes three canonical CyPA genes. Among them, LjCyPA1 was characterized through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout analysis and shown to be important for normal intracellular infection of compatible rhizobia. A gain-of-function LjCyPA1 variant in a soybean cultivar was able to promote symbiosis with not only compatible but also incompatible rhizobia. Structural modeling followed by genetic analysis demonstrated a functional interaction between LjCyPA1 and the immune hub protein LjRIN4. The cis conformation of LjRIN4 promoted intracellular rhizobial infection, while the trans conformation suppressed it. LjCyPA1 acted with the rhizobial type III secretion system (T3SS) which exhibited a cooperative role between host and symbiont in facilitating infection. Phylogenomic analysis showed that conservation of the CyPA1 orthologue is correlated with the trait of intracellular infection in legumes.

Hcrt reactive T-cells have been identified in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of NT1 patients. However, it remains unknown whether T-cells infiltrate the brain. Since T-cells can be a lifelong retained in tissues as tissue resident memory T-cells after primary antigen exposure, we now systematically studied CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in NT1 brains to determine their regional distribution and potential autoimmune involvement in NT1 neuropathology. In post-mortem brain tissue of NT1 patients (n=5) and matched controls (n=5) we immunohistochemically stained and quantified CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in the Hcrt region, paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and median eminence (ME) as well as in the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC). To phenotypic characterization of those CD4+ T-cells, we performed double staining with CD49a or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6). Furthermore, we stained for fibrinogen to estimate blood-brain barrier integrity, microglia markers and an astrocyte marker to evaluate acute immune reactivities in the Hcrt region of NT1. In NT1 there was a 11-folds increase in total CD4+ T-cells in the Hcrt region, but not in other hypothalamic regions, the PVN, ME, nor SN or LC. These CD4+ T-cells exhibited tissue residential memory features with double staining with CD49a or CXCR6. There was no changes in blood-brain barrier integrity, microglia and astrocyte between NT1 and controls. In addition, the total number of CD4 T-cells in the Hcrt region showed significant negative correlations with mean sleep latency in NT1 cases. Our findings suggest an enrichment of CD4+ T-cells specifically in the Hcrt region of NT1 indicating prior local antigen engagement. Moreover, greater CD4 T-cell presence in the Hcrt region of NT1 was associated with increased symptom severity, as reflected by shorter sleep latency.

Transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium across extended regions of the axon, and calcium mediated disintegration of cytoskeletal elements is one of the main causes of this neurodegeneration. When axonal damage involves complete transection of axons, any recovery has to be driven by the formation of fresh motile tips (growth-cones). However, axons could also undergo partial damage where the axonal plasma membrane retains its continuity while cytoskeletal elements undergo extensive disintegration triggered by elevated free calcium. We invoke such a condition using a partial laser ablation technique, and we show that complete axonal recovery, mainly mediated by microtubule regrowth, is possible in such cases when extracellular calcium is depleted. This method allows us to explore the dynamics of cytoskeletal damage after injury and the modes of recovery of microtubules and actin filaments.

Here, we investigated the heritability of OB volume and the broader olfactory network architecture in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 941; aged 22-35 years), including monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. Using a deep learning-based segmentation model, we first automatically segmented OB volumes and then employed a support vector machine framework to classify zygosity based on within-pair morphological similarity. The OB volume alone showed weak classification performance in distinguishing between monozygotic and dizygotic twins, suggesting limited heritability. However, integrating OB volume with morphometric features from olfactory-associated brain regions, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortices, substantially improved classification performance.

Despite numerous insights, the mechanism by which phenotypic heterogeneity is generated within the population and leads to colistin heteroresistance has been unclear. Here, using a transposon-based mutagenesis screen, we identify the sigma factor {sigma}E as the source of heterogeneity in population-wide colistin resistance levels. Single-cell tracking experiments revealed that {sigma}E is active in only one percent of the population at baseline, and only those cells with active {sigma}E survive colistin exposure. However, {sigma}E expression and population heterogeneity are insufficient for survival, as a mutant lacking the PhoPQ two-component system controlling lipid A modifications necessary for colistin resistance retains heterogeneity but loses colistin resistance.

However, interpreting how evolutionary processes shape genomic patterns can be challenging: repeatability of genotype-environment association alone is not strong evidence for selection, as such patterns could also occur at loci that originally differentiated between the parental species due to drift. On the other hand, repeated directional patterns of introgression, where an allele typical of one species moves far into the range of the other, are unlikely to occur due to drift and therefore provide stronger evidence of natural selection. Here we compared hybridization and local adaptation patterns between two replicated regions within the western Canada interior spruce hybrid zone: broad latitudinal transects with gradual environmental variation and narrow elevational transects with steep environmental contrasts. Despite differences in geography and selective pressures, the two regions revealed strikingly similar genome-wide patterns of differentiation and adaptation. Genomic clines analyses confirmed this trend, uncovering consistent patterns of directional introgression between transect types. The strong similarity in differentiation, environmental adaptation and directional introgression between replicated hybrid zones is unlikely under an entirely drift-driven process, suggesting that selection plays an important role in shaping hybridization patterns between Picea glauca and P. engelmannii. Consistent with hybridization theory, we found longer introgressed genomic tracts in the elevational transects, likely because steep environmental gradients over short distances restrict recombination preserving larger ancestry blocks in the genome.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that Ds-Fat signaling shapes the wing during the larval stage, rather than during pupal development when morphogenetic rearrangements transform the developing wing disc into the adult wing. We further find that Ds-Fat alters tissue wide stresses in the wing disc, and genetic manipulations that reduce cytoskeletal tension result in rounder wings, whereas increasing cytoskeletal tension produces more elongated wings. Reduced tension is also associated with less oriented growth during development. Notably, increased cytoskeletal tension partially rescues the rounder shape caused by ds knockdown.

An important component of such models is to account for spatial structure, since plant hosts are immobile and a majority of disease spread will often be localised. Here we apply a lattice-based mathematical modelling approach, a pair approximation, to model disease spread. While this method has previously been used to develop epidemiological theory, it has not been used to predict spread in a specific pathosystem. We fit our lattice-based epidemiological model to experimental data relating to Bahia bark scaling of citrus, an economically-important disease in north-eastern Brazil, and compare its performance to a more commonly used dispersal-kernel modelling approach. We show that the lattice-based model fits the data well, predicting a significant degree of near-neighbour infections, with similar estimated values of epidemiologically-meaningful parameters to the dispersal model. We highlight the pros and cons of the lattice-based approach and discuss how it may be used to predict disease spread and optimise control of plant diseases.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Using this platform, we measured an average metabolic output of ~256 nW per brain in female, 10-day-old Drosophila flies. Notably, female brains exhibited significantly higher metabolic activity than male brains at a young age (10-day-old). Furthermore, in parkin mutants, used to model Parkinsons disease, homozygous mutant brains showed a ~15% reduction in metabolic output relative to heterozygous controls, consistent with impaired mitochondrial function. We further extended our measurements to other Drosophila tissues, demonstrating that mass-normalized metabolic rates of ovaries and testes are ~2.5-fold lower compared to brains in Drosophila, highlighting the brain's exceptional energy demands.

We present TCUP, an ensemble learning framework that combines Contrastive Autoencoders (CAE) and Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) with base classifiers and a meta-learning layer to classify and interpret CUP, adding biological insight through Monte-Carlo ablations. Methods: Gene-expression data from TCGA (tumour), GTEx (normal), and the Genome Sciences Centre (metastatic) were imputed, log-transformed, and SMOTE-balanced. A SNN and CAE learned pairwise and reconstruction embeddings. Multiple base classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) generated meta-features, which a meta-learner combined for final prediction. Monte-Carlo ablation iterations were performed to assess gene-level importance. Results: TCUP achieved 98.3 % accuracy (F1 = 98.3) across all tissues. In metastatic BRCA, COAD, and PAAD it reached 86.7 % accuracy. Ablation highlighted 79 key contributors, including established tumour suppressors NKX6-1 and SOX30 and the less-studied SYTL1. PCA confirmed clearer separation in embedded space. Conclusion: TCUP delivers high tissue-of-origin accuracy and CUP assignment while providing interpretable gene importance that clarifies tissue differences and metastatic drivers.

However, there are ongoing challenges in assembling complex genomic regions, particularly those associated with genetic disorders. Moreover, assemblies of non-model organisms are often limited by the amount of DNA that can be extracted, so reducing the data modalities that can be obtained. Here, we introduce NOVOLoci, a haplotype-aware assembler capable of high-quality targeted and whole-genome assemblies, despite the relatively high error rates of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) data. By adopting a novel seed-extension approach with iterative conflict resolution, it achieves accurate haplotype phasing, thus overcoming a critical limitation of current graph-based assemblers. Benchmarking shows that NOVOLoci consistently outperforms the four leading assembly tools across five clinically relevant genomic disorder loci by delivering accurately phased assemblies with superior contiguity and completeness, even compared with hybrid assemblers that combine PacBio and ONT sequencing reads (nearly triple the N90 value compared with Verkko hybrid). We demonstrate its broader utility in assembling the genome of a highly heterozygous non-model animal Oikopleura dioica, whose small size limits the amount of DNA available from an individual. Using data only from a single ONT flow cell, NOVOLoci assembles a phased diploid genome with high contiguity and a 32-fold increase in N50 values compared with existing methods. NOVOLoci's distinct algorithmic strategy demonstrates that substantial advances in genome assembly can still be made.

This handedness switching arises from light-dependent modulation of flagellar beating, including changes in beat extension, phase, and--crucially--beat plane orientation. Using high-speed imaging and hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal that this beat plane reorientation is critical for Chlamydomonas to swim orthogonally to light as well as to dynamically modulate its trajectory curvature, enabling transitions between global exploration and localized searching in spatially structured light fields.

While increases in ploidy are well-characterised, the opposite phenomenon--extensive chromosome loss leading to hypodiploidy--remains underexplored. Here, we analyse over 17,000 cancer genomes from 34 cancer types and perform a pan-cancer analysis of karyotypic evolution in hypodiploid tumours. We find that hypodiploidy is widespread and associated with a generalised chromosomal instability phenotype, marked by significantly elevated rates of genome doubling, intrachromosomal copy number alterations, chromothripsis, and intra-tumour heterogeneity. These tumours are hypoxic and strongly enriched for TP53 mutations. However, we also identify a subset of cancer--acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), kidney chromophobe, and adrenocortical carcinoma--that exhibit stable hypodiploidy, with stereotyped chromosome loss patterns, low chromosomal instability, and distinct evolutionary origins. We exploit this stability to develop a simple method of distinguishing poor-prognosis masked hypodiploid from good-prognosis hyperdiploid ALL using only cytogenetic data, enabling more precise risk stratification. Finally, we show that hypodiploidy predicts poor prognosis across cancers. Genome doubling does not confer a fitness advantage in low-hypodiploid tumours, nor do these tumours evolve to avoid loss of dosage-sensitive genes. Together, these findings provide the first pan-cancer characterization of hypodiploidy as a widespread and clinically relevant phenomenon often driven by pervasive chromosomal instability, and illustrate the remarkable ability of cancer cells to tolerate and evolve under extreme dosage imbalance.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Five GPCRs mediate the effects of endogenous dopamine and compounds used to treat Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and other conditions. However, on-target side effects associated with these medications highlight the need to analyze dopamine receptor signaling to design safer, more effective therapeutics. We characterized the G protein coupling of dopamine D2-like receptors and observed the striking inability of D3R to engage with Gi proteins while effectively activating Go and Gz subtypes. Applying orthogonal cell-based assays that utilize wild-type G proteins both in parental and {Delta}Gi/o/z cells, we conclusively established that D3R does not activate Gi proteins. Further analysis of Gi2:GoA and D2R:D3R chimeras revealed that this selective inability is driven by molecular determinants located within the 5 helix of Gi and the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) of D3R. Guided by cryo-EM structures, we modeled the interface between these regions to better understand the structural basis of this selectivity.

In this study, we identify CD300LG as a crucial receptor for TRLs. Human genetic analyses reveal that reduced CD300LG protein levels are causally linked with CAD risk and increased number, diameter, and TAG concentration of TRLs. In mice, CD300LG deficiency results in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia independent of changes in VLDL secretion, intestinal lipid absorption, or lipoprotein lipase activity. Mechanistically, CD300LG acts as a receptor for TRLs through a direct interaction with ApoA4 to facilitate TRL clearance at the microvascular endothelium.

Traditionally, two main modeling approaches have been followed, using either comprehensive models recapitulating most molecular actors involved, or minimal qualitative models highlighting the core mechanisms. However, analyzing the behavior of large models may be difficult, and small models often lack predictive power, questioning their relevance. Through a systematic reduction of a more complex model, we obtain a simple three-gene clock model, featuring the activator Bmal1, the repressor Reverb and the inhibitor Cry, that accurately describes the corresponding temporal expression profiles for the mouse hepatic clock. We characterize this model by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for its limit cycle, as well as by computing phase response curves for the different possible inputs.

Using experimental recordings of the nematode C. elegans, we validated normative model predictions of this optimal encoding strategy, specifically how neural dynamics and adaptation levels vary with stimulus timing. A parametric Bayesian decoder architecture predicted conditions leading to behavioral habituation or invariance, but also paradoxical inversion, whereby appetitive stimuli elicit aversive responses.

To elucidate the dynamic role of -MSH release in regulating appetite, specific, sensitive, and spatiotemporally resolved genetic sensors are required. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) scaffold was leveraged for its robust plasma membrane expression, high affinity for melanocortin peptides and low affinity for AgRP to design a -MSH selective sensor for in vivo use. This was achieved by integrating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into the receptor, which we named Fluorescence Amplified Receptor sensor for Melanocortin (FLAREMC). The FLAREMC sensor shows high potency and selectivity in heterologous and homologous expressing cells for -MSH and the synthetic melanocortin agonist MTII but not to the inverse agonist AgRP. The sensor exhibited impaired signaling, with reduced G protein activation, no {beta}-arrestin coupling, and failed to internalize upon agonist stimulation. In vitro, FLAREMC displayed high photostability and reversible photoactivation. These properties suggest that the FLAREMC is suitable for long-term activity recording in the brain without desensitizing or interfering with endogenous melanocortin receptor signaling. When expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the mouse hypothalamus, the primary site of anorexigenic -MSH signaling, FLAREMC demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting changes associated with melanocortin responses in vivo.

Visual stimuli that alternate according to randomized temporal patterns can also result in predictable EEG patterns. While such EEG responses are robust and predictable, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that shape these responses are not fully understood. To better understand the relationship between the stimuli and associated EEG responses, and ultimately inform a biophysical model, we examine these relationships using EEG data from a controlled experiment. We model the EEG using several statistical time series models with components that loosely mimic biophysical mechanics: an autoregressive (AR) model, with an exogenous input (ARX), adding moving average terms (ARMAX), and a seasonality term (SARMAX). We fit these models using the Box-Jenkins methodology and assess EEG forecast performance for a relatively long period of several seconds out-of-sample. We find in-sample fits are good in all models despite the complexities of the visual pathway, and that all models can capture aspects of out-of-sample EEG, including the distribution of values (point-wise in time), the point-wise Pearson's correlation of EEG and model, and the frequency content. Surprisingly, we find little variation in the performance of all models, with the most sophisticated and detailed model (SARMAX) performing comparatively poorly in some instances. Taken together, our results suggest the simplest AR model is valuable because it is easy to understand and can perform just as well as more complicated models. Since these models are relatively simple and more transparent than contemporary predictive models with numerous parameters, our study may provide insights into the biological mechanisms of the temporal dynamics of human EEG response that could generalize to other visual stimuli.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

While FDA approved immunotherapies slow cognitive decline in some individuals with AD, they do not improve cognition, are costly, and have significant side-effects. Therefore, new targets, approaches, and treatments for AD are a necessity. There are no FDA approved therapies for AD that target the brains lymphatic system. It is well established that the toxic protein, amyloid-beta (AB), accumulates in the AD brain. Recent studies have shown that AB is cleared via interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid through a pathway involving the glymphatic system-meningeal lymphatic vessels-leading to deep and superficial cervical lymphatic vessels and nodes. Therefore, any blockage along this route can cause inefficient drainage and result in pathological buildup of AB, which can lead to AD. Here, we propose a new approach to treating AD by manual lymph drainage (MLD), which is a light skin massage traditionally used to reduce fluid accumulation in lymphedema. This therapy has also been demonstrated to be safe in individuals with AD, but its effects on cognition and biomarkers of AD has never been investigated. In this study we demonstrate that repeated MLD of the head and neck, including the superficial cervical lymphatic vessels (scLVs), improves cognitive function in AD as measured in both the Y-maze and nest-building tests. We also show that this coincides with a reduction in plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a non-specific biomarker for neuronal cell death and axonal damage. MLD was also shown to reduce AB in the hippocampus of these mice.

Heat shock protein expression changes suggested proteotoxic stress and impaired protein quality control, with some findings conserved in a previously reported Drosophila melanogaster model of DRPLA. These transcriptomic signatures expand our understanding of molecular events related to degeneration in DRPLA and may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Predictive computational models enable the identification of RBP binding sites from RNA sequences in silico, complementing experimental assays. We previously developed a PTBP1 binding model based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that utilized overlapping nucleotide triplets but was limited due to the assumption of independence between triplets. In this study, we present an improved PTBP1 binding model using Transcription Factor Flexible Models (TFFMs), which relax this assumption and accommodate flexible-length motifs. Trained on PTBP1 CLIP-seq data from HeLa cells, the TFFM-based approach captures positional dependencies among nucleotides, consistent with known PTBP1 binding motifs, and achieves improved predictive performance. The updated model shows a stronger correlation with experimental binding affinities (r = -0.95) compared to the previous HMM (r = -0.91) and maintains specificity by correctly scoring non-binding RNA substrates. This work highlights the advantage of flexible, context-aware modeling frameworks in predicting RBP-RNA interactions and offers a more accurate tool for studying PTBP1 binding specificity.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Most current generative models operate on simplified backbone-only representations. However, in vivo and in vitro protein folding and function are largely mediated by amino acid sidechains. Given this biochemical relevance, we ask: what happens when sidechain and sequence information are introduced into a protein generative model? To address this, we developed SiBaSe, a novel generative model that simultaneously co-designs sidechains, backbones, and sequence. SiBaSe achieves design performance approaching that of state-of-the-art backbone-only models. However, analysis of design patterns reveals that, despite access to sidechain data, the model behaves similarly to a backbone-based model. This appears to arise from uncertainties in the simultaneous modeling of sequence and sidechains that are inherent to flow-based architectures and offers new insight into architectural limitations and opportunities for improving generative protein design", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

While cooperative interactions in septin assembly have been suggested, the molecular mechanisms governing membrane binding and assembly remain unclear. Building on prior findings, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine how single and paired extended AH domains, derived from Cdc12, interact with lipid bilayers. A single membrane-bound AH adopts a curved conformation. In solution, a second AH peptide preferentially interacts with the bound peptide through conserved salt bridges, favoring an antiparallel arrangement. Simulations of covalently linked AH tandems confirm this configuration. Dual membrane-bound peptides induce lipid packing defects, reduce tail order, and exhibit slight membrane displacement, suggesting curved membranes may better accommodate multiple AH domains.

The loading of PCNA onto DNA is catalyzed by the ATPase clamp loader RFC. Using a single-molecule platform to visualize the dynamic interplay between PCNA and RFC on DNA, we unexpectedly discovered that RFC continues to associate with PCNA after loading, contrary to the conventional view. Functionally, this clamp-loader/clamp complex is required for processive DNA synthesis by polymerase (Pol), as the PCNA-Pol assembly is inherently unstable. This architectural role of RFC is dependent on the BRCT domain of Rfc1, and mutation of its DNA-binding residues causes sensitivity to DNA damage in vivo. We further showed the FEN1 flap endonuclease can also stabilize the PCNA-Pol interaction and mediate robust synthesis. Overall, our work revealed that, beyond their canonical enzymatic functions, PCNA-binding proteins harbor non-catalytic functions essential for DNA replication and genome maintenance.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Risk is often underestimated or overestimated due to reliance on population-level data and neglect of cellular aging and mechanobiological alterations. Methods: We profiled primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) from women of varying ages and risk backgrounds using mechano-node-pore sensing (mechano-NPS), a high-throughput microfluidic platform that captures single-cell mechanical properties. Using machine learning, we developed a classifier, MechanoAge, to predict age-related mechanical phenotypes and introduce a novel index, mechano-RISQ, to quantify deviations linked to breast cancer risk. We further assessed the cytoskeletal protein keratin 14 (KRT14) as a molecular mediator of these mechanical states through overexpression and knockdown experiments. Findings: Cells from younger women carrying BRCA1/2 mutations or with a family history of breast cancer exhibited accelerated mechanical aging compared to age-matched controls. Elevated mechano-RISQ scores reflected an increased proportion of cells with \"older\" mechanical profiles. KRT14 overexpression induced an aged mechanical phenotype in younger cells, while knockdown partially reversed this state in older cells. CyTOF profiling and modeling showed KRT14 modulation impacted protein expression signatures associated with aging and risk, particularly in luminal cells. Interpretation: Mechanical properties of breast epithelial cells reflect biologic aging and cancer susceptibility. Mechano-RISQ offers a new approach for identifying individuals at elevated risk, especially among average-risk populations, and may complement existing risk models by incorporating biophysical measures of epithelial aging.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we present SpheroMap Cytometry, an innovative spatial flow cytometry method that enables high-resolution analysis of spatially organized cellular phenotypes within spheroids. CAPAN-1 pancreatic tumor cells and either HS-5 bone marrow stromal or umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) were co-cultured in ultra-low-adhesion 96-well plates. After 48 hours aggregation, spheroids were incubated with Image-iT Green Hypoxia to mark hypoxic cells, and after 72 hours spheroids were dissociated and stained with antibodies against CD73 and CD140B. SpheroMap Cytometry revealed that the hypoxic core was significantly enriched for CD73+ and myCAF-like populations (CD140BCD73high), indicating a functional link between hypoxia and this CAF subpopulation. Moreover, while hypoxia alone was sufficient to drive myCAF differentiation in heterotypic and monotypic spheroids, we found that normoxic induction of myCAF occurred only in the presence of tumor cells supporting the hypothesis that proximity to tumor cells synergizes with hypoxia to regulate CAF differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that hypoxia drives a distinct stromal architecture in PDAC.

Most environmental behavior research focuses on Western or large developing countries, leaving significant gaps in understanding small developing nations with unique cultural frameworks. Objective This study explored youth perceptions, communication preferences, and content effectiveness for waste management education within Bhutan's Buddhist collectivist culture, addressing identified research gaps in small developing countries. Methods A convergent mixed-methods design combined quantitative surveys (n=185) with qualitative interviews (n=10) at Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School in Thimphu, Bhutan. The theoretical framework integrated Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Learning Theory, Diffusion of Innovations Theory, and Community-Based Social Marketing principles. Results Students demonstrated exceptionally high environmental awareness (99.5%) and positive attitudes toward waste separation (mean scores 4.4-4.8 on 5-point scales). Social media emerged as the overwhelmingly preferred communication channel (78.4%), with videos being the most engaging content format (81.6%). Key barriers included time constraints (61.6%), infrastructure limitations (51.9%), and motivational challenges (46.5%). Notably, social influence showed only moderate impact (mean=3.7), lower than typically found in collectivist cultures. Qualitative analysis revealed five themes: shared responsibility burdens, engagement sustainability challenges, system effectiveness limitations, civic values education needs, and institutional support requirements. Conclusions Bhutanese youth show strong environmental awareness coupled with distinct motivational patterns where environmental behavior appears more individually driven than typically found in collectivist cultures, suggesting Buddhist values of personal responsibility create unique frameworks. Digital communication channels, particularly video content through social media, offer promising avenues for environmental education. A multifaceted approach combining improved infrastructure, educational reinforcement, and culturally-appropriate communication strategies is essential for promoting sustainable waste management practices among youth in similar contexts.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed considerable inconsistencies in how fatigue and motor learning were defined and measured. None of the studies examined the effect of fatigue induced by combined physical and cognitive exertion, and only 27% investigated fatigue induced by cognitive exertion. Acuity tasks were the most frequently used to assess motor learning, employed in 59% of the studies. Notably, all participants were between 19 and 31 years of age, and reporting of key demographic and physiological characteristics such as sex, gender, physical activity level, and body mass index was inconsistent or absent. This review highlights the need for comprehensive definitions of both fatigue and motor learning to improve consistency and reproducibility across studies. Given the limited research on the effects of fatigue induced by cognitive and combined physical and cognitive exertion, future studies should prioritize using these experimental manipulations.

Animal studies suggest that VNS delivered during motor skill practice drives task-specific plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1), but direct evidence in humans has been lacking. Here, we provide the first demonstration that taVNS paired with motor skill practice selectively enhances cortical plasticity without boosting motor performance beyond practice alone during short-term training. Thirty-one healthy right-handed adults practiced a novel implicit motor task, rotating two balls with the non-dominant hand for 15 minutes. Participants were randomized to receive taVNS to the left tragus or sham stimulation during practice. Motor performance, M1 hand representation (TMS mapping), and spinal excitability (F-wave) were assessed pre- and post-practice, while pupil diameter was continuously monitored as an index of noradrenergic activity. Motor performance improved similarly in both groups, whereas cortical map expansion was significantly greater in the taVNS group than in the sham group. F-wave amplitude increased only in the sham group, suggesting that taVNS-driven plasticity was restricted to cortical circuits. Moreover, taVNS uniquely elicited pupil dilation during practice, consistent with noradrenergic system engagement. These findings reveal that taVNS can promote task-specific cortical reorganization in humans independent of immediate behavioral improvement. By linking taVNS-induced plasticity to noradrenergic modulation and dissociating cortical from spinal effects, this study provides novel mechanistic insight into how taVNS may lay the neural groundwork for enhanced motor recovery, with critical implications for neurorehabilitation.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have suggested that changes in regional brain GABA signaling contribute to these effects, but empirical neurophysiological evidence remains limited. Methods: We investigated the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of tVNS (200 microsecond pulses at 20 Hz, alternating 30 s ON, 1 s OFF cycles, 30 min total duration) in healthy adults using two experimental paradigms. In Experiment 1, GABA levels were measured in the left striatum (STR), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sensorimotor cortex (SM) of 34 participants by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before and after ipsilateral tVNS. In Experiment 2, 28 participants performed a right-hand force-control motor learning task before, during, and after tVNS. Results: Administration of tVNS significantly reduced GABA levels in the left STR compared to sham stimulation (p < 0.05), and also significantly improved motor task performance compared to the sham group at 10 minutes after stimulus onset (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Transcutaneous VNS may facilitate early-phase motor learning by reducing striatal GABA levels and consequently inducing corticobasal circuit disinhibition.

A.", "abstract": "Sensory neuron spiking responses vary across repeated presentations of the same stimuli, but whether this trial-to-trial variability represents noise versus unidentified signals remains unresolved. Some of the variability can be attributed to correlations between neural activity and arousal, locomotion, and other overt movements. We hypothesized that correlations with global activity factors, i.e., patterns of neural activity observable in other brain regions, may explain additional variability in spike count responses of visual cortical neurons. To test this, we used Neuropixels 2.0 probes to record neural activity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) while subjects passively viewed images. We recorded videos of behavior alongside neural activity from other brain regions, either spiking activity of neural populations in anterior cingulate area (ACA) or widefield calcium signals from across the dorsal cortex. We then used a model based on reduced rank regression to partition the explainable variability of visual cortical responses by source. Some of the trial-to-trial variability in V1 spike counts was attributable to locally shared patterns of activity uncorrelated with either behavior or global activity patterns. Locally shared activity patterns explained trial-to-trial variability that was in excess of Poisson spike generation. Of the parts of variability attributable to non-local sources, global cortical activity predicted significantly more V1 spike count variability than behavioral factors. Additionally, behavioral factors explained little variability uniquely and comprised a geometric subspace of the globally predictable V1 activity. Finally, optogenetically perturbing ACA directly impacted V1 activity, and ACA activity patterns predicted V1 spike count variability even on trials without overt behaviors. Our data indicate that globally shared factors from other cortical areas contribute substantially to shared spike count variability in V1, with only a minority of shared variability confined to local V1 circuits.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

We show that functional connectivity gradients arising from network activity closely match the geometric eigenmodes of the network's spatial embedding when neurons are locally connected. By systematically varying network parameters such as the connectivity radius and the prevalence of long-range connections introduced via edge swaps, we reveal a robust geometry-function correspondence that progressively deteriorates as local connectivity is disrupted. Additionally, we demonstrate that spatial filtering can artificially impose geometric structure on functional gradients, even at modest levels. To support our computational results, we conduct volumetric calcium imaging experiments at cellular resolution in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. We uncover cellular functional gradients that closely align with geometric eigenmodes up to a certain eigenmode wavelength that reflects the spatial extent of neuronal arborizations measured in single-neuron reconstructions, as predicted by our simulations.

While prior work has shown that large-scale brain activity reflects attention, the mechanism governing this association in a time-varying and task-dependent manner remains unknown. Here, we tested a hypothesis that the geometry of neural dynamics on the attractor landscape, or the movement along the \"hills and valleys\", reflects changes in attentional states over time and variations across controlled and naturalistic contexts. We fit a parametric dynamical systems model to fMRI data collected during rest, task performance, and naturalistic movie-watching. The model decomposes neural dynamics into components that are intrinsic versus extrinsically driven by stimuli. Model parameters were biologically meaningful, reflecting both cognitive states and individual differences. Model simulations revealed a set of attractors that mirrored functional brain networks, spanning the canonical gradient from sensorimotor to default mode network regions. The speed and direction of neural trajectories toward these attractors systematically varied across attentional states in a context-dependent manner. When participants were paying attention to effortful tasks, neural dynamics converged directly toward a task-relevant attractor, suggesting that it occupied a steeper region of the attractor landscape. In contrast, when participants were engaged in sitcom episodes, neural dynamics were in a flattened region of the landscape, directed away from the attractors. These findings demonstrate that while the positions of the attractors are largely determined by the cortical organization, the geometry of neural dynamics on the attractor landscape changes systematically across attentional states and situational contexts.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Due to the conceptual overlap between these two constructs, successful performance on visual working memory tasks may rely on the use of visual imagery to rehearse items during the retention interval. Consequently, individuals with aphantasia, who lack voluntary visual imagery, may experience difficulties with such tasks. However, prior research has suggested that some individuals with aphantasia might employ non-visual strategies to compensate for this deficit. In two experiments, we examined visual working memory performance in aphantasic and control participants across a range of stimulus types. In Experiment 1, participants completed a change localization task using color squares and complex fractals; in Experiment 2, stimuli included real words, phonologically valid pseudowords, and phonologically invalid pseudowords. Across both experiments, aphantasic participants demonstrated significantly impaired visual working memory compared to controls. Notably, their performance was equally impaired for stimuli that were easily verbalizable (i.e., colors and words) and those that were not (i.e., fractals and pseudowords). Furthermore, individual differences in visual imagery ability, as measured by the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), significantly predicted working memory performance across all stimulus types.

To achieve consensus on HER processing and improve the reproducibility of findings, the field urgently requires a structured summary of the methods employed so far. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of 132 HER studies using non-invasive M/EEG recordings in humans. Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity across most steps of HER analysis, ranging from data acquisition and preprocessing to HER estimation and statistical approaches. The large diversity in the processing choices is accompanied by considerable proportions of unreported methodological information across reviewed studies, reaching up to 80% for key processing steps. In addition, less than 33% of studies had enough statistical power to reliably detect meta-level HER effects, while their reported spatiotemporal locations varied substantially. We provide a comprehensive reporting and quality control checklist to aid in the development of more standardized procedures, highlighting critical steps for robust HER investigations.

A.; Zolessi, F.

The ways in which this process fails inform us of the complex mechanical conditions required for its correct completion. Previous results showed that the functional disruption of MARCKS, a protein which simultaneously interacts with the plasma membrane and actin filaments, resulted in neural tube closure defects with apical cell extrusion. Here, we show that this is an example of 'live cell extrusion', wherein extruded cells are not undergoing apoptosis. This suggests that extrusion in this case might be due to a mechanical instability in the neural plate. Using an expanded energy-based vertex model of pseudostratified epithelia we then show that extrusion may be elicited by a reduction in the relative surface tension of apical and basal interfaces with respect to cell-cell interfaces. Finally, by considering a continuum description of a simplified epithelium we derive an approximate quantitative threshold for single-layered epithelial stability in the form of a power law relating cell density to the relative value of interfacial surface tensions. Our work serves to explain an example of how alterations in polarization and forces at the single-cell level can produce tissue-scale instabilities which not only greatly alter its morphology but can also ultimately lead to severe developmental defects.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the role of Twist in tentacle morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 generated knockout, we show that twist mutants exhibit impaired secondary tentacle formation, reduced proliferation in budding tentacles. Cross-sections reveal that mutants also lack micronemes, which are incomplete mesenteries that demarcate tentacle boundaries-suggesting defects in spatial patterning. We demonstrate that twist expression is regulated by Wnt, BMP, and Notch signalling but is independent of MAPK and Hedgehog pathways. Loss of Twist disrupts expression of mesodermal transcription factors paraxis and tbx15 and perturbs the TOR-FGF signalling feedback loop necessary for normal tentacle growth. In addition to the impaired tentacle formation phenotype, juvenile or adult mutants develop epithelial neoplasms at the level of the pharynx, with tentacle-like molecular and morphological profiles, indicating a role for Twist in maintaining tissue homeostasis at the oral pole. Together, our findings reveal that Twist integrates major signalling pathways to regulate secondary tentacle patterning and maintain spatial tissue organisation in the diploblastic Nematostella vectensis.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Understanding the eco-evolutionary forces that shape pathogen strain diversity is central to predicting their response to environmental and demographic changes and informing disease control strategies. However, most existing models focus on short-term invasion processes, which are insufficient for understanding long-term dynamics. Here, we develop Multi-Strain Eco-Evo Dynamics (MultiSEED), a unified theoretical framework that integrates a deterministic n-strain SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model with continuous-time stochastic processes to approximate multi-strain disease dynamics across both ecological and evolutionary scales. MultiSEED accounts for key mechanisms often overlooked in previous models, such as finite strain-specific immunity, mixed infections and within-host competition. Additionally, the model can distinguish between transient and persistent strains and classify strain dynamics into regimes of extinction, replacement, or long-term coexistence. We apply MultiSEED to four human pathogens (influenza A, HIV-1, pneumococcus, and malaria) that differ widely in life history and transmission ecology. The model accurately reproduces observed levels of strain diversity and lifespan. The model also reveals how interactions among host population size, transmissibility, cross-immunity, and immune loss collectively govern strain diversity, whereas strain innovation rates have a more significant impact on the regimes of strain dynamics. The model further highlights how parameter interactions near the persistence threshold are highly complex, requiring MultiSEED evaluations for regime predictions. By bridging short-term epidemiological processes with long-term evolutionary dynamics, MultiSEED offers a quantitative framework for estimating the emergence, maintenance, and turnover of pathogen strain diversity across a range of infectious diseases and ecological contexts.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Although LV remodeling is a complex process that can be described at several levels (i.e. biochemical, cellular, tissue, organ, system), response variables that govern cardiac mechanics include changes in LV wall and chamber geometry, the mechanical properties of the LV myocardium, and functionally-deterministic LV structural mechanical properties such as LV chamber stiffness. In this study, we leverage two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) to serially monitor key LV remodeling response variables in porcine models of LV pressure overload (LVPO), chronic exercise (CE), and the superposition of both settings (CE+LVPO), and compare changes to those occurring in age-matched referent control (RC) animals. Our findings show that over a 28-day study period, LVPO and CE both induce hypertrophy in comparison to RC, but passive LV myocardial stiffness increases with the former and decreases with the latter. As a net effect of geometrical and mechanical property changes, these settings induce divergent changes in LV chamber stiffness, namely an elevation with LVPO and reduction with CE. In the CE+LVPO cohort, exercise was found to attenuate the LVPO-induced increase in LV myocardial and LV chamber stiffnesses and insomuch supports its continued integration and refinement as a cardiac rehabilitation therapy. Data obtained across study cohorts were used to identify a phenomenological model of LV chamber stiffness, providing the first explicit relation of LV geometry and myocardial mechanical properties to a key LV structural property. Additional data processing was performed to develop a predictive mathematical model of late changes in LV chamber stiffness based on early remodeling response variables irrespective of stimulus, suggesting that STE can be extended to predict cardiac disease risk/progression in certain patient populations.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Our lab has identified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as optimal nanocarriers to overcome delivery challenges to cartilage due to their positive charge and small size, which enables them to bind to cartilage and diffuse through tissue to deliver therapeutics to chondrocytes. Previously, we have developed and characterized dendrimers functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), demonstrating improved biocompatibility and enhanced transport through cartilage matrix. To improve the design of our therapeutic system, in this next phase of work, we characterized dendrimer-protein interactions or protein coronas that form on dendrimers after being immersed in synovial fluid. We also analyzed how synovial fluid protein coronas affect biological outcomes of dendrimers in synovial joints, specifically uptake in cartilage and internalization by chondrocytes. We identified that protein coronas can reduce dendrimer uptake in cartilage and chondrocytes; however, uptake reduction is mitigated by varying PEG chain length and density. Although protein coronas can be perceived as biological barriers to uptake, we demonstrate that dendrimers conjugated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have better engagement with IGF-1 receptors after being pre-coated with a synovial fluid protein corona.

For well-studied RNA systems (58-mer and Ade riboswitch), the model accurately describes the concentration-dependent ionic environment, including (bidentate) chelated and hydrated (diffuse/outer-shell) ions. With this foundation, we applied the model to simulate the yeast ribosome and quantified the ion-dependent energy landscape of intersubunit rotation. These calculations show how the energetics of rotation responds to millimolar changes in [MgCl2], which shift the distribution between rotation states and alter the kinetics by more than an order of magnitude. We find that this response to the ionic concentration correlates with formation and breakage of ion-mediated interactions (inner-shell and outer-shell) between the ribosomal subunits.

Here, we show that this pathway sustains amino acid biosynthesis by promoting mitochondrial NAD regeneration through ubiquinone-dependent electron transport. Statin-mediated inhibition of the mevalonate pathway impairs oxidative phosphorylation, lowers the NAD/NADH ratio, and suppresses de novo serine and aspartate synthesis, thereby activating the GCN2-eIF2-ATF4 amino acid deprivation response. The resulting depletion of serine-derived glycine and one-carbon units, together with reduced aspartate availability, limits purine and pyrimidine nucleotide production. Expression of the bacterial NADH oxidase LbNOX or the alternative oxidase AOX restores NAD levels and rescues statin-induced growth inhibition.

Despite these risks, it is frequently left untreated due to fears of side effects caused by antidepressant medications which cross through the placental barrier. It is therefore desirable to develop formulation strategies to mitigate systemic exposure to relevant drug molecules while maintaining their psychotropic efficacy. In this work, we develop formulations of sertraline, a common antidepressant, to target delivery to the brain through intranasal administration. Formulation engineering enables successful solubilization of sertraline at high concentrations and our lead formulation remains stable at room temperature for months. Using mice, we compare sertraline biodistribution following intranasal administration and standard oral administration. Intranasal administration of our drug product candidate provides comparable brain exposure at half the dose compared to oral treatment and lowers the maximum plasma exposure. These findings suggest that intranasal administration may provide selectivity for drug exposure in the central nervous system over systemic exposure.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) offer a promising strategy to overcome this barrier. Using an optimized high-yield extraction protocol, we isolated PEVs from four medicinal plants Panax ginseng, Panax notoginseng, Gastrodia elata, and Ligusticum chuanxiong. Among these, EVs derived from Panax notoginseng (NotoEVs) exhibited the strongest neuroprotective effects under hypoxic conditions in both in vitro and in vivo stroke models. Mechanistically, NotoEVs deliver conserved plant microRNAs to recipient neurons, where they suppress key stress granule nucleators (G3bp2, Ubap2l, Lsm14a), activate mTOR signaling, and promote mitochondrial stabilization via the BCL2 and TOM20 axis. This cross kingdom RNA delivery reprograms neuronal stress responses, reduces infarct volume, preserves neuronal morphology, and restores electrophysiological function. Together, our findings establish a scalable platform for plant-based nanotherapeutics and highlight the translational potential of NotoEVs for the treatment of ischemic stroke.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Understanding its adaptation to such extreme conditions provides key insights into survival strategies under fluctuating oxygen availability. We investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of L. capensis under normoxia, hypoxia, and recovery, focusing on the gills and digestive gland. Our findings highlight distinct organ-specific responses, with the gills showing strong transcriptional changes to oxygen fluctuations, in contrast to the more stable profile observed in the digestive gland. Under hypoxic conditions, the gills exhibited coordinated downregulation of critical metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, transposable element activity, and immune function, suggesting a tightly regulated energy conservation strategy and mechanisms to preserve symbiont stability and genomic integrity. Activation of prokaryotic metabolism in the gills supports the symbionts' role in host energy acquisition and sulfide detoxification during hypoxia. In contrast, the digestive gland showed minimal transcriptional shifts during anoxia, with upregulation of pathways supporting structural maintenance. Upon reoxygenation, the gills displayed an active and asymmetric recovery, characterized by rapid restoration of protein synthesis and gradual normalization of protein degradation and immune functions. Despite significant transcriptomic changes, the metabolome remained largely stable, reflecting L. capensis's resilience to oxygen fluctuations. However, an overshoot in TCA cycle intermediates and derepression of previously downregulated pathways indicate that reoxygenation involves active metabolic reprogramming, not merely a return to baseline. This study highlights the specialized tissue responses and symbiotic contributions that enable L. capensis to thrive in one of the ocean's most challenging environments.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Islet rhythmicity is triggered by glucose elevation and mediated by paracrine interactions. However, the dynamics of islet population rhythmicity in healthy and diabetic pancreases in vivo remain poorly understood. Using simultaneous multi-islet Ca2+ imaging (20-100 islets per experiment) in both live mice and pancreatic tissue slices, we systematically studied how glycemia fluctuations and intra-islet paracrine signaling collectively shape the islet rhythmicity. In this study, we report that a transition from Hyperglycemia to Euglycemia induces a coordinated shift from slow to fast islet Ca2+ oscillations (HESF) in vivo. HESF is conserved in pancreatic tissue slices and isolated islets, however, not dispersed single cells in vitro, suggesting a mechanistic link with paracrine interactions. We found HESF arises from -cell activation, which is inhibited by {delta} cells upon glucose elevation. The autonomous islets mostly differ in phase and period at high glucose level. Diabetic mice with disrupted glycemic stability lost HESF both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, HESF is preserved in {beta}-cell knockout Gcgr transgenetic mice, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting HESF's dependence on Glp1r. Indeed, HESF was restored in semaglutide-treated diabetic mice with stabilized glycemic stability.

A.; Vanicek, N.", "abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies have examined gait biomechanics during stair descent in older adults, but limited evidence exists on how bone mineral density (BMD) influences these mechanics in postmenopausal women, a group at increased risk of falls and fractures. This study investigated the relationship between self-selected stair descent speed and femoral neck BMD (T-score) with gait biomechanical parameters in postmenopausal women across a wide range of T-scores, from normal to osteoporotic. Methods: Forty-five postmenopausal women (mean {+/-} SD age: 67.3 {+/-} 1.5 years) descended a five-step, custom-built staircase at a self-selected speed, without using handrails. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected using motion capture and force plates. Multiple linear regression models assessed how stair descent speed and femoral neck T-score influenced stair descent gait parameters. Results: The participants mean stair descent speed was 0.80 {+/-} 0.21 m{middle dot}s-1. Speed significantly explained variance in temporal-spatial, kinematic, GRF, joint moment, and joint power parameters (R{superscript 2} = 7% to 49%, P [&le;] 0.01). The inclusion of femoral neck T-score in the regression models further improved the explanatory power of the model in anterior pelvic tilt (R{superscript 2} = 21%, P [&le;] 0.01), hip adduction (R{superscript 2} = 11%, P [&le;] 0.01), hip extension (R{superscript 2} = 29%, P [&le;] 0.01), knee flexion (R{superscript 2} = 21%, P [&le;] 0.01), ankle dorsiflexion (R{superscript 2} = 19%, P [&le;] 0.001), mid-stance vertical GRF (R{superscript 2} = 20%, P [&le;] 0.01) during the forward continuance phase, and the second vertical GRF peak (R{superscript 2} = 15%, P [&le;] 0.01). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that stair descent speed and femoral neck T-score significantly influence lower limb biomechanics, accounting for up to 29% of the variance in key variables, particularly during the controlled lowering phase. Postmenopausal women with low BMD adopted altered movement strategies, such as increased frontal plane motion at the hip and pelvis, which may serve to maintain balance but could also elevate the risk of falls. The substantial eccentric muscle demands during stair descent contribute to mechanical loading of the lower limb skeleton, underscoring its potential not only as a complex functional task but also as an osteogenic stimulus. These findings highlight the value of targeted interventions aimed at improving eccentric strength and trunk control to enhance stair negotiation safety and support both musculoskeletal function and bone health in individuals with low BMD.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Its significant heterogeneity poses major challenges for effective therapy and clinical outcomes. In this study, we present a systems-level analysis of spatial transcriptomics data to characterize tumor heterogeneity in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy HGSOC patients. By integrating gene expression profiles with spatial localization and histological context, we quantified hallmark pathway activities across tissue regions. The computed pathway scores were then used for clustering to investigate intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We also constructed gene co-expression network within tumor-enriched regions. Finally, we examined the association of these co-expressed modules with treatment response. Clustering based on pathway activity scores revealed spatially distinct regions enriched for different hallmark pathways, uncovering functionally diverse cellular subpopulations within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cell-enriched clusters show difference in pathways related to proliferation, metabolism, immune signaling and stress response, while fibroblast-rich regions exhibit upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Unsupervised co-expression analysis further revealed gene modules associated with both biological processes and clinical phenotypes. Poor responders exhibit higher expression of gene modules involved in stress response, ribosomal function, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell-cycle regulation. In contrast, good responders show elevated activity in modules enriched for immune activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and inflammatory signaling.

Safe driving requires numerous cognitive and sensorimotor skills, and past literature suggests that cognitive testing can predict safe or unsafe driving in both healthy and medically at-risk drivers. However, such testing is often time-consuming and inaccessible.

We recruited 4405 commercially-licensed drivers and 314 medically at-risk drivers to complete the TMT, plus an on-road test of their driving abilities. We then trained and tested a logistic regression model using 50-50 splits on each dataset. The results of the model showed that the longer it took drivers in both groups to complete the TMT, the more likely they were to fail the on-road driving test. Accuracy for the commercial group was 83.8%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 34.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85.3%. Accuracy for the medically at-risk group was 63.1%, with a PPV of 55.8% and an NPV of 65.8%. Overall accuracy was 82.5%, with a PPV of 43.0% and an NPV of 84.3%.

We show that training a simple linear decoder with fixed feedback weights enables the system to learn and autonomously generate diverse temporal patterns. When feedback is switched on, the irregular activity in the BNNs is transformed into low-dimensional, structured dynamics, producing coherent trajectories that are characterized by stable transitions between different neural states. BNNs trained on various target frequencies -- ranging from 4 to 30 s -- can be trained to sustain oscillations at distinct frequencies, demonstrating their adaptability. Importantly, top-down control of the self-organized network formation with microfluidic devices is the key to suppressing excessive synchronization and increasing dynamic complexity in BNNs, facilitating the training process and the generation of robust outputs.

We propose the solution to this dilemma: spike synchrony provides crucial information about stimulus familiarity under conditions when the firing rate alone is insufficient - namely, when the input stimulus is varied in saliency. Using simulations of recurrent spiking networks, we show that synchrony is particularly effective in distinguishing familiar stimuli of low saliency from novel stimuli of high saliency - an important distinction for both biological perception and artificial agents navigating dynamic environments. We evaluate familiarity detection across two frameworks: a biologically inspired model of the primary visual cortex (V1) and an abstract associative memory model. We show that in both cases, synchrony is more sensitive to recurrent connectivity, that encodes prior experiences, compared to input firing rate. This highlights the relevance of synchrony for familiarity encoding in a scenario of realistic input variability.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

D.; Muthukumaraswamy, S. D.; Hamandi, K.; Sumner, R. L.", "abstract": "Introduction: Catamenial epilepsy refers to a cyclical exacerbation of seizure frequency and/or severity linked to stages of the menstrual cycle. To investigate the contribution of underlying excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of this exacerbation we induced and measured long-term potentiation (LTP). Oestradiol modulates primarily NMDA receptor driven excitation and would enhance visual LTP. Allopregnanolone modulates GABA receptor mediated inhibition and would suppress visual LTP. Method: A control cohort (n = 25) and a cohort with epilepsy (n = 20) were recruited. Participants took part in a visual LTP task while EEG was recorded. Three study visits were timed to capture the mid-follicular (days +5 to +8), mid-luteal (days -9 to -5) phases, as well as the hormone withdrawal in the perimenstrual phase (days -3 to +2). Blood samples confirmed session timing. Generative computational modelling of thalamocortical changes in the EEG was paired with standard evoked potential analysis. Result: 17 (age 26 +/- 9.40) participants with epilepsy, and a control cohort of 25 (age 30 +/-7.06) without epilepsy completed the study. The P2 visually evoked potential (a positive-going component of the visual event related potential waveform) was significantly more enhanced by LTP induction in the mid-follicular phase than the mid-luteal or perimenstrual phases in the control cohort (F(2, 144) =11.54, p = 0.004 corrected). In contrast, in the epilepsy cohort the P2 was significantly more potentiated in the perimenstrual phase than the mid-follicular or mid-luteal phases (F(2,108) = 12.21, p = 0.005 corrected). The effect of cycle on visual LTP was robust, with only 3/17 participants with epilepsy showing highest P2 modulation in the mid-follicular phase (which is the pattern the healthy cohort showed). The computational modelling showed that in epilepsy, the perimenstrual phase was associated with a decrease in superficial pyramidal grain control as well as decreased LTP driven modulation of feed-forward superficial connections to layer 5 and layer 6 to thalamus. Discussion: Our finding of enhanced visual LTP in the luteal phase and perimenstrual phase of females with epilepsy indicates a breakthrough of glutamatergic excitation. Given the relationship between oestrogen and n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dependent LTP this is plausibly NMDA receptor driven. Several thalamocortical model parameter changes observed warrant further investigation in studies stratifying participants by catamenial epilepsy type. Overall, while research into allopregnanolone and its inhibitory effects dominate perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy research, this study justifies consideration of the role of seizure exacerbating oestradiol.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases. Prior work identified defective B cell tolerance, reflected by a high frequency of self-reactive naive B cells, in patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis (MG), mediated by IgG4 autoantibodies. Here, we investigated whether tolerance defects exist in neurofascin-155-mediated AIN (NF155-AIN), similar to MuSK+ MG. Additionally, we analyzed B and T cell transcriptomics and interactions at the single-cell level to explore the underlying pathomechanism. Methods: Using a well-established assay, we assessed B cell tolerance fidelity by generating recombinant antibodies from new emigrant (NE) and mature naive (MN) B cell populations, directly downstream of key tolerance checkpoints-from three NF155-AIN patients, and testing these antibodies for polyreactivity and autoreactivity, thereby determining the frequency of polyreactive and autoreactive B cells. The transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied, with a special focus on naive B cells and CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level, along with characterization of cell-cell interactions. Results: NF155-AIN patients have an elevated frequency of polyreactive B cells in the NE (37.4% compared to 9.7% in healthy controls (HCs), p = 0.03) and MN (31.5% compared to 10.5% in HCs, p = 0.03) compartments with increased B cell clones expressing autoreactive antibodies, consistent with a breach in early tolerance checkpoints. We observed abnormal B cell receptor (BCR) signaling characterized by low CD79B, CSK, BLNK, and BTK expression, which may contribute to a breach in B cell tolerance. We also observed evidence of impaired follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and regulatory T cells (Treg), which may limit the normal development and suppression of autoreactive B cells. Moreover, comparative gene expression analysis of B cells and CD4+ T cells from three patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a related autoimmune neuropathy, confirmed that these differences are largely specific to NF155-AIN, supporting a distinct pathophysiology in this subset. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated a breach in early B cell tolerance checkpoints, defective BCR signaling, and disrupted T cell-B cell interactions in NF155-IN, all of which may contribute to the development of pathogenic autoreactivity. These immunologic abnormalities appear distinct from those seen in CIDP, supporting NF155-AIN as a unique immunopathologic entity.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

These predictive responses were accompanied by bidirectional AC-PFC coupling in the delta band, reflecting a temporally coordinated predictive state. Deviant tones elicited early responses in the AC, followed by PFC activation, and were associated with increased feedforward and feedback connectivity across delta, theta, and gamma bands.

We then generated synthetic cross-sectional seroprevalence surveys with varying frequencies from outbreak scenarios inferred from empirical serological data from the Comoros archipelago. By refitting the model to these synthetic data, we found that lower surveillance frequency was associated with increased uncertainties in understanding disease biology, inferring past outbreak timing, predicting future outbreak size, and recommending optimal control measures. In particular, once serological surveillance was less frequent than annually, the ability to distinguish spatio-temporal patterns of disease transmission and forecast trends diminished. These findings emphasise the need for adequately frequent surveillance data to ensure robust model-based analyses which inform effective preparedness and control strategies for livestock diseases within resource-limited settings.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

S.; Toju, H.", "abstract": "Biological community dynamics are organized by the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes. While species' responses to biotic and abiotic environments determine the attractors of community compositions, stochastic processes, especially those in early stages of community assembly, can drastically influence the direction of temporal ecological dynamics. Nonetheless, establishing quantitative insights into the roles of stochastic processes has remained a major challenge. By developing a multi-replicated experimental system for tracking community assembly, we quantitatively evaluated the extent to which stochasticity could cause the divergence of community dynamics. We constructed soil- and freshwater-derived experimental microbial assemblages (microbiomes) with varying foundation community size, thereby controlling variation in initial community compositions among replicate communities (i.e., initial stochasticity). An analysis of > 3,000 community samples across four time points then indicated that higher levels of initial stochasticity could result in greater divergence of population- and community-level consequences. From the quantitative perspective, conspicuous differentiation into alternative trajectories of community assembly occurred when the absolute number of founding prokaryotic cells was less than the order of 104. Furthermore, the replicate microbiomes differed in dominant Pseudomonas species, suggesting divergence into alternative transient/stable states through competitive exclusion between species occupying similar niches. Overall, our experiment showed that quantitative differences in stochasticity could result in qualitative differences in the fate of ecological communities. Further quantitative insights into stochasticity in community assembly will reorganize our views on biological invasions, agroecosystem microbiome management, and therapeutics of human-associated microbiomes.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

K.; Dayan, P.", "abstract": "An impressive wealth of cognitive neuroscience tasks involves combining perceptual information with an estimate of the latent state of the environment to make a decision. Such tasks have driven the development of theoretically motivated cognitive models which offer compactly parameterised, and thereby insightful, accounts of the internal processes by which this might happen. However, the very large amounts of data that can now be collected present a challenge and an opportunity for this framework. The challenge is that these models can be shown to underfit the data systematically (Nassar & Frank, 2016; Palminteri, Wyart, & Koechlin, 2017; Wilson & Collins, 2019), particularly in how they characterise the effect of the latent state estimate. But this opens up the opportunity to extend the framework and employ richer, more highly parameterised and flexible models, in a data-driven manner (Dezfouli, Griffiths, Ramos, Dayan, & Balleine, 2019). Unfortunately, it is tremendously difficult to interpret these models, precisely because of their flexibility. Here, we follow a recent approach (Eckstein, Summerfield, Daw, & Miller, 2024), in which components of compact models are progressively replaced with more flexible homologues, but, where possible, the resulting insights are mapped back into theoretically-transparent forms. We prove the effectiveness of our scheme by applying it to one of the largest available decision-making data sets for mice, more than 300,000 choices from 139 subjects studied by the International Brain Lab (The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021). We found widely generalisable phenomena such as notable effects of continual fluctuations in task engagement and systematic differences between learning and forgetting of chosen and unchosen options in determining the subjective state estimate. Our results show that combining theory-driven and data-driven methods can reveal cognitive processes that would have been difficult to discover using either method on its own.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a fully automated rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (rLC-MS) system coupled to an AI-enabled computational pipeline that enables high-throughput, reproducible, non-targeted metabolite measurements across tens of thousands of samples. This system captures thousands of polar, amphipathic and nonpolar (lipid) metabolites in a human plasma sample in 53 seconds of analytical time, enabling analysis of greater than 1,000 samples per day per instrument. To demonstrate the discovery power of the rLC-MS platform, a subset of samples from Sapient's DynamiQ biorepository -- comprised of 62,039 total plasma samples collected longitudinally from 11,045 individuals -- were selected for deep analysis by rLC-MS to capture a rich, dynamic landscape of chemical variation that reflects both physiological processes and environmental influences. 26,042 plasma samples with matched real-world data (RWD) were chosen for the study, representing 6,935 individuals with diverse demographic backgrounds and disease profiles. Unbiased exploratory analysis revealed human metabotypes that correlate with heterogenous disease phenotypes, including key sub-populations of cardiometabolic and other human diseases. Moreover, a metabolic aging clock machine learning model trained on healthy individuals in this dataset accurately predicted accelerated aging in various chronic diseases, with dynamic reversal of metabolic aging following definitive therapy.

In Caenorhabditis, the expanded O-acyltransferase (OAC) family, enzymes that transfer acyl groups to hydroxylated substrates, remains poorly characterized despite having been implicated in lipid metabolism. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, behavioral assays, gas chromatographic-mass spectral (GC-MS) analyses, and metabolomics, we systematically analyzed 59 OAC-family protein-coding genes to define their roles in regulating signaling molecules. We found that four adjacent paralogs (oac-13, oac-16, oac-25, and oac-28) on chromosome I are required for synthesizing volatile sex pheromones (VSPs), airborne signals critical for male mate-searching. Specifically, oac-13 and oac-16 are necessary for producing both major pheromone components, while the identical tandem paralogs oac-25 and oac-28 regulate the production of the later-eluting component in gas chromatography. Disruption of these genes reduced production of key pheromone components and impaired male attraction. Metabolomics revealed that oac-16 and other OACs also modulate synthesis and secretion of non-volatile ascaroside pheromones, indicating dual roles in chemical signaling.

These foundation models have shown remarkable potential across a variety of downstream applications. However, there remains a lack of foundation models for scATAC-seq data, which measures chromatin accessibility at single-cell level and is critical for decoding epigenetic regulation. Developing such models is considerably more challenging due to the unique characteristics of scATAC-seq data, including the vast number of chromatin regions, lack of standardized annotations, extreme sparsity, and near-binary distributions. To address these challenges, we systematically explore various strategies and propose CLM-access, a specialized foundation model for scATAC-seq data. CLM-access incorporates three main innovations: (1) an unified data processing pipeline that maps 2.8 million cells onto an unified reference of over 1 million chromatin regions; (2) a specialized patching and embedding strategy to effectively manage high-dimensional inputs; and (3) a tailored masking and loss function design that preserves fine-grained regional information while enhancing training efficiency and representation quality.

Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the effects of DSIF on the dynamics and structure of Pol II and upstream nucleic acids, thereby gaining a mechanistic understanding of its role in transcription elongation. We determined three major sites of impact by DSIF, including the upstream nucleic acids, Pol II clamp, and active site, which potentially contribute to its role in transcription processivity. Our results showed that DSIF helps stabilize upstream DNA and RNA at the exit sites, preventing the unwinding of DNA and the folding of RNA. In addition, our results suggest that DSIF regulates the motion of the Pol II clamp to potentially maintain a proper size at the central cleft. We also observed a more dynamic active site and increased interactions between active site domains.

Previous data suggest that patient outcomes are enhanced with the induction of an anti-tumor immune response, but current research focuses on using immune checkpoint inhibitors, which function through conventional immune pathways that may be downregulated by cancer or dysregulated by chemo-induced lymphodepletion. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells overcome this limitation, as they are engineered with synthetic receptors that redirect lymphocytes to recognize and target cells expressing tumor-specific structures. CARs are engineered to have an increased binding affinity compared to in-situ T-cell binding, amplify internal stimulation cascades, and release pro-inflammatory cytokines that can modulate the endogenous immune system. However, there are still major limitations for adoptive cell therapies in solid tumors, including life-threatening on-target off-tumor cytotoxicity, antigen escape, and failure to infiltrate and persist in solid tumors. Given the substantial evidence that IRE overcomes many of the challenges associated with immune infiltration and persistence in solid tumors, there is a strong premise for using targeted cell therapies following IRE, which would then target residual cancer that could repopulate the lesion.

We demonstrate that RAC1P29S/C189S, which lacks C-terminal prenylation site, has lost the ability to induce resistance toward vemurafenib or trametinib in BRAFV600E melanoma cells. Furthermore, the combination of vemurafenib with cysmethynil, a proof-of-concept ICMT inhibitor, showed efficacy in combating RAC1P29S-driven resistance of BRAFV600E melanoma cells in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

A synergistic combination of checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor (CHK1i) with low-dose hydroxyurea (LDHU) promotes a unique ATR-independent moderate replication stress response with potent anti-tumour effects. The ability of this approach to reprogram the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) to overcome the immunosuppression and promote an anti-tumour immune response in HGSOC is the focus of this study. METHODS: We investigated the therapeutic potential of CHK1i+LDHU in established HGSOC cell cultures, fresh tumour cell explants from HGSOC patient ascites, and syngeneic mouse models, assessing tumour cell killing, immunogenic cell death, pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression, and anti-tumour immune responses. RESULTS: CHK1i+LDHU effectively killed ovarian cancer cells regardless of chemotherapy resistance, BRCA2 mutation and homologous recombination repair status in vitro. In vivo, treatment significantly reduced tumour burden and ascites accumulation. CHK1i+LDHU enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and triggered immunogenic cell death in tumour.

Using a tunable mouse embryonic stem cell degron system, we uncover that HDAC3 directly prevents enhancer--and consequently gene--overactivation, effectively establishing a molecular ''speed limit'' for many naive pluripotency and housekeeping genes. Interestingly, we find that both the catalytic and non-catalytic functions of HDAC3 contribute to establishing this physiological transcript dose. Specifically during early development, HDAC3 rather than functioning as a canonical repressor, constrains the activity of highly transcribed genes of the implanting epiblast and ensures timely exit from naive pluripotency in vitro. Altogether, this indicates that a dynamic equilibrium between activators and repressors coexists at highly active enhancer elements in pluripotent stem cells, establishing appropriate transcriptional dosage and rendering them responsive to signaling cues, thereby enabling timely and coordinated developmental progression.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) enhancers formed at low physiological doses of E2 (1-100 pM) are mechanistically distinct from those that form at high pharmacological doses (10-100 nM). They (1) form in open chromatin bound by FOXA1, (2) produce enhancer RNAs enriched with functional eRNA regulatory motifs (FERMs), and (3) drive expression of cell proliferation genes with promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II. Importantly, low dose ER enhancer usage is elevated in breast cancer patients with poor responses to aromatase inhibitors, likely as a continued response to low circulating levels of E2.

These changes are defined by cell-type-specific transcriptional rewiring of progenitor cells to form CMs, and are regulated by various epigenetic elements, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are versatile epigenetic regulators as they may act in cis or in trans to orchestrate important gene programs during cardiac development and may concurrently encode micropeptides. LIPTER is one such lncRNA, previously shown to regulate lipid droplet transport in cardiomyocytes and thus an important regulator of cardiomyocyte metabolism. Here we show that LIPTER also plays a role in the cytoskeletal maturation of CMs, as loss of LIPTER leads to persistent expression of fetal genes, changes in chromatin accessibility, disorganized sarcomeres and impaired calcium homeostasis in CMs. Furthermore, we have identified a cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory enhancer that regulates the expression of LIPTER in CMs. CRISPR-mediated inhibition of this enhancer led to reduced LIPTER expression in CMs and increased expression of fetal genes. This CM-specific enhancer could therefore be manipulated to control the expression of LIPTER for therapeutic benefit. In summary, we have unravelled a novel role of LIPTER in CMs cytoskeletal maturation and have identified a CM-specific enhancer for LIPTER.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, their quantitative study is often impaired by technical difficulties, creating either low-quality and sparse data, or impractical data amounts, particularly when capturing large groups over long periods of time. Common challenges arise from recording group members with as little obscuring of each other as possible, as well as in generating manageable data amounts with as high as possible information content. We here provide a multicomponent system that allows to record, analyze and simulate the long-term spatiotemporal activity patterns of insect collectives, especially ant colonies. Our Ant Observing System, ALTAA, comprises a flat nest design to prevent occlusion of individuals, a recording system running on a low-power single-board-computer, and a set of computer programs performing quantitative analyses to guide the formation and validation of rules underlying the observed collective patterns. Our system is scalable in that it allows parallel, continuous observation of a high number of colonies using low memory space, with colony maintenance requirements (e.g. feeding, nest humidity) being achieved at lowest possible disturbance by the experimenter. We showcase the potential of the system in a study using the black garden ant, Lasius niger, where we analyze the spatiotemporal effects of different group size (1, 6, 10 ants), brood (larvae) presence or absence, as well as of different nest geometries, over a period of one week. We show that the ants' motion activity has a weak periodicity in the range of 20 to 120 minutes promoted by larval presence, and that ants are spatially attracted to their larvae, the water source and the walls. We also find that the presence of nestmates lowers an individual ants' motion activity. Observed data are compared to simulations of the temporal activity of the ants. ALTAA provides a powerful toolkit to quantify and interpret spatial and temporal collective activity patterns in (social) insects over extended periods.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

While high-throughput CRISPR screens have revolutionized our ability to identify gene dependencies in cancer, most large-scale screens are conducted in two-dimensional (2D) culture systems that fail to recapitulate tumor organization and behavior. To uncover architecture-dependent vulnerabilities in breast cancer, we performed parallel CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in 2D and three-dimensional (3D) cultures of MCF7 cells, an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer model representative of a high risk of relapse, luminal subtype. Knockdown of IFNAR2 and TYK2 conferred a growth advantage in 3D cultures, implicating type I interferon signaling as a tumor-intrinsic suppressor of proliferation in 3D spheroids. Transcriptomic and functional analyses demonstrated that type I IFN signaling is endogenously activated in 3D spheroids via RIG-I-mediated sensing of cytosolic double-stranded RNA, leading to TBK1 activation and induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This tumor-intrinsic IFN response slowed proliferation in 3D culture, independent of exogenous stimuli or the presence of immune cells. Analysis of bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic datasets from breast cancer patients revealed that a subset of tumors exhibit elevated IFN signaling in cancer cells, including in immune-depleted tumor cores, consistent with a tumor-intrinsic IFN signature.

While individual phosphorylation sites have been well-studied in pathology, it remains largely unknown how combinatorial phosphorylation is regulated under physiological conditions. Here, we uncover distinct, site-specific phosphorylation patterns on tau in developing human neurons. With top-down mass spectrometry we find that functional, endogenous tau is highly modified, with up to 21 phosphates per molecule. We identify patterns of co-occurrence between phosphorylation sites that are in proximity in the linear protein sequence, such as epitopes S202/T205/T212/T217 and T231/S235/S262. Moreover, these phospho-epitopes define discrete pools of tau and regulate tau-MT interactions in coordination, providing a mechanism for fine-tuning the binding of tau to MTs. Intriguingly, we find that co-occurring phospho-epitopes are dynamically regulated in response to changes in MT integrity; chemical perturbation of neuronal MTs promotes rapid tau dephosphorylation by phosphatase PP2a at most sites to enhance tau-MT interactions and counteract destabilization. We then use the PS19 tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that developmental and pathological tau phosphorylation patterns partially overlap, and that co-occurring phospho-epitopes exhibit similar associations with the insoluble fraction in aged mice. Our results reveal an isoform-dependence on the effects of site-specific tau phosphorylation on its behavior. Together, these findings define a combinatorial phosphorylation code that modulates tau's physiological function in neurons and raises the possibility that MT destabilization precedes tau phosphorylation in disease. This work provides a mechanistic framework for distinguishing functional from pathological tau phosphorylation, with implications for the development of therapies that specifically target disease-associated tau proteoforms.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Paradoxically, thalamic neurons discharge tonically during cellular depolarization and activated brain states (wakefulness, REM sleep) but burst during hyperpolarization and NREM sleep (5-9). It has been proposed that NREM thalamic bursts do not awaken the cortex because of their periodic and synchronized nature (2-4); however, this has never been tested in vivo during natural sleep. We simultaneously recorded polysomnographic signals, local field potentials, and spiking activity from multiple thalamic neurons in the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei of two female non-human primates during naturally occurring vigilance states. These nuclei receive GABAergic output from the basal ganglia (10,11), with discharge rate and GABA outflow decreasing during NREM sleep (12). We found that despite the expected thalamic depolarization, bursting increased significantly. NREM bursts were neither periodic nor highly synchronized. However, EEG activity time-locked to burst onset during NREM sleep differed markedly from that observed during wakefulness and REM sleep. These results support a modulatory, rather than a driving, relationship between the basal ganglia and thalamus.

In embryonic stem cells (ESC), MLL2 is essential for H3K4me3 deposition at bivalent promoters, which has been proposed to facilitate the induction of major developmental genes during pluripotent cell differentiation. However, prior studies point to a functional discrepancy between the loss of H3K4me3 at bivalent promoters and the largely unaltered transcription of major developmental genes in Mll2-/- cells. In this study, we investigated MLL2-dependent gene regulation in mouse ESC and during their differentiation. Contrary to the prevailing view, we show that MLL2's primary role is not to oppose Polycomb-mediated repression at the bivalent promoters of developmental genes. Instead, we identify a previously unrecognized regulatory function for MLL2 at the CG-rich 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR) of evolutionarily young LINE-1 (L1) transposable elements (TE). We found that MLL2 binds to the 5'UTR of L1 elements and is critical for maintaining their active state (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), while preventing the accumulation of repressive H3K9me3. Using both global genomic approaches (i.e. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Micro-C) as well as targeted L1 deletions, we demonstrate that these MLL2-bound L1 elements act as enhancers, modulating the expression of neighboring genes in ESC and, more prominently, during differentiation.

One hypothesis is that the coccosphere acts as a physical shield, deterring predators and microbes. While its protective role has been investigated against grazers and viruses, its function in bacterial defense remains untested. Here, we investigate the interaction between heavily calcified Coccolithus braarudii and the bacterial pathogen Phaeobacter inhibens, known for its lethal 'Jekyll and Hyde' relationship with the bloom-forming Gephyrocapsa huxleyi. We find that in C. braarudii, no P. inhibens pathogenicity is observed--unless the algae are decalcified. Upon decalcification, the relationship with P. inhibens becomes pathogenic, leading to algal cell death. Mortality of decalcified cells is specific to interactions with P. inhibens and is attachment-mediated: no toxicity is observed when cells are exposed to P. inhibens supernatant or to growth-inhibiting concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid--identified in the P. inhibens-G. huxleyi system. Attachment requirement is further supported by scanning electron microscopy, which reveals extensive bacterial colonization on decalcified but not on calcified C. braarudii with P. inhibens.

To dissect the relative contributions of type I and type III IFNs in protecting the liver during echovirus infection, we combined in vivo mouse models (expressing hFcRn and deficient in Ifnar1, Ifnlr1, or both) with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This approach enabled us to pinpoint the hepatic cell types targeted by echoviruses and to identify the specific cells producing IFNs in response. We found that hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were the most heavily infected cell types. In contrast, early and robust type I IFN responses were primarily driven by Kupffer cells and a subset of dendritic cells. To determine whether type I IFNs act directly on hepatocytes to mediate protection, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking Ifnar1 specifically in hepatocytes. These mice showed similar morbidity, mortality, and hepatic viral titers as whole-body Ifnar1-/- animals, indicating that hepatocytes depend on protective IFN signals produced by immune cells during echovirus infection.

Importantly, IS transpositions commonly lead to gene inactivation, which can in turn promote AMR (e.g. through the modification of the antibiotic target). In this study, we combined experimental, bioinformatic and computational approaches to investigate the role of plasmids as catalysts of AMR through IS-mediated gene inactivation. Our results revealed that plasmid pOXA-48, which encodes two IS1 elements, increases the rate of resistance acquisition to multiple antibiotics in clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae through IS1-mediated gene disruption. Moreover, a large screen of genome databases confirmed that the inactivation of genes through plasmid-encoded IS elements is an extended mechanism of AMR evolution. Finally, both our experiments and computational model revealed that conjugative plasmids can promote this route of AMR acquisition while invading complex bacterial communities.

Six unique peptides were identified from the screen and their ability to bind perrhenate free in solution and immobilized on a solid support were explored. It was found that the peptides, particularly when immobilized, were able to remove perrhenate from aqueous solutions, and despite not being screened for selectivity, demonstrated some preference for perrhenate over other anions such as chromate and nitrate.

However, classical de novo algorithms are hindered by cubic time and quadratic memory complexity, which makes them impractical for emerging datasets containing millions of sequences. Recent placement-based alternatives provide better algorithmic scalability, but they also face practical scaling challenges due to their high cost to compute evolutionary distances and significant memory usage. Current tools also do not fully utilize the parallel processing capabilities of modern CPU and GPU architectures. Results: We present DIPPER, a novel distance-based phylogenetic tool for ultrafast and ultralarge phylogenetic reconstruction on GPUs, designed to maintain high accuracy and a small memory footprint. DIPPER introduces several novel innovations, including a divide-and-conquer strategy, a placement strategy, and an on-the-fly distance calculator that greatly improve the runtime and memory complexity. These allow DIPPER to achieve runtime and space complexity of O(N.log(N)) and O(N), respectively, with N taxa. With divide-and-conquer, DIPPER is also able to maintain a low memory footprint on the GPU, independent of the number of taxa. DIPPER consistently outperforms existing methods in speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, and scales to tree sizes 1-2 orders of magnitude beyond the limits of existing tools. With the help of a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU, DIPPER is able to reconstruct a phylogeny from 10 million unaligned sequences in under 7 hours, making it the only distance-based method to operate at this scale and efficiency.

The results showed significant variations in morphological features, nutritional content, and bioactive compounds among the mushrooms grown on different substrates. Pleurotus ostreatus grown on oil palm fruit pressed fibers looked blossomed, tan in color, and matured faster, while those grown on cassava peels did not blossom, had a shiny white color, and matured late.

H. gallinarum is of particular concern because of its role as a vector for the protozoan Histomonas meleagridis, the cause of blackhead disease. Currently, only the benzimidazole anthelmintic, fenbendazole (FBZ), is approved for use in poultry, and recently, FBZ resistance has been discovered and validated in populations of the turkey ascarid Ascaridia dissimilis and in ascarid of gallinaceous birds H. gallinarum. Here, we further explore the prevalence of resistance in poultry ascarids by testing FBZ efficacy against thirteen isolates of A. galli and eight isolates of H. gallinarum. Isolates were used to infect day-old naive chickens. Four weeks after infection, animals to be treated received the label-recommended dosage of FBZ (SafeGuard Aquasol) for five days, per the manufacturer's directions. One week after the fifth day of treatment, animals were euthanized and parasite burdens were counted to determine treatment efficacy between the untreated and treated groups. Resistance was identified and validated in a single isolate of A. galli, marking the first confirmed case in the species. All isolates of H. gallinarum were found to be resistant. The emergence of resistance in A. galli and the high prevalence of resistance in H. gallinarum highlight the growing concern of resistance in parasites of poultry. Without approved alternative treatments, the detrimental effects of infections cannot be mitigated in resistant populations, significantly impacting profit margins. Diagnostics that enable broader surveys are necessary to understand the full scope of the problem. However, we show that resistance is present across production species and should act as an impetus for the discovery of new treatments and the adoption of new management strategies.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

In mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses such as dengue and yellow fever viruses, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity by targeting tight junction proteins (TJPs), thereby facilitating viral neuroinvasion. However, comparable mechanisms in TBEV remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the potential interaction of NS1 from high (Hypr)- and low (Vs)-pathogenicity TBEV strains to different blood-brain barrier (BBB) TJPs, using AlphaFold3 (AF3) multimer modelling and in vitro binding assays. We find that NS1 from the highly pathogenic strain exhibits higher predicted interactions with multiple TJPs, including two junctional adhesion molecules (JAM-A, JAM-B) and Claudin-10, which are critical component of the paracellular barrier. In contrast, low pathogenic strain Vs interaction was limited to JAM-A and Claudin-5. Experimental validation using recombinant NS1 proteins revealed strain-specific binding profiles: Hypr NS1 displayed high-affinity, saturable direct binding to immobilized JAM-A (KD = 0.271 ug/mL), whereas Vs NS1 showed negligible interaction (KD = 0.000023 ug/mL). No binding to ZO-1, a barrier scaffold lacking an extracellular domain, was observed for either strain. This differential interaction may be modulated by 22 specific amino acid substitutions localized to the Wing and {beta}-ladder domains, which distinguish the highly neurovirulent Hypr strain from the avirulent Vs strain. Notably, despite its weak JAM-A interaction, the Vs strain is associated with slow-progressing infections that can culminate in chronic neurological disease, highlighting the need for further investigation into noncanonical pathways of neuroinvasion.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

To address this limitation for further solution of microbial uncultivability, we developed a Gel Microdroplet Aggregate in Oil (GMD-agg) cultivation method. This method provides a high inoculum cell density (>108 cells/mL) but maintains pure cultures of each growth unit. Millions of hydrogel particles (10-30 {micro}m in diameter) entrapping single cells with medium softly aggregated in oil (GMD-oil cultivation) is the key structure of this method. In this study, to assess the effect of microbial interactions on the cultivation of environmental microorganisms, soil and activated sludge samples were cultured, and colony formation and diversity during cultivation in GMDs were investigated. Results showed that the cultivation efficiency of GMD-agg was approximately 10 times higher than that of the method in which microbial interactions were canceled. In addition, the growth of taxonomies containing many uncultured microorganisms, such as Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetia, Acidobacteria, and Vicinimibacteria, was observed. Furthermore, when isolated strains were co-cultured at high cell densities with either inter- or intra-species, we observed a higher cultivation efficiency than when microbial interactions were canceled. Rebuilding growth-promoting microbial interactions using isolated strains demonstrated that microbial interactions positively influence microbial growth.

ESBL-E infections lead to a worse treatment outcome and often require escalating antibiotic treatment to reserve antibiotics such as carbapenems. Understanding how these bacteria are transmitted within healthcare settings is complex and not well understood, but it is a requirement for effective infection prevention and control strategies. To what extent environmental ESBL-E reservoirs contribute to transmission is unclear. To accurately capture these reservoirs, laboratory processing of environmental samples needs to be optimised to reliably detect ESBL-E, which is challenging because they can be scarce and part of complex microbial communities. Here, we assessed screening methods for the detection of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) from environmental swabs taken from healthcare settings, testing different swab types, pre-enrichment conditions and selective agars. We show that a pre-enrichment of 18 hours significantly increased the recovery of 3GC-resistant gram-negatives. The choice of selective agar impacted the number of ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Kp detected. This also affected the number of samples requiring additional species confirmation, which is costly and time-consuming. For our use case and by considering additional factors such as cost and practical aspects, Membrane Lactose Glucuronide Agar supplemented with cefotaxime performed best for the combined detection of ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Kp. Our work will guide environmental surveillance of ESBL-E by providing optimised methods for laboratory processing of environmental samples from healthcare settings.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Upon exposure to additional stress by the addition of human urine, we further show that MG1655 induces infection related filamentation, and reversal back to rod shape when the stress is removed, indicating that infection related filamentation should be regarded as a stress response rather than a virulence factor.

Here, we investigate chitin synthase diversity, transcription and localisation in the saprotrophic chytrid Rhizoclosmatium globosum (Rg), expanding insights into fungal cell wall biology beyond Dikaryan models. We identified 20 chitin synthase genes in the Rg genome, including canonical Division I and II types, and a distinctive chitin synthase gene containing a glycoside hydrolase domain linked to glucan synthesis. Transcriptomic analysis through zoospore, germling and immature thallus developmental stages revealed stage-specific expression patterns, with active gene diversity correlating with increasing morphological complexity. Using electroporation-based transformation and fluorescent fusion constructs, we demonstrated successful expression and localisation of two chitin synthases during cell development. Localisation patterns showed dynamic redistribution from cytoplasmic dispersion in early encysted cells to concentrated signals at the sporangium wall. Expression in the apophysis and at the apophysis sporangium junction indicates the importance of these structures in cell maintenance. Our findings highlight functional specialisation among chitin synthases and underscore the importance of cell wall integrity in chytrid development.

While classical localization and functions of polysaccharides are well established, their presence and potential roles in the nucleus remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that N-glycans, a type of polysaccharides, are present in the cell nucleus and modify inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins across diverse cell types-a modification referred to as N-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation). N-glycosylation is enriched in chromatin regions marked by H3K9me3 and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons. N-glycosylation inhibition and INM protein N-glycosylation site mutation both downregulate H3K9me3 within lamina-associated domains (LADs) and lead to genomic instability. Mechanistically, N-glycosylation regulates the interaction between the histone H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 and INM proteins, promotes the association of SETDB1 with the INM, and maintains H3K9me3. Moreover, we reveal that canonical N-glycan biosynthetic machinery in ER contributes to the N-glycosylation of INM proteins. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized nuclear role for polysaccharides, broadening our understanding beyond their traditional subcellular distributions and functional profiles.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, analyzing the large and complex datasets generated by HTS presents significant bioinformatics challenges. The process of accurately identifying and characterizing viral sequences from assembled contigs remains a bottleneck, often requiring specialized expertise and involving non-standardized parameters. There is a pressing need for robust, user-friendly, and reproducible pipelines to streamline this post-assembly analysis. Results: To address these challenges, we developed ViralQuest, a bioinformatics tool that automates the in-depth characterization of viral sequences from pre-assembled contigs. The pipeline integrates multiple lines of evidence for robust identification, using Diamond BLASTx against the Viral RefSeq database and pyHMMER searches against the RVDB, Vfam, and eggNOG profile HMM databases. For detailed characterization, ViralQuest performs taxonomic classification based on the ICTV nomenclature and functional annotation via Pfam domain analysis. Novel features of ViralQuest include an AI-powered summarization module that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate contextual narratives for key viral findings and a comprehensive confidence score to rank putative viral contigs. All results are consolidated into a single, interactive HTML report that includes dynamic visualizations of contigs, ORFs, and protein domains, alongside detailed data tables that are exportable in TSV and SVG formats. Conclusion: ViralQuest provides an accessible and comprehensive solution for the post-assembly analysis of viral metagenomic data. By combining rigorous bioinformatics methods with novel AI-driven features and an intuitive reporting interface, it streamlines the complex process of viral identification and characterization.

Here, we present a minimal eco-evolutionary model that captures trade-offs between oncogenic and immunogenic mutations in cancer cell replication. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals a rich phase space, including an evolutionary bistable regime where both immunologically silent and mutationally active tumor strategies can coexist. Notably, the model explains two key eco-evolutionary mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy: preexisting resistance, driven by the persistence of silent clones within genetically unstable tumors; and immunoediting, where immune pressure selects for reduced antigenicity over time.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Pathogenesis severities resulting from Asian/American versus African ZIKV lineage infections range from mild to severe, respectively; however, mechanisms underlying differential ZIKV pathogenesis remain unclear, as do effective therapeutic strategies. The limitations of mechanistic understanding are due in part to the challenges of comparing data generated in disparate experimental models, as well as approaches that did not test both ancestral and contemporary ZIKV infections. The goal of this work was to define differential pathogenesis mechanisms among ancestral and contemporary ZIKVs by direct infection comparisons using a relevant human stem cell-derived cerebral organoid experimental model. While Asian/American ZIKV lineage infections enhanced antiviral and interferon gene expression responses that correlated with viral RNA clearance from organoid ventricles, ancestral African lineage ZIKV infections enhanced apoptotic and stress response signaling that correlated with diminished STAT2 signaling protein levels, ongoing ZIKV replication, and production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). We discovered that, surprisingly, severe ancestral Zika virus pathogenesis was dramatically reduced by Trolox, a hydroxyl radical scavenger antioxidant, thereby confirming ROS imbalance as a major pathogenesis driver. These results demonstrate that ZIKV lineage infections and pathogenesis are differentiated by their signaling responses and suggest that preventing or controlling hydroxyl radical imbalance may offer therapeutic benefits to address microcephaly and Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

The investigation into the role of cFos in IAV infection revealed increased apoptosis and elevated interferon-{beta} mRNA levels in cFos-knockdown A549 cells during IAV infection. This suggests that cFos may enhance cell survival and reduce interferon-{beta} expression during infection, thereby facilitating IAV proliferation. Furthermore, the levels of viral NA mRNA and the expression of late viral proteins NA and M2 decreased upon cFos knockdown. Overall, this study identifies cFos as a proviral factor for IAV, through the modulation of innate immunity and apoptosis during infection, and potentially by supporting the viral transcription.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

It causes acute and chronic infections and is notorious for its multidrug resistance and tolerance. To systematically uncover genetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited as therapeutic targets, we present a portable high-density CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library comprising >80000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting virtually all annotated coding sequences and intergenic regions of P. aeruginosa PAO1. This library was used to assess the genome-wide fitness landscapes under different growth conditions, uncovering gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes for more than a thousand genes upon depletion. Many of the phenotypes are likely caused by hypomorphic (partial loss-of-function) alleles that would not be easily accessible by traditional transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq). Focusing on central carbon metabolism, we reveal two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases as central, non-redundant nodes in glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth conditions that might be promising targets to redirect carbon flux away from metabolically persistent states associated with chronic infections. More generally, our comprehensive sgRNA libraries are a valuable resource to access genome-wide quantitative phenotypes through CRISPRi beyond the binary phenotypes offered by Tn-Seq.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, forest canopies also harbor a diverse and abundant bat community. In this study, we investigated the impact of flight interception traps and multi-funnel traps deployed in oak canopies on incidental bat captures, and evaluated whether trap modifications could reduce this bycatch. We also examined how these modifications influenced the species richness, abundance, and mean body size of several beetle taxa, including Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Cetoniinae, and Scolytinae. Both trap types captured bats. Flight interception traps collected seven species -Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, Myotis mystacinus, Nyctalus noctula, Nyctalus leisleri, Plecotus auritus, and Pipistrellus pipistrellus - with an average of 0.38 to 0.45 bats per trap. Multi-funnel traps primarily captured males of P. pipistrellus, with an average of 0.24 to 0.33 bats per trap. Adding a 13-mm mesh above the collection container significantly reduced bat bycatch to 0.02 to 0.05 bats per trap. This modification had no significant effect on insect species richness or mean body size, although it did reduce beetle abundance in Cerambycidae in black multi-funnel traps, and Scolytinae in flight interception traps, likely due to more frequent clogging by twigs and leaves. We recommend modifying flight interception and multi-funnel traps deployed in forest canopies to prevent unintentional harm to protected bat species.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

However, accurate registration out-of-the-box remains challenging when overt morphological phenotypes--such as those observed in developmental and comparative studies--are present in a dataset. A new label-informed image registration function developed in the ANTsX ecosystem provides an easy to use, generalizable solution for anatomy-aware registration of a wide diversity of morphological variation. In this approach, segmentations (i.e., labels) provide a priori regional correspondences that guide the registration. These labels can be generated by any method-manually, using semi-automated tools, or through deep learning-based approaches-and allow morphological experts to define regions of correspondence based on biological concepts of homology (e.g., tissue origin, gene expression patterns). Here we demonstrate the utility of this label-informed image registration approach for improving the registration knockout mouse embryos which fail to register to a wildtype (normative) template image by traditional registration methods. E15.5 Gli2-/- mouse embryos show a severe scoliosis and radical topological rearrangement of the internal organs. Compared to traditional, intensity only registration, the new label-informed image registration improved the correspondence of knockout subjects to the canonical template image, which resulted in increased power and sensitivity of downstream statistical analyses. All in all, label-informed image registration provides a flexible and customizable method to allow image registration in datasets for which registration-based morphometrics were previously unfeasible, unlocking new potential applications of registration-based morphometrics in developmental, comparative, and evolutionary studies.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Despite its importance, the seafood industry in this region is hindered by complex supply chains and insufficient regulation frameworks, which facilitate illegal practices, including mislabeling. DNA-based methods have emerged as essential tools for seafood authentication, helping to mitigate mislabeling and supporting conservation strategies. This study provides the first comprehensive review of DNA-based methods used globally to identify seafood species from the Eastern South Pacific Ocean. Historical and current techniques were systematically examined, with a focus on emerging technologies that offer promising applications in the field. Nearly three decades of research have enabled the successful identification of over 200 commercially valuable species using more than ten distinct DNA-based methods. Fish and mollusks constituted the most extensively studied seafood groups, with DNA sequencing emerging as the predominant technique. Furthermore, a global mislabeling meta-analysis, encompassing 1,806 seafood products from the Eastern South Pacific Ocean, revealed an estimated mislabeling rate of 24.8% (95% CI [22.9-26.9]). Notably, a substantial proportion of mislabeled and substituted products corresponds to highly threatened shark species. This raises serious conservation concerns, particularly given that nations bordering the Eastern South Pacific Ocean are major players in the global shark trade. Overall, the findings of this review underscore the urgent need to integrate advanced DNA-based techniques into existing regulatory frameworks.

The distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is governed in part by interference, which prevents multiple crossovers from occurring in close proximity, though not all crossovers are subject to interference. Neither the factors that control strength of interference, nor the extent to which they vary within and between species, are well understood. Here we confirm that that crossover interference is stronger in male than in female meiosis in house mice (Mus musculus), provide the first estimate of the proportion of non-interfering crossovers in female mice, and show that this proportion is lower than in males. Interference is stronger on shorter chromosomes in both sexes, but the frequency of interference escape is similar across the range of chromosome size. Together with evidence that interference varies across strains and subspecies, our results provide a foundation for studying the evolution and sexual dimorphism in this important feature of meiosis in mice.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

N.; Vaaga, C. E.", "abstract": "The ability to assess and rapidly respond to predator threats in the environment is necessary for survival and requires dedicated neural circuits for threat detection, sensorimotor integration, and execution of ethologically appropriate behavioral responses. Although numerous brain circuits are involved in these processes, the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) serves as an important central hub to generate ethologically appropriate passive and/or active defensive behaviors. Despite its central role in generating defensive behaviors, little is known about the intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons across columns in the PAG. To address this knowledge gap, we made whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings from unlabeled neurons in the vl- and dmPAG of mice. Consistent with in vivo work, our data highlights the relative importance of synaptic inhibition in both columns. Further, our results suggest that neurons in both the vl- and dmPAG prioritize frequency-invariant coding strategies, showing remarkably stable paired pulse ratios across interstimulus intervals. Despite this common theme, the underlying mechanism each column utilizes to achieve such frequency invariant coding is distinct, reflecting important differences in synaptic processing across columns. More specifically, while the vlPAG is relatively resistant to phasic short-term depression across stimulation frequencies, neurons in the dmPAG show a pronounced buildup of tonic/slow current during high frequency stimulation trains, which counteracts short-term depression of the phasic current amplitude observed during high frequency stimulation trains. This prolonged tonic current observed in the dmPAG prolongs the period of spike elevation, suggesting that high frequency stimulation may drive sustained activity in the dmPAG. Together, these results provide fundamental information of synaptic integration and network properties across columns in the PAG, which ultimately support their distinct roles in threat processing.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

M.; Chadderton, P.", "abstract": "Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) within the cerebellar cortex mediate feed-forward inhibition onto Purkinje cells, positioning them as pivotal modulators of cerebellar output. We asked how motor patterns and salient sensory input influence MLI population activity during active whisking and tactile interactions. Utilizing two-photon calcium imaging combined with high-speed videography, we examined MLI population dynamics in awake, behaving mice engaged in voluntary whisker movements. Our results demonstrate that during free whisking, MLI population activity reliably tracks whisker position, yielding uniform graded responses that provide stable and precise representations over time. Tactile contact with external stimuli evokes additional activation in a subset of MLIs. Sensory input transiently disrupts the linear relationship between MLI activity and whisker position and may account for rapid synchronous inhibition of Purkinje cell spiking activity following tactile stimulation. These findings indicate that MLIs in Crus 1 maintain an accurate internal model of whisker position which is perturbed upon encountering obstacles. This disruption likely reflects the integration of sensory feedback, disrupting predictive signals that are subsequently passed forward to Purkinje cells. Such signals can alert the brain to novel happenings and be used to update motor commands, thereby contributing to cerebellar function in response to environmental changes.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

In a human model-based EEG study, we augmented a canonical click-train evidence accumulation task with probabilistic cues to shape prior expectations and analysed all activity with trial-resolved linear encoding models. Probabilistic cues drove alpha-oscillatory EEG patterns and induced symmetric shifts in response bias but did not change temporal integration dynamics. Neural encoding strength in lateralised auditory cortex uniquely predicted single-trial choice and confidence beyond what was explained by evidence strength or cueing alone.

In the neural plate of Xenopus embryos, endogenous Wnt11 does not form an obvious gradient in the direction of PCP, but is polarized at cell boundaries together with core PCP components. Wnt11 polarization is dependent on core PCP components, while polarization of core PCP components can also be induced by Wnt11, indicating a mutual amplification loop between Wnt11 and core PCP components in PCP formation. Furthermore, Wnt11 and core PCP components compose an intercellular loop to coordinate the direction of polarity. Thus, we propose that local and reciprocal interactions between Wnt11 and core PCP components can generate PCP.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

NDE1 knockout leads to a caudal identity shift of neural progenitor cells in the organoids and mouse brains, coinciding with aberrant ERK signaling.

The molecular strategies that individual neuron types deploy to complete this complex process remain poorly understood. In this work, we used single nucleus multiome sequencing (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) to track the transition from specification to functional maturation in mouse skeletal motor neurons (SMNs). Our data show that individual SMNs undergo significant transcriptional changes as they mature, but more strikingly, we find that diversity within SMNs fluctuates dramatically as the functional needs of these cells change over time. At embryonic day E15.5, when motor axons are innervating their specific muscle targets, SMNs can be subdivided into dozens of transcriptional subclusters. These embryonic subclusters represent known motor columns and pools, which utilize column- and pool-specific genes to innervate unique muscle targets. About a week later, at postnatal day 3 (P3) many column- and pool-specific genes are downregulated or become broadly expressed and SMNs coalesce on the molecular level into a more homogenous state. These neurons then undergo a second round of diversification during the first two weeks of postnatal life (P3-P13), acquiring gene expression patterns that divide them into the functionally distinct alpha, gamma, and type3 subtypes found in adults. The fluctuations in SMN diversity go hand-in-hand with changes in accessible chromatin regions and transcription factor (TF) expression. Differential ATAC-seq peaks that define embryonic diversity are lost over time while new peaks that control expression in adult subtypes are gained. TFs that are known to regulate embryonic diversity are also downregulated over time, as a separate set of TFs that likely regulate adult subtype identities are upregulated. Our work uncovers a novel maturation trajectory for postmitotic neurons where extensive spatial diversity is first acquired in the embryo to ensure proper circuit wiring; this diversity is then lost as maturing neurons re-diversify into functional identities required for proper circuit firing in postnatal life. Therefore, all aspects of a neuron's identity - its morphology, circuitry, and electrophysiologically - may not be fully described by its gene expression program at adulthood, but instead is a culmination of transcriptional events that occur throughout its specification and maturation trajectory as the functional needs of the cells evolve.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Alteration in the gene coding {delta}-catenin has been implicated in many neurological disorders. Some of these genetic alterations exhibit a profound loss of {delta}-catenin functions in excitatory synapses. We have shown that {delta}-catenin deficiency induced by the homozygous {delta}-catenin knockout (KO) and autism-associated missense glycine 34 to serine (G34S) mutation significantly alters AMPAR-mediated synaptic activity in cortical neurons and disrupts social behavior in mice. Importantly, many genetic disorders are caused by haploinsufficiency. Indeed, {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency contributes to severe autism and learning disabilities in humans. However, previous studies have used only homozygous {delta}-catenin deficiency models. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency on animals' behaviors and excitatory synapses. Here, we use heterozygous {delta}-catenin KO and G34S mice as a {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency model to examine this idea. Multiple behavioral assays, a social behavior test, contextual fear conditioning, and an open field test, reveal that both {delta}-catenin KO and G34S haploinsufficiency significantly disrupt animals' social behavior and fear learning and memory. Interestingly, only KO haploinsufficiency mice show anxiety-like behavior. A biochemical assay using brain extracts demonstrates that {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency significantly affects the levels of synaptic {delta}-catenin and AMPARs.

Here, we examine how ACh modulates DD without invoking additional plasticity mechanisms. Using a cholinergic-sensitive Hodgkin-Huxley network of 200 neurons arranged in 2D space and stimulated via five spatially distinct inputs (A-E), we implemented an oddball paradigm with three conditions: standard (80% A, 20% B), deviant (20% A, 80% B), and a multi-standard control (20% each of A-E). ACh levels were controlled by the conductance of the slow K current. In the absence of ACh, the network already exhibited DD, responding more strongly to deviant A compared to control A. Notably, introducing a small amount of ACh amplified DD, while further increases suppressed it. Maximal DD occurred when strong spike frequency adaptation to standard B reduced competition, and enhanced phase-locking synchronized the network's response to deviant A. These findings reveal how neuromodulation can shape context-sensitive neural computation, optimizing detection of salient events through a dynamic balance of suppression and synchronization.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": ""}

Since heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) associate with Wnt on cell membranes, how HSPGs are involved in Wnt polarization and PCP formation is a central issue. Here, we show that HSPGs are dynamically organized in a polarized manner, as with core PCP components and Wnt11, by associating with them.
