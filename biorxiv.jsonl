Here, we developed highly sensitive sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines undergoing structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in rodent organotypic hippocampal slices. During sLTP, Rab10 was persistently inactivated (>30 min) in the stimulated spines, whereas Rab4 was transiently activated over ~5 min. Inhibiting or deleting Rab10 enhanced sLTP, electrophysiological LTP and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during sLTP. In contrast, disrupting Rab4 impaired sLTP only in the first few minutes, and decreased AMPAR trafficking during sLTP. Thus, our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab4 oppositely regulate AMPAR trafficking during sLTP, and inactivation of Rab10 signaling facilitates the induction of LTP and associated spine structural plasticity.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of designing experiments, with ad hoc decisions often resulting in suboptimal or even failed experiments. Bridging model and experiment via simulation can help solve this problem, leveraging advances in computational models to provide a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, we require an integrated approach that incorporates simulation of the experimental interface into computational models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of virtual recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. Notably, it is the only publicly available tool to date simulating two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, evaluate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

However, the fate of HFD-induced tanycytic neurogenesis, the functional attributes of the nascent neurons, and mechanisms underlying their subsequent integration into the feeding-related neural circuitry remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play crucial roles in adult neurogenesis. In this study, miRNA profiling of BrdU-labelled neurogenic {beta}2 tanycytes from HFD-fed mice identified a cohort of miRNAs that originate from different chromosomal loci rather than a single genomic cluster. Network analysis of predicted targets for these HFD-induced miRNAs identified key \"hub\" mRNA targets that influence neurogenesis and the functional integration of newborn neurons. These HFD-induced miRNAs promoted the differentiation of nascent neurons into orexigenic AgRP+ and anorexigenic POMC+ neurons. Interestingly, only AgRP+ newborn neurons were selectively integrated into the functional feeding circuit, as detected by c-Fos immunostaining. This integration was disrupted when HFD-induced miRNA activity was suppressed via hypothalamic miRNA sponge expression. Furthermore, HFD feeding increased body weight in female mice, which was abrogated upon the inhibition of HFD-induced miRNAs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed elevated liver fat in HFD-fed mice, which reverted to normal levels when the HFD-induced miRNAs in hypothalamic tanycytes were blocked. Collectively, the findings from our study highlight a miRNA-mediated paradigm that links HFD-induced neurogenesis from {beta}2 tanycytes to weight gain and liver fat accumulation, and identifies the selective integration of AgRP+ neurons into the feeding circuitry as a possible causality of HFD-induced changes to body weight.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Dugue, L.", "abstract": "The organization of the phase of electrical activity in the cortex is critical to inter-site communication, but the balance of this communication across large-scale (>8cm), macroscopic (>1cm) and mesoscopic (1cm to 1mm) ranges is an open question. Traveling waves in the cortex are spatial phase gradients, such that phase values change smoothly through the cortical sheet over time. Large-scale cortical traveling waves have been understudied compared to micro- or mesoscopic waves. The spatial frequencies (i.e., the spatial scales) of cortical waves have been characterized in the grey-matter for micro- and mesoscopic scales of cortex and show decreasing spatial power with increasing spatial frequency. This research, however, has been limited by the size of the measurement array, thus excluding large-scale traveling waves. Obversely, poor spatial resolution of extra-cranial measurements prevents incontrovertible large-scale estimates of spatial power via electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram. These limitations mean that the relative importance of large-scale traveling waves is unknown, and recent research has suggested waves measured extra-cranially are artefactual. We apply a novel method to estimate the spatial frequency spectrum of phase dynamics in order to quantify the uncertain large-scale range. Stereotactic electroencephalogram (sEEG) is utilized to leverage measurements of local-field potentials within the grey matter, while also taking advantage of the sometimes large extent of spatial coverage. Irregular sampling of the cortical sheet is offset by use of linear algebra techniques to empirically estimate the spatial frequency spectrum. We find the spatial power of the phase is highest at the lowest spatial frequencies (longest wavelengths), consistent with the power spectra ranges for micro- and meso-scale dynamics, but here shown up to the size of the measurement array (up to 8-16cm), i.e., approaching the entire extent of cortex. Low spatial frequencies dominate the cortical phase dynamics. This has important functional implications as it means that the phase measured for a single contact in the grey matter is more strongly a function of large-scale phase organization than local--within the same frequency band at least. This result arises across a wide range of temporal frequencies, from the delta band (1-3Hz) through to the high gamma range (60-100Hz).", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes. Here we show that pyramidal neurons play an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack layer 5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity and engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand-receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

We investigated the role of the PS in visual perceptual decisions by optogenetically stimulating striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway (D1-MSNs) of mice performing a visual change-detection task. PS D1-MSN activation robustly biased visual decisions in a manner dependent on visual context, timing, and reward expectation. We examined the effects of PS and DMS direct pathway activation on neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a major output target of the basal ganglia.

While variable across clades, we estimate an average lag-time from speciation to colonisation of ~8Myr, similar to time between speciation events. Concomitantly, the maximum proportion of co-occurrence is highest in old, species-poor clades, having had more time to accumulate locally. Phylogenetic patterns, previously interpreted as ecological limits to local richness, are consistent with slow, constant colonisation.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a major transcript category with relatively low expression and complex expression patterns that can be identified via RNA-seq. However, it is challenging to distinguish them from protein-coding genes because of their low abundance and tissue-specific expression. In the present study, we employed a dual sorghum reference genome scheme to identify 9467 (31.49% cultivar-specific) and 9551 (28.93% cultivar-specific) lncRNAs in sorghum cultivars BTX642 and RTX430, respectively. Our results showed that a few lncRNAs were linked to pre- and post-flowering drought tolerance in these two genotypes. The NPCTs encoded elements such as transposon-derived Pol polyproteins (RE-1, RE-2, TNT-1), pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, receptor-like protein kinases, zinc finger BED proteins, and putative disease resistance proteins, etc., suggesting their involvement in drought-specific phenotype development. Cis and trans acting targets for identified lncRNAs were predicted. The results showed that upregulated lncRNAs targeted C2H2, B3, putative zinc finger domain, Ras-related protein, L-ascorbate peroxidase-S, lanosterol synthase, and DUF domain genes during drought, which highlights their role in drought tolerance.

To investigate the spatial and cellular distribution of lncRNAs in the aging brain, we leveraged published spatial transcriptomics (ST), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and bulk RNA-seq datasets from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of ROSMAP participants with and without pathological AD. Results: LncRNAs exhibited greater subregion-specific expression than mRNAs, with enrichment in antisense and lincRNA biotypes. Subregion-enriched lncRNAs were generally not cell-type specific, and vice versa. Differential expression analysis of ST data identified AD-associated lncRNAs with distinct spatial patterns and moderate overlap with differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs from bulk RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment revealed their involvement in chromatin remodeling, epigenetic regulation, and RNA metabolism. We also identified AD DE lncRNAs across major brain cell types using snRNA-seq but overlap with ST DE lncRNAs was limited. Among previously reported lncRNAs, OIP5-AS1 was consistently upregulated in AD in all cortical subregions. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown of OIP5-AS1 in iPSC-derived microglia led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulation of DNA replication and repair pathways. Immunoassays confirmed increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The knockdown expression pattern was enriched for microglia-specific AD DE genes and microglia states. Conclusions: This study provides a spatial and cellular map of lncRNAs in the aging human cortex and identifies subregion- and cell-type-enriched DE lncRNAs in AD.

L.; Hahn, M. W.", "abstract": "Traditionally, the inference of species trees has relied on orthologs, or genes related through speciation events, to the exclusion of paralogs, or genes related through duplication events. This has led to a focus on using only gene families with a single gene-copy per species, as these families are likely to be composed of orthologs. However, recent work has demonstrated that phylogenetic inference using paralogs is both accurate and allows researchers to take advantage of more data. Here, we investigate a case in which using larger gene families actually increases accuracy compared to using single-copy genes alone. Long-branch attraction is a phenomenon in which taxa with long branches may be incorrectly inferred as sister taxa due to homoplasy. The most common solution to long-branch attraction is to increase taxon sampling to break up long branches. Sampling additional taxa is not always feasible, possibly due to extinction or limited access to high-quality DNA. We propose the use of larger gene families with additional gene copies to break up long branches. Using simulations, we demonstrate that using larger gene families mitigates the impacts of long-branch attraction across large regions of parameter space, especially when either maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood with a misspecified substitution model is used for inference. We also analyze data from Chelicerates, with a focus on assessing support for a sister relationship between scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Previous work has suggested that the failure to recover this relationship is due to long-branch attraction between pseudoscorpions and other lineages. Using data from larger gene families increases support for a clade uniting scorpions and pseudoscorpions, although other resolutions of this relationship continue to have higher support.

Although mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of Ab42 are established drivers of pathology, the mechanisms connecting amyloid toxicity with lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses remain poorly understood. Here, we employed complementary Drosophila and mouse models to dissect these relationships. Expression of AppNLG and Ab42 in Drosophila resulted in locomotor deficits, disrupted sleep, circadian rhythms, memory impairments, lipid accumulation, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammatory signatures. Comparable lipid metabolic disturbances and inflammatory alterations were detected in the AppNLG-F knock-in mouse model, underscoring their conserved relevance to AD pathogenesis. We further identified diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of triglyceride synthesis, as a critical modulator of AD-related phenotypes. Dgat2 expression was altered in both animal models and human AD tissues. Notably, panneuronal knockdown of Dgat2 in Drosophila attenuated lipid accumulation, restored synaptic integrity, and ameliorated locomotor and cognitive deficits, while also reducing neuroinflammation. Dgat2 suppression additionally improved sleep and circadian behavior, highlighting its pleiotropic protective effects. Together, these findings demonstrate a mechanistic link between amyloid pathology, lipid dysregulation, and neuroinflammatory processes. Targeting Dgat2 may therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract AD-associated metabolic and neuronal dysfunction.

Problem-solving, in turn, depends on goal-directed generation of novel thoughts and behaviors, which has been proposed to rely on internal representations of discrete units, or symbols, and processes that can recombine them into a large set of possible composite representations. Although this view has been influential in formulating cognitive-level explanations of behavior, definitive evidence for a neuronal substrate of symbols has remained elusive. Here, we identify a neural population encoding action symbols--internal, recombinable representations of discrete units of motor behavior--localized to a specific area of frontal cortex. In macaque monkeys performing a drawing-like task designed to assess recombination of learned action symbols into novel sequences, we found behavioral evidence for three critical features that indicate actions have an underlying symbolic representation: (i) invariance over low-level motor parameters; (ii) categorical structure, reflecting discrete types of action; and (iii) recombination into novel sequences. In simultaneous neural recordings across motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex, we found that planning-related population activity in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) encodes actions in a manner that, like behavior, reflects motor invariance, categorical structure, and recombination, three properties indicating a symbolic representation. Activity in no other recorded area exhibited this combination of properties. These findings reveal a neural representation of action symbols localized to PMv, and therefore identify a putative neural substrate for symbolic cognitive operations.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a disordered RGG peptide as a disassembly factor for mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates. Using yeast, mammalian cells, and in vitro assays, we observe that an RGG motif reduces condensate burden and toxicity while restoring nuclear localization and RNA regulatory defects associated with the FUS-P525L mutant. The RGG motif interacts with FUS, competitively inhibiting FUS self-association. Overall, our findings uncover a direct role for a disordered RGG motif in the disassembly of ALS-associated condensates, highlighting the possibility of a new therapeutic for post-symptomatic ALS.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

This shift can lead to an earlier and potentially longer growing season, which in turn may affect various plant-mediated ecosystem functions. Despite its relevance in the carbon cycle, we still know little about how earlier snowmelt impacts the carbon balance in ecosystems over the growing season, e.g., does it only shift phenology, or does it affect the overall carbon uptake? Most studies rely on interannual variability in snowmelt timing, making it difficult to isolate snowmelt effects from other confounding variables, e.g, temperature and moisture anomalies. To address this uncertainty, we investigated how experimentally advancing snowmelt affects the carbon cycling of montane meadows across the growing season. We experimentally advanced the snowmelt date in a montane meadow by approximately 12 days and collected data every two weeks throughout the growing season, including net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), plant composition, and shrub, graminoid, and forb biomass. Early in the growing season, GPP was higher in the early snowmelt plots, though this effect decreased as the growing season progressed. Our modeling of cumulative NEE showed that earlier snowmelt increased the carbon sink strength by 22%, with the strongest effect in the early spring and the effect diminishing as the growing season progressed, with control plots being a greater carbon sink in the later season. Graminoid biomass was 47% higher in plots with earlier snowmelt, but there was no change in total biomass. Synthesis: As winters warm and snowmelt occurs earlier, plant productivity will shift earlier in the growing season, and montane meadows will become a stronger carbon sink. However, this effect will differ seasonally, altering the carbon balance in montane meadows.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

It is widely believed in deep learning field that larger model performs better across tasks. However, for fitness prediction, language model performance declines beyond a certain size, raising concerns about their scalability. Here, we showed that model size, training dataset, and stochastic elements can bias the predicted p(sequence) away from real fitness. Model performance on fitness prediction depends on how well p(sequence) matches evolutionary patterns in homologs, which is best achieved at a moderate p(sequence) level for most proteins. At extreme predicted wild-type sequence likelihoods, models predict uniformly low or high likelihoods for nearly all mutations, failing to reflect the real fitness landscape. Notably, larger models tend to predict proteins with higher p(sequence), which may exceed the moderate range and thus reduce performance.

In this process, actin depolymerization factors (ADFs) function as key players through severing and depolymerizing actin microfilaments. However, recent evidence suggests that ADFs may possess non-canonical immune functions inside the nucleus, in addition to the canonic cytosolic role, a phenomenon not adequately explained by the traditional mechanistic model of ADF-actin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis ADFs exhibit a moonlighting function in the nucleus, where they interact with transcriptional machinery to regulate the transcriptome during both the resting state and the immune responses. We show that ADF2/3/4 have redundant functions in defense against virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. Notably, it is nuclear (rather than cytosolic) ADFs that contribute to defense against P. syringae and mediate pro-immune transcription. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that nuclear ADFs interact with transcription factors, histone complexes, and other components of the transcriptional machinery. Specifically, ADF2/3/4 can form a complex with WRKY transcription factors, such as WRKY22/29/48, thereby directly regulating WRKY activity to shape the pro-immune transcriptome. In summary, our study reveals that ADFs moonlight as direct regulators of transcription factors, mediating a broad range of nuclear-cytoplasmic regulation in plant immunity and potentially other biological processes.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine whether haptic force feedback from a simulated endpoint mass facilitates the De Novo learning of novel kinematic and dynamic mappings. We investigate this using a virtual 2D planar arm controlled via a bimanual robotic manipulandum. Human participants moved two handles constrained to 1D channels, with handle positions specifying shoulder and elbow joint angles. Across two days, they performed center-out and out-back movements under two experimental conditions. On Day 1, one half of the participants practiced with a purely kinematic arm, whereas the other half received continuous haptic feedback from an endpoint mass. Initially, intrinsic hand movements were often sequential, but participants rapidly adopted more coordinated control strategies, and trajectories became straighter with practice. Notably, the haptic feedback group exhibited significantly greater improvements in virtual arm control. On Day 2, we introduced a velocity-dependent curl field to both groups. The curl field initially resulted in curved, loopy paths, but participants gradually compensated, consistent with internal-model formation. Prior exposure to haptic feedback conferred a superior capacity to adapt to the novel dynamics, as evidenced by straighter trajectories and smaller directional biases throughout curl-field exposure. These findings suggest haptic feedback enhances sensorimotor learning, possibly by engaging distributed neural networks involved in motor skill acquisition.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

However, titania differs from the others as it supports the regrowth of normal skin tissue without scarring. This unique effect was hypothesised to result from its ability to suppress inflammation, possibly by interfering with the complement system. Ex-vivo whole blood experiments within the present study confirm that titania NPs significantly dampen the immune response and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis confirms that the nanoparticle binds with nanomolar affinity to complement C3, a central protein in the human innate immune system. To elucidate the molecular basis of this effect, we developed a novel cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) methodology capable of resolving the challenging interface between metal NPs and proteins. This approach revealed that TiO2 binds with high specificity to a single domain on C3. The NP restricts the conformational dynamics of C3 and thus blocks the initiation of the complement cascade. These structural and biophysical insights support the biochemical findings and previous observations within the contact system. Our method advancement demonstrates that cryo-EM can uncover physiologically relevant interactions between proteins and nanomaterials at high resolution and offers a strong foundation for others investigating metal-biological interactions.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

One key unresolved issue is whether prefrontal cortical outputs to motor-related subcortical regions carry predominantly motor commands or mixed sensory-motor signals. Retrograde optogenetics offers a powerful way to interrogate such projection-defined circuits, but its use in non-human primates has been limited. Here, we applied retrograde optogenetics in awake macaques to directly test the functional organization of the corticotectal projection from the frontal eye field (FEF) to the superior colliculus (SC). We asked whether FEF output to SC is motor-dominant or reflects sensory-motor convergence. Optical activation of this pathway evoked robust, contralateral saccades and selectively modulated reaction times, demonstrating its causal role in saccade generation. Optogenetically tagging FEF neurons projecting to SC revealed a heterogeneous population of visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons. This diverse output converged predominantly onto motor-related neurons in the SC. These findings support a visuomotor convergence model and resolve long-standing questions over the composition of FEF outputs. Additionally, our results establish retrograde optogenetics as a tool for dissecting projection-defined circuits in primates and for precisely probing the neural pathways that link perception to action.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Common and rare variations in SYNPO2L have been implicated in risk for heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF); however, little is known about the function or pathophysiological mechanism upon disease risk. Methods: The role of SYNPO2L was explored with human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) models of a rare splicing mutation rs766868752 differentiated into both atrial and ventricular lineages. Electrophysiology was assessed via multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and contractility was assessed using engineered heart tissues (EHTs). Genetic survival analyses were performed to explore the potential therapeutic role of the SYNPO2L_A isoform in AF risk after myocardial infarction. Results: hiPSC-CMs carrying the splice mutation rs766868752 resulted in preferential expression of the SYNPO2L_B isoform and absence of SYNPO2L_A isoform, and atrial hiPSC-CMs displayed significant differences in action potential durations when unpaced, and spontaneous extra-systolic beats when paced. Contractility of atrial hiPSC-CMs carrying the splice mutation was severely compromised. Electrophysiological differences were normalized and contractility was partially restored by overexpression with AAV:SYNPO2L_A. Absence of SYNPO2L_A in the mutant led to an observed decreased phosphorylation of YAP along with significant downstream transcriptional effects. A direct interaction between SYNPO2L_A and LATS2, a known regulator of YAP phosphorylation was found to occur in hiPSC-CMs. Additionally, a common variant time-to-event analysis may suggest a beneficial effect of the SYNPO2L_A isoform to lower the risk of atrial fibrillation after myocardial infarction. Conclusions: A rare splice mutation conferring isoform predominance of SYNPO2L_B appears to disturb the electrophysiology and contractility of atrial hiPSC-CMs via LATS2 phospho-regulatory effects upon YAP signaling. Supplementation of the SYNPO2L_A isoform can restore many functional deficits and supports a specific gene regulatory role for SYNPO2L in modulating the risk of AF and heart failure.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

While it has been central to their study for decades, no complete picture has emerged yet. Some of the most fascinating questions arise in the context of self-organised societies, like those of social insects, which coordinate their behaviour with completely decentralised simple decision-making performed by individuals that only have local information at their disposal. Based on empirical evidence, these collectives appear to balance task engagement globally across their whole task network for the benefit of the colony overall. How can this pro-social coordination be achieved by independently acting individuals? How is a global workforce balancing possible based on only local perception with no knowledge of the global colony status or needs? How can information flow through the task network, so that a changed task demand in one part of the network can lead to adjustments in distant other parts? We detail a model that presents a potential answer to this conundrum. Our model is informed by evolutionary game theory and rests on the assumption that the perception of an individuals sensory input can evolve.

However, it is unclear if oxidative stress ultimately increases to a point of cell death. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer strategy, it remains unknown whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and if it can be leveraged therapeutically. Using genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we performed tumor specific loss-of-function studies of the two key ferroptosis suppressors, glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (Fsp1), and observed increased lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis and robust suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumors are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that FSP1 was selectively required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout (Fsp1KO) tumors had an accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, dietary, or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of Fsp1 KO tumors in vivo. Unlike GPX4, FSP1 expression was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in LUAD patients, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic target. Moreover, given the critical role of GPX4 in multiple tissues, there is a greater therapeutic window for targeting FSP1. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models. Our studies highlight the importance of ferroptosis suppression in vivo and pave the way for FSP1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to improve disease outcome in lung cancer patients.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Further, if self-monitoring or error detection-related regions are also impaired (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), inner speech may be misattributed as external. We tested this proposal using neuroimaging meta-analyses, examining how the brain systems in overt and inner speech production in neurotypical participants overlap with findings from psychosis-spectrum participants performing a range of tasks. They showed increased activity in motor-related regions associated with inner speech (e.g., ventral premotor cortices) and decreased grey matter in bilateral auditory cortices and ACC, in regions specific to overt speech. Coactivation-based network analyses revealed that these ventral premotor and auditory regions form distinct, inversely coupled audiomotor networks. Classification suggests the ventral premotor network supports 'higher-level' language processing, while the audiomotor network supports 'lower-level' speech and self-referential processing. Overall, results accord with the proposal that psychotic symptoms like auditory verbal hallucinations derive from phenotypic hyperactivation in inner speech-related regions that yield affectively salient efference copy signals that are insufficiently suppressed and monitored as self-produced. In line with a hierarchical predictive-processing account, disruption of a distributed recurrent system distorts self-awareness and conscious experience.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

T.; Weaver, K. E.; Webb, S. J.; Ojemann, J. G.", "abstract": "Maturation of human brain structure has been well-studied, but developmental changes to brain physiology are not as well understood. One consistent finding is that the peak alpha rhythm frequency (PAF) increases throughout childhood. Another is that resting-state functional connectivity shifts from sensorimotor regions in children to association regions in adolescents, a reorganization along a hierarchy called the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. In mature brains, the S-A axis has been parcellated physiologically using the duration of persistent neural activity, known as the intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which increases along the hierarchy. Here we studied the development of PAF and INT in a cohort of epilepsy patients 3 to 33 years of age undergoing intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) monitoring. Given the well-known developmental trajectory of PAF, and the ability to delineate hierarchy using INT, we hypothesized that changes to PAF and INT would correlate across development, but that their relationship may be influenced by hierarchy. Consequently, we predicted that age-dependent PAF increases would accompany INT decreases, and we tested whether their relationship varied between sensorimotor and association regions. We found that PAF increased significantly with age in both sensorimotor and association regions, while age-dependent INT decreases were only significant in association regions. Supporting this finding, we found a strong negative relationship between PAF and INT that was specific to association regions. Together, our results suggest that developmental divisions across the S-A axis manifest in the relationships between neurophysiological measures, providing further evidence that asynchronous development along the S-A axis depends on maturation of brain function.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanisms of these conditions are not well understood, partly due to the lack of in vitro models that mimic endometrial physiology, which limits options for targeted intervention and treatment of these diseases. Mouse models are also inadequate, as common laboratory strains do not naturally undergo a menstrual cycle comparable to that of humans. This study addresses this need by developing a 3D multi-compartment assembloid that mimics the architecture of endometrial tissue and recapitulates all three phases of the menstrual cycle (proliferative, secretory, and menstrual regression) within a single platform. The cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) components in each compartment are carefully tuned based on a 3D spatial cellular map of endometrial tissue. The model contains endometrial epithelial cells enveloped in a basement membrane and endometrial stromal cells in a surrounding collagen-rich layer; this architecture allows realistic interactions between these cells and their respective ECMs. This assembloid successfully supports the controlled growth and organization of these cells, revealing reciprocal regulation of cell behavior and exhibiting compartment-specific hormonal responses, i.e., stromal decidualization. This platform enables the study of dynamic, phase-resolved, and compartment-specific paracrine signaling in human endometrial biology. By combining tissue-informed design, modular fabrication, and full-cycle hormonal responsiveness, this model sets a new benchmark for blastocyst implantation studies, organ modeling, and precision diagnostics in human reproductive health.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we systematically evaluated tilt increments of 1{degrees}, 2{degrees}, 3{degrees}, 5{degrees}, and 10{degrees} using lamellae from Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Keeping total electron dose constant, we found that finer tilt increments (1-3{degrees}) produced better-aligned tomograms with higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved outcomes in template matching and subtomogram averaging.

We leverage high-speed quantitative live imaging to extract the spectrum of possible ciliary beating patterns, and derive a dispersion relation coupling the temporal frequency and spatial wavelength of cilia oscillations.

How these progenitors emerge and persist during tumor progression remains unknown. Here, we elucidate a process that drives the emergence of SOX2+ metastatic progenitors in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). LUAD cells in the tumor invasive front and distant metastases express the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM, a marker of regenerative epithelial progenitors and a mediator of cell-basement membrane and cell-cell interactions. L1CAM-mediated adhesion to perivascular basement membrane is known to stimulate the proliferation of extravasated micrometastatic cells. We now identify a distinct and broader role of L1CAM as promoter of the SOX2+ LUAD progenitor state. We show that L1CAM at cell-cell interfaces promotes the assembly of the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex in metastatic LUAD progenitors. L1CAM-dependent PCP acting through a non-canonical WNT signaling activates c-Jun, which cooperates with the chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 to drive SOX2 expression and metastatic activity. This axis sustains the tumor-initiating and regenerative capacity of LUAD progenitor cells. By illuminating the role of L1CAM and PCP signaling in the generation of SOX2+ LUAD progenitors, our findings identify potential new targets to treat metastatic cancer.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Structural studies of RAS proteins bound to non-hydrolysable GTP analogs have revealed snapshots of the enzyme in its possibly active form. Yet, the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis has not been structurally resolved3. To visualize this reaction in real time, we performed time-resolved crystallographic experiments employing a photolabile caged-GTP substrate. Fifty-seven distinctive reaction intermediates were captured during hydrolysis of a live GTP for N-RAS, the oncogenic mutants G12C, G12V and Q61L; and Y32R, a fast hydrolytic mutant. The reaction mechanisms and rates for the native and each of the mutants differed significantly; however, they shared common elements: an initially catalytically-defective open state, which transitions into the closed Michaelis complex state with solvent-assisted O3B-P{gamma} bond lengthening and breaking, followed by the release of the Mg2+ stabilized PO3-/PO4-3 species and unfolding of the switch loops. Given the conserved nature of GTP- and ATP-ases active sites, this structural work lays the basis to understand the universal mechanism of {gamma}-phosphate hydrolysis4. Furthermore, search for cryptic binding sites during GTP hydrolysis in G12C, G12V, and Q61L mutants reveals the presence of distinctive state-dependent binding pockets that could be targets for structure-based drug discovery of experimentally resolved intermediates states.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Although often benign, PPGLs can metastasize unpredictably, with limited therapeutic options once disseminated. Progress has been hindered by the lack of robust preclinical models, especially those that capture their molecular complexity and microenvironmental influences. To address this gap, we established patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from 35 PPGLs, encompassing a broad spectrum of clinical and molecular phenotypes. The organoids retained key immunohistochemical, genomic, transcriptomic, and catecholamine-secretory features of their parental tumors. PPGL organoids cultured under hypoxic conditions generally exhibited enhanced viability, supporting hypoxia as a driver of cell survival. Hypoxia activated HIF-1a and expanded ASCL1+ cell populations, suggesting a lineage shift toward an immature chromaffin state. In contrast, long-term normoxic cultures activated hypoxia inducible factor 2a (HIF-2a) and acquired a hybrid sympathoblast-mesenchymal identity in subpopulations with upregulation of extracellular matrix and cell cycle markers, independent of genotype. These features resemble high-risk neuroblastoma subtypes and establish a molecular parallel suggestive of shared lineage plasticity and pathogenic programs, detectable in primary PPGLs. Drug screening across a library of up to 51 drugs and combinations revealed both shared and unique vulnerabilities, with response rates to approved therapies matching clinical observations. The CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, previously unexplored in PPGLs, elicited the strongest activity. Abemaciclib responsive PDOs and their matched tumors, including a metastatic sample, exhibit ed epithelial mesenchyme transition enrichment, nominating potential biomarkers for patient stratification. Our results establish PDOs as a novel platform for modeling neuroendocrine tumor biology, reveal microenvironment-driven plasticity in PPGLs, with potential translational relevance, and identify actionable vulnerabilities in a disease with few effective systemic therapies.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

In 190 healthy adults (aged 20-94 years) we collected diffusion tensor imaging scans and multiple tests of working memory and EF. Deterministic tractography was used to generate CTC tracts from which white matter metrics (mean, radial, axial diffusivities) were extracted. General linear model results indicated that reduced white matter integrity (i.e., higher diffusivity) was associated with significantly poorer EF performance in an age-dependent fashion. Higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivities in fronto-cerebellar white matter was associated with lower EF scores in older, but not younger, adults. These findings suggest CTC white matter connectivity is important for executive function performance and lend mechanistic evidence to the role of the cerebellum in age-related differences in higher-order cognitive operations.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Condensates are viscoelastic materials that display composition-specific rheological properties and responses to mechanical forces. Graph-based descriptions of microstructures can be combined with computational rheometry to model the outcomes of passive and active mechanical measurements. We consider two types of network models for microstructures. In the Jeffreys model, each edge in the network is a Jeffreys element. In the Stokes-Maxwell model, each edge is a Maxwell element that is embedded in an incompressible viscous fluid that can undergo Stokes flow. We describe results from comparative assessments of the two models for individual elements, ordered lattices, random geometric graphs, structured graphs, and graphs for condensates that are extracted from coarse-grained simulations of disordered proteins. Results from deformation and relaxation tests and flow field analysis reveal how distinct length and time scales contribute to the responses of different types of networks. No single test provides definitive assessments of the connections between material properties and microstructures. Instead, a range of active and passive rheometric tests are essential for distinguishing the responses of different types of networks.

In females, the reproductive cycle lasts 31 days and approximately 10 oocytes are ovulated per cycle. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) play a crucial role in marsupial conservation, but developing protocols to harvest large numbers of oocytes remains a key challenge. Specifically, producing sufficient mature metaphase II (MII) oocytes in dunnarts continues to be difficult. Ovarian follicle stimulation is common practice to achieve superovulation in many species and typically requires treatment of prepubertal female animals to avoid the impacts of endogenous hormone cycling. Alternatively, adult females can be stimulated during the intermediate or follicular phase. In this study, we aimed to develop a high-yield induced-ovulation protocol to collect higher number of MII oocytes from adult, cycling, female dunnarts. We first synchronized the female dunnart reproductive cycles using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The reproductive cycles were monitored by examining cytology of vaginal lavage samples. After administering four LHRH injections given at three-day intervals, 88.9% (n=36) of the adult female dunnarts responded to the treatment, with their estrous cycles synchronized at the diestrous stage. We then induced ovarian follicle development through two PMSG injections over 6 days, followed by hCG administration to trigger ovulation. By combining estrous cycle synchronization with PMSG stimulation, we achieved 77.8% (n=36) ovulation success and obtained an average of 20.1{+/-}9.1 (n=28) MII oocytes per adult dunnart. These data demonstrated that estrous cycle synchronization followed by the PMSG-hCG treatment yields consistent, highly efficient induced-ovulation in adult dunnarts.

For example, the order-level relationships among chondrichthyans are still contentious despite the use of phylogenomic data. To address systematic errors, complex models have been developed, and filtering for less erroneous data shows great promise. Current metric-based filtering methods rank loci based on overall tree statistics, but problematic signals are often local; and topology-based data filtering approaches struggle with circular assumptions. In this study, we introduced two novel metric-based data filtering methods based on the ratio of local branch length or GC content between problematic clades. We applied these methods to a dataset of 4,452 single-copy exons extracted from 98 chondrichthyan species. The results using all loci showed that the Hexanchiformes was positioned at the root of Elasmobranchii, pulling other squalomorphs to the basal position and rendering Squalomorphii paraphyletic. Contrastingly, filtering for loci with more even branch length, the branch ratio method (absRatioLen) strongly supported the monophyly of all superorders of the chondrichthyans as well as their higher classification grouping, such as Selachii and Batoidea.

Primary human bladder urothelial and fibroblast cells were immortalized by introducing the human CDK4R24C and TERT genes.

Our previous study in stroke patients revealed a significant increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) immediately (hyperacute) and downstream of the ischemic ictus, within the arterial compartment. The present study investigated the source, inciting factors, and role of IFN-gamma in a preclinical murine model. Stroke was produced using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and immune cells within the arterial vasculature distal to the occlusion (pre- and post-occlusion) were characterized using flow cytometry. Compared with the control samples, the post-occlusion samples presented an increase in IFN-gamma+ and CD69+ cells, whereas no significant increase was detected in IL17+, IL4+, and CD25+ cells. Further analysis of the IFN-gamma+ population revealed two novel attributes. First, interrogation of the identity of these IFN-gamma+ cells revealed that the increase in IFN-gamma production was largely driven by CD14+ cells in the post-occlusion sample, with negligible contributions from other canonical IFN-gamma-producing cells (CD4, CD8). Second, the IFN-gamma+ cells exhibited two distinct clusters, an IFN-gammalow and an IFN-gammahi population. Further analysis revealed that the IFN-gammalow population was largely composed of CD14+ cells, whereas the IFN-gammahi population was dominated by CD4+ T-cells.

Co-culturing of naive splenocytes with OGD-treated CNS cells and OGD-derived supernatant resulted in a significant increase in IFN-gamma+CD14+ cells, as compared to normoxic controls, an effect that coincided with marked loss of DAPI+ and NeuN+DAPI+ cells in mixed cortical (neuronal and glial) cultures. In summary, this study identified intra-arterial CD14+ monocytes as novel early sources of IFN-gamma in the hyperacute phase of stroke, a role traditionally attributed to adaptive immune cells. Using in vivo and in vitro ischemia models, the findings reveal that injury-associated signals from CNS cells are sufficient to directly induce IFN-gamma production in CD14+ cells, redefining early stroke immunopathology and uncovering a potential target for timely immunomodulation.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

X.; Li, J.-M.; Huang, H.-J.", "abstract": "Plants rely on receptor-like proteins and receptor-like kinases (RLPs/RLKs) to detect a variety of invading pathogens and insects. However, it remains unclear how these invaders are able to overcome receptor perception and disable the plant signaling pathways. Here, we show that whiteflies and planthoppers independently evolve salivary effectors to target defensive RLP4, therefore minimizing the plant immunity. RLP4 is a leucine-rich repeat RLP (LRR-RLP) that confers plant resistance against herbivorous insects by forming RLP4/SOBIR1 complexes. In whitefly Bemisia tabaci, BtRDP is an Aleyrodidae-restricted protein that attaches to salivary sheath. It interacts with RLP4 from different plants, causing the degradation of RLP4 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner. Transgenic plants overexpressing NtRLP4 exerts a detrimental impact on B. tabaci by exploiting the crosstalk between the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. Conversely, the overexpression of BtRDP or silencing of NtRLP4 effectively alleviates such negative effects. In planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a Delphacidae-restricted salivary protein NlSP694 also targets and promotes degradation of OsRLP4 from rice plants. Our results reveal the convergent evolution of salivary proteins in insects, and shed lights on the complex interactions between plants and herbivorous insects.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Yet, microbial eukaryotes like Amoebozoa, an ancient and morphologically diverse lineage, remain critically underrepresented in genomic repositories. This has limited our ability to address fundamental questions in eukaryotic evolution. The Protist 10,000 Genomes (P10K) initiative seeks to fill this gap by generating and compiling genome- and transcriptome-level data for a wide range of microbial eukaryotes. To ensure the reliability of these resources, accurate taxonomic identification and contamination screening are vital. In this study, we aimed to assess the taxonomic consistency and integrity of the P10K database with a phylogenetic-based approach using Amoebozoa as a case study. Results: Through SSU rDNA/rRNA and COI phylogenetic reconstructions this study confirmed several initial taxonomic identifications provided in the P10K database, resolved ambiguities at higher taxonomic levels, and corrected misassignments among morphologically similar but phylogenetically distant taxa. Moreover, the contamination screening using SSU rDNA/rRNA revealed several amoebozoan data that are contaminated by sequence from other eukaryotic taxa, representing contaminated genomic assemblies. Conclusion: Phylogenetic placement coupled with contamination screening enabled us to distinguish the higher-quality Amoebozoa datasets currently available in the P10K database from those requiring decontamination or additional sequencing before downstream use. These findings serve as a reference for the future use of these data and as a guide for further sequencing efforts aimed at expanding the taxonomic diversity of Amoebozoa represented at the genomic level. By applying a phylogenetic survey to the Amoebozoa data, we present a framework that can be extended to other microbial eukaryote lineages. Addressing imprecise taxonomic identifications and contamination in certain P10K datasets, as well as data reproducibility, will further enhance the value of this unprecedented genomic resource for protists, with significant potential to illuminate the evolution and diversification of eukaryotic life.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Using differential expression analysis and correlation meta-analysis across cohorts, we identified an expression signature with several lncRNAs, including LEF1-AS1 and DOCK8-AS1, that exhibit conserved transcriptional activation following vaccination. Correlation of lncRNA expression with gene targets and IgG titers revealed putative roles for lncRNAs in regulating and/or participate in both innate immune responses and adaptive antibody production. Functional enrichment of lncRNA co-expressed protein-coding genes highlighted involvement in T-cell differentiation, interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation. Integrating global run-on sequencing data and comparative transcriptomic analysis across other vaccine studies suggests that LEF1-AS1 modulation is distinctively associated with Ebola vaccination.

While the type II IRES of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV, an aphthovirus) has been shown to depend on the oncoprotein ITAF45, also known as Proliferation-Associated 2G4 (PA2G4) or ErbB-3 receptor Binding Protein (EBP1), for in vitro assembly of the 48S pre-initiation complex, some related type II IRESs, such as that of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, a cardiovirus), can form the initiation complex independently of ITAF45. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identified knockouts of PA2G4/EBP1/ITAF45 in cells that survive EMCV infection, suggesting an important role for this factor. We show that the p48 isoform of ITAF45, but not the p42 isoform, is crucial for efficient EMCV/Mengovirus replication and for propagation of replicons in human cell culture. Loss of ITAF45 markedly diminishes EMCV and FMDV IRES activities, which can be rescued by re-expression of ITAF45-p48. Interestingly, cell-free translation assays reveal that EMCV IRES activity is less ITAF45-dependent in vitro, in contrast to FMDV, raising questions about the versatile functions of ITAFs in IRES-driven translation.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are particularly sensitive to their solution conditions such as ionic strength and molecular crowding, and their dynamic structural ensembles rapidly respond to the cellular environment. While structural mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are uniquely able to capture aspects of this structural diversity, technical limitations have largely precluded the use of native MS approaches to interrogate the conformational rearrangements of IDPs in response to high concentrations of non-volatile salts. Here, we overcome this challenge by employing sub 100-nm nanopipette electrospray emitters for more gentle and salt-tolerant analysis to study the conformational distribution of -Synuclein (S) using native MS and ion mobility-MS in varied solution conditions, including in phosphate buffered saline. We show using native MS that it is possible to capture salt and buffer induced changes in the S conformational ensemble when using traditional biochemical buffers, which reflect structural changes from in silico predictions and in-solution measurements. This work demonstrates the power of nanopipette emitters for the study of IDPs, and establishes native MS as a method that can be routinely used to determine how solution conditions tune the conformational landscape of IDPs.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Across 29 diverse populations of \"wild tomatoes\", leaves developed under high light intensity benefit more from amphistomy in terms of CO2 assimilated for a given stomatal conductance than plants developed under low light. Furthermore, populations native to open habitats benefit more from amphistomy than those from more closed habitats. Thus, plasticity and adaptation together may explain why amphistomatous leaves are prevalent in sunny, open habitats, including many crops.

Here, we present a compartmentalized microfluidic co-culture platform that enables spatially controlled interactions between primary cortical neurons and adult microglia from wild-type (WT) and APP-transgenic mice. This system allows precise functional analysis of microglia-synapse interactions under defined inflammatory conditions. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, APP microglia exhibited exaggerated morphological activation, elevated IL-1{beta} secretion, and selectively increased engulfment of synaptic material. In contrast, phagocytosis of non-specific substrates such as pHrodoTM Zymosan remained unchanged, suggesting a substrate-specific enhancement of microglial phagocytic activity. Blocking the complement receptor CD11b abolished the LPS-induced increase in synaptic uptake, confirming the role of complement-dependent pathways. Transcriptomic profiling revealed robust inflammatory responses in both genotypes, with selectively heightened expression of proinflammatory genes in APP microglia, consistent with a primed immune phenotype. Importantly, increased synaptic uptake occurred without measurable loss of global synaptic connectivity, highlighting the specificity and sensitivity of the system to detect microglial functional changes.

Whether these responses require conscious emotion recognition is debated. Here, we examined the relationship between visual awareness and physiological arousal in response to emotional faces. We recorded facial electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and pupil dilation during the presentation of fearful, happy, and neutral faces, as well as their phase-scrambled versions, to the left eye. Meanwhile, rapidly changing Mondrian patterns were displayed to the right eye to suppress the left-eye stimuli. Participants pressed a button when they noticed a change from the flickering mask. This setup allowed us to compare behavioural and physiological responses during conscious versus subconscious processing of emotional content. Results showed faster breakthrough times for happy faces and moderate physiological responses to emotional information, even without conscious perception. Specifically, pupils and facial EMG were more responsive to fearful than to happy or neutral expressions. EDA was higher for faces compared to control stimuli, regardless of the emotional expression. Once visual awareness was established, emotional expressions elicited distinct responses that aligned with the perceived emotion. An exploratory analysis revealed a negative correlation between pupil dilation and autistic, alexithymic, and schizotypal traits, whereas empathy traits correlated positively. Our findings highlight the role of subcortical visual processing in detecting emotionally relevant stimuli and show that social abilities are linked to the physiological processing of emotions at a subconscious level.

One such transporter, plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, Slc29a4), attenuates both dopamine and serotonin signaling. An absence of selective pharmacological inhibitors means genetically modified mice constitutively deficient in PMAT remain the best tool with which to study PMAT's organism-level functional effects. Fear conditioning is a high arousal process. Generalization of fear is an evolutionarily advantageous process, whereby information learned from one experience is applied to other new but similar encounters. Pathological fear generalization, in contrast, is a core feature of most anxiety disorders. Given our previous findings indicating PMAT function reduces male mice's context fear and enhances extinction of female mice's cued fear, we hypothesized that PMAT would similarly reduce generalization (i.e., enhance discrimination) of context and cued fear in male and female mice, respectively. Our context and cued fear conditioning experiments in adult PMAT wildtype (+/+) and heterozygous (+/-) male and female mice partially supported our hypotheses. We discovered PMAT functions to facilitate extinction of contextually generalized fear, plus subsequent extinction of context-specific fear, selectively in females. Moreover, when specific fear cues or contexts were temporally presented before cues or contexts that were similar enough to make generalization possible, PMAT enhanced biological sex differences. Growing evidence reports common PMAT polymorphisms elicit measurable effects when PMAT function is reduced. Thus, we suspect future experiments may reveal positive associations between PMAT polymorphisms and risk for anxiety disorder symptoms, particularly in people assigned female at birth.

Flower-bacteria interactions can strongly affect plant ecology, and the identities of epiphytic flower bacteria are relatively well documented. Yet little is known about how the abundance of epiphytic bacteria on flowers changes over time. In this field study, we quantified how the abundance of culturable epiphytic bacteria on flowers changed as flowers aged and how abiotic factors influenced bacterial abundance and flower longevity. To accomplish this, we sampled flowers from anthesis to senescence of 8 plant species that varied substantially in terms of flower longevity and comprised 8 different genera from 7 different families. As expected, flowers of all plant species accumulated more bacteria with age. However, plant species with longer-lived flowers accumulated bacteria relatively more slowly, suggesting such plant species may have evolved more effective antibacterial defenses. Although elevated temperature is often expected to boost bacterial growth and diminish flower longevity, temperature was negatively associated with both flower longevity and bacterial accumulation, suggesting that changes to flower longevity strongly affect bacterial populations. In contrast, precipitation was positively associated with flower longevity and negatively associated with bacterial accumulation, likely because precipitation reduced plant water stress while also dislodging bacteria from flowers.

While most studies focused on the impact of partition models on the tree topology, little is known about the impact on divergence time estimation. Furthermore, although modeling among site rate variation within a partition is common practice, the extent of substitution rate variation among partitions is less explored. Here we study the impact of four partition model strategies: (i) no subdivision of the data (uniform), (ii) partitioning by gene, (iii) partitioning by codon position, and (iv) partitioning by both gene and codon position (combine). We explore the impact of partition models on divergence time estimation in fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). To this end, we sequenced mitochondrial genomes from 22 firefly species from Europe and Central America and combined these with 82 published mitochondrial genomes. Our results represent the most comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny of fireflies to day. While the partition models had an impact on the inferred tree topology, the divergence times were almost not affected.

Despite its global distribution, the current Old-World demography of the wild and captive BSF populations remains poorly understood. This work combined whole-genome sequencing and population genomic analyses to determine the genetic diversity, population structure, and historical spread of global wild and captive BSF populations. Our results reveal that most global captive BSF lines were largely derived from a single primary captive lineage, likely from North America. In contrast to the genetically diverse and geographically structured wild populations, captive populations consistently exhibited reduced heterozygosity, elevated inbreeding, and extensive runs of homozygosity. These patterns reflect demographic processes such as founder effects and genetic drift, rather than intentional selection or domestication. This strongly highlights the lasting genomic impact of human-mediated dispersal and uncoordinated breeding practices.

Inspired by herbivore rumen microbiome, we engineered bottom-up anaerobic fungal-bacterial consortia for direct conversion of lignocellulose to medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Initial screening experiment identified a newly isolated fungal strain, Neocallimastix sp. FC1, in co-culture with the bacterial strain Megasphaera hexanoica, as an optimal co-culture pair, achieving 21.0 % (carbon-to-carbon basis) lignocellulose-to-MCFAs yield. Lactate, the main fermentation product of Neocallimastix sp. FC1 and primary substrate for M. hexanoica, was undetectable in co-culture suggesting tight cross-feeding.

L.; Sharma, S.; Youssif, A. A.; Thomson, B. R.; Johnson, M.; Scott, E. A.", "abstract": "Nanocarriers hold transformative potential for treating anterior segment eye diseases, yet corneal epithelium impermeability necessitates intraocular injection. Given the discomfort and infection risk, an injectable hydrogel-based depot offers a promising strategy for sustained nanocarrier delivery in intraocular therapy. However, because the aqueous humor is a large, fluid-filled environment, achieving spatially confined gelation remains a key challenge as injected materials rapidly diffuse. Herein, we present a composite hydrogel (C-gel) that enables localized in situ gelation and sustained nanocarrier release within the anterior chamber. This is achieved using poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) filomicelles (FMs), whose filamentous structure confines crosslinking reactions spatially, promoting efficient gel formation. As a result, 90% of the injected polymer is retained within the crosslinked hydrogel matrix. Embedded FMs then undergo oxidation-induced cylinder-to-sphere transitions, facilitating gradual release of micellar nanocarriers. The rheological properties, gelation timing, and microstructure of the C-gel are adjustable, allowing precise control of nanocarrier release dynamics. In vivo evaluation in mice confirmed excellent biocompatibility without inducing intraocular pressure elevation, ocular toxicity, or immune cell infiltration. Sustained release of nanocarriers was observed for over a month under conditions mimicking that of the anterior chamber of the eye, underscoring the potential of C-gels for long-term drug delivery in anterior segment eye diseases therapy.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Rodlets form hierarchical structures where they are bundled and densely aligned, contributing to the hydrophobicity of the mycelium surface. However, the formation mechanism of the hierarchical structures is completely unknown. In this study we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly observe the structural dynamics of hierarchical structure formation by hydrophobin RolA from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae at a single-fibril level and revealed its mechanism. The elongation of rodlets occurred at both ends and was discontinuous, alternating between periods when they could elongate (growth state) and could not elongate (pause state). This suggests an equilibrium of two distinct structural states at the rodlet ends. We also discovered an aggregation pathway, termed surface-catalyzed elongation, in which elongation is promoted by lateral interactions between bundled rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation decreased the energy barrier of both structural switching between growth and pause states and elongation at rodlet ends, doubling the elongation rate in bundled rodlets. The rodlet surface could be considered as a catalyst for the elongation of neighboring rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation could contribute to rodlet bundling, whereby rodlets tend to form oriented domain structures, and our Monte Carlo simulations confirmed this. Surface-catalyzed elongation may be a universal concept to explain the hierarchical assembly mechanism of amyloid fibrils, so it could contribute to the advancement of amyloid research in general.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Our group previously identified the chemokine receptor CCR10 as a potential alternate target to address this need. Here, we validated CCR10 expression on primary myeloma tumors and sought to develop CAR T-cells against CCR10, utilizing its natural ligand CCL27 as a CAR binding element. However, CARs based on the native CCL27 sequence were ineffective. We thus utilized computational modeling and structure-guided engineering to inform rational mutations along the CCL27-CCR10 interface, exploiting a hydrophobic pocket on CCR10. This effort identified CCL27 mutants with an additional N-terminal aromatic amino acid that dramatically improved the efficacy of CCL27-based CAR-Ts to near that of current anti-BCMA CAR-Ts. We validated key amino acid contacts at the CCL27-CCR10 interface, which contribute to increased CAR binding avidity, predicted to be influenced by increased Van der Waals interactions. Lastly, we found that the CCL27 mutants have no toxicity in the hematopoietic compartment.

ACTs consist of an artemisinin and a longer-lived partner drug, which is often a quinoline. Given that heme is central to the mechanism of action of artemisinins and some quinolines, we hypothesized that these antimalarials would exhibit strong drug-drug interactions. Previous studies using standard 48 h or 72 h assays identified additive to mildly antagonistic interactions between artemisinins and quinolines. Here, we sought to re-evaluate these interactions using a pulsing assay that better mimics the short in vivo half-life of artemisinins. We found that chloroquine (CQ), piperaquine (PPQ), and amodiaquine substantially antagonize dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolite of artemisinins. CQ-DHA antagonism was notably exacerbated in CQ-resistant parasites, resulting in a superantagonistic phenotype in isobolograms. Further, we found that CQ co-treatment conferred artemisinin resistance to Kelch 13 wild type parasites in the ring stage survival assay. Using a small molecule probe to measure chemically reactive heme in live parasites, we determined that quinolines block artemisinin activation by rendering cytosolic heme inert. Finally, we probed beyond traditional ACTs, evaluating interactions of the proposed triple ACT, DHA-PPQ-Mefloquine, as well as OZ439-quinoline combinations, which were all found to be antagonistic.

However, the molecular mechanisms of nociception in cephalopods are still poorly characterised and it is important to address this knowledge gap to better understand cephlapods capacity to express pain states. Here we describe a bioinformatic pipeline utilising conserved nociceptive genes, to identify the orthologous candidates in the Octopus vulgaris transcriptome. We identified 51 genes we predict to function in nociception.

Independent pairwise matrices (pathogen * immune-perturbation; pathogen * niche) yielded an interpretable systems readout - diagnostic breadth - which, together with niche use, separated keystones with 93% cross-validated accuracy and showed significant group differences (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.026) (Fig. 2). At the micro level, focusing of memory on keystone-patterned epitopes creates niche-matched vulnerability to modified-self ligands, offering a mechanism for autoimmune and drug-hypersensitivity syndromes. In the same way, fast-evolving RNA viruses exploit keystone-established hierarchies by inflating immunodominant but mutable decoy epitopes that re-engage familiar memory while offering little control; unless immunogens exclude such decoys and force recognition of conserved, functionally constrained sites, vaccine responses are diverted and outpaced by host-specific adaptation.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A using harmine induces cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) MI. Here, we developed a computational network model of DYRK1A-mediated regulation of the cell cycle, which predicts how DYRK1A inhibition promotes cardiomyocyte re-entry. To validate these predictions, we tested selective DYRK1A inhibitors and observed robust induction of cell cycle activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Integrating our network model with bulk RNA-sequencing data from DYRK1A inhibitor-treated NRCMs, we identified E2F1 as a key transcriptional driver of cell cycle gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that both pharmacological and post-developmental inhibition of DYRK1A enhances heart function and increases cardiomyocyte cycling following I/R MI.

This revealed object category pairs associated with EBA activity, leading to the hypothesis that EBA encodes the speed of human body motion implied in scenes. A subsequent behavioral experiment and correlation analyses confirmed this, showing strong correlations between EBA responses and implied motion ratings. In addition, the representation of implied body motion extends into the fusiform body area (FBA). Variance partitioning further showed that while body-related features such as the number of people and body size also contributed, implied motion uniquely explained the largest portion of EBA and FBA responses. Overall, semantic representations in body-selective regions are jointly shaped by multiple body-related features, with implied motion as the primary contributor.

Yet, their role in regional vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) remains poorly understood. To elucidate this subregional heterogeneity of astrocytes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex and its implication for neurodegeneration, we employed high-content neuropathology, integrating chromogenic immunohistochemistry (cIHC) and digital pathology, to map and quantify the expression of functional astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, AQP4, GPC5 and ALDH7A1) of healthy individuals, of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). We found that astrocytic markers followed distinct expression patterns in AD and PDD. In AD, GFAP was strongly reduced in specific hippocampal regions, whereas AQP4 was increased and GPC5 expression, although regionally stable, was locally associated with amyloid and tau pathology. In PDD, astrocytic responses were characterized by selective decreases in ALDH1L1 and ALDH7A1, with GFAP and GPC5 remaining largely unaffected. Notably, GFAP and GPC5 expression delineated distinct astrocytic subtypes that were differentially distributed across hippocampal subfields and showed specific responses to AD and PD pathologies. These findings provide new insights into the landscape of astrocytic heterogeneity in the human hippocampus and beyond, revealing disease- and region-specific astrocytic signatures.

To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive {gamma}{delta}T-omics platform that integrates functional screening, biomimetic migration assays, {gamma}{delta}TCR repertoire analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. Using matched samples from 31 patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (CRC), we analyzed {gamma}{delta}T cells from peripheral blood (PBLs{gamma}{delta}), adjacent colon (LPLs{gamma}{delta}), primary tumors (pTILs{gamma}{delta}), and liver metastases (mTILs{gamma}{delta}). This approach uncovered striking compartmentalization of {gamma}{delta}T cell phenotypes, clonality, and function. Tumor-reactive, clonally expanded V{delta}1 {gamma}{delta}T cells were enriched in primary tumors and shared transcriptional and functional features with lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs). In contrast, V{delta}1 {gamma}{delta}T cells from liver metastases lacked tumor reactivity, exhibited distinct {gamma}{delta}TCR repertoires, and expressed transcriptional signatures associated with TGF-{beta}-mediated suppression and cellular quiescence, suggesting they are shaped by tissue-specific environmental cues. CXCL16 secretion by tumor cells initiated V{delta}1 LPLs{gamma}{delta} migration, which was further amplified by {gamma}{delta}TCR-mediated CCL5 induction from pTILs{gamma}{delta}, leading to CCR5 downregulation and subsequent entrapment of pTILs{gamma}{delta} within the tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, our clinical data from an independent second cohort of 69 patients showed that infiltration by pTILs{gamma}{delta}, but not mTILs{gamma}{delta}, is associated with a protective effect against CRC progression. In summary, our study offers a compartment-resolved perspective on {gamma}{delta}T cell behavior in CRC, revealing key trafficking and functional mechanisms, and enabling the identification of novel tumor-reactive {gamma}{delta}TCRs and migratory cues to inform immunotherapeutic strategies for both primary and metastatic CRC.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Yet, essential bodily functions require a continuous energy supply, imposing energy constraints and trade-offs between competing processes. Our understanding of the underlying bioenergetic adaptations reconciling rapid immune activation with other vital processes remains scarce. Here, by using experimental models of viral infections, we identified an unexpected CD8+ T cell-driven redistribution of energy substrates between lymphoid organs and the heart. Viral infection promoted systemic hypoglycaemia and ketogenesis, together with systemic reallocation of energy substrates. Across organs analysed, secondary lymphoid organs and the heart showed the most dramatic changes. The former increased glucose uptake and oxidation while the heart showed the opposite, switching to preferential fatty acid utilization. These bioenergetic adaptations were absent in infected mice lacking CD8+ T cells or with T cells lacking the glucose transporter GLUT1. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid oxidation forced a systemic switch to glucose oxidation. This was associated with metabolic decompensation, reduced cardiac energetics, left ventricular stress, and mortality in otherwise nonlethal viral infections. Our results reveal how the energetic cost of immune cell activation imposes bioenergetic adaptations on non-lymphoid organs, posing a major challenge for the heart by completely relying on fatty acids.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

NK cell function is dynamically regulated through education driven by inhibitory receptors, including CD94/NKG2A and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). However, the acquisition of inhibitory receptors in iNK cells and their role during differentiation and education remains poorly defined. In this study, we monitored receptor repertoires, transcriptional states, and functional responses in a range of genetically engineered iNK cell lines. Transcriptional reference mapping placed iNK cells close to cytokine-activated NKG2A+ CD56dim peripheral blood (PB) NK cells. Despite their early differentiation stage, iNK cells displayed a well-developed cytotoxic effector program, which was also reflected in high protein expression of Eomes, granzyme B, and activating receptors DNAM-1 and NKG2D. Acquisition of NKG2A by iNK cells was associated with a more differentiated transcriptional state and superior functional responses against a broad range of targets, including those expressing low to moderate levels of HLA-E, suggesting attenuated inhibitory signaling through NKG2A in iNKs. CRISPR knockout of B2-microglobulin (B2M) in iNK cells revealed that the functional potency of NKG2A+ iNK cells was independent of educating interactions with HLA-E in cis or trans. Finally, CRISPR-mediated ablation of NKG2A led to a spontaneous compensatory surface expression of CD94/NKG2C heterodimers, associated with enhanced IFN-g production and cytotoxic activity against target cells with forced high expression of single-chain B2m-HLA-E-peptide trimers.

We conducted a range-wide survey of drought stress, growth, and allocation traits in a widespread oak species (Quercus douglasii, blue oak) to test the predictability of drought stress across populations and explore how water availability and allocation mediate spatial variation in tree growth. Across 15 sites, we found little relationship between end-of-season water availability (predawn leaf water potentials) or maximum drought stress (midday leaf water potentials) and climate or soils. Instead, plant water availability (within and among sites) was predicted by access to deep water resources inferred from stem water stable isotopes. We also found a remarkable three-way decoupling of water stress, growth, and allocation to leaf tissue, which challenged a data-parameterized mechanistic plant model. Our results reveal that deeply rooted trees can be hydrologically decouple from above-ground climate, and that the seasonality of growth, trait development and hydraulic risk are phenologically disconnected. The complicated relationship between carbon gain and hydraulic risk in seasonal environments and limited data on critical zone hydrology are key challenges to predicting drought vulnerability.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Comprehensive antigenic characterization has been hindered by the absence of real-world A(H1N1)pdm antigenic mapping and post-2012 A(H3N2) maps due to insufficient pair-wise hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titrations. Here, we present an end-to-end transformer model that predicts HAI titers directly from viral genetic sequences with error under two-fold, comparable to experimental variability. This approach enables rapid and high-throughput augmentation of HAI titrations across viral isolates, allowing for constructing large-scale antigenic maps. Several novel evolutionary patterns emerged from our analysis. Our antigenic mapping identified three A(H3N2) clusters between 2012-2022 with transitions occurring approximately every 6 years. Notably, genetically diverse co-circulating subclades 3C.2a and 3C.3a (2015-2020) formed a single antigenic cluster. A(H1N1)pdm formed three less temporally distinct clusters, with a novel cluster emerging post-COVID-19. Using interpretable analysis, we identified mutation sites linked to antigenic cluster transitions that align with previous laboratory findings. Key A(H3N2) mutations primarily occurred within major antigenic epitopes, while A(H1N1) showed fewer key mutations, some outside recognized antigenic regions. Our deep learning approach accelerates antigenic characterization in surveillance at global scale and can be transferred to other variable pathogens, providing an actionable bridge between genomic sequencing and vaccine strain selection.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

In parasitoids wasps, this is especially true for lineages with limited sampling and unclear species boundaries. Here we reconstruct the phylogeny of Cotesia wasps parasitizing Melitaeini butterflies, including two cryptic species complexes (Cotesia acuminata agg. and C. melitaearum agg.). Using a ten-gene dataset from samples collected in Europe, Asia, and North America, we inferred relationships among 22 Cotesia species using maximum likelihood. We also included non-Melitaeini associated Cotesia to assess whether the Melitaeini parasitoids form a monophyletic group. Our analyses yielded a highly supported phylogeny, revealing four major clades, three of which included the Melitaeini associated species. This confirms that the Cotesia attacking Melitaeini butterflies are polyphyletic, resulting from independent host shifts across the genus. Each clade is further subdivided into subclades corresponding to the different (cryptic) species, clarifying previously unresolved relationships.

This study developed and evaluated dual saturation multiband-accelerated Qperf imaging to achieve near-complete left ventricular coverage in free-breathing at an adequate in-plane spatial resolution, using a semi-automated Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) framework for quantification deployable directly on the scanner console. Methods: A dual-saturation single-band QPerf sequence was modified for multiband imaging, enabling the acquisition of 6 high-resolution myocardial slices plus Arterial Input Function (AIF) during free-breathing. The technique was evaluated in 16 sedated pigs (13 healthy and 3 with LAD occlusion) under rest conditions on a 3T MRI scanner. Additionally, two healthy pigs underwent stress imaging as well. Statistical comparisons were performed between multiband and single-band MBF values in corresponding AHA segments. Results: Qualitatively, multiband QPerf provided superior left ventricular coverage and comparable image quality to single-band Qperf MBF maps, potentially enabling a more comprehensive detection of perfusion defects at rest. Quantitatively, multiband QPerf yielded lower MBF values than single-band QPerf (p < 0.01). However, Bland-Altman analysis (mean difference: -0.17 ml/min/g; 95% CI: -1.12 to 0.79 ml/min/g) and Passing-Bablok regression (intercept: -0.01 ml/min/g; 95% CI: -0.37 to 0.28 ml/min/g) indicated that such discrepancy remained within the expected confidence intervals. Furthermore, the Passing-Bablok slope (0.88; 95% CI: 0.73-1.06) confirmed that mb-QPerf maintained sensitivity comparable to sb-QPerf in detecting perfusion changes under rest conditions. Finally, there was an overall increase in MBF values during stress vs rest conditions (average MBF Ratio 1.67 SD 0.31) when comparing healthy pigs. Conclusion: Multiband-accelerated Qperf is feasible, providing improved left ventricular coverage, adequate in-plane resolution, and a semi-automated MBF quantification framework directly on the scanner console. Compared to its single-band counterpart, multiband QPerf demonstrated a more comprehensive visualization of perfusion defects and comparable sensitivity and accuracy in detecting perfusion changes at rest.

As the library of parts available for building such programs continues to expand, computation-guided design is increasingly helpful and necessary. Yet key gaps exist for designing programs for use in mammalian cells in particular. Predictive models aid the challenging design process, but iterative simulation and experimentation are intractable for complex functions. Computer-aided design accelerates this process, but existing tools do not yet capture the behavior of mammalian-specific parts and population-level effects needed for mammalian synthetic biologists. To address these needs, we developed a framework for mammalian genetic program computer-aided design. Starting with a user-defined design specification to quantify circuit performance, the framework uses a genetic algorithm to search through possible designs. Circuit space is defined by a library of experimentally characterized parts and dynamical systems models for gene expression in a heterogeneous cell population. We developed this genetic algorithm using a directed graph-based formulation with biologically constrained rules to explore regulatory connections and parts. We evaluated the framework for design problems of varying complexity, including programs we describe as an amplifier, signal conditioner, and pulse generator, demonstrating that the algorithm can successfully find optimal circuit designs. Finally, we experimentally evaluated selected circuits, demonstrating the path from a predicted circuit design to experimental testing and highlighting the importance of characterization for enabling predictive design.

All three compounds displayed measurable in vitro activity, with MIC values of 22 M, 40 M, and 9 M, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of resistant mutants revealed nonsynonymous mutations in key enzymes of the mycothiol biosynthesis pathway, including D87A and W227G substitutions in MshC (MAB_2116) and a Q51T substitution in MshA (MAB_4057c), implicating disruption of redox homeostasis as a likely mechanism of action.

Cytotoxicity profiling indicated tolerable activity thresholds (rebastinib, 30 M; olverembatinib, 60 M; NAS-181, 14 M), enabling further macrophage infection assays. All three compounds significantly reduced intracellular M. abscessus burden in THP-1 macrophages without affecting host cell viability.

There are no treatments that prevent or eliminate cysts in part due to our poor understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cyst formation and recrudescence. In this study, we aimed to understand the biology of bradyzoites prior to recrudescence and the developmental pathways they initiate. We have discovered ME49EW cysts from infected mice harbor multiple bradyzoite subtypes that can be identified by their expression of distinct proteins. Sorting of these subtypes revealed they initiate distinct developmental pathways in animals and in primary astrocyte cell cultures. Single bradyzoite RNA sequencing indicates 5 major bradyzoite subtypes occur within these cysts.

Here, we uncover direct molecular cross-talk between (p)ppGpp and c-di-GMP signaling pathways. Using biochemical, structural and genetic approaches, we show that (p)ppGpp binds to the diguanylate cyclase PleD and inhibits c-di-GMP synthesis by competing with GTP at the active site. This interaction prevents c-di-GMP accumulation under nutrient-limiting conditions, linking metabolic stress to inhibition of developmental progression.

However, challenges such as cofactor competition and low pathway flux prevent competitive titers. Some bacteria address these challenges by encapsulating metabolic pathways in bacterial microcompartments (MCPs), many of which contain dedicated cofactor recycling enzymes. We sought to determine how pathway cofactor recycling and intermediate sequestration in MCPs benefit pathway performance using an in vitro assay and kinetic model of the 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) system. Guided by model simulations, we performed experimental design to characterize permeability, a key and difficult-to-measure property of MCPs. Using our model and measurements of metabolite concentrations over time, we estimate MCP permeability values in the range of 10-5 cm/s. We also demonstrated that NAD+/NADH recycling in the Pdu MCP benefits increased pathway flux.

Here, we benchmark eight state-of-the-art models on three publicly available proteomics datasets, comparing performance using established metrics and quantifying intermodel agreement. We assess post-processing approaches, including iterative refinement, rescoring, and reranking, for their ability to improve identification accuracy, and perform an error analysis to identify common mispredictions and their causes.

Coarse-grained molecular modeling allows computer simulations on length and time scales 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than atomistic simulations, bridging the gap between the atomistic and mesoscopic scales. However, the structural information involving the atomic planes is lost in coarse-grained. We develop a simple coarse grained protein model with structural information in explicit solvent. We represent each residue's center of mass as a polymer bead and water oxygen as a solvent bead. Each polymer bead has five degrees of freedom: position of the center and additional two variables, for the backbone dihedral angles. All interaction parameters for bonded, non-bonded and dihedral coupling are derived from the equilibrated all-atom molecular dynamics simulation trajectory.

However, both automated and manual sampling can introduce systematic artifacts, such as residual volume retention and surface adsorption, that distort concentration time series and affect downstream analysis. To fully realize the potential precision of automated measurements, we propose a mathematical correction to account for sampling artifacts; then to fit the corrected data to a three-compartment model that captures membrane diffusion, cellular sequestration, and metabolic loss. The method is demonstrated on datasets from transwell epithelial barrier transport assays.

A key challenge for in vivo DW-SSFP is the sequence's severe motion sensitivity, currently limiting investigations to low or no motion regimes. Here we establish a framework to both (1) investigate and (2) correct for the impact of subject motion on the DW-SSFP signal. Theory and Methods: An extended phase graphs (EPG) representation of the DW-SSFP signal was established incorporating a motion operator describing rigid body and pulsatile motion. The representation was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and subsequently integrated into a data fitting routine for motion estimation and correction. The fitting routine was evaluated using both simulations and experimental 2D low-resolution single-shot timeseries DW-SSFP data acquired in a human brain, with a tensor reconstructed from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data. Results: The proposed EPG-motion framework gives excellent agreement to complementary Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that diffusion coefficient estimation is robust over a range of motion and SNR regimes. Tensor estimates from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data give excellent visual agreement to complementary DW-SE data acquired in the same subject. Conclusion: Temporal information capturing the evolution of the DW-SSFP signal can be used to retrospectively (1) estimate subject motion and (2) reconstruct motion-corrected DW-SSFP data.

The disease disproportionately affects females and is associated with immunological, haematological, hepatic, and renal alterations. Monitoring these parameters can provide insights into disease severity, treatment compliance, and sex-specific responses. Methodology: This case-control study included 50 RA patients (30 females [60%], 20 males [40%]) and 30 healthy controls. The disease duration ranged from 1 to 28 years, with the majority (28%) having a duration between 1 and 4 years. Eighty per cent of patients were compliant with treatment. Blood and biochemical tests were performed to evaluate inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, IL6, TNF, Anti CCP)by Eliza technique, liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, TSB, albumin), renal function tests (urea, creatinine) by Specterophotometer, and trace elements (copper by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS), ceruloplasmin by Immunoturbidimetric assay, transferrin by Immunoturbidimetry through Roche Cobas c501/c601 device). Results: RA patients showed significantly elevated inflammatory markers compared to controls, including Anti-CCP (Females: 32.33 10.85 IU/mL; Males: 31.90 8.55 IU/mL), IL6 (Females: 61.90 to12.62 ng/L; Males: 66.55 to 10.32 ng/L), and TNF (Females: 198.80 50.95 ng/L; Males: 234.95 83.43 ng/L) (P<0.01). ESR was significantly higher in RA patients (Females: 55.53 33.96 mm/h; Males: 38.00 18.12 mm/h) versus controls. Liver function was impaired in RA patients, with increased ALT, AST, and TSB levels, and decreased albumin and ALP. Kidney function markers (urea and creatinine) were elevated in females but comparatively reduced in males. Trace elements showed high copper and ceruloplasmin levels in RA patients of both sexes compared to controls, while transferrin was notably higher in males with RA (53.90 11.48 ng/mL vs. 28.08 4.33 ng/mL in controls). Conclusion: RA significantly affects immunological, hepatic, renal, and haematological profiles, with marked differences between sexes. Female patients exhibited more profound renal and lymphocytic alterations, whereas male patients showed elevated transferrin levels. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive, sex-specific monitoring of RA patients, particularly focusing on inflammatory and organ function biomarkers, to improve disease management and patient outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

This study explored the repertoire of sRNAs produced by the human pathogen Staphylococus aureus in response to metal limitation. Two sRNAs, S1077 and ZinS (RsaX20), regulated by zinc (Zn) availability, were identified. Further investigations revealed that, similar to the cnt operon from which it derives, S1077 synthesis is controlled by the transcription factors Zur and Fur. In contrast, zinS transcription is solely repressed by Zur. Amongst the ZinS targets are several Zn-dependent enzymes, such as the alcohol dehydrogenase Adh, whose synthesis is negatively regulated by ZinS. Loss of ZinS does not alter staphylococcal metal accumulation, suggesting a role in a Zn-sparing response. Remarkably, zinS also encodes a small peptide, ZinP. Genomic analysis suggests that the regulatory portion of ZinS emerged from the 3 untranslated region of zinP in S. aureus and closely related species after horizontal gene transfer from phylogenetically distant organisms. All our findings demonstrate that sRNAs also facilitate bacterial adaptation to Zn limitation, and that genetic exchange and subsequent neofunctionalization have enabled S. aureus to adapt to metal-restricted environments.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

We used transient expression to probe ZtLRR function related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death, two important immune processes. We used AlphaFold structural predictions with targeted yeast two-hybrid to demonstrate protein-protein interactions. Transgenic wheat allowed assessment of effector function in the natural host. ZtLRR suppressed ROS production and cell death in N. benthamiana with high potency. Structural predictions suggested high similarity to several plant LRR-RLKs and interaction with TaBAK1 was confirmed by targeted yeast two-hybrid. Transgenic wheat expressing ZtLRR was impaired in PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and had increased susceptibility to infection with compatible Z. tritici. We identified structural orthologs of ZtLRR in diverse fungal lineages and demonstrated that several of these proteins have similar immune-suppressing properties as ZtLRR.

S.; Tessarz, P.; Huppertz, I.", "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (SCs) rely on metabolic rewiring to regulate self-renewal and differentiation. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates multiple metabolic inputs to produce uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a central substrate for protein and lipid glycoconjugates. While UDP-GlcNAc levels influence pluripotency, the broader metabolic roles of the HBP in stem cell maintenance and differentiation remain largely unexplored. Using proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we uncovered extensive enzymatic remodelling of the HBP during early mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, including a significant decrease in N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) levels, despite stable UDP-GlcNAc levels. Isotope labelling experiments revealed that pluripotent stem cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis through a combination of glucose-driven de novo synthesis and the N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) salvage pathway, both of which are downregulated during differentiation. Functionally, we identified GlcNAc6P--a point of convergence of the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathways--as a pivotal metabolite of stem cell fate. Preventing GlcNAc6P's deacetylation by deleting or depleting AMDHD2 impaired mESC differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GlcNAc6P catabolism is essential for sustaining cytosolic acetate and in turn acetyl-CoA levels, which are critical for lipid synthesis and histone modifications required for pluripotency exit. These findings establish AMDHD2 as a key supplier of cellular acetate and reveal an essential metabolic link between HBP activity and acetyl-CoA homeostasis. By expanding the role of the HBP beyond UDP-GlcNAc production, this study reveals an unrecognised metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate stem cell identity.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Determining associations among different species from citizen science databases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density variations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species associations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large datasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small blocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces observations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise overlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves as a null model. For each species i, an expected overlap i is estimated by averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This gives a z-score for significance of a species-species association and a correlation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on 874,263 iNaturalist observations spanning 15,975 non-avian taxa in the Santa Cruz, California region ({approx} 4.68 x 106 tiles). The method recovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many host-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa Beetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds associations on ~108 species pairs on modest hardware, filtering correlations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts.

Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) are the ideal tool for studying these processes; yet functional transmembrane protein reconstitution in GUVs still represents a bottleneck in bottom-up synthetic biology. Here, we developed a novel approach that we call Synthetic Membrane Transfer (SMT), where transmembrane proteins reconstituted into styrene-maleic acid particles in a detergent-free environment can be transferred to the GUV membrane. The SMT approach is a one-step, facile and general method that works for structurally diverse proteins, and it does not require any specific lipid or buffer composition. Moreover, the SMT is fully compatible with the Synthetic Membrane Shaper (SMS) technology, which allows to deform GUVs in a controlled fashion, obtaining dumbbell-shaped GUVs exhibiting a catenoid-like geometry. The combination of SMT and SMS results in functional reconstitution of transmembrane proteins in catenoid membrane necks. Using this approach, we demonstrate that Mic10, a component of the MICOS complex, directly senses membrane curvature and localizes at the neck of dumbbells GUVs, a geometry that recapitulates the shape of mitochondria cristae junctions.

Validation in independent datasets (GSE91061, GSE261866) supported the immune signature's relevance (AUC = 0.780, p = 0.0456) and the cell cycle signature's specificity to melanoma (p = 0.2414 in SLE) [17, 18].In TCGA-SKCM survival analysis, the cell cycle signature demonstrated strong prognostic value, predicting dramatically worse overall survival (OS HR = 15.634, 95% CI: 1.898 - 128.761, p = 0.011) and progression-free survival (PFS HR = 8.484, 95% CI: 1.420 - 50.688, p = 0.019). The immune signature showed protective trends for both OS (HR = 0.259, p = 0.121) and PFS (HR = 0.656, p = 0.585), while a composite score integrating both signatures achieved significant prognostic utility (OS HR = 0.141, p = 0.004; PFS HR = 0.324, p = 0.053) [40]. Connectivity Map analysis identified mTOR inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and statins as candidate therapeutics targeting these pathways [45, 50]. Limitations include reliance on transcriptomic data, moderate biomarker performance (AUC = 0.6567 - 0.780), and lack of functional validation. Future studies should validate these signatures' in ICB-treated cohorts, integrate multi-omics, and test proposed therapeutics preclinically. Overall, this cross-disease analysis highlights immune-epigenetic convergence linking SLE and melanoma, with implications for biomarker development and therapeutic repurposing [6, 12].", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

HuNoVs are non-enveloped, with an icosahedral capsid composed of 90 dimers of the major capsid protein VP1, which encloses a minor structural protein, VP2, and a VPg-linked positive sense ssRNA genome. Although the atomic structure of the icosahedral capsid formed by VP1 is well characterized using crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy analyses of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs), the structures and the localization of VP2 and VPg inside the capsid, how they are incorporated into the capsid, and whether this process requires interactions between them remain unresolved. Herein, we show VP2 is the molecular bridge for assembly of particles containing VP1, VP2 and VPg. We used deletion constructs and mutational analyses, guided by bioinformatic analyses, to determine the interaction site on VP2 for VP1 of the pandemic-causing GII.4 Sydney HuNoV. GII.4 HuNoV VP2 contains a unique insertion site at amino acids (AAs) 43-53, relative to VP2s of other GII HuNoV genotypes. We identified AA residues 40-43 on VP2 are required for interaction with VP1; mutation of VP2 AA 40-43 abrogates VP2 encapsidation. Computational analyses predicted VP2 has a highly conserved N-terminal -helical domain and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that exhibits significant sequence diversity. We identified VP2, not VP1, uniquely binds VPg; the VP2 C-terminal domain is sufficient to interact with VPg. These findings reveal domain-specific functions of VP2 that are essential for coordinating capsid protein interactions for HuNoV assembly.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Existing in vitro models that accurately recapitulate its three-dimensional structure, barrier properties, and long-term stability are still limited. In this study, we propose a robust, adaptable, and scalable platform designed to generate engineered three-dimensional lymphatic endothelium using primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). This system combines microfluidic extrusion-based fabrication allowing precise control of the tubular geometry with a fully defined extracellular matrix-derived hydrogel. The capability to adjust dimensions enables the creation of constructs that encompass physiologically relevant size ranges. A comprehensive matrix screen revealed a distinct four-component formulation - gelatin, Matrigel, hyaluronic acid, and fibrinogen - that promotes HDLEC self-assembly into stable, lumen-lining monolayers within a week. These engineered structures retain viability and structural integrity for a minimum of 30 days under static culture conditions. Functional permeability assays demonstrated selective tracer uptake characteristics of lymphatic transport. Comparative studies with blood vascular endothelial cells indicate that the proposed platform supports prolonged maintenance of lineage-specific expression profiles, junctional organization, and permeability properties under identical fabrication parameters. Altogether, this methodology offers a reproducible and controlled system for examining three-dimensional endothelial architecture, transport mechanisms, and extracellular matrix remodeling across diverse endothelial phenotypes, thereby addressing a pivotal gap in the modeling of lymphatic vasculature.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, the role of PUM in plants is largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the functions of Arabidopsis group I PUMs (APUM1-APUM6), which are ubiquitously expressed and localized in the cytosol. While single apum mutants exhibit no visible phenotypes, CRISPR/Cas9-generated apum1 apum2 apum3 triple mutants (apum1/2/3) display reduced growth in both vegetative and reproductive organs, alongside hypersensitivity to various stresses. Remarkably, apum1/2/3/4 quadruple mutants are embryonically lethal, highlighting their essential role in embryo development. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upregulated in apum1/2/3 are enriched in pathways related to photosynthesis, stress responses and anthocyanin biosynthesis, while downregulated DEGs are associated with biotic stress defense and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. This suggests that APUM1/2/3 act as molecular hubs balancing plant growth and stress adaptation. Biochemical assays showed that recombinant APUM homologous domains bind to the 5'-UGUGUAUA-3' core motif in the 3'-UTR of the transcription factor Production of Anthocyanin Pigment1 (PAP1), crucial for anthocyanin biosynthesis. Notably, single nucleotide substitutions, except for the third U, do not affect binding, while multiple mutations disrupt interaction. Consistently, apum1/2/3 mutants accumulate significantly more anthocyanin than wild-type plants. Furthermore, we predicted 7053 potential target genes for APUM1/2/3, with 1609 present among the upregulated DEGs in apum1/2/3. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that group I APUMs are vital posttranscriptional regulators, providing a new perspective on the trade-offs between growth and stress resilience in plants.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

A.; Hong, K.; Tsuda, K.; Cohen, J. D.; Hegeman, A. D.", "abstract": "Salicylate (SA) is a key plant immunity hormone, which induces immunity against biotrophic pathogens. Two SA biosynthetic pathways are known: the isochorismate synthase (ICS) and the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathways. However, the primary pathways used are known for only a few plant species. For example, the ICS pathway evolved within the Brassicales order, and Arabidopsis, a member of this order, primarily uses it. It is challenging to determine the proportions of these pathway contributions using genetic perturbations because the SA biosynthetic pathways are typically regulated by feedback from SA. We developed a simple method to directly measure the relative contributions of these two pathways to SA synthesis using [13C6]glucose feeding to leaves and LC-MS/MS analysis of the leaf extracts. A survey of 16 diverse eudicot species and a monocot species, rice, showed that all these species, except for the Brassicales species with the ICS pathway, mainly use the PAL pathway. The Brassicales species mostly used the ICS pathway but did not use it exclusively: for example, the contribution of the ICS pathway in Arabidopsis was 84% on average. We found that the main pathway in two basal angiosperm species was neither the ICS nor the PAL pathway. Instead, the [13C]-labeling patterns of SA in these species were consistent with possible involvement of a type III polyketide synthase. Thus, during evolution of flowering plants, the main SA biosynthetic pathways changed drastically at least twice. Pathogen effectors targeting SA biosynthetic pathway components likely exerted selection pressure driving these drastic changes.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

The maize genes GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1) and RAMOSA3 (RA3) are required for axillary meristem suppression, a deeply conserved trait across angiosperms, and for floral organ suppression, a trait which evolved within the grass family. To determine how these pleiotropic functions are regulated, we first established a high-throughput method for quantitative phenotyping of grass flowers. Using this method, we show that distinct environmental mechanisms regulate axillary meristem versus floral organ suppression. In line with these differences, we find upstream regulation of GT1 and RA3 has diverged, consistent with their redeployment in flowers. Our results show that, rather than wholesale adoption of genetic networks, developmental genes can retain ancient functions and be recruited into other programs in the evolution of form, thereby increasing genetic pleiotropy.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Rare males, often resulting from developmental errors, including chromosomal abnormalities, offer valuable insights into reproductive reversibility, although their rarity limits data on morphology, behavior, and fertility. Stick insects (Phasmatodea), with numerous parthenogenetic species, are key taxa for studying these phenomena; however, detailed analyses of rare males remain scarce. In this study, we investigated the spontaneous appearance of male and sexual mosaics within a captive colony of Neohirasea japonica, a widespread stick insect in Japan, where males are typically absent. In total, three individuals exhibiting male characteristics (penis and non-oviposition) were observed during the 8-years rearing. One displayed a typical male abdominal clasper and exhibited mating behavior with conspecific females, with morphological comparisons strongly suggesting that it was an N. japonica male. The other two individuals lacked mating behavior and were identified as sexual mosaics based on their external morphology and the presence of female reproductive systems upon dissection. This study provides foundational morphological and anatomical data on male, female, and sexually mosaic individuals in N. japonica. It also includes quantitative comparisons of key traits, such as the antenna-to-body length ratio, which is 0.78 in males and ranges from 0.52 to 0.53 in females. These findings establish valuable criteria for future identification of rare males and sexual mosaics in this species, ultimately contributing to our understanding of sexual trait degeneration in obligate parthenogenetic lineages.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": ""}

Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations reveal that PIL neurons activated by social touch inhibit aggression via excitatory projections to the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus.

We find that increased tension enhances synaptic efficiency by accelerating vesicle clustering and recovery, resulting in a 67% improvement in memory recall speed and a 17% increase in inter-regional synchrony during projection relative to relaxed states. Conversely, a 20% reduction in tension leads to a 31% decline in memory association performance, highlighting the tension-sensitive accessibility of stored information. The model further reveals that networks with 20% inhibitory neurons achieve optimal spatial precision in memory encoding and recall.

Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled direct and indirect effects of host abundances on LB hazard (i.e., DIN). Rodent abundance was associated with higher DIN through its positive effect on NIP (pathogen amplification), while showing no effect on DON. Cervids increased DON (vector amplification) but decreased NIP (pathogen dilution). Our study suggests that in boreal forests the vectors may be supported by very low cervid densities and, as a virtual absence of rodents did not eliminate the pathogen, the pathogen is likely to persist through very low rodent densities.

Temperate cnidarians experience a high degree of seasonal temperature variability, leading us to hypothesize that temperate taxa have more thermally robust pH homeostasis than their tropical relatives. To test this, we investigated how elevated temperature affects intracellular pH and calcification in the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. Clonal pairs were exposed to elevated (30{degrees}C) or control (22{degrees}C) temperatures for 17 days. Despite causing damage to host tissues and symbiont cells, elevated temperature did not affect intracellular pH or inhibit calcification in A. poculata. These responses contrast with those of tropical cnidarians, which experience cellular acidification and decreased growth during heat stress. A. poculata therefore appears to have thermally resilient cellular acid-base homeostasis mechanisms, possibly due to adaptation to large seasonal temperature variations. However, we also observed tissue damage and lower egg densities in heat-treated individuals, suggesting that increasingly severe marine heatwaves can still threaten temperate coral fitness.

Two competing approaches have emerged to build such reference panels, one which uses machine-learning, and another based on optimizing effect size and cell type specificity. Here we demonstrate that the latter approach is preferable, because, owing to the relatively small number of sorted samples used in building panels, standard machine learning does not optimize effect size and cell-type specificity, causing the model to overfit and underperform when tested in independent data. Furthermore, adult blood panels built from cell-type specific hypomethylated markers improves inference when compared to panels built from hypermethylated ones.
