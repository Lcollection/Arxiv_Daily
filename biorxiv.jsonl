Here, we report that IKK2 not only phosphorylates substrate serine residues and autophosphorylates its own activation loop, but also autophosphorylates at a tyrosine residue proximal to the active site and is, therefore, a dual-specificity kinase. We observed that mutation of Y169, an autophosphorylatable tyrosine located at the DFG+1 (DLG in IKK1) position, to phenylalanine renders IKK2 incapable of catalyzing phosphorylation at S32 within its I{kappa}B substrate. We also observed that mutation of the phylogenetically conserved ATP-contacting residue K44 in IKK2 to methionine converts IKK2 to an enzyme that no longer catalyzes specific phosphorylation of I{kappa}B at S32 or S36, but rather directs phosphorylation of I{kappa}B at other residues. Lastly, we report evidence of a phospho-relay from autophosphorylated IKK2 to I{kappa}B in the presence of ADP. These observations suggest an unusual evolution of IKK2, in which autophosphorylation of tyrosine(s) in the activation loop, and the conserved ATP-contacting K44 residue provide its signal-responsive substrate specificity and ensure fidelity during NF-{kappa}B activation.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that CDX2 cells found in human chorion are poised for cardiovascular differentiation. We isolated CDX2 cells from term placentas of 180 healthy patients and showed that they spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes, functional vascular cells, and retain homing ability in vitro with a transcriptome that supports enhanced cardiogenesis, vasculogenesis, immune modulation, and chemotaxis gene signatures. They restore cardiac function when administered to NOD/SCID mice subjected to MI. CDX2 cells can be clonally propagated in culture with retention of cardiovascular differentiation.

GPFNs perform amortized Bayesian inference by simulating hundreds of thousands or millions of plant or animal populations. This allows GPFNs to be deployed without requiring any training or tuning, providing predictions in a single inference pass. On three populations of plants across two different crop species,GPFNs perform significantly better than the linear baseline on 13 out of 16 traits. On a challenging between-families structured prediction task on a third crop species, the GPFN matches the performance of the linear baseline while outperforming it in one location. GPFNs represent a completely new direction for the field of genomic prediction, and have the potential to unlock levels of selection accuracy not possible with existing methods, especially in diverse populations.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Global warming and more frequent extreme heat events may impose selection pressures that allow fungal adaptation to higher temperatures. Cities are heat islands that are up to 8{ring}C warmer than their suburban counterparts because of mechanical heat production and reduced greenspace, among other factors, and may be an important reservoir of fungi that have increased risk of thermotolerance and inhabit environments near humans. Here we describe a novel and inexpensive technique that was developed to collect fungal samples from various sites in Baltimore, Maryland using commercially available taffy candy. Our results show fungal isolates from warmer neighborhoods show greater thermotolerance and lighter pigmentation relative to isolates of the same species from cooler neighborhoods, suggesting local adaptation. Lighter pigmentation in fungal isolates from warmer areas is consistent with known mechanisms of pigment regulation that modulate fungal cell temperature. The opportunistic pathogen Rhodotorula mucilaginosa from warmer neighborhoods had a higher resistance to gradual exposure to extreme heat than those from cooler neighborhoods. Our results imply fungal adaptation to increased temperature in an urban environment. The acquisition of thermotolerance poses a risk for humans if fungal species with pathogenic potential acquire the capacity to grow at human body temperatures and cause disease.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Purpose: Advanced prostate cancer is treated with androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors, which are initially effective, but the majority of patients eventually develop resistance and progress to castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Loss of RB1 in CRPC tumors is correlated with rapid progression and poor patient survival, and in combination with TP53 loss, predisposes to the development of transitional neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Although progressing CRPC is clinically associated with higher 18FDG-PET SUVmax values, it is unknown whether inactivation of RB1 and/or TP53 is a driver of increased glucose import. Experimental Design: A cohort of patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived CRPC organoids was screened to assess 18FDG uptake in ARPC and NEPC, considering the influence of RB1 and TP53 status. Experimental loss of RB1 and/or TP53 was induced in an androgen sensitive and a castrate resistant model, and metabolic changes were evaluated using 18FDG-PET, 13C-hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Seahorse, and ex vivo NMR. Results: Knockdown of either RB1 or TP53 increased glycolysis and TCA cycle intermediates, while knockdown of both created a new phenotype where glucose was diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway and into glycogen synthesis. These large-scale metabolic changes were not reflected in 18FDG uptake, which was not increased upon knockdown of either gene. 13C-hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, on the other hand, showed significant differences in lactate dehydrogenase flux upon loss of RB1. The metabolic heterogeneity revealed here suggests a multimodal molecular imaging approach can improve tumor characterization, potentially leading to better prognostics in cancer treatment.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We have previously demonstrated its ability to promote cardiac repair in small and large animals when delivered to the heart via a viral vector. However, the effect of CCNA2 gene delivery on cytokinesis in isolated cardiomyocytes from adult human hearts has not been explored. We designed a human gene therapy vector featuring a replication-deficient adenovirus encoding human CCNA2 driven by the cardiac Troponin T promoter to enable the expression of CCNA2 in freshly isolated human cardiomyocytes. Time-lapse live imaging of adult human primary cardiomyocytes from a 21-year-old male, a 41-year-old female, and a 55-year-old male demonstrated the induction of complete cytokinesis in human adult cardiomyocytes with preservation of sarcomere integrity in the resulting daughter cells with active calcium mobilization in redifferentiated cardiomyocytes. To elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this response, we conducted single-nucleus transcriptomics analysis of hearts isolated from adult transgenic mice that constitutively express CCNA2 in cardiomyocytes (CCNA2-Tg) and non transgenic mice (nTg). This revealed a cardiomyocyte subpopulation enriched with cytokinesis, proliferative, and reprogramming genes in hearts obtained from CCNA2-Tg mice as compared to nTg mice. Ultra-deep bulk RNA sequencing of human adult and fetal hearts identified key reprogramming genes relevant to understanding the mechanisms of CCNA2-induced effects observed in our experimental models.

This study demonstrates that the aberrant response of the sst1-susceptible macrophages to prolonged stimulation with TNF is primarily driven by conflicting Myc and antioxidant response pathways leading to a coordinated failure 1) to properly sequester intracellular iron and 2) to activate ferroptosis inhibitor enzymes. Consequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation fueled Ifn-beta superinduction and sustained the Type I Interferon (IFN-I) pathway hyperactivity that locked the sst1-susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress and compromised their resistance to Mtb. The accumulation of the aberrantly activated, stressed, macrophages within granuloma microenvironment led to the local failure of anti-tuberculosis immunity and tissue necrosis. The upregulation of Myc pathway in peripheral blood cells of human TB patients was significantly associated with poor outcomes of TB treatment. Thus, Myc dysregulation in activated macrophages results in an aberrant macrophage activation and represents a novel target for host-directed TB therapies.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We previously demonstrated that peritumoral ductules are associated with angiogenesis in liver tumors and forkhead box L1 (Foxl1)-expressing murine HPCs secrete angiogenic factors in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that HPCs are capable of remodeling the portal vascular microenvironment and regulating overall liver disease progression, and this function of HPCs is dependent on recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ), a key effector of the Notch signaling pathway. Methods and Results: We generated HPC-specific Rbpj conditional knockout mice (CKO) using Foxl1-Cre and treated them with the DDC diet to induce chronic liver disease. CKO mice exhibited a significant reduction in serum levels of liver injury markers, ductular reactions, vascular and fibrotic areas, and hepatic expression of fibrosis and inflammation markers compared to control mice (WT). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing comparing CKO and WT livers detected transcriptome changes across multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and cholangiocytes. Expression of several reactive cholangiocyte markers, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), in HPCs was significantly downregulated in response to anti-Rbpj shRNAs in vitro. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the percentage of VCAM1+ cells was reduced in both HPC and cholangiocyte populations in CKO compared to WT in vivo. Conclusions: Our findings reveal Rbpj-dependent expression of reactive cholangiocyte markers in HPCs and demonstrate that Rbpj deletion in HPCs attenuates not only endothelial responses but also liver injury, fibrosis, and VCAM1 expression in cholangiocytes, highlighting the crucial role of HPCs in pathogenic progression.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We use Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning method designed for probabilistic modelling of complex nonlinear phenomena, to construct species distribution models (SDMs) for HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b presence.

Our models are time-stratified to capture both seasonal changes in risk and shifts in epidemiology associated with the succession of H5N6/H5N8 by H5N1 within the clade.

Our projections of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b indicate a shift in persistent, year-round risk towards cold, low-lying regions of northwest Europe associated with H5N1.

This study utilizes information theory, contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs), and approximately 100 hours of high-quality spatiotemporal ECoG recordings of speakers engaged in spontaneous conversations to explore how the speaker's brain conveys information during everyday interactions. Information theory defines information as the reduction of uncertainty (Shannon entropy). It lays the theoretical foundations for why listeners actively predict upcoming words (information-seeking) before a word is spoken while enhancing the processing of unexpected, information-rich words after they are perceived. But what happens when speakers generate (information-making) these improbable, information-rich words in the first place? We analyzed continuous electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings collected during hours of real-life, 24/7 conversations to address this question. Using LLMs (Llama-2 and GPT-2), we estimated the probability of each word based on its context, categorizing them as either improbable, information-rich words or predictable, information-thin words. We then extracted word-based non-contextual embeddings from these models and employed neural encoding techniques to examine brain activity during speech production and comprehension. Our findings reveal a striking contrast in how the brain handles improbable, information-rich words while speaking versus listening. During speech comprehension, we identified two distinct neural phases: one preceding word onset, associated with predictive (information-seeking) processing, and another following word onset, linked to enhanced information processing of unexpected words. Conversely, in the speaker's brain, we found, for the first time, enhanced pre-word-onset encoding for improbable, information-rich words versus probable words. The results remained strong and clear even when we narrowed down the analysis to a shared set of words that were unlikely in one context and likely in another. Since information-rich words are statistically unpredictable, this suggests the speaker's brain aims to produce linguistic output that defies listeners' expectations. However, we also point out that predictability alone is insufficient to generate meaningful words, highlighting a gap in information theory and LLMs that neglects how speakers intentionally choose information-rich words to convey novel meanings.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

However, over-active inflammation disrupts normal cellular functions and can be life-threatening when not resolved. The NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a component of the innate immune system, is an intracellular multiprotein complex that senses stress-associated signals, and, for this reason is a promising therapeutic target for treating unresolved, pathogenic inflammation. Alternative splicing of NLRP3 RNA has been suggested as a regulatory mechanism for inflammasome activation, as some spliced isoforms encode NLRP3 proteins with compromised function. Here, we take advantage of this natural regulatory mechanism and devise a way to control pathogenic inflammation using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). To identify and induce NLRP3 isoforms lacking inflammatory activity, we tested a series of ASOs, each targeting a different exon, to determine the most effective strategy for down-regulating NLRP3. We identify several ASOs that modulate NLRP3 splicing, reduce NLRP3 protein, and decrease inflammasome signaling in vitro. The most effective ASO suppresses systemic inflammation in vivo in mouse models of acute inflammation and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). Overall, these results demonstrate how ASOs can be used to systematically engineer proteins with modified functions and treat pathological inflammation in mice by reducing functional NLRP3.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we found that tight regulation of GSK-3{beta} kinase activity is required for the maintenance of parallel microtubule bundles in Drosophila and rat axons. Up- or down-regulation of GSK-3{beta} led to axons forming pathological swellings in which microtubule bundles disintegrated into disorganised, curled microtubules. We identified the microtubule bundling proteins Shot and Tau as key GSK-3{beta} targets and found that GSK-3{beta} exerted its regulatory effect on microtubule bundling through them. GSK-3{beta} regulates the ability of Shot and Tau to attach to microtubules and/or the plus-end protein Eb1.

Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGF{beta} in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGF{beta} regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGF{beta} maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGF{beta} alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGF{beta} (+) and TGF{beta} (-) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGF{beta}-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists and the IFN response was dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.

However, how these distinct processes are coordinated remains unclear. Here, we show that fragments of Slit guidance ligand 3 (Slit3) drive crosstalk among adipocyte progenitors, endothelial cells, and sympathetic nerves. We demonstrate that adipocyte progenitors secrete Slit3, which regulates both angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation in BAT and is essential for BAT thermogenesis in vivo. Proteolytic cleavage of Slit3 generates secreted Slit3-N and Slit3-C fragments, which bind distinct receptors to stimulate angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation, respectively. We identify Plxna1 as a previously unrecognized receptor for Slit3-C and show that it is essential for sympathetic innervation and cold-induced neurite expansion in BAT. Moreover, we introduce bone morphogenetic protein 1 (Bmp1) as the first Slit protease identified in vertebrates. In summary, this work establishes a mechanistic framework for the coordinated regulation of sympathetic innervation and angiogenesis to enhance thermogenic function. The co-regulation of neurovascular expansion by distinct Slit3 fragments offers a bifurcated yet harmonized mechanism to ensure a synchronized BAT response to environmental challenges. Finally, this study provides the first evidence that adipocyte progenitors regulate tissue innervation, revealing a previously unrecognized dimension of cellular interaction within adipose tissue.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses of the retina, these local Ca2+ signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis, endocytosis, and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites for sustained neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca2+ signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca2+ indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca2+ transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). We observed that a Ca2+ transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca2+ indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca2+ indicator, and the estimated Ca2+ levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 M in response to a 10-millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca2+ indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca2+ diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca2+] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca2+ levels may vary between ribbons of different RBCs and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca2+ signals is correlated to ribbon size, which in turn correlates with active zone extent, as serial electron microscopy provides new information about the heterogeneity in ribbon size, shape, and area of the ribbon in contact with the plasma membrane", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we applied different BioID strategies to screen the interactomes of Connexin 36 the major neuronal connexin and its zebrafish orthologue Cx35b in retinal neurons. For in vivo proximity labeling in mice, we took advantage of the Cx36-EGFP strain and expressed a GFP-nanobody-TurboID fusion construct selectively in AII amacrine cells. For in vivo BioID in zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line expressing a Cx35b-TurboID fusion under control of the Cx35b promoter. Both strategies allowed us to capture a plethora of molecules that were associated with electrical synapses and showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation in the proteomes of both species. Besides known interactors of Cx36 such as ZO-1 and ZO-2 we have identified more than 50 new proteins, such as scaffold proteins, adhesion molecules and regulators of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, we determined the subcellular localization of these proteins in AII amacrine and tested potential binding interactions with Cx36. Amongst these new interactors, we identified signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3 (SIPA1L3), a protein that has been implicated in cell junction formation and cell polarity as a new scaffold of electrical synapses. Interestingly, SIPA1L3 was able to interact with ZO-1, ZO-2 and Cx36, suggesting a pivotal role in electrical synapse function.

Protein Kinase C - epsilon (PKC{varepsilon}) is is a serine/threonine kinase involved in diverse cellular processes such as migration, growth, differentiation, and survival. PKC{varepsilon} is known to act in a context dependent manner within heart, however, its role in atherosclerosis is unknown. Methods: Bone marrow derived MO from global PKC{varepsilon} KO mice were examined for impact of lipid metabolism and inflammatory factor secretion. Public geneset analysis assessed raw counts of PKC{varepsilon} to determine translational relevance. To determine the function myeloid PKC{varepsilon} on atherosclerosis a novel murine model was generated using LysM Cre technology. After its characterization, human-like hypercholesterolemia was induced to assess plaque morphology in WT mice or mice lacking myeloid PKC{varepsilon}. Results: Public geneset analysis of human atherosclerotic plaque tissue revealed that PKC{varepsilon} expression is inversely correlated with plaque size and vulnerability. Similarly, peritoneal MO from hypercholesterolemic mice have significantly lower PKC{varepsilon} expression. As MO play a major role in atherogenesis, we generated a mouse strain with PKC{varepsilon} selectively deleted in the myeloid lineage (m{varepsilon}KO). qPCR revealed no basal differences between genotypes in the expression of lipid uptake receptors, efflux transporters, or inflammatory markers. However, upon lipid loading, m{varepsilon}KO MOs retained significantly more cholesterol than WT. Human-like hypercholesterolemia was induced in WT and m{varepsilon}KO mice and assessed for lesion area and plaque morphology in aortic arches and aortic roots. We found that, compared to WT, the lesion area in m{varepsilon}KO mice was significantly larger, more necrotic, had larger foam cells, and thinner collagen caps. Conclusions: Loss of myeloid PKC{varepsilon} promotes atherosclerosis as determined by larger lesions, more necrosis, thinner plaque caps).

Many new TE insertions have deleterious effects on their host and are therefore removed by purifying selection. The genomic distribution of TEs thus reflects a balance between new insertions and purifying selection. However, the inference of purifying selection against deleterious TE insertions from the patterns observed in natural populations is challenged by the confounding effects of demographic events, such as population bottlenecks and migration. Results:We used Experimental Evolution to study the role of purifying selection during the invasion of the P-element, a highly invasive TE, in replicated Drosophila simulans populations under controlled laboratory conditions. Because the change in P-element copy number over time provides information about the transposition rate and the effect of purifying selection, we repeatedly sequenced the experimental populations to study the P-element invasion dynamics. Based on the empirical data, we used Gaussian Process surrogate models to efficiently explore the parameter space and identify parameter combinations that best reproduce the experimental P-element invasion trajectories. Assuming that beneficial P-element insertions are negligible, we found that, in our experimental populations, 73% (60.9% to 76.1%) of new P-element insertions are under purifying selection with a mean selection coefficient of -0.056 (-0.060 to -0.042), highlighting the central role of selection in shaping P-element invasion dynamics.

Translational control has been identified at multiple stages of PN development, but how translational regulation contributes to formation of distinct, subtype-specific long-range circuits is poorly understood. Ribosomal complexes (RCs) exhibit variations of their component proteins, with an increasing set of examples that confer specialized translational control. Here, we directly compare the protein compositions of RCs in vivo from two closely related cortical neuron subtypes-cortical output \"subcerebral PN\" (SCPN) and interhemispheric \"callosal PN\" (CPN)- during establishment of their distinct axonal connectivity. Using retrograde labeling of subtype-specific somata, purification by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, ribosome immunoprecipitation, and ultra-low-input mass spectrometry, we identify distinct protein compositions of RCs from these two subtypes. Strikingly, we identify 16 associated proteins reliably and exclusively detected only in RCs of SCPN. 11 of these proteins have known interaction with components of ribosomes; we further validated ribosome interaction with protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE), a candidate with roles in synaptogenesis. PRKCE and a subset of SCPN-specific candidate ribosome-associated proteins also exhibit enriched gene expression by SCPN.

In this study, we investigate the distinct behaviors of gene expression dynamics in MCF-7 breast cancer cells under two stimuli: Heregulin (HRG), which promotes cell-fate transitions, and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which binds to the same receptor but fails to induce cell-fate changes. We model the system as an open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic system and introduce a convergence-based framework for robust estimation of information-thermodynamic metrics. Our analysis reveals that the Shannon entropy of the critical point (CP) dynamically synchronizes with the entropy of the rest of the whole expression system (WES), reflecting coordinated transitions between ordered and disordered phases. This phase synchronization is driven by net mutual information scaling with CP entropy dynamics, demonstrating how the CP governs genome-wide coherence. Furthermore, higher-order mutual information emerges as a defining feature of the nonlinear gene expression network, capturing collective effects beyond simple pairwise interactions. By achieving thermodynamic phase synchronization, the CP orchestrates the entire expression system. Under HRG stimulation, the CP becomes active, functioning as a Maxwell's demon with dynamic, rewritable chromatin memory to guide a critical transition in cell fate. In contrast, under EGF stimulation, the CP remains passive during non-critical expression dynamics.

Rust fungi of the order Pucciniales (Subphylum Pucciniomycotina) are the largest group of obligate biotrophic plant pathogens and harbor some of the largest and most TE-rich genomes (up to 1.2Gb) compared to other fungi. This global genomic expansion contrasts with the smaller genomes and minimal mobilome found in other Pucciniomycotina species. Despite the availability of high-quality genome assemblies, our understanding of TE dynamics in Pucciniales remains limited due to inconsistent and incomplete TE annotations. Results: We analyzed the mobilomes of 12 Pucciniomycotina species, producing a manually curated TE library for each genome. In Pucciniales, TEs occupy 47-92% of the genome, whereas 2-36% of TEs are detected in other Pucciniomycotina genomes. The comparison of gene and TE repertoires indicates that TEs, particularly LTR-retrotransposons and TIR-DNA transposons, are the primary contributors to the genome expansion of the Pucciniales. We reconstructed the proliferation histories of TEs in the Pucciniales, combining sequence similarity, clustering, and molecular clock approaches. We highlight recent and ancient TE invasions with some LTR-Gypsy elements predating the divergence of Pucciniomycotina (~176 Mya), while most TE accumulation in Pucciniales occurred within the last 50 Mya. However, the TE invasions in the Pucciniales genomes do not seem to result from specific deficiencies in known TE-control mechanisms. Conclusion: Our findings uncover extensive TE proliferation in Pucciniales, predominantly driven by LTR-Gypsy expansions. The retention of ancestral TEs and the consistently TE-rich genomes observed in Pucciniales highlight TE proliferation as an ancestral genomic feature in rust fungi.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

However, responses to urbanization are often studied one (type of) trait at a time. In this context, we studied how, in the brown garden snail Cornu aspersum, shell phenotype (shell size and colour/reflectance), behaviour (food intake, mobility) and metazoan parasite prevalence respond to urbanization. Within an urbanization gradient spanning the French city of Rennes, we found that snails from more urbanized sites closer to the urban centre were smaller, whereas urbanization had no detectable effect on shell reflectance, parasite prevalence or behaviour. Larger snails and snails with paler shells were more likely to be infected by trematode metacercariae and sexually-transmitted nematodes (Nemhelix bakeri), respectively. Snails harbouring trematode sporocysts ate typically less, while those infected by N. bakeri moved more slowly. We discuss the decrease of snail size along the urbanization gradient in relation with the Urban Heat Island effect and the potential decrease of resource quality and availability in urban sites. The absence of detectable effects of urbanization on shell reflectance, mobility and parasite prevalence may be due to scale mismatches between how urbanization is measured and how snails experience microhabitats.

We first observed high levels of resistance that appeared and became widespread within three years. Genome scans revealed genetic heterogeneity of resistance among populations and identified 15 target mutations, including six mutations on five amino acid residues of subunit sdhB, and nine mutations on three amino acid residues of subunit sdhD of the pesticide target succinate dehydrogenase, with as many as five substitutions on one residue.

Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game in which freely moving mice made value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrated real-time spatial information about both themselves and their opponents to flexibly shift their preferences toward safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice behaviour and reinforcement learning agents revealed that these adaptations could not be explained by simple reward learning, but were instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of decision-making, we found that competition increased choice variability and sensitivity to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for future neural recordings and perturbations.

The physiological function of -synuclein and the detrimental effects of the pathological variants of -synuclein have been widely debated, but recent evidence has suggested an emerging consensus on a critical role for -synuclein in regulating synaptic function. However, a controversial role for -synuclein in nuclear function in both normal and pathogenic states has been proposed, and the degree to which -synuclein localizes within the nucleus and subsequent impact on the nucleus are poorly understood. To begin to address this controversy, we employed synucleinopathy murine and cell culture models, as well as postmortem human Lewy Body Dementia tissue to elucidate the extent to which pathological -synuclein localizes within the nuclear compartments, and the downstream consequences of this localization. We observed pathological aggregation of -synuclein within the nucleus in both murine models and human postmortem Lewy Body Dementia cortex via quantitative super resolution microscopy. In both mouse and human brain tissue the presence of -synuclein in the nucleus correlated with abnormal morphology of nuclei. This pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus was not observed in control mice, human tissue without pathology, or control cells. We subsequently examined the mechanistic consequences of pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus. Synucleinopathy models displayed increased levels of the DNA damage marker 53BP1. Furthermore, cells with pathological -synuclein exhibited elevated markers of nuclear envelope damage and abnormal expression of nuclear envelope repair markers. Our cell culture data also suggests altered RNA localization in response to pathological -synuclein accumulation within the nucleus.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing of breast cancer organoids, we identified a basal-like leader cell subset enriched for cytoskeletal, ECM-remodelling, and epithelial junction genes. We show that integrin 2 (Itg2) links collagen I engagement to mesenchymal reprogramming by inducing Inhba expression and activating TGF{beta} signalling. This, in turn, upregulates Vimentin while preserving epithelial junction gene expression. In parallel, Itg2 promotes ECM degradation through a TGF{beta}-independent mechanism. This dual mechanism supports a model of partial EMT as a regulated state and highlights the Itg2-TGF{beta} axis as a potential therapeutic target in aggressive breast cancers.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Penglei (XMM) and Rubus eustephanos Focke ex Diels Dahongpao (DHP), which are widely distributed in southern China with similar phenotypic traits (Figures 1A, 1B, and Figure S1), yet ripe fruits display distinct sugar accumulation levels (Table S1), making them ideal candidates for investigating the mechanisms underlying sugar accumulation in the Rubus genus. The XMM (213.53 Mb, 28,204 genes) and DHP (218.26 Mb, 28,569 genes) genomes exhibit close evolutionary relationships, diverging approximately 3.21 Mya. Comparative genomics identified extensive synteny, interspecific structural variations (translocations, inversions, segmental duplications), and presence/absence variation (PAV). Using Hi-C interaction heatmaps and Sanger sequencing, we validated interspecific structural inversions. Additionally, we identified a sugar transporter gene (MFS1), which is present in XMM but absent in DHP. Combined analysis of the gene family expansion/contraction and transcriptome identified two conserved key genes (RhSTP13 and RhSTP7) associated with sugar accumulation in Rubus genus and displayed distinct roles through transient expression assay. To facilitate functional genomics study, we also established a comprehensive Rubus database, RubusDB, a freely accessible repository consolidating all genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic data of Rubus genus. These findings provide a foundational framework for elucidating the genetic basis of sugar accumulation, genome diversification, and trait improvement in Rubus species.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

It combines functional, structural, and diffusion-weighted MRI with EEG to examine brain activity in 62 participants before and after a 19 mg dose of psilocybin. The design includes resting-state scans and three naturalistic conditions: guided meditation, music listening, and movie watching. Half of the cohort underwent an 8-week meditation training program, enabling the exploration of interactions among meditation, psilocybin, and brain function. The fMRI data was obtained through multi-echo fMRI, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces susceptibility artifacts, thereby improving the reliability of the analyses. A comprehensive battery of behavioural and self-report measures captured both acute and longitudinal cognitive and subjective effects, with follow-ups extending to one year post-administration. The large sample size, multimodal neuroimaging, diversity of contexts, and longitudinal behavioural follow-ups enable the study of psilocybin-induced changes in brain and behaviour with an unprecedented level of detail and reliability. Furthermore, the data is curated according to open science principles to ensure accessibility and interoperability with established neuroimaging processing pipelines.

However, to interact properly with others we also need to know to which person a face belongs. Here we tested how person knowledge modulates face processing. Participants were familiarized with highly variable faces, associated with artificial biographies. Crucially, participants were allocated randomly into two groups, trained on the identical faces of the same persons, but with reversed person knowledge associated with the faces. Multivariate pattern analyses were used to examine the time course of identity representations in the EEG data. We estimated cross-participant, leave-one-participant-out pairwise identity classifications within the same face-person association groups and compared them to the those performed across association groups. We observed that face-person knowledge associations led to a robust familiarity signal from 300 ms and to a rapidly emerging identity representation, starting from 80 ms. Importantly, the shared associations within participant groups led to a longer-lasting and stronger face identity representation over the right posterior electrode cluster when compared to cross-group comparisons with reversed associations. The direct comparison of within and cross-group classifications showed that an early stage of identity representation, between 250 and 370 ms, is significantly modulated by face-biography associations. Our findings suggest that top-down, person recognition memory related information modulates visual face identity representation already at an early processing stage. Our study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of how person-related conceptual, biographical knowledge modulates familiar identity representation.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine GPCR diversity and evolution in choanoflagellates by curating a catalog of 918 GPCRs, 141 G proteins, and 367 associated regulators from 23 choanoflagellate genomes and transcriptomes. We found that the repertoire of choanoflagellate GPCRs is larger and more diverse than previously anticipated, with 18 GPCR families found in choanoflagellates, of which 12 families are newly identified in these organisms. Comparative analyses revealed that most choanoflagellate GPCR families are conserved in metazoans and/or other eukaryotic lineages. Adhesion GPCRs and GPCR-TKL/Ks are the most abundant GPCRs in choanoflagellates.

{"title": "Accelerated, Accurate, Hybrid Short and Long Reads Alignment and Variant Calling", "doi": "10.1101/2025.04.15.648987", "authors": "Hu, J.; Freed, D.; Feng, H.; Chen, H.; Li, Z.; Chen, H.", "abstract": "Background: Integrating short-read and long-read sequencing technologies has become a promising approach for achieving accurate and comprehensive genomic analysis. While short-read sequencing (Illumina, etc.) offers high base accuracy and cost efficiency, it struggles with structural variation (SV) detection and complex genomic regions. In contrast, long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi) excels in resolving large SVs and repetitive sequences but is limited by throughput, higher Indel error rates, and sequencing costs. Hybrid approaches may combine these technologies and leverage their complementary strengths and different sources of error to provide higher accuracy, more comprehensive results, and higher throughput by lowering the coverage requirement for the long reads. Methods: This study benchmarks the DNAscope Hybrid pipeline, a novel integrated alignment and variant calling framework that combines short- and long-read data sequenced from the same sample. We evaluate its performance across multiple human genome reference datasets (HG002-HG004) using the draft Q100 and Genome in a Bottle v4.2.1 benchmarks. The pipeline's ability to detect small variants (SNPs/Indels), structural variants (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs) is assessed using data from the Illumina and Pacbio sequencing systems at varying read depths (5x-30x). Benchmark results are compared to DeepVariant. Results: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline significantly improves SNP and Indel calling accuracy, particularly in complex genomic regions. At lower long-read depths (e.g., 5x-10x), the hybrid approach outperforms standalone short- or long-read pipelines at full sequencing depths (30x-35x). Additionally, the DNAscope Hybrid outperforms leading open-source tools for SV and CNV detection, enhancing variant discovery in challenging genomic regions. The pipeline also demonstrates clinical utility by identifying disease-associated variants. Moreover, DNAscope Hybrid is highly efficient, achieving less than 90 minutes runtimes at single standard instance. Conclusion: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline is a computationally efficient, highly accurate variant calling framework that leverages the advantages of both short- and long-read sequencing. By improving variant detection in challenging genomic regions and offering a robust solution for clinical and large-scale genomic applications, it holds significant promise for genetic disease diagnostics, population-scale studies, and personalized medicine.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

C.; Bonhoeffer, S.; Regoes, R. R.", "abstract": "The study of evolution in organisms with high mutation rates requires detailed data on the genomic composition of the population. Here we report on an innovative use of high-throughput sequencing technology combined with rapid experimental evolution that allowed us to follow the genetic diversification of four independent bacteriophage populations that we evolved without imposing any direct selection pressure for 412 generations in unprecedented detail. Tracing over 80000 bacteriophage genomes, of which 884 are unique, we find that evolution is largely neutral but document multiple instances of parallel evolution. Unlike previous observations of parallelism, we do not just see the parallel evolution of mutations at single sites, but on the level of full-length genomes. Computer simulations that recapitulate our experiments in great detail show that this degree of paralellism is inconsistent with neutral evolution. We further show that the observed extent of parallel evolution biases phylodynamic analysis of migration rates, and wrongly estimates significant migration between the independent evolution lines. Our approach is applicable to many other viruses and paves the way to advanced population genetic investigations that aim to shed light on phenomena that relate to genetic linkage across the genome.\n\nSignificance StatementGenetic sequences of organisms contain imprints of their population biology and migration history. To recover this history, phylodynamic inference has been developed that combines phylogenetics with population biological models. Although phylodynamic methods are being applied widely, they have not yet been experimentally validated. To do this, we evolved a bacteriophage in four independent evolution lines for over 400 generations. We did not impose any direct selection pressure in these evolution experiments because phylodynamic inference works best in neutrally evolving systems. We found that often the same mutations and combinations of mutations evolve in the independent evolution lines. As a result, phylodynamics wrongly estimates migration between the lines. We conclude that the effects of selection should be included into phylodynamic inference.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as Onecut2, Pou2f1, and Zic3 remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as Thrb, Rxrg, and Mef2c expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that Zic3 and Mef2c are sufficient to promote cone photoreceptor and respress rod specification, and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors. These results demonstrate that evolutionary modifications to gene regulatory networks underlie the development of cone-dominant retinas and provide insight into mechanisms of sensory adaptation and potential strategies for cone photoreceptor regeneration in vision disorders.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Given this, we hypothesised that the pharmacokinetics, the temporal changes of drug concentrations under treatment, could impact persister formation. We predicted that the longer bacteria spend under sublethal drug concentrations, the more persisters would form. Using a set-up with small chemostats and the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan, we indeed found that faster pharmacokinetics resulted in lower persister numbers compared to slower pharmacokinetics. This finding provides a proof of principle that pharmacokinetics, which can be influenced by treatment procedures, has consequences for persister formation. Our results suggest that faster pharmacokinetics could be useful to minimize persister numbers and hence to lower the risks of relapse or resistance evolution.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Existing cat-RNA designs were manually generated to be broad-host range, providing no control over the organisms that were barcoded. To achieve control over the organisms barcoded by cat-RNA, we created a program called Ribodesigner that uses input sets of rRNA sequences to create designs with varying specificities.

We use Ribodesigner to create cat-RNA designs that target Pseudomonadales while avoiding Enterobacterales, and we compare the performance of one design to a cat-RNA that was previously found to be broad host range.

Here, we identify a signalling cascade involving FGF8, MafB, and cadherin-22 that orchestrates this morphogenetic process.\n\nWe show that FGF8 is selectively expressed in the developing auditory hindbrain and correlates spatiotemporally with lamina formation in the nL. Disruption of FGF signalling--either via misexpression of FGF8 or dominant-negative FGFR1--perturbs the formation of the nL and alters cadherin-22 expression. In vitro culture experiments further reveal that nL lamination is sensitive to FGF8 dosage, with an optimal concentration required for both FGF8 and MafB expression and correct structural organization.\n\nWe demonstrate that FGF8 induces MafB, which in turn regulates cadherin-22 expression, a cell adhesion molecule enriched in the dendrites of nL neurons. Functional disruption of cadherins impairs lamina formation and leads to scattered FGF8 expression, indicating a feedback loop between adhesion and signalling. Computational models--both static and dynamic--show that bipolar dendrite-localized adhesion can drive laminar architecture as the maximum adhesion configuration.\n\nThese findings establish a novel molecular and biophysical mechanism for neuronal lamination in the vertebrate hindbrain, showing how local FGF signalling, transcriptional regulation, and dendritic adhesion converge to shape neural circuitry essential for sound localization.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Muscle biopsies were analyzed for fiber type composition, fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), and satellite cell- and myonuclear content using immunofluorescence. The training regimens led to comparable increases in maximal strength in multi-joint movements (21%), but not in single-joint movements were HL-RET was superior. LL-RET induced superior improvements in local muscle endurance (9% vs -2.7%, p=0.013). Regardless of training regimen, muscle thickness increased by ~7.4% at the mid-thigh site and ~8.5% at the distal site pre- to post-intervention.

Our approach challenges established methods for CRISPR screen analysis, while offering additional insight into selection dynamics through the Kullback-Leibler divergence (DKL) and cumulants of the fitness distribution. By modeling fluctuations in gene-fitness effects as a linear response to environmental perturbations, we derive a geometric measure for genomic information content based on a second-order approximation of the DKL. Our analysis reveals that functional information-encoded (or shared) between genes-can be quantified by analyzing the directions corresponding to maximal conditional selection within the space of decomposed gene-environment interactions. This geometric representation offers several advantages for the functional analysis of the human genome and its network architecture.

PTPRZ1 is expressed in several neural cell types, including radial glial stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and regulates critical aspects of neurodevelopment, including neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation, myelination, and extracellular matrix (ECM) development. Moreover, altered PTPRZ1 expression is associated with schizophrenia and glioblastoma. Therefore, this mouse model is a valuable resource for investigating cell-type-specific PTPRZ1 function in numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropathological mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of mitochondrial function as one of these fundamental pathways involved in neurodevelopment. Our study investigates the role of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like (HPDL) protein in cortical neurogenesis and mitochondrial activity, since mutations in the HPDL gene are associated with SPG83, a childhood-onset form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by corticospinal tract degeneration and cortical abnormalities. Starting from mutant neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrated that HPDL is essential to mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and cellular redox balance. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulated pathways related to neurogenesis, implicating HPDL role in early cortical development. To further elucidate the role of HPDL, we generated cortical neurons and organoids from SPG83 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant cells exhibited premature neurogenesis at early differentiation stages, likely leading to depletion of cortical progenitors, as evidenced by decreased proliferation, slight increase of apoptosis, and unbalanced cortical type composition at later stages. Furthermore, cortical organoids derived from SPG83 patients showed impaired growth, reminding microcephaly observed in severe cases. In addition, mitochondrial morpho-functional characterization in mutant neurons confirmed disruption of OxPhos chain functionality and increased ROS generation rate. Treatment of cortical cells with two antioxidant compounds, could partially revert premature neurogenesis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a critical role for HPDL in coordinating cortical progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These insights shed light on a mechanistical understanding of SPG83 pathology and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting oxidative stress in this and related neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and primary motor cortex (M1) to directly manipulate phase relationships in the beta band and assess their effects on both functional connectivity and motor inhibition. Fifty-two healthy participants received in-phase, anti-phase and sham stimulation while performing a stop-signal task. The results revealed that connectivity between rIFG and lM1 increased following in-phase but decreased after anti-phase stimulation. Although no direct modulation of task performance was observed, the greater connectivity increase between the targets during in-phase stimulation was predictive of faster inhibitory performance. In contrast, greater connectivity decreases during anti-phase stimulation were related to faster go responses, suggesting a shift towards less inhibition on the motor system. These findings provide evidence that dual-site beta-tACS can both enhance and impair inhibitory control depending on phase alignment, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive intervention for disorders marked by impaired inhibition.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In mice, six ipRGC subtypes have been discovered based on morphological characteristics, functions, and molecular profiles. All ipRGCs arise from Tbr2-expressing RGCs during developmental stages and subsequently diverge and differentiate into the six mature, distinct subtypes in adult retinas. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the formation and maturation of the six ipRGC subtypes remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two Tbr2-dependent transcription factors, Iroquois-related homeobox 1 (Irx1) and T-box containing factor 20 (Tbx20), are key downstream transcription factors guiding lineage segregations of Tbr2-expressing RGC into distinct adult ipRGC subtypes. Both factors also control Opn4 expression. Irx1 is expressed in the M3, M4, and M5 subtypes, while Tbx20 is predominantly expressed in M1, M2, M6, and subgroups of M3 and M5. When Irx1 is ablated during retinal development, Opn4 expression is significantly reduced in the M3, M4, and M5 ipRGC groups; however, the formation of Irx1-expressing ipRGCs is not affected. In contrast, when Tbx20 is deleted, a significant number of Tbx20-expressing cells fail to develop while Opn4 expression is down-regulated. These findings reveal two parallel transcription cascades downstream of Tbr2 for controlling ipRGC subtype formation, fate divergence, and maintenance in the adult retina.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

The fossil record of early passerines is relatively sparse and molecular-clock estimates of the passerine crown age have varied widely, with most previous studies relying on external fossil calibrations or assumptions relating to Gondwanan vicariance. In this study, we estimated the passerine evolutionary timescale by incorporating a set of 43 passerine fossils selected through a detailed assessment, while using a Bayesian tip-dating approach with the unresolved fossilized birth-death process. Our analyses ultimately place the passerine crown age in the Eocene, which largely closes the gap between molecular and palaeontological estimates of the passerine evolutionary timescale. Our date estimates are somewhat influenced by the prior probability density for the starting time of the diversification process. Through a simulation study, we show that the effect of the starting-time prior can be attenuated by the inclusion of morphological data for fossil and extant taxa. Overall, our study demonstrates that incorporating a curated, comprehensive set of fossils is effective in producing a well-resolved estimate of the passerine evolutionary timescale, while highlighting potential avenues for refining this estimate using Bayesian tip-dating analyses.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

A typical action consists of a movement and a performance outcome, e.g., grabbing a coffee cup involves a reaching movement and its actual landing of the hand relative to the target cup. While performance error is fundamental for the cognitive component of motor learning, what error, either performance or movement prediction error, underlies implicit motor learning has not been resolved. These two errors are hard to disentangle as the performance outcome is an integral part of the movement. Here we used the classical visuomotor adaptation paradigm, in which people learn to counter visual perturbations by deliberately aiming off the target, to dissociate the performance error from the prediction error. Using a series of behavioral experiments and model comparisons, we revealed that movement prediction error, but not performance error, can parsimoniously explain diverse learning effects. Importantly, despite the perturbation is visual, the movement prediction error is not specified in visual terms, but determined by a perceptual estimate of the hand kinematics. In other words, contrary to the widely-held concept of sensory prediction error, a perceptual prediction error drives implicit motor learning.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Glutamate gradually decreased during deeper sleep stages compared to wakefulness in the second session, with better sleep quality. No such change occurred in the first session with poorer sleep, likely due to the first-night effect. Furthermore, reduced glutamate significantly mediated sleep-onset latency in both sessions.

This interhemispheric communication is essential for sensory perception and involves reciprocal connections between homotopic sensory areas. A key role in this process is attributed to interhemispheric inhibition which, owing to its long-lasting form, is posited to operate largely through neurogliaform cells (NGCs). However, direct evidence on the role of NGCs in interhemispheric inhibition is missing. Here we show that NGCs in the mouse barrel cortex (BC) are engaged by interhemispheric callosal projections to modulate pyramidal neuron (PN) activity and sensory perception. Using optogenetics, ex vivo whole-cell recordings, and in vivo calcium imaging, we found that layer 1 and layer 2/3 (L1-3) NGCs are strongly activated by the callosal and suppressed by the thalamocortical pathway, suggesting that NGCs encode ipsilateral rather than contralateral whisker stimuli. We also found that direct stimulation of L1-3 NGCs modulates whisker-evoked activity in L2/3 and L5b PNs, and increases the perceptual threshold in a whisker-deflection detection task. Furthermore, these effects were recapitulated by direct stimulation of callosal projections and deflection of the ipsilateral whiskers respectively, suggesting that the effect of the callosal pathway on sensory perception is mediated by NGCs. Our results not only prove that NGCs mediate interhemispheric inhibition, but also demonstrate their role in sensory perception via modulation of the main units involved in cortical input and output.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

The long ZAP isoform preferentially binds viral RNA, which is promoted by TRIM25. The endoribonuclease KHNYN then cleaves viral RNA at positions of ZAP binding. The 5' cleavage fragment undergoes TUT4/TUT7-mediated 3' uridylation and degradation by DIS3L2. The 3' cleavage fragment is degraded by XRN1. ZAP and TRIM25 interact with KHNYN, TUT7, DIS3L2 and XRN1 in a RNase-resistant manner.

Here, a Buster x Charger population comprising 108 doubled haploid lines was grown across four year-sites under UK field conditions. TS was recorded through meristem dissection and SE duration was measured as the time between TS and ear emergence (EE). Mixed model analysis across year-sites revealed high heritabilities (H2yield = 0.66, H2TS = 0.93, H2SE = 0.89, H2EE = 0.95) and strong genetic correlations between yield and the phenology traits SE and EE (rg = 0.56 and rg = 0.6, respectively). While SE duration was mainly driven by EE, independent QTL for TS suggest that SE could be modified without affecting EE. The positive effect of SE duration on yield was attributed to increased grain number per area as well as increased grain weight, through independent QTL. Although validation in broader genetic backgrounds is needed, these QTL may offer opportunities for further yield increase in a physiological breeding framework.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Where a Lactobacillus-dominated microenvironment is typically considered optimal, a polymicrobial environment is associated with increased risk for female reproductive diseases. Recent work has examined bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles (bEVs) as an important mode of microbe-host communication in the female reproductive tract, with bEVs exhibiting unique species- and strain-level functions that may influence women's health outcomes. However, in order to communicate with female reproductive tissues, bEVs must be able to penetrate the protective cervicovaginal mucus barrier. As the first line of defense against bacteria and pathogens, cervicovaginal mucus protects against infection in the female reproductive tract through steric, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions with foreign pathogens. Here, we hypothesize that the physical properties of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles enable their mobility through cervicovaginal mucus and permit interactions with upper female reproductive tract tissues. We demonstrate that the barrier properties of mucus allow increased diffusion of bEVs, compared to whole bacteria. We evaluate the uptake of bEVs by, and the resulting effects on, human vaginal epithelial, endometrial, and placental cells, highlighting potential mechanisms of action by which vaginal dysbiosis contributes to gynecologic and obstetric diseases.

Desmoplasia, which is a dense deposition of stroma, is a major reason for therapy resistance, acting both as a physical barrier that interferes with drug penetration and as a supportive niche that protects cancer cells through diverse mechanisms. A precise understanding of spatial cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment in stroma-rich cancers is essential for optimizing therapeutic responses. It allows detailed mapping of stromal-tumor interfaces, comprehensive phenotyping of diverse cell types and their functional states, and insights into changes in cellular distribution and tissue architecture, thus leading to an improved assessment of drug responses. Recent advances in multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging have enabled the acquisition of large batches of whole-slide tumor images, but scalable and reproducible methods to analyze the spatial distribution of cell states relative to stromal regions remain limited. To address this gap, we developed an open-source computational pipeline that integrates QuPath (Bankhead et al. 2017), StarDist (Schmidt et al. 2018), and custom Python scripts to quantify biomarker expression at a single- and sub-cellular resolution across entire tumor sections. Our workflow includes: (i) automated nuclei segmentation using StarDist, (ii) machine learning-based cell classification using multiplexed marker expression, (iii) modeling of stromal regions based on fibronectin staining, (iv) sensitivity analyses on classification thresholds to ensure robustness across heterogeneous datasets, and (v) distance-based quantification of the proximity of each cell to the stromal border. To improve consistency across slides with variable staining intensities, we introduce a statistical strategy that translates classification thresholds by propagating a chosen reference percentile across the distribution of marker-related cell measurement in each image. We apply this approach to quantify spatial patterns of distribution of the phosphorylated form of the N-Myc downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a novel DNA repair protein that conveys signals from the ECM to the nucleus to maintain replication fork homeostasis, and a known cell proliferation marker Ki67 in fibronectin-defined stromal regions in PDAC xenografts.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors are treated with endocrine therapies such as Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI), aimed at disrupting tumor-promoting estrogen signaling. While these therapies are initially effective, resident tumor cells can develop resistance, leading to relapse. The p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a key regulator of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and has been implicated in resistance to Tamoxifen. However, it remains unclear, whether PAK1 also affects the response to other endocrine therapies. Using global phosphoproteomic profiling of endocrine resistant cell line models, we observed elevated PAK1 activity in cells resistant to Tamoxifen and to estrogen deprivation, respectively, with further increases following EGF stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK1 effectively reduced cell proliferation in both resistance models, however, with distinct effects on PAK1 downstream substrates and pathways. In the Tamoxifen resistance context, PAK1 reduces apoptosis via inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, whereas in the AI resistance model PAK1 rather triggers proliferation via RAF1. Our findings position PAK1 as a common mediator of resistance to different endocrine therapies and offer insights into the distinct signaling networks that are involved. In summary, our results suggest that targeting PAK1 may present a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer, potentially enhancing the efficacy of both Tamoxifen and AI treatments.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that pre-symptomatic male MJD mice present with significantly different microbiome communities as early as 5-weeks-old. Furthermore, we show that male MJD mice have faster total gut transit times by 9-weeks-old, prior to signs of impaired motor function by 11- weeks-old. To elucidate whether these microbial and colonic functional changes are due to the presence of pathological and morphological changes in the gut, we quantified the formation of ataxin-3 protein aggregates within the gut and examined morphological changes within the gut of pre- and early symptomatic MJD mice relative to proteinopathy in the brain. Interestingly, we observed ataxin-3 aggregates within the brains of pre-symptomatic MJD mice, with significantly more aggregates present in MJD than WT mice from 7-weeks-of-age, an earlier timepoint than previously reported, coinciding with changes within the microbiome. However, we observed no ataxin-3 protein aggregates and no changes in enteric neuron populations or morphology within the gut. Analysis of endocrine factors involved in gut motility and inflammatory markers within the small intestine of 13-week-old males revealed increased expression of genes encoding cholecystokinin (Cck), ghrelin (Ghrl), heme oxygenase (Ho1), interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). Together, we demonstrate for the first time that colonic dysfunction occurs after gut microbiome changes, but prior to the onset of motor impairments in male MJD mice.

The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida harbors several large polymorphic inversions, one of which (Cf-Inv(4.1)) displays a latitudinal cline of frequencies along the North American Atlantic Coast. This distribution suggests a putative role in adaptation along the eco-climatic gradient. To further investigate this hypothesis, we designed a molecular marker to identify the different karyotypes and studied natural and experimental populations from America and Europe. We confirmed that this inversion is also present and polymorphic in Europe and displays parallel latitudinal clines across continents, providing strong indirect support that Cf-Inv(4.1) is under natural selection along similar environmental gradients. We found that Cf-Inv(4.1) had no effect on cold tolerance but a significant impact on egg-to-adult survival and fecundity under different thermal conditions. We speculate that fitness associated with the inversion may be shaped by subtle life-history differences whose relative advantage depend on climate. While our experimental approaches provided insights into genotype-phenotype associations, it is worth noting that natural selection acts on the overall fitness, involving complex sets of traits. This is especially relevant for inversions linking hundreds of genes.

R.", "abstract": "A novel bacteriophage vB_CoeS_P1, isolated in the surface waters of the Cochin estuary of Kerala, India, was identified as the first phage known to infect Vibrio hepatarius. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the phage had a myovirus morphotype with an icosahedral head and a long contractile tail. Characterization experiments show that the phage was stable across a temperature range of 4oC to 60oC, a pH of 4 to 12, and a salinity range of 0.5 % to 16%. One-step growth curve analysis revealed a burst size of 30 PFU/Cell and a latent period of 20 minutes. The phage contains a double-stranded DNA with 136,927 bp and 34.93% GC content. The NCBI Blastn analysis reveals that vB_CoeS_P1 exhibits very low sequence similarity (1% query coverage and 77.82% identity) with Vb_VpaM_R16F (OP793884.1). It has 265 predicted ORFs, among them 57 have putative functions with no tRNA, antibiotic encoding genes, and resistance encoding genes. Three putative auxiliary metabolic genes were identified, encoding pyrophosphohydrolase enzyme (ORF 75), PhoH-like phosphate starvation-inducible (ORF 34), and Endonuclease V N-glycosylase UV repair enzyme (ORF 248). Phylogenetic analysis of conversed genes revealed that vB_CoeS_P1 is clustered with Vb_VpaM_R16F but diverged into a distinct clade. Further whole genome proteomic tree analysis, comparative genome analysis using average nucleotide identity (ANI), and network analysis confirmed that vB_CoeS_P1 contains a unique genetic and evolutionary architecture. These findings support the proposal of a new bacteriophage family Estovirdae, within the Caudoviricetes class.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies of the species have demonstrated remarkably low diversity, with strains typically differing by about 1.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per 10 kb. However, SNP calling alone does not capture the full extent of genetic variation. Here, we define the pangenome of 372 C. parapsilosis isolates to determine variation in gene content. The pangenome consists of 5,859 genes, of which 48 are not found in the genome of the reference strain. This includes 5,791 core genes (present in [&ge;] 99.5% of isolates). Four genes, including the allantoin permease gene DAL4, were present in all isolates but were truncated in some strains. The truncated DAL4 was classified as a pseudogene in the reference strain CDC317. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing showed that removing the early stop codon (producing the full-length Dal4 protein) is associated with improved use of allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. We find that the accessory genome of C. parapsilosis consists of 68 homologous clusters. This includes 38 previously annotated genes, 27 novel paralogs of previously annotated genes and 3 uncharacterised ORFs. Approximately one-third of the accessory genome (24/68 genes) is associated with gene fusions between tandem genes in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS).

The hallmark of STEC virulence is the production of a potent phage-borne cytotoxin, often accompanied by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). This study explores the genomic landscape, virulence factors, and resistance traits of O118 STEC. We analyzed 357 publicly available O118 genomes across ten H-antigens and included two clinically significant O118:H16 STEC strains sequenced to closure. Pangenome assessment and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 4,160 shared genes revealed phylogenetic clustering by H-type and delineated distinct STEC-phylogroups, alongside relationships to non-STEC pathovars such as uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Identified STEC phylogroups encompassed H6, H12, H16, and H2 strains with diverse Shiga toxin (stx) profiles (stx1a, stx2a, stx2b, stx2c, stx2f). A subset of H2-STEC lacked stx, suggesting potential secondary phage loss. Most STEC groups harbored the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Further, a strong correlation was observed between H-antigens and eae subtypes, with specific pairings such as H6/eae-{iota}, H16/eae-{beta}, and H2/eae-{varepsilon}. Horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands-including O-island 122 in H16 strains and a novel pathogenicity-associated island carrying antibiotic resistance-along with other loci related to colonization and interbacterial competition, further enhance these strains' virulence potential. Our findings underscore the genetic diversity and virulence potential of O118 STEC.

Applying our model, JODIE, to 30,000 child-mother-father trios with phased DNA information from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and the Norwegian Mother, Father, Child Cohort (MoBa), we jointly estimate the phenotypic variance attributable to these four effects unbiased of assortative mating (AM) for height, body mass index (BMI) and childhood educational test score (EA). For all three traits, direct effects make the largest contribution to the genetic effect variance. But we find that parental indirect genetic effects make an equivalent combined contribution, and that there is a non-zero PofO effect variance for all traits. We calculate the heritability that would be obtained at the population-level in the absence of AM for common DNA loci, and show that the proportional contribution of direct effects to these heritability values can be calculated as 64.0% for EA in MoBa, 77.1% and 63.4% for height in MoBa and EstBB, and 81.2% and 88.0% for BMI in MoBa and EstBB. Additionally, using within-family genome-wide association testing, we identify 276 independently associated DNA regions that replicate across two additional biobanks, which all show a genotype-phenotype relationship that reflects an interplay of direct, indirect and PofO effects. Determining how direct, parental and PofO genetic effects combine across loci genome-wide to influence human phenotypic variation requires joint modeling of parental and child genotypes alongside the parental origin of loci.

Thirty five spice species, primarily herbaceous, with Lamiaceae emerging as the most dominant family documents. The findings underscore the centrality of homegardens as reservoirs of agrobiodiversity and hubs of traditional knowledge transmission. Spices were found to serve diverse roles culinary, medicinal, and ritual positioning them as biocultural keystone species intricately linked to local health systems, cultural identity, and daily life. Community preference rankings and culinary preparation methods revealed nuanced valuations based not only on taste but also cultural symbolism and perceived health benefits. Moreover, the study highlights gendered and socioeconomic dimensions of spice use and management, revealing persistent inequalities in resource access, decision-making, and benefit-sharing, despite womens key roles in preserving and utilizing these resources. The research emphasizes the need for inclusive, gender-sensitive policies that recognize and protect indigenous ecological knowledge systems.

In our analysis, task-induced fatigue was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe, corresponding to the level of fatigue perceived at the beginning, middle, and end of the task period. Our study revealed the following significant findings: (1) Linear mixed-effects modeling of event-related desynchronization (ERD) EEG analysis during the EF task demonstrated significant effects of group and fatigue levels in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). (2) EF task-specific functional connectivity was estimated using the debiased weighted phase-lag index (dwPLI), which demonstrated reduced inter-regional connectivity in the M1 and prefrontal regions in the CRF group compared with the HC group. (3) The dwPLI analysis identified significantly reduced alpha-band connectivity strength in the CRF group, particularly between the right supramarginal gyrus and other brain regions during mild fatigue. (4) Additionally, resting-state EEG exhibited globally elevated delta band (1-4 Hz) activity in CRF survivors than HC, potentially reflecting chronic fatigue. These observations emphasize the clinical relevance of resting-state EEG, motor activity-related ERD and functional brain connectivity as potential CRF biomarkers.

Our patient data-driven model tightly integrates 3D structural mechanics of the LA myocardium, incorporating both passive and active components, with a 0D closed-loop lumped parameter network (LPN)-based circulatory system model. A finite element (FE) model of LA tissue is constructed from the patients images, assuming uniform thickness and employing rule-based fiber directions, a structurally based constitutive model for the passive mechanics, and a phenomenological contraction model while applying physiologically relevant boundary conditions. We then adopted a multi-step personalization approach, in which the LPN parameters with a surrogate LA model are first optimized to match cuff-based blood pressures and cardiac lumen volumes derived from time-resolved 3D gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. The surrogate LA pressure during passive expansion is used to estimate myocardial passive mechanics parameters and the reference unloaded configuration using an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework. Finally, a robust multiscale coupling is applied between the iFEA-optimized FE model and the tuned 0D LPN model to characterize LA contraction. This effectively captures the 8-shaped pressure-volume curve and reasonably aligns with the image-based cavity volumes and deformation. The resulting simulation-predicted deformation is imposed as a moving-wall boundary condition to model atrial hemodynamics.

Our study investigated the coordination in photosynthetic and mitochondrial activity during (12:12 h) light-dark cycle in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Live cell confocal imaging revealed light-dark-dependent mitochondrial morphology transitions from fragmented to intermediate to tubular forms by the end of 12 hr of light period, which reverses sharply through 6 and 12 hr of dark. Concurrently, chloroplast transitions from an intact cup (light) to a distorted and punctured structure (dark), which gets reversed in light phase. Spatial mapping showed tubular mitochondria positioned peripherally to the chloroplast cup in light, whereas fragmented and intermediate mitochondria were diffused around distorted chloroplast in dark, which again gets reversed in light. Functional analysis using 77K spectroscopy and photosynthetic protein levels (PsaA and D1) reflected that PSI/PSII fluorescence ratio remains stable in continuous light condition but increased exceptionally in continuous dark, which led to rhythmic oscillation in fluorescence ratio in light/dark-dependent manner in synchronous cultures. Mitochondrial activity, measured using Seahorse flux analyzer, showed basal oxygen consumption rate in continuous light and a marked reduction in continuous dark condition, resulting in rhythmic changes in light-dark cycle, indicating a coordinated rhythmicity in organellar function. Further, Target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase activity was essential to maintain inter-organellar coupled rhythmicity as evidenced by subdued rhythmicity following TOR kinase inhibition.

At the present, structures of PBS with tricylindrical and pentacylindrical cores have been determined while the structure of the PBS with a bicylindrical core is yet to be revealed. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of PBS with bicylindrical core from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus 7942) at 2.98 [A] resolution. Similar to the PBS with a tricylindrical core, six peripheral rods are attached to the core by the rod-core linker protein CpcG in the PBS of Synechococcus 7942 even though the core lacks the top AP cylinder, which is important for the attachment of peripheral rods to the tricylindrical cores. We found that the C-terminus of ApcE in the Synechococcus 7942 was involved in interacting with both CpcG and CpcB of a top peripheral rod, compensating for the absence of the top AP cylinder of the core and maintaining PBS stability. Analysis of the bilin distribution reveals that distance of excitation energy transfer from top peripheral rods to the terminal emitters is approximately 15% shorter compared to the PBS with tricylindrical cores. Although there are 30% fewer bilin chromophores in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core compared with the tricylindrical core, the aromatic residue ring in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core is conserved, supporting the suggestion that these aromatic residues from AP and linker proteins are critical to the energy transfer of PBS.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Although small and large errors are known to engage distinct motor learning mechanisms - model-free (implicit) or model-based (explicit), respectively - it remains unclear whether successfully deploying one mechanism might hamper the engagement of the other in subsequent learning tasks. Here, we investigated how prior engagement of a particular mechanism biases future adaptations, even when the new task context typically favours the alternative strategy. Across three experiments (N=82), participants performed reaching movements to targets that either remained fixed or jumped mid-movement by small (15{degrees}) or large (30{degrees}, 45{degrees}, or 60{degrees}) angles. When first exposed to small errors (15{degrees}), participants exhibited persistent aftereffects in subsequent catch trials and stable reaction times (RTs), hallmarks of a model-free, habitual process. Surprisingly, even when switching to larger error magnitudes later, these participants continued to show robust aftereffects and did not elevate RTs - indicating a carryover of model-free learning. Conversely, participants who initially experienced large errors showed minimal aftereffects and flexible RT modulation consistent with model-based strategies; this bias persisted in later sessions with smaller errors, leading to reduced habitual aftereffects. Notably, inserting a washout phase to reset baseline performance did not abolish these mechanistic biases, highlighting that the initial engagement of either model-free or model-based processes leaves a durable imprint on subsequent adaptations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that motor learning is shaped not only by ongoing task demands (e.g., error magnitude) but also by an individual's prior learning history.

When the target appeared after the expected frame, accuracy was lower than in the same neutral condition frame, suggesting an attentional suppressive wake in time (because the effect of attention cannot be observed until after stimulus onset).", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We investigated how the human brain evaluates consumer items, both individually and in bundles, and how this activity relates to choice behavior. Participants underwent a deep-fMRI scanning protocol while we elicited behavioral valuations for single and bundled items. Behaviorally, we find that bundle values are sub-additively discounted compared to the sum of individual item values. Neurally, we find that the same distributed network in pre-frontal cortex computes the value of a bundle and its constituent individual items, but the value representation undergoes a normalization that actively re-scales across bundle and single item contexts. These findings suggest that generalized value regions contextually adapt within a valuation hierarchy, as opposed to utilizing an absolute value code.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

It is strongly associated with obesity, disease progression being promoted not only by hepatic leukocyte accumulation but also by inflammatory signals from adipose tissue and an altered gut microbiome. To determine the contribution of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to MASLD pathogenesis, mice with an ICAM-1 mutation (Icam1tmBay) were compared to wild type (WT) mice in a Western-style diet (WD) model. WD-induced MASLD was accompanied by increased ICAM-1 expression in liver, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and intestine in WT mice. WD-fed Icam1tmBay mice exhibited increased circulating neutrophils, higher frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes in EWAT, and a worsened glucose tolerance when compared to WT mice. In contrast, the mutation resulted in reduced WD-induced liver damage and less accumulation of intrahepatic leukocytes. WD-feeding caused substantial changes in fecal microbiota with decreased microbial diversity that differed between the mouse strains. In conclusion, ICAM-1 positively regulates adipose tissue homeostasis and protects from insulin resistance but promotes liver damage in diet-induced obesity. This points to various organ-specific roles for ICAM-1 and the potential of liver-specific targeting of ICAM-1 for treatment of MASLD.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Akuamoah-Boateng, Y.; Afrane, Y. A.; Reece, S. E.", "abstract": "Background and objectives: Vector-borne disease transmission follows daily rhythms because the transmission of pathogens occur at the time of day vectors forage for blood. Insecticide-treated bed nets significantly reduce malaria transmission by interrupting the host seeking behaviour of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes, yet residual transmission is an increasing problem. Biting when humans are unprotected by bed nets is thought to be a driver of residual transmission, but why mosquitoes are shifting their biting rhythms is poorly understood. We test whether food availability, which mediates activity and foraging rhythms across diverse animal taxa, influences the time of day that mosquitoes bite. Methodology: We varied the amount of blood and sucrose that female Anopheles gambiae s.l. received, and used human-mimic traps in a semi-field system to test the hypothesis that low resources cause host seeking to occur at earlier and later times of day. Results: Nutritional resources determine both the likelihood and time of day that host seeking occurs. Specifically, low-resourced mosquitoes were 2-3 fold more likely to host seek overall, and 5-10 fold more likely to host seek at an earlier time of day than well-resourced mosquitoes, which predominantly sought a host in the second half of the night time. Conclusions and Implications: By driving plasticity in biting time of day, mosquito nutritional condition is an underappreciated contributor to residual malaria transmission. Understanding the drivers of biting time of day variation, and their impacts on parasite development, is crucial for the future success of vector control tools and controlling malaria transmission.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We investigated the genetic architecture and cellular basis of flag leaf length (FLL) and width (FLW) in a multi-parent population comprised of 45 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (HvDRR) in barley. Fine mapping of a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) was performed as a first step to isolate the causal gene. Natural variation of FLL and FLW across multi-environment was highly heritable and genotypes adapted to warm climate produced longer and wider flag leaf than those adapted to cooler regions. The variation in flag leaf size was quantitatively inherited and influenced by 24 consensus QTLs of which 17 have not been reported earlier. Further, validation of QTL qHvDRR-FLS-8 and qHvDRR-FLS-17 in nearly isogenic RILs demonstrated that these QTLs also controlled length and width of leaves older than flag leaf. The number of epidermal cells primarily determined the differences in FLL and FLW. In addition, we identified the previously unknown effect of genic- and epiallele at Vrn-H1 on flag leaf size variation in spring barley. Furthermore, we fine-mapped qHvDRR-FLS-8, narrowing the interval from 8.7 to 3.5 Mb.

Traditional array-based screening methods, which require significant cell numbers, face limitations when working with samples that have low proliferation capacity. While pooled library methods such as CRISPR screens can be solutions to these experimental efficiency challenges, there is still room for improvement in terms of cost and convenience. In response to these challenges, we developed PiER (Perturbation-induced intracellular events recorder) technology. PiER facilitates gene perturbation and intracellular signal detection through a novel system that integrates three DNA domains. The Perturbation domain induces gene-specific disturbances, the Response domain expresses an enzyme upon desired cellular signals, and the Memory domain records perturbation history by altering its DNA sequence via the expressed enzyme. To demonstrate PiER's potential, we designed a vector which has a Response domain that detects WNT pathway activation. Transfecting HEK293 cells, we observed dose-dependent responses to WNT pathway activation using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), which confirmed successful intracellular event recording in the Memory domain. Further experiments with lentiviral PiER vectors containing a pooled shRNA library revealed the system's capability to conduct high-throughput screening by analyzing perturbations and their effects within individual cells. PiER technology significantly enhances screening capabilities by offering a versatile and scalable approach that can be deployed without prior cell modification and single-cell isolation. Its high throughput, combined with requiring minimal effort, presents a significant advancement for genomic research and drug target discovery.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Patient-specific TMJ implants often require detailed in-silico modelling based on subject-specific computed tomography (CT) scans of mandibles. However, creating these detailed finite element (FE) models is time-consuming and laborious due to segmentation of multiple components to appropriately capture the anatomical structure. Although it is known that any simplifications in the structure of mandible would influence its overall mechanical behaviour, influence of such modelling simplifications on TMJ implant design has hardly been investigated. Hence, this study investigates the biomechanical implications of following three model simplifications for intact and implanted mandibles: a detailed segmented mandible with tissue-specific material properties (Model 1), a simplified mandible made of cortical bone only (Model 2), and a further simplified mandible with dental crowns being excluded and made of cortical only (Model 3). For implanted mandible models, both narrow and standard TMJ implants were considered under both osseointegrated and non-osseointegrated conditions. Thus, a total of 15 FE models of intact (three) and implanted (12) models were developed. Physiological clenching activities were considered and the mechanical behaviour of intact and implanted mandibles were evaluated. Results revealed an overall reduction of 22-49% in principal stress, 16-50% in principal strain on bone and up to 79% in von Mises stress in TMJ implants in the biomechanically simplified model compared to the detailed segmented mandible model.

Numerous models have been proposed to identify damaging coding variants, with the most recent ones employing deep learning and large language models (LLM) to predict the impact of changes in coding sequences. Here, we use newly available proteomics data on 2,898 proteins across 46,665 individuals to evaluate and refine LLM predictors of damaging variants. Using one of these refined models, we evaluate association between rare damaging variants and human phenotypes at 241 positive control gene-trait pairs.

When attempting to recover known associations by correctly separating damaging singleton missense variants from other singleton variants, our approach recapitulates 36.5% of gene-trait pairs with known associations, exceeding all the alternatives we considered. Furthermore, when we apply our model to 10 exemplary traits from the UK Biobank, we identify 177 gene-trait associations - again exceeding all other approaches.

The method saw significant use for nucleic acids, proteins, synthetic polymers, and viruses throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, DGE-AUC has seen continued use in the polymer/nanoparticle field and the genomic DNA field. New developments in medicine have revived interest in the technique for the characterization of cell and gene therapeutics. While several theoretical (model-dependent) approaches exist to determine density at any given point along a density gradient at equilibrium, there is ample evidence in the 50+ years of density gradient literature that indicates the presence of pressure effects, solvent compressibility, and general nonideal behavior of the gradient medium that are not easily accounted for in models describing the density gradient. These complications led to the requirement for using reference standards at standard conditions where empirical relationships have been developed and tested over many years. With an interest in buoyant density determination for virtually any particle of various composition, an approach that does not rely on reference standards is desirable. The current manuscript details a fundamental model-independent method for determination of the buoyant density of a particle via DGE-AUC. An examination of this novel DGE-AUC method is presented in the context of NISTmAb and lambda bacteriophage DNA in a CsCl gradient, as well as polystyrene beads in a sucrose gradient.

Here, we present a new automated approach for quantifying HTRs using the open-source machine learning-based toolkits, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA). First, pose estimation DLC models were trained to predict X,Y coordinates of 13 body parts of C57BL/6J mice using historical experimental videos of HTRs induced by various psychedelic drugs and experimental conditions. Next, a non-overlapping set of historical experimental videos was analyzed and used to train SimBA random forest behavioral classifiers to predict the presence of the HTR. The DLC+SimBA approach was then validated using a separate subset of visually scored videos. DLC+SimBA model performance was assessed at different video frame rates (120, 60, 30 frames per second or fps) and resolutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%). Our results indicate that HTRs can be quantified accurately at 120 fps and 50% resolution (precision = 95.45, recall = 95.56, F1 = 95.51) or at lower frame rates (i.e., 60 fps and 50% resolution, precision = 91.00, recall = 86.23, F1 = 88.55). The best performing DLC+SimBA model combination was deployed to evaluate the effects of bufotenine, a tryptamine derivative with uncharacterized potency and efficacy in the HTR paradigm. Interestingly, bufotenine only induced elevated HTRs (ED50 = 0.99 mg/kg, max counts = 24) when serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1A) were pharmacologically blocked. HTR scores for a subset of 21 videos from bufotenine experiments were strongly correlated across DLC+SimBA, visual review, and semi-automated software detection methods (r = 0.98 -0.99).

This is partly due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which blocks the free passage of lipophobic molecules and those larger than 400 Da. One strategy to bypass this natural barrier is to use low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) to oscillate circulating micro-sized microbubbles which then exert mechanical stress on the vessel walls. This procedure allows for temporary disruption of the BBB and enhanced local delivery of therapeutics from the blood to the brain parenchyma. In this study, the effect of repeated BBB opening on neuroinflammation in a healthy mouse model was first explored followed by the effect of repeated opening on amyloid pathology in a model for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A cohort of wildtype mice was used to determine the effect of a single BBB opening mediated by ultrasound/microbubbles (US/MB) on the inflammatory profile, using RT-Q-PCR on brain extracts at 2-, 4-, 8- and 15-days post opening. A second cohort of ARTE10 mice, a mouse model for amyloid pathology, was treated with a different sequence of repeated US/MB mediated BBB opening to explore the effect on the pathology. Tissues were also analyzed for immune cell infiltration, microglia and astrocyte activation, and inflammatory response. Results: Our results demonstrate that the opening of the BBB leads to a mild inflammatory response in wild-type animals. However, repeated opening of the BBB in the ARTE10 model resulted in a decrease in amyloid pathology, along with a mild increase of growth factor. Conclusions: Altogether, this study suggests that sonication is not only a safe method to deliver therapeutics to the brain but could also have synergistic effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Although the brains structural and functional alterations with age are individually well documented, how differences in cognitive abilities emerge from variations in the underlying spatio-temporal patterns of regional brain activity is largely unknown. Patterns of increased synchronization between brain regions are taken as enhanced cognitive integration, while decreased synchronization is indicative of cognitive segregation. The ability to dynamically switch between different levels of integration and segregation across different cognitive systems is believed to be crucial for overall cognitive performance. Building on a recently proposed cognitively informed, synchronization-based framework, we study here age-related variations in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization or chimera states. Leveraging personalized brain network models based on large-scale, multisite datasets of cross-sectional healthy cohorts, we systematically show how regional brain stimulation produces distinct patterns of synchronization. We find that chimera states play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cognitive integration and segregation as the brain ages, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. Whereas the emergent synchronization behavior of brain regions belonging to the same cognitive system often show the same aging trends, different cognitive systems can demonstrate distinct trends. This supports the idea that aging affects cognitive systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging. At the same time, dynamical flexibility increases in the oldest age groups across most cognitive systems. This may reflect compensatory mechanisms to counteract age-related cognitive declines and points towards a phenomenon of dedifferentiation. Yet, the multiplicity of behaviors highlights that whereas dedifferentiation emerges in certain cognitive systems, differentiation can also occur in others. This illustrates that these processes, though seemingly oppositional, can coexist and unfold in parallel across different cognitive systems.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Both Dlk1 and Cebpa are regulated by the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2), which together form a pulse generator circuit that times Dlk1 expression and thus Notch activation, resulting in a salt and pepper pattern of AT1 and AT2 fate.

Fish shoals were faster to attack the food stimulus in larger groups and slower in turbid water, effects which were independent of one another. However, shoals became more cohesive and coordinated (i.e. more polarised in direction) in turbid water, and this corresponded to more cohesive and polarised shoals being faster to attack the food stimulus in turbid water but slower in clear water. Our results demonstrate that fish shoals can increase cohesion and coordination in moderate levels of turbidity, that this plasticity improves their response to ecologically relevant ephemeral stimuli, and that collective behaviour, rather than group size, can mediate the response of groups to environmental change.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Decades of biophysical, biochemical, and imaging studies on purified or in vitro reconstituted liposomes have shown that variations in lipid composition influence the physical properties of membranes, such as thickness and curvature. However, similar studies characterizing these membrane properties within the native cellular context have remained technically challenging. Recent advancements in cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) imaging enable high-resolution, three-dimensional views of native organellar membrane architecture preserved in near-native conditions. We previously developed a \"Surface Morphometrics\" pipeline that generates surface mesh reconstructions to model and quantify cellular membrane ultrastructure from cryo-ET data. Here, we expand this pipeline to measure the distance between the phospholipid head groups (PHG) of the membrane bilayer as a readout of membrane thickness. Using this approach, we demonstrate thickness variations both within and between distinct organellar membranes. We also demonstrate that membrane thickness positively correlates with other features, such as membrane curvedness. Further, we show that subcompartments of the mitochondrial inner membrane exhibit varying membrane thicknesses that are independent of network morphology (i.e., fragmented versus elongated networks). Finally, we demonstrate that large membrane-associated macromolecular complexes exhibit distinct density profiles that correlate with local variations in membrane thickness. Overall, our updated Surface Morphometrics pipeline provides a framework for investigating how changes in membrane composition in various cellular and disease contexts affect organelle ultrastructure and function.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

In particular, detecting interactions at submicromolar levels remains technically challenging, with most methods lacking the resolution required for molecular-level characterization. Here, we examined the interactions between high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA), a biologically and technologically relevant polymer, and a series of model oligopeptides--nonaarginine, nonalysine, and nonaglycine, chosen for their charge and side-chain chemistry. Using angle-resolved second harmonic scattering (AR-SHS), multi-angle dynamic light scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we captured a detailed molecular picture of HA-peptide interactions across a broad concentration range, including submicromolar concentrations. We found selective and multivalent interactions between HA and positively charged peptides, which are consistently stronger with nonaarginine. These interactions trigger significant solvent and solute remodeling, including nanoscale HA-peptide clustering. Our molecular simulations provide essential atomic-level interpretation of the experimental data, elucidating the transient and dynamic nature of the intermolecular interactions and the underlying processes of molecular aggregation and induced water reorientation. The distinct behavior found in arginine-rich peptides highlights their potential in modulating extracellular environments and as peptide-based drug delivery systems.

Notably, we found that the contribution of B cells to the CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-viral response was not associated with their ability to generate antibodies but with their ability to sustain Langerin+ type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), a dendritic cells (DC) subset known for being involved in viral and bacterial clearance in the marginal zone of the spleen. Furthermore, we found that the presence of Langerin+ cDC1s is dependent on B cells expressing lymphotoxin beta to maintain CD169+ marginal metallophilic macrophages (MMMs). We further discovered, using ligand-receptor interaction analyses, that the communication between MMMs and Langerin+ cDC1s was mediated via VCAM1 - ITGA4/ITGB1 interaction. Thus, our data reveals that B cell regulate the development of MMMs in the spleen via lymphotoxin beta; expression and consequently sustain Langerin+ cDC1s homeostasis for effective initiation of an anti-viral CD8+ T cell response.

However, the accuracy of genetic risk prediction remains moderate for most traits. Currently, most PGSs were built based on the summary statistics from the target trait, while many traits exhibit varied degrees of shared genetic architecture or pleiotropy. Appropriate leveraging of pleiotropy from correlated traits can potentially improve the performance of PGS of the target trait. In this study, we present PleioSDPR, a novel method that jointly models the genetic effects of complex traits to characterize conditions under which considering pleiotropy enhances polygenic risk prediction. PleioSDPR models the joint distribution of effect sizes across traits, allowing SNPs to be null for both traits, causal for only one trait, or causal for both traits, while accommodating region-specific genetic correlations and unequal heritability between traits. Through extensive simulations and real trait applications, we demonstrate that PleioSDPR improves prediction performance compared with several univariant and multivariate PGS methods, especially when there is no validation dataset. For example, by incorporating information from schizophrenia or leg fat-free mass, PleioSDPR effectively improves the prediction accuracy of bipolar disease (14.2% accuracy gain) and hip circumstance (20.65% accuracy gain), respectively. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that traits exhibiting high genetic correlations and heritability, and low overlapping sample sizes contribute more to the improvement of prediction accuracy of the target trait. Overall, our study highlights the potential of PleioSDPR to enhance the accuracy of genetic risk prediction by leveraging pleiotropy and considering a broader spectrum of traits and diseases.

We introduce two novel metrics: the Bouziane Similarity Index (BSI), a frequency-weighted score emphasizing rare variant matches, and BSI-VAR, a variant that integrates allele dosage and inverse variance weighting to capture partial allele sharing and amplify rare variant signals. To evaluate these metrics, we first performed unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) on simulated genotype similarity matrices, showing that BSI and BSI-VAR provide clearer genetic structure compared to IBS. We then conducted controlled simulations involving Parent-Child, Sibling, and Random genetic pairs to quantify discriminative performance. Through all evaluations, BSI and especially BSI-VAR consistently outperformed IBS in distinguishing genetic relationships. These findings establish BSI and BSI-VAR as robust, interpretable, and rare-variant-aware alternatives for modern genetic similarity analysis, with potential applications in population genetics, ancestry inference, and precision medicine (Ashley, 2016; Manolio et al., 2009).

UCP1 facilitates the dissipation of the proton gradient as heat and plays a critical role in energy expenditure and metabolic regulation. We employ advanced molecular simulations and mutagenesis to reveal the mechanism of UCP1-mediated proton and fatty acid (FA) transport. We demonstrate that FAs bind spontaneously to UCP1's central substrate-binding site. In the binding site, a proton transfer to the FA is facilitated by a key aspartate residue (D28) and a coordinating water molecule. The protonated FA exits UCP1 through a well defined pathway, and releases its proton into the mitochondrial matrix. UCP1 then facilitates the return of deprotonated FAs to the intermembrane space. Nucleotide binding disrupts this mechanism by inducing conformational changes in the transmembrane helices and obstructing the FA return pathway.

Here, using all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we examined the conformational dynamics and interdomain interactions of FL FUS in both dilute and condensed phases. Comparing two modern force fields (FFs) - Amber ff03ws and ff99SBws-STQ, we found that monomer simulation ensembles generated by both FFs exhibited qualitatively similar intramolecular interaction profiles dominated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). While the two folded domains minimally participated in interdomain interactions, their stabilities significantly influenced the chain dimension and led to discrepancies compared to experimental data for both FFs. We observed that the Amber ff99SBws-STQ coupled with bond parameters adopted from the Zinc Amber force field (ZAFF) maintained stable folded domains and improved estimates of the chain dimensions.

However, the specific conditions under which these subconcussive impacts influence concussion outcomes are uncertain, limiting our understanding of the mechanisms behind repetitive head trauma. Given that subconcussive impacts elicit a microglial response, and microglial morphology offers insight into function, we examined how subconcussive preconditioning affects microglial morphology and cognitive outcome after concussion. To investigate this question, we developed and validated a scalable, closed-head controlled cortical impact model. Using this approach, we found that although concussion elicited features of hypersurveillant microglia at 1 day post-injury, they resolve by 9 days post-injury, and subconcussive impacts only produced microglial changes at 9 days post-injury. When subconcussive impacts preceded a concussive impact (i.e., preconditioned concussion) no changes in microglial morphology appeared at either 1 or 9 days after injury. Interestingly, subconcussive preconditioning eliminated concussion-associated cognitive deficits in novel object recognition and this cognitive protection was time dependent: preconditioning impacts were only protective if delivered within 2 minutes of concussion, and had no effect if delivered over a 48-hour window. These results suggest that some types of subconcussive impacts may offer protection against subsequent concussion and mitigate changes in microglial morphology.

When a deep learning model trained on omics data achieves high performance, the important question is to define factors that contribute to model predictive power. Explainable AI (XAI) methods can be categorized as model-aware and model-agnostic. Model-agnostic approaches, which rely on combinatorial feature perturbations to assess impact, are often computationally prohibitive for deep learning models.

Despite the popularity of dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE and UMAP, concerns have arisen regarding their ability to preserve critical aspects of high-dimensional data and their sensitivity to user-defined parameters. This study aims to evaluate the impact of extreme dimension reduction from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to just two dimensions, highlighting the resulting distortions to deeply understand their implications. Given the significance of dimensionality reduction in biological research, careful evaluation of these methods is necessary to ensure reliable and meaningful results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 16 dimensionality reduction methods. Our evaluation addresses several key factors, such as the preservation of pairwise distances and local neighborhood relationships between the original high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projections.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Background Anesthesia decreases core body temperature, and this seriously compromises the physiological status of an experimental animal. Hypothermia alters many aspects of neural function. When recording nervous system activity in anesthetized animals, their core temperature must be stabilized. New method This report describes an inexpensive, battery-powered, temperature-controlled warming pad for mice and rats and documents its validity and utility. The device is portable, making it convenient for researchers who conduct procedures such as surgical preparations in one location and transport the anesthetized animal to another location for experimental recordings. Results The device keeps anesthetized mice normothermic +/- 0.7 C. for over 6 hours without supplemental warmth (e.g., heat lamp), despite >15 C. differential between ambient room temperature and core body temperature. We demonstrate how the warming pad can be used for in vivo imaging of neuronal activity for a prolonged period in mice. Comparison with existing methods Commercial heating pads for small animals are expensive, somewhat bulky, and require power cords and a 120/240V source. Transporting an anesthetized animal from one location (e.g. surgical suite) to another (e.g., imaging rig) involves moving power cords. Moreover, commercial devices are not always compatible with custom stereotaxic frames, microscope stages, or holding boxes. The device described here is small, inexpensive, battery-powered, and readily adaptable to experimental set ups. Conclusion The homeothermic heating pad provides a simple method for maintaining the core temperature of anesthetized small animals. It can be constructed in under 30 minutes, the components are readily available, and the cost is less than $100. It is exceptionally useful for experiments on mice or rats.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Additionally, TREEs of zebrafish origin were shown to direct the expression of transgenes in border zone regions after cardiac injury when packaged into recombinant AAV vectors and introduced into mice. Future implementation of TREEs into AAV-based vectors as research tools and potential gene therapy modalities will require a more detailed understanding of expression dynamics and potential off-target effects. Here, we applied in vivo bioluminescent imaging to mice systemically injected with AAV vectors containing different combinations of capsids, enhancers, and timing of delivery. Longitudinal tracking of TREE-based expression over time revealed distinct amplitudes and durations of reporter gene expression in the injured heart directed by different TREEs. The liver-de-targeted AAV capsid, AAV.cc84, was able to deliver TREEs either pre- or post-cardiac injury to negate off-target expression in the liver while maintaining transduction in the heart. By screening AAV9-based capsid libraries dosed systemically in mice post-cardiac injury, we discovered a new capsid variant, AAV.IR41, with enhanced transduction at cardiac border zone regions, and with elevated transduction of TREE driven transgenes versus conventional AAV9 vectors.

P.; Bhandawat, V.", "abstract": "Animals rely on olfactory cues to guide critical behaviors such as foraging, mate selection, and predator avoidance. Animals discriminate between different odors because each odor binds to a distinct set of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The relationship between the activated ORN class and resulting behavior is an intensely studied problem. Genetic tools in the Drosophila olfactory system make it particularly suitable for understanding this relationship. In this study, we investigate how activity in Or7a-expressing ORNs (Or7a-ORNs) which projects to the DL5 glomerulus, is transformed into aversive behavior. We find that optogenetically activating Or7a-ORNs causes an increase in locomotion speed which results in mild aversion. Surprisingly, silencing the synaptically connected second-order neuron called DL5PN increases the aversion. Silencing DL5PN has no effect on the increase in speed. The increased aversion results from the flies returning to the stimulated area less often. When DL5PN is left intact, flies return more frequently to the stimulated area. Patch-clamp recordings from PNs other than DL5PNs suggest they are activated when Or7a-ORNs are activated. These results suggest that the behavioral effect downstream of a given ORN class is mediated by multiple PN classes. This work advances our understanding of how aversion is encoded and transmitted through early sensory circuits to shape behavior.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Concurrently, variants such as NB.1.8.1, LF.7.9, XEC.25.1, XFH, and XFG exhibit enhanced growth advantages over LP.8.1.1, necessitating a comparative analysis of their antigenic and virological characteristics. Here, we evaluated the infectivity, ACE2-binding efficiency, and immune evasion of these variants. Pseudovirus assays revealed BA.3.2's robust antibody evasion, including resistance to Class 1/4 monoclonal antibodies; however, its ACE2 engagement efficiency was markedly reduced due to a closed spike conformation, leading to low infectivity. While XFG and LF.7.9 demonstrated strong immune escape associated with A475V and N487D mutations, their reduced receptor-binding efficiency suggested a need for compensatory adaptations. In contrast, NB.1.8.1 retained high ACE2 affinity and humoral immune evasion, supporting its potential for future dominance. Collectively, BA.3.2's current profile limits its ability to compete with emerging variants like NB.1.8.1.

Here, we investigated the impact of mouse vendor on indomethacin-induced injury using C57BL/6 mice from different breeding facilities (in-house 'Tar Heel' and commercial Charles River). We found that Tar Heel mice exhibited significantly enhanced susceptibility to indomethacin toxicity, characterized by greater body weight loss, increased ileal ulceration, elevated fecal lipocalin-2 levels, and higher goblet cell numbers in ileum compared to Charles River mice. Importantly, whole genome metagenomic analysis revealed distinct baseline gut microbiomes between the two types of mice. Notably, Tar Heel mice showed higher abundances of {beta}-glucuronidase (GUS)-producing bacteria, particularly those expressing Loop-1 GUS enzymes, and elevated levels of mucolytic enzyme-encoding bacteria. These differences suggest that enhanced indomethacin toxicity observed in Tar Heel mice may be related to functional changes in their gut microbiome, which may predispose to an exaggerated response to NSAID exposure. Together, our findings demonstrate that vendor-specific differences significantly influence NSAID-induced intestinal toxicity and highlight the importance of considering mouse sources and gut microbial compositions in experimental design.

The approach further revealed that heterogeneity in C. difficile toxin gene expression is independent of location in the gut and unexpectedly showed that a toxin gene over-expressing mutant forms filamentous cells during the acute phase of infection.

The pathology and virology findings together with the phylogeographic and environmental data were examined for underlying factors to the dynamics of the USUV infection in Switzerland, between 2015 and 2020, with particular focus to the major peak of 2018. USUV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR in 67 birds, with common blackbirds (Turdus merula, 73%; 49/67) being overrepresented, showing signs of diseases including poor body condition (84%; 56/67) and splenomegaly (75%; 50/67). Histology (n=34) revealed changes in the heart (58%; 19/33), the central nervous system (67%; 22/33) and the liver (62%; 21/34). Of interest, the splenic changes (86%, 25/29) showed different, but likely correlated phenotypes, characterized by the presence of discrete and/or diffuse histiocytic infiltrates in the congested and lymphoid depleted spleen parenchyma, possibly reflecting different stages of the disease. Phylogenetic analysis unambiguously revealed that the recent USUV infections were predominantly caused by strains of the Europe 3 lineage. USUV Africa 3 strains were detected exclusively from southern Switzerland in one location (two blackbirds). Our investigation revealed intralesional Usutu viral RNA consistent with infection in previously undescribed hosts (Corvus frugilegus, Cygnus olor) and provided new insights into the pathogenesis and the ecology of the disease.

However, its accumulation imposes severe stress on the microbial producer, leading to significant production losses. To address this, improving a strains ethanol tolerance is considered an effective strategy to enhance production. In our previous research, we conducted an adaptive evolution experiment with Escherichia coli growing under gradually increasing concentrations of ethanol, which gave rise to multiple hypertolerant populations. Based on the genomic mutational data, we demonstrated in this work that adaptive alleles in the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system drive the development of ethanol tolerance in E. coli. Specifically, when a single leucine was substituted for a proline residue within the periplasmic domain using CRISPR, the mutated EnvZ osmosensor caused a significant increase in ethanol tolerance. Through promoter fusion assays, we showed that this particular mutation stabilizes EnvZ in a kinase-dominating state, which reprograms signal transduction involving its cognate OmpR response regulator. Whole-genome proteomics analysis revealed that this altered signaling pathway predominantly maintains outer membrane stability by upregulating global porin levels and attenuating iron metabolism in the tolerant envZ*L116P mutant. Moreover, we demonstrated that the hypertolerant envZ*L116P allele also promotes ethanol productivity in fermentation, providing valuable insights for enhancing industrial ethanol production.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Four soil samples each were collected from three locations namely Negombo lagoon, Balapitiya coastal area and Beruwala coastal area. From 12 soil samples 20 bacterial isolates were obtained namely NE01 to NE09 (Negombo lagoon), BA01 to BA07 (Balapitiya coastal area) and BE01 to BE04 (Beruwala coastal area). The isolates were characterized based on bacterial colony morphology, Grams stain and biochemical tests namely catalase test, modified oxidase test, hemolytic reaction on blood agar and growth on MacConkey agar. All the bacterial isolates were screened for salt tolerance at different concentrations of NaCl ranging from 3 dS/m to 18 dS/m. All 20 bacterial isolates were found to be salt tolerant upto the highest NaCl concentration tested (18 dS/m). The salinity tolerance behavior of selected five isolates were observed by enumerating the number of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) with increasing salinity. Molecular identification of these five isolates were carried out by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. It is recommended to screen the identified salt tolerant bacterial isolates for their plant growth promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) activities such as phosphate solubilization, indole acetic acid and ammonia production.

A total of 306 strains (147 genera, eight phyla) carried CBB cycle genes and a literal survey showed that 74 genera had reported evidence of their autotrophic growth, although 73 lacked supporting information. Phylogenetic analysis of RubisCO large subunit (RbcL) identified diverse forms (IA, IB, IC, IE, I+, II, and III) with distinct metabolic associations: form IA associated with sulfur oxidation and form IC with hydrogen oxidation.

Here, we address the molecular basis for such length control. Reconstituting polyadenylation reactions during the formation of Nab2:poly(A) RNA ribonucleoprotein particles in vitro, we find that Nab2 dimerization directs polyadenylation termination. The Nab2 dimer is stable only on poly(A) tails that are longer than 25 adenosines, explaining how Nab2 avoids prematurely terminating poly(A) synthesis. However, the mature tail length is not determined by the footprint of Nab2 on the RNA, but rather by the kinetic competition between CPAC-mediated tail elongation and Nab2 RNA-binding. Variations in Nab2 RNA-binding rate can shift poly(A) tail lengths, but in cells such variations are buffered by autoregulation of Nab2 protein concentration. As a result, poly(A) tail length control operates through a ''kinetic ruler'' mechanism, whereby the concentration of Nab2 quantifies RNA length.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

We provide TCRvdb as a resource to the community to support training and evaluation of improved predictive TCR specificity models.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

N.; Vardhana, S. A.", "abstract": "Loss of effector function is a hallmark of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells that have lost therapeutic efficacy. This impaired capacity occurs despite expression of transcripts encoding cytotoxic proteins, raising the possibility that post-transcriptional suppression of cytotoxic protein synthesis limits anti-tumor immunity. Whether altered protein synthesis contributes to CD8+ T-cell dysfunction has not been explored. Here we show that intratumoral amino acid availability restricts the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ TILs by perturbing their ability to sustain protein synthesis. mRNA translation rates in antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells were rapidly and specifically suppressed within tumors but not tumor-draining lymph nodes, due to a combination of increased amino acid demand and reduced amino acid availability. Mechanistically, amino acid-dependent uncharging of tRNA-Gln in T-cells persistently exposed to antigen was sufficient to suppress protein synthesis in a manner that is independent of either activation of the integrated stress response or suppression of mTORC1 activation. Finally, suppressing intracellular glutaminase activity or ectopically overexpressing the amino acid transporter SLC6A15 was sufficient to restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. These results establish a novel mechanism by which nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment limits T-cell function and demonstrate how enhancing T cell-specific amino acid availability can sustain T-cell effector function and potentiate anti-tumor immunity.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

A.; Kalkum, M.", "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malaria species with predominance in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Devising effective controls against P. vivax infections presents unique challenges due to the parasite's exclusive invasion of reticulocytes, a transient developmental stage of red blood cells. The ephemeral nature and limited availability of reticulocytes complicate efforts to establish continuous in vitro cultures to study the parasites biology and receptor-ligand interactions. Here, the potential of the erythroid cell lines JK-1 and BEL-A as alternatives to reticulocytes was confirmed through successful parasite invasion, marking the first report of P. vivax entry to BEL-A cells. Furthermore, LC-MS was used to quantitatively compare the membrane proteomes of these cell lines with those of reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes. This analysis revealed significant similarities between the membrane proteomes of JK-1, BEL-A, and reticulocytes. In addition to the known Plasmodium receptors, transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1 or CD71), CD98hc, and basigin (BSG), potential receptor candidates involved in the parasite's invasion pathway were identified, including prohibitin-2 (PHB2), CAT-1 (SLC7A1), ATB(0) (SLC1A5), CD36, integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), and Metal transporter CNNM3. Proximity labeling using TurboID enabled the identification of specific interactions between PvRBP1a158-650 and TfR1, BSG, and prohibitin-2 in the erythroid cell lines. Notably, this is the first report of prohibitin-2 as a receptor for P. vivax. These findings advance the understanding of P. vivax receptor-ligand interactions and underscore the potential of JK-1 and BEL-A cell lines as alternative models for the study of parasite biology.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we isolated and characterized Clostridial isolates, focusing on the genomic diversity of Anaerostipes, a prevalent butyrate-producing genus within the gut microbiota. We conducted a genomic comparison across 21 Anaerostipes strains isolated from healthy human fecal samples (n = 5) and publicly available genomes (n = 105). Whole genome comparisons across the Anaerostipes genus demonstrated 12 species bins, clustering into three major functionally distinct clusters correlating with host origin. One cluster (representing mostly A. caccae genomes) was distinguished by possessing a complete vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway. Variability in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism was demonstrated within dominant species of the human microbiota (A. hadrus, A. caccae, and A. hominis).

These properties make them indispensable tools in functional genomics and genome engineering, particularly for delivering molecular components in high-throughput CRISPR screening, a powerful approach for uncovering the genetic basis of complex cellular mechanisms and phenotypes. However, challenges such as lentiviral-induced recombination, unpredictable integration profiles, and variable susceptibility of target cells to transduction can introduce noise and compromise experimental outcomes. In this study, we selected two suspension-adapted mammalian cell lines, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K1 and Human Embryonic Kidney cells HEK293-6E, due to their widespread use in recombinant protein production. Recognizing the influence of intrinsic cell line properties and transduction methodology, we compared two distinct procedures: spinoculation and static transduction. By implementing a two-step static transduction protocol, we achieved significantly higher transduction efficiencies while minimizing cellular stress, streamlining workflows, and eliminating scalability limitations inherent to large-scale lentiviral applications like genome-wide CRISPR screens. To further characterize the variation in lentiviral integration, we used droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to quantify copy number variation (CNV) both at the pooled population level and within individual clonal isolates. This comprehensive analysis underscores the robustness of our optimized protocol in enhancing transduction efficiency in difficult-to-transduce suspension cell lines. It further emphasizes the importance of carefully modulating infection rates to limit multiple integrations, ensuring the accuracy and consistency required for large-scale functional genomics applications.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

One consequence of this arbitrariness is taxonomic synonymization, wherein variation determined not unique enough to constitute distinct species gets merged into one. Synonymization is non-random and subject to taxon and trait-specific biases. We explore these trends using a comprehensive dataset of the world's marine species for all large phyla and Animalia. We match all accepted species-names from the present day with their synonyms and calculate metrics of synonymization including the time lag between the years of descriptions of a species and its newest synonym. We find that although species description trends across phyla show no consistent, discernible trends, the fraction of names that gets synonymised remains initially constant across phyla, with a subsequent gradual decrease. Most accepted species described around the early 20th century possess synonyms created in the same year, indicating synonyms arising due to new taxonomic combinations, suggesting a distinct period of taxonomic praxis. This period was followed by a period of most species descriptions lacking synonyms on moving towards the present. Across taxa, we find the mean lag to be strongly negatively correlated to time, with time not being a limiting factor determining this trend. We also find the number of synonyms per accepted name to also be strongly negatively correlated to time in a taxon-independent manner. Our study considers when the diversity characterising species in the form of once-unique species-names becomes known to science. Our results suggest that across taxa, species described more recently encompass less biological variability, indicating a gradual change in how morphologically delineated species which comprise the vast majority of species described across time are described.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Accuracy of such estimates rests on correctly classifying recurrent infections developed during follow-up as recrudescences or new infections. Genotyping is used to guide classification, but polyclonal infections and allele chance matching still make classification challenging, especially in high transmission settings. Established methods for analyzing genotyping data are biased or difficult to use; few take full advantage of data from modern genotyping methods such as multiplexed amplicon sequencing. We propose an Adaptable Statistical framework for Therapeutic Efficacy and Recrudescence (Aster) that delivers accurate and consistent results by explicitly incorporating complexity of infection (COI), population allele frequencies, and imperfect detection of alleles in minority strains. Using an identity by descent approach, Aster accounts for alleles matching by chance and background relatedness that can otherwise lead to misclassification. The extensible framework can also utilize external information, such as parasite density and performance characteristics of a genotyping panel. Aster employs efficient combinatorial algorithms to process unphased polyclonal data, making it fast and fully scalable. Using simulations, we show that Aster dramatically outperforms match-counting algorithms currently recommended by WHO in a wide variety of settings and demonstrates consistently balanced performance measures that improve with more informative genotyping panels. Aster provides accurate study-level estimates of treatment failure for TES with any type of genotyping data, facilitating reliable evaluation of drug efficacy and effective management of malaria.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

RBPs often contain multiple domains known to directly bind RNA, such as RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), as well as domains whose RNA binding capacity remains incompletely understood, e.g., low complexity domains (LCDs). Here, we dissect HNRNPR, an RBP with three RRMs and an arginine-glycine rich (RG-rich) LCD. We apply unbiased high-throughput biochemical approaches and identify critical RNA binding domains that confer specificity. We show that not all RRMs contribute equally to binding and find that RRM3, along with a downstream C-terminal charged region, are required for RNA binding. We find that HNRNPR also binds RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) and map multiple rG4 binding sites including RRM3 with the C-terminal charged region and RG-rich regions within the LCD. We dissect rG4 specificity for the full length HNRNPR and LCD using a newly created RNA pool focused on rG4s and reveal that binding is dependent on RNA folding and find specific rG4 features that enhance HNRNPR-rG4 interactions.

The sterile screwworm adult fly releases were mixed sex, but experience with other flies suggests that releasing only males could be up to five times more effective. Here we describe screwworm transgenic sexing strains (TSSs) with expected embryo lethality developed using the Tetracycline-off (Tet-off) system with the Lucilia cuprina nullo (DR6) or C. macellaria CG14427 (DR7) gene promoters and a tTA activated effector to promote female lethality. The TSSs expressed tTA highest in 2-3 h embryos and low in larvae and adults. However, most strains showed high expression in pupae. Evaluation on two doxycycline (Dox) regimens found that inclusion of Dox in the last larval feeding rescued females of the subsequent generation, likely by maternal Dox transfer to embryos. All TSSs produced only males on a reduced Dox feeding regimen but the female lethal period for the DR6 TSS was too late in development to save diet costs. Production parameters were met by all strains in colony, but strains had lower male fly survival than current production strains after removing Dox. In non-competitive mating success trials DR6 strains performed poorly, but DR7 performed equally to production strain males. However, males from all TSSs faired poorly in mating competition tests against production males.

J.; Caldon, C. E.", "abstract": "Purpose: While PARP inhibitors have shown great efficacy in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, many preclinical studies, including combination therapies, fail to translate into clinical approval, potentially due to the limitations of preclinical models. The goal of this brief report was to identify appropriate cell line models to investigate PARP inhibitor sensitivity and synergies. Methods: An in-silico study of cell line collections was performed to assess the correlation between BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and sensitivity to PARP inhibitor monotherapy or combination therapy with a platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, we characterised an isogenic model with matched cell lines containing Brca1 and Brca2 mutations and investigated the response of cells to PARP inhibitor alone, or in combination with chemotherapy. Results: Using cell line collections, cell lines with BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations are not associated with increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Other factors, such as high PARP1 expression and low-level genome alterations showed correlation with increased sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor. Furthermore, cell line collections did not reflect the synergy observed in patients to combination PARP inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the ID8 isogenic model cell lines with specific mutations in Brca1 and Brca2 represent patient response to PARP inhibitor monotherapy, and in combination with chemotherapy. Conclusions: This study suggests exercising caution when using cell line collections as part of model selection when investigating PARP inhibitor sensitivity and synergy. Our data proposes that using an isogenic preclinical model is more likely to accurately reflect patient response.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

This study aims to investigate the role of netrin-1 and its dependence receptor UNC5B in regulating CSC self-renewal in mCRC and explore their potential as therapeutic targets. Methods: We used patient-derived liver metastasis organoids (PDOs) to examine the effects of netrin-1 on CSC self-renewal. The role of UNC5B was evaluated by silencing its expression using CRISPR and assessing the impact on CSC apoptosis in response to an anti-netrin-1 blocking antibody (NP137) using extreme limiting dilution assays (ELDAs). Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to explore the molecular mechanisms behind netrin-1/UNC5B regulation of CSC fate. Clinical data from a patient with mCRC were used to validate the findings. Results: Netrin-1 promoted CSC self-renewal by inhibiting apoptosis, a process reversed by NP137. UNC5B was identified as the primary receptor mediating this effect, as its silencing eliminated Netrin-1- induced self-renewal. Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), secreted by UNC5B-expressing cells, plays a key role in netrin-1-induced CSC self-renewal. Clinical trial data from a patient with mCRC showed a reduction in TFF3 and stemness genes expression after treatment with NP137. Furthermore, combining NP137 with FOLFOX chemotherapy enhanced cell death and inhibited tumor growth in PDO xenograft models.

It is unknown if photophobia leads to light avoidant behavior, and if such behaviors worsen light sensitivity and disrupt sleep. Recently developed wearable, continuous light loggers allow us to address these open questions. We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of measuring light exposure using wearable light loggers in youth with migraine. Methods: Youth 10 to 21 years old with a headache-specialist confirmed ICHD-3 diagnosis of migraine were recruited from CHOP headache clinics. Each participant recorded 7 consecutive days of light logging data from the ActLumus device worn as a pendant around the neck paired with a text-based daily migraine symptom diary during a typical school week between November and March 2024. Validated questionnaires were used to capture headache and migraine frequency, headache-related disability, visual sensitivity, fear-of-pain, and sleep disturbance and impairment. Percent time spent within recommended light exposure levels was calculated for the day, 3 hours prior to bedtime, and night. Power analysis was calculated to determine sample size needed for group comparison of baseline characteristics across light intensity and light timing metrics to aid in the design of larger studies. Results: Twenty youth with a median age 17 years [IQR 16, 19], 70% of whom were female completed 7 days of continuous light logger recording and daily headache diary. Data completion rates were high with 136/140 (97.1%) useable days of light logger data, and 100% compliance on the daily headache diary. Participant feedback on the study was positive; 85% would recommend the study to others. On average, participants received recommended light exposure during only 14.5% +/- SD 7.0 of daylight hours. By contrast, participants were more consistently below the recommended maximum light levels 3 hours prior to bed (77.5% +/- 21.6 of the time), and at night (99.1% +/- 2.9 of the time). Youth with chronic migraine (i.e., at least 15 headache days and 8 migraine days per month) had daily light exposure patterns that were phase shifted 60 minutes later as compared to participants with non-chronic migraine. Power analyses suggest that future tests for differences in light exposure between migraine-characteristic groups (e.g., differing by headache frequency, severity, or disability) will require sample sizes on the order of 50 to 150 to reach 80% power with an alpha of 0.05. Conclusion: Measuring daily light exposure is feasible in pediatric populations with photophobia and reveals intriguing trends in youth with migraine that warrant further study.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Connectivity strength was high at LGS diagnosis and decreased after favorable response to treatment, but it remained stable or increased when response was unfavorable. In all subjects, connectivity strength was higher at the time of LGS diagnosis than at the preceding timepoint. Presence of clinical markers of LGS were associated with high connectivity strength, but no single marker predicted connectivity strength.

Across 274 Mtb clinical isolates, we uncovered unexpected diversity in expression of virulence genes which we linked to known and previously unrecognized regulators. Surprisingly, we found that many isolates harbor variants associated with decreased expression of EsxA (Esat6) and EsxB (Cfp10), which are virulence effectors, dominant T cell antigens, and immunodiagnostic targets.

The differences in epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, can also contribute to phenotypic differences, even in individuals with identical genetic information. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain not fully understood, particularly in vertebrates. The number of fin rays in teleosts, such as medaka, is a useful model to study this variation. In our previous study, the teleost Hox code was shown to play a crucial role in determining the anterior-posterior identity required for the formation of dorsal and anal fins. In this study, we investigated widefins medaka, a spontaneous mutant displaying phenotypic variation in the number of dorsal and anal fin rays. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that an extremely large transposon, Teratorn, containing a herpesvirus genome, was inserted into the 3' UTR of the hoxc12a gene. This insertion decreased hoxc12a expression and, in some cases, also affected neighboring hox genes, resulting in variations in fin size and the presence or absence of dorsal fins. Additionally, hoxc6a, located 50 kb away from the insertion, was also downregulated in widefins medaka. These findings suggest that this large transposon insertion leads to a reduction in nearby hox gene expression, contributing to the phenotypic variation observed in widefins medaka.

Simulations using neuromusculoskeletal human models could help understand these internal processes leading to PD-associated postural deficits. In this paper, we investigated whether reduced reactivity amplitudes resulting from impairments due to PD can explain postural instability as well as increased muscle tone as often observed in individuals with PD. To simulate reduced reactivity, we gradually decreased previously optimized gain factors within the postural control circuitry of our model performing a quiet upright standing task. After each reduction step, the model was again optimized. Simulation results were compared to experimental data collected from 31 individuals with PD and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants. Analyzing our simulation results, we showed that muscle activations increased with a model's reduced reactivity, as well as joint angles' ranges of motion (ROMs). However, sway parameters such as center of pressure (COP) path lengths and COP ranges did not increase as observed in our experimental data. These results suggest that a reduced reactivity does not directly lead to increased sway parameters, but could cause increased muscle tone leading to subsequent postural control alterations. To further investigate postural stability using neuromusculoskeletal models, analyzing additional internal model parameters and tasks such as perturbed upright standing requiring comparable reaction patterns could provide promising results. By enhancing such models and deepening the understanding of internal processes of postural control, these models may be used to assess and evaluate rehabilitation interventions in the future.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

A wide variety of epistasis detection tools are currently available with several studies comparing the performance of methods suitable for case-control data. However, there is limited understanding of how well these tools perform with quantitative phenotypes. Methods We identified six epistasis detection methods suitable for quantitative phenotype data: EpiSNP, Matrix Epistasis, MIDESP, PLINK Epistasis, QMDR, and REMMA. To evaluate these tools, we generated simulated datasets using EpiGEN. The datasets modeled various pairwise interactions between disease-associated SNPs, including dominant, multiplicative, recessive, and XOR interactions. Additionally, we assessed the BOOST and MDR algorithms on discretized (case-control) version of the datasets. These tools were then tested on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset for the externalizing behavior phenotype. Results Each tool exhibited strong performance for certain interaction types, but weaker performance for others. MDR achieved the highest overall detection rate of 60%, while EpiSNP had the lowest overall detection rate of 7%. MDR and MIDESP performed best at detecting multiplicative interactions with detection rates of 54% and 41% respectively. Both MDR and MIDESP were also effective at detecting XOR interactions with detection rates of 84% and 50% respectively. PLINK Epistasis, Matrix Epistasis, and REMMA excelled at detecting dominant interactions, all achieving a 100% detection rate. On the other hand, EpiSNP was particularly effective at detecting recessive interactions with a detection rate of 66%. When analyzing the ABCD dataset, Plink Epistasis and Plink BOOST identified SNPs within the DRD2 and DRD4 genes, which have been previously linked to externalizing behavior. Conclusion Since no single method consistently outperforms others across all types of epistasis, and given that the specific types of epistasis present in a dataset are often unknown, it may be more effective to use multiple epistasis detection algorithms in combination to obtain comprehensive results.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

However, significant challenges remain for large-scale cultivated meat commercialization, including effective scaling, cost efficiency, and product quality, but also scientific evidence to support regulatory approval and building consumer trust. In this paper, we discuss the potential of an integrative multi-omics approach to characterize and optimize cultivated meat production. By analyzing a network-based interactome model that integrates the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic layers, we achieve a system-level understanding of cellular metabolism and regulatory mechanisms. This approach can allow for precise monitoring and targeted interventions of critical quality and safety attributes associated with cellular biomass. We then describe a Target-Action-Metabolite (TAM) framework, which utilizes insights from the interactome to optimize cell culture conditions through actionable interventions. We illustrate the potential use of this framework through a case study involving Duck Embryonic Stem Cells (dESCs) for use in cell-cultured meat products, providing hypotheses for improving key metabolic pathways through targeted interventions on metabolites present in culture media. Finally, our paper highlights the potential of this interactome-based strategy to enhance bioprocess efficiency, improve product quality and ensure safety attributes, addressing regulatory challenges associated with cultivated meat production.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

To address these gaps, we propose SynVerse, a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring four data-splitting strategies to assess DL model generalizability and three ablation studies: module-based, feature shuffling, and a novel network-based approach to disentangle factors influencing model performance. We evaluated sixteen models incorporating eight drug- and cell line-specific features, five preprocessing techniques, and two widely used encoders. Our analysis revealed several insights. None of the models outperformed a naive baseline using one-hot encoding as features. Biologically meaningful drug or cell line features and drug-drug interactions were not the drivers of predictive performance. All models demonstrated poor generalization to unseen drugs and cell lines.

In response, we developed two low-cost, customizable alternatives -- a 3D-Printed Electrode and a Pen Electrode assembled from off-the-shelf jumper wire components -- and evaluated their performance relative to the discontinued commercial standard. Methods: We conducted in vivo NMES of the left hindlimb ankle dorsiflexors in C57BL/6J mice using three electrode types: a Simple Electrode (previously available as BS4 50-6824, Harvard Apparatus), our novel 3D-Printed Electrode, and our novel Pen Electrode. Contractile torque was recorded during twitch and tetanic contractions, and electrode performance was evaluated based on peak torque values. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare torque generated by each animal for the three different types of electrodes. Results: Both custom electrodes generated twitch and tetanic responses comparable to those of the Commercial electrode. No statistically significant differences were observed in peak torque values in either twitch (p = 0.181) or tetany (p = 0.438). Conclusion: Custom-built 3D-printed and Pen-style electrodes offer low-cost, accessible alternatives to discontinued commercial devices for murine NMES studies.

J.; Vivash, L.; Pase, M.", "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers are promising for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but their role in cognitively healthy individuals remains unclear. Plasma pTau-217 has high diagnostic accuracy for clinical and prodromal AD, yet its relevance in preclinical stages is underexplored. We examined if plasma biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation were associated with cognition, brain structure, and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) counterparts in dementia-free older adults. We studied community-based, dementia-free older adults from the Brain and Cognitive Health (BACH) cohort. Neuropsychological testing assessed global cognition (MMSE), memory (Logical Memory II), visual processing (Hooper Visual Organization Test), processing speed (Trail Making Test-A), and reasoning (Similarities). Paired plasma and CSF biomarkers (pTau-217, pTau-181, GFAP, NfL, A{beta}42/40) were measured using SIMOA. MRI-derived cortical thickness was used as a neurodegeneration marker. Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between log10-transformed plasma biomarker levels, cognition (adjusted for age, sex, education, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes), and cortical thickness (adjusted for age, sex, education, and intracranial volume). Pearson's correlations and Bland-Altman plots evaluated plasma-CSF agreement. There were 147 dementia-free participants (mean age{+/-}SD: 66.7{+/-}7.7 years; 56 % women). Higher plasma pTau-217 levels associated with lower global cognition scores ({beta} -0.80, 95% C.I. -1.56, -0.03, p=0.041) and abstract reasoning ({beta} -0.86, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] -1.62, -0.09, p=0.028). Greater plasma pTau-217 also associated with lower global cortical thickness ({beta}eta [{beta}] -0.21, 95% confidence interval [C.I]. -0.37, -0.06, per log unit change; p=0.006). No associations were found between the plasma biomarkers and processing speed or visual processing (p>0.05 for all). Among 47 participants with paired plasma-CSF biomarkers, plasma pTau-217 showed the strongest correlation with its CSF counterpart (R=0.76, p<0.0001), outperforming pTau-181 (R=0.61, p<0.0001), GFAP (R=0.66, p<0.0001), NfL (R=0.56, p<0.0001), and A{beta}42/40 (R=0.53, p=0.0001). In conclusion, plasma pTau-217 levels were associated with both cognition and cortical thickness in dementia-free older adults. All plasma biomarkers correlated significantly with their CSF counterpart. These findings reinforce the utility of plasma biomarkers, particularly pTau-217, as indicators of neurodegenerative processes, even in asymptomatic individuals.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

T.; Konofagou, E.; Dmochowski, J. P.", "abstract": "Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has emerged as a promising modality for non-invasive neuromodulation, offering deep brain penetration and high spatial precision. However, the electrophysiological effects of tFUS remain poorly understood, in part due to challenges distinguishing genuine neural responses from mechanical artifacts. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological signatures captured during tFUS of the anesthetized rat hippocampus using silicon microelectrodes. We observed a strong, stereotyped local field potential (LFP) response that was time-locked to the onset and offset of sonication and resembled sensory-evoked potentials. Critically, the same waveform was observed in euthanized animals, confirming a non-biological, artifact-driven origin. The artifact scaled with acoustic intensity and was most pronounced under continuous-wave sonication. These findings suggest that electrode movement induced by ultrasound can generate artifactual LFP signals that closely mimic authentic neural responses. Our results underscore the need for caution when interpreting in situ electrophysiological recordings during tFUS and advocate for alternative, artifact-resistant readouts such as fiber photometry to unambiguously detect neuromodulatory effects.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Compared to the use of anthelmintic drugs, to which resistance is increasing, vaccination is considered a more sustainable control strategy. The safety and efficacy of a novel glycoengineered vaccine produced in Hi5 insect cells was evaluated in a randomized, controlled vaccination-and-challenge trial. For this, 35 male Jura x Lacaune sheep were assigned to five groups (n=7). Three experimental groups were vaccinated three times subcutaneously with 1 ml of either the commercial Barbervax vaccine, the novel glycoengineered vaccine, consisting of a cocktail of five antigens (H11, H11-1, H11-2, H11-4 and GA1), or its non-glycoengineered counterpart before challenge with 5,000 H. contortus third-stage larvae. Clinical assessments, differential blood counts, serum antibody responses and fecal egg counts were evaluated at least once per week within the 16-week trial period. The abomasal worm burden was counted 40 days after challenge. The results of the mixed model showed a lower degree of anemia (mean packed cell volume (PCV) of 26.77%; mean hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.03 g/dl), in sheep vaccinated with the glycoengineered antigen cocktail compared to the unvaccinated group (PCV of 24.34%; mean Hb of 7.84 g/dl) and to the sheep vaccinated with the non-glycoengineered antigens (PCV of 26.11%; mean Hb of 8.53 g/dl). However, the degree of anemia was lower in sheep vaccinated with native antigens (Barbervax) (PCV of 29.10%; mean Hb of 9.84 g/dl). Serum IgG and IgE antibodies were elevated in all vaccinated groups. Sheep vaccinated with the glycoengineered antigens showed a reduction in abomasal worm burden of 25.36% and a reduction of fecal egg shedding of 81.09%, the group vaccinated with non-glycoengineered antigen showed no worm reduction and a fecal egg count reduction of 32.72%. While there was no significant difference in egg shedding between sheep vaccinated with the glycoengineered antigens and sheep vaccinated with Barbervax (98.32%; p = 0.33), the Barbervax group showed a greater reduction in worm burden (86.40%). The results emphasize that glycoengineering of vaccine candidates is essential to achieve protective immunity against H. contortus in sheep and that the novel glycoengineered vaccine produced in insect cells clearly has the potential to reduce fecal egg shedding and worm burden, paving the way for the development of highly effective recombinant vaccines against this and other parasitic worms in the future.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

Long peptides stall unless supplemented; adding either eukaryotic factor eIF5A or elevated Mg2+ restores activity, and their combination increases nanoluciferase output about fivefold. Alanine scanning shows that basic residues R27 and R87 within the eIF5A core, rather than the hypusine side chain, provide the principal P-site tRNA stabilisation. Higher magnesium alone accelerates elongation but raises UAG and UGA read-through to roughly fifteen percent, revealing a trade-off between speed and fidelity when tRNAs are unmodified.

Our data argue that kinesin re-registers itself between steps into an Await-Isomerisation (AI) state that engenders both on-axis steps and off-axis missteps, and that missteps can be rescued. In the AI state, ATP or ATP{gamma}S is bound but neck-linker docking and nucleotide hydrolysis are inhibited. Load-dependent exit from the AI state establishes hydrolytic competence via catalytic site closure and coupled neck-linker docking, which guides the tethered head to its next on-axis site.

G.", "abstract": "Many cellular processes such as polarized growth and secretion require the formation of specific actin networks. In fungi, the morphogenetic process of cell-cell fusion requires cell wall digestion mediated by the local secretion of lytic enzymes at the site of cell-cell contact. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, lytic enzyme-containing secretory vesicles are transported by the myosin V Myo52 on the actin fusion focus, an aster-like actin network assembled by the condensate-forming formin Fus1. The fusion focus also concentrates proteins regulating cell polarity, cell-cell communication, actin cytoskeleton, exocytosis and membrane merging, but their precise position from the time of focus formation to cell fusion is unknown. Here, using centroid tracking and averaging, we present a first spatiotemporal map of the fusion site with a precision of 8 nm. We show that the bulk of secretory vesicles remains at constant distance from the plasma membrane as the actin structure condenses. Notably, though necessary to transport vesicles, Myo52 detaches from the vesicle pool and colocalizes with Fus1 in a more membrane-proximal position. We show that Myo52 physically interacts with Fus1 and transports it along actin filaments, and that Myo52 and Fus1 actin assembly activity contribute to focus compaction. Thus, myosin V-driven transport of the formin Fus1 along actin filaments nucleated by other Fus1 molecules underlies a positive feedback mechanism for actin aster formation.", "date": "2025-05-01", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "C. elegans is a powerful model for dissecting biological processes in vivo. In particular, the ease of generating targeted knock-in alleles makes it possible to visualize and functionally modify endogenous proteins to gain fundamental insights into biological mechanisms. Methods for C. elegans genome engineering typically utilize selectable markers, visual screening for fluorescence, or PCR genotyping to identify successfully edited animals. A common genetic tool known as the Self-Excising Cassette (SEC) combines drug and phenotypic selection, which makes it possible to screen large numbers of progeny rapidly and with minimal hands-on effort. However, N-terminal and internal knock-ins using the SEC cause loss of function until the selectable marker cassette is excised, which makes it impossible to isolate homozygous lines for essential genes prior to SEC excision. To simplify generating knock-ins for essential genes, we developed a Nested, Self-Excising selection Cassette (NSEC) that is located entirely within a synthetic intron and does not interfere with the expression of endogenous, N-terminally-tagged NSEC-fusion proteins. This innovation makes it possible to isolate homozygous lines for N-terminally tagged genes prior to selectable marker excision and allows for a standardized workflow to generate N-terminal and internal tags in any background and without the need for genetic balancers. We designed versions of NSEC that include an optional auxin-inducible degron tag and mTurquoise2, GFP, mStayGold, mNeonGreen, or mScarlet-I fluorescent proteins for experimental flexibility.
