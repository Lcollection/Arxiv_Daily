N.; Chen, C.; Nunez, I.; Haller, P.; Verde, F.", "abstract": "Cellular response to environmental fluctuations, such as increased temperature, is crucial in promoting cell survival and plays an increasingly recognized role in cancer biology. Important cellular functions altered by heat stress are cell polarization and protein translation. Previous studies have shown that heat stress alters the dynamics of Cdc42, a key regulator of cell polarization in eukaryotes, and promotes RNP granule formation, reprogramming protein translation. The biological mechanisms underlying these vast changes are only partially known. Here, we report that conserved NDR kinase Orb6, a homologue of mammalian STK38, responds to heat stress and regulates heat stress resilience by modulating Cdc42 dynamics and promoting stress granule assembly. Also, we discovered a finely tuned mechanism whereby stress-activated MAP kinase Sty1 negatively regulates Orb6 kinase and Orb6 C-terminal phosphorylation during heat stress. Orb6 inhibition by Sty1 increases the sensitivity of the cell to heat stress in a temperature-specific manner, fostering increased stress resilience and metabolic adaptation. These observations highlight the role of NDR kinase in the process of heat adaptation and thermotolerance during environmental cell exposure to elevated temperatures.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Model organisms may help understand how p53 suppresses tumorigenesis in mammals. In Drosophila, the primary transcriptional target of p53 is the gene encoding the bZip AT-hook protein Xrp1, which is another transcription factor. We report that Xrp1 mediated multiple functions of p53 in the DNA damage response (DDR), contributing to p53-dependent gene transcription and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In addition to this role as a p53 effector, a p53-independent role for Xrp1 in cell competition has been described. Cell competition can remove cells whose genome has been altered by DNA damage and repair. During cell competition, Xrp1 is induced by RpS12, which acts as a sensor of defective ribosome biogenesis. RpS12-dependent cell competition began as the DDR wound down, and was even more prominent if p53 function was reduced. Such p53 inhibition resulted in persistence of DNA damage revealed by gammaH2Av accumulation. Thus, Xrp1 limited the accumulation of abnormal cells resulting from genotoxicity through both the acute, p53-dependent DDR, and also from subsequent cell competition that removes cells where DNA repair did not restore the normal genome. Both these processes might contribute to the tumor suppressor function of p53 in mammals.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Yet, a comprehensive, well-powered mapping of cortical structure in relation to empathy and psychopathy is still lacking. Methods: In 804 incarcerated adult men, we administered the Perspective Taking (IRI-PT) and Empathic Concern (IRI-EC) subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; with Interpersonal/Affective [F1] and Lifestyle/Antisocial [F2] factors), and T1-weighted MRI to quantify cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and structural-covariance gradients. Results: PCL-R F1 was uniquely negatively related to IRI-EC, while PCL-R F2 was uniquely negatively related to IRI-PT. Cortical structure was not related to the IRI subscales. In contrast, CT was related to PCL-R F1 (mostly positively), SA was related to both PCL-R factors (only positively), and both cortical indices demonstrated out-of-sample predictive utility for PCL-R F1. Compared to low-psychopathy men, high-psychopathy men had uniquely lower IRI-EC scores and increased SA (but not CT); across the cortex, effect sizes were largest in the paralimbic class and somatomotor network, while meta-analytic task-based activations further highlighted spatial overlap with (social-)affective/sensory regions. Finally, the total sample revealed canonical anterior-posterior structural-covariance gradients. In high-psychopathy men, the gradient of CT (but not SA) was globally compressed. Conclusions: High-psychopathy men had reduced empathic concern, increased SA, and a compressed macroscale organization of CT, suggesting specific co-occurring alterations in empathy and cortical structure. Future work should build upon these novel insights in both the general and incarcerated populations to inform the treatment of psychopathy.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Given that self-reported reward sensitivity and level of substance use have been associated with differences in VS activation, we set out to investigate whether these factors would be independently associated with enhancements to neural reward responses within social contexts. In this pre-registered study, participants (N=45) underwent fMRI while playing a card guessing game in which correct or incorrect guesses resulted in monetary gains and losses that were shared evenly with either a close friend, stranger (confederate), or non-human partner. Consistent with our prior work, we found increased VS activation when sharing rewards with a socially close peer as opposed to an out-of-network stranger. As self-reported reward sensitivity increased, the difference in VS response to rewards shared with friends and strangers decreased. We also found enhanced connectivity between the VS and temporoparietal junction when sharing rewards with close friends as opposed to strangers. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed that as reward sensitivity and sub-clinical substance use increase, the difference in VS connectivity with the right fusiform face area increases as a function of social context. These findings demonstrate that responsivity to the context of close friends may be tied to individual reward sensitivity or sub-clinical substance use habits; together these factors may inform predictions of risk for future mental health disorders.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

These metabolism-contributing, signal-transducing and response-regulating networks, and the redundant forms that result, thereof, are responsible for complex biochemical-, physiological- and clinical-outcomes. It is unclear whether a unique mathematical structure, which is concurrently resolvable into redundant, unequal and functionally relevant substructures, can be ascribed to a biochemical network. Here, we develop a reactant-dependent algebraic framework to define, construct, characterize and assess the redundant forms of a biochemical network. We deploy a constraint-based approach to populate and select plausible reaction vectors in accordance with known paradigms of biochemically relevant outcomes. There is a strict lower bound for the number of participating reactants with integral changes, across all molecules of a reactant, which are Boolean (zero, signed non-zero) and combinatorially distributed across linearly independent plausible reaction vectors. The reactants and the selected plausible reaction vectors form a set of unique stoichiometry number matrices, each of which represents a distinct biochemical network which when multiplied by a set of positive and non-unitary rational numbers will generate a library of equivalent rational number matrices. The matrices that comprise this library are unequal, disjoint, form a semigroup with respect to addition, share the same null space and represent the redundant forms of a biochemical network. The presented framework is theoretically sound, mathematically rigorous, readily implementable, easily parameterized and can be used to assess the biomedical relevance for the redundant forms of a biochemical network.

Given the extent of furrowing, the potential agents known in the palaeolandscape, and a number of additional theoretical features, we believe this bone to have been consumed by an extinct species of giant hyena; Pachycrocuta brevirostris.

The main hypothesis invoked to explain the evolution of imprinted genes is the kinship theory, which posits a conflict between parental genomes over resource allocation in progeny. According to this theory, imprinted genes are expected to undergo a shift from balancing to directional selection, in coding or regulatory regions. However, most studies addressing selection in imprinted genes have focused on self-fertilizing species, where conflicts over resource allocation are predicted to be weak. Consequently, the impact of kinship theory on the evolution of imprinted genes remains largely untested. Furthermore, the predicted coevolution between certain imprinted genes under kinship theory has not been tested yet empirically. Combined phylogenetic and population genomic approaches, we investigated signatures of selection on imprinted genes across the Brassicaceae family and in autogamous and allogamous populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, and searched for evidence of coevolution among imprinted genes. We found that endosperm-expressed genes exhibited signals of balancing selection across Brassicaceae and within allogamous populations, consistent with unresolved intralocus conflicts. Supporting the kinship theory, these signals varied with mating system. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses further indicated negative directional selection acting on imprinted genes. However, population-level signals were independent of mating system and showed limited concordance with kinship predictions, possibly due to stronger selection acting on expression than on coding sequences. Finally, we identified coevolution between imprinted genes, although not at specific sites, suggesting that interactions beyond protein sequence drive this process.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Using shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei as a model, we demonstrate that febrile temperatures induce HSF1, which in turn upregulates antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that target viral envelope proteins and inhibit viral replication. Importantly, this is the first to show that HSF1 directly binds to the heat shock elements (HSE) motifs of AMPs both in shrimp and Drosophila S2 cells, suggesting this may be a conserved regulatory mechanism in arthropods. Additionally, our findings highlight the role of HSF1 beyond the classical heat shock response, revealing its critical function in modulating innate immunity.

M.; Auksztulewicz, R.", "abstract": "The brain is thought to generate internal predictions, based on previous statistical regularities in the environment, to optimise behaviour. Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning in the visual domain.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

A mosquito population was infected with parasite lineages selected for early or late transmission and compared with infections by an unselected reference parasite and with uninfected controls. Whole-body transcriptomes were all sampled at a common sporulating stage of infection. A core infection signature was identified by contrasting reference infections with uninfected mosquitoes. Against this baseline, early and late parasites generated distinct, partly overlapping expression profiles. Network analysis revealed modules whose activity tracked infection background and estimates of virulence and parasite load. One module was negatively associated with virulence and enriched for genes involved in damage limitation and tissue integrity, consistent with a disease tolerance programme. A second was positively associated with environmental persistence and enriched for genes that condition the replication and release environment, indicating that host pathways can influence the robustness of transmission stages.

Here, by pharmacologically manipulating dopamine using the dopamine precursor Levodopa, we investigated the role of dopamine in an explicit motor learning task guided by internally determined signals of performance success, by removing intrinsic feedback about task success. Specifically, we asked participants to strategically aim away from presented targets by various instructed angles: a form of explicit motor learning that contributes to performance in the classic visuomotor rotation task. In the feedback condition, targets jumped mid-movement by the instructed angle, such that success in target hitting depended on successfully aiming away by the instructed angle. In the no-feedback condition, intrinsic feedback about task success was removed by having targets disappear mid-movement, such that participants could not know if they succeeded at hitting the targets or not. We found that dopamine altered performance, both with and without task feedback about task success.

Given the disparate impacts of these agents on host health, intestinal CD4+ T cells must maintain strain-level discriminatory power to ensure protective immunity while preventing inappropriate responses against symbionts.

Using single-telomere and single-cell analyses combined with mathematical modeling, we identify a threshold length at which telomeres switch into dysfunction. A single shortest telomere below the threshold length is necessary and sufficient to trigger the onset of replicative senescence in a majority of cells. At population level, fluctuation assays establish that rare genomic instability arises predominantly in cis to the shortest telomere as Pol32-dependent non-reciprocal translocations that result in re-elongation of the shortest telomere and likely transient escape from senescence.

These findings support an account, in which conflict processing relies on partially overlapping neural mechanisms rather than being fully domain-general or entirely task specific.

For chromatic stimuli, desaturation increased with decreasing size. Unexpectedly, a similar amount of desaturation occurred for luminance-defined discs, once their perceived contrast was adjusted to match the standard chromatic discs. Desaturation was reduced as standard stimulus contrast increased, in line with contrast constancy theory, which predicts constant appearance for stimuli that are sufficiently distant from threshold.

These improvements yielded a qualitative enhancement of in vivo performance when compared directly to the original sensor. iGABASnFR2 enabled the first measurements of direction-selective GABA release in the retina. In vivo imaging in somatosensory cortex revealed that iGABASnFR2 can report volume-transmitted GABA release following whisker stimulation. Overall, the improved sensitivity and kinetics of iGABASnFR2 make it a more effective tool for imaging GABAergic transmission in intact neural circuits.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

However, the intricate and multifaceted mechanisms underlying methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity have impeded the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Methods: To establish a mouse model of cognitive decline induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure, we employed a large sample size and conducted two behavioral tests (Y-maze and novel object recognition test) at 2 and 4 weeks post-exposure. Subsequently, single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized to delineate the mRNA expression profiles of individual cells within the hippocampus. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including cell clustering and identification, differential gene expression analysis, cellular communication analysis, pseudotemporal trajectory analysis, and transcription factor regulation analysis, were performed to elucidate the cellular-level changes in mRNA profiles caused by chronic methamphetamine exposure. Results: Our findings demonstrated impairments in working memory, spatial cognition, learning, and cognitive memory. After 4 weeks of behavioral testing, we identified diverse cell types in the hippocampi of METH- and saline-treated mice through scRNA-seq, including glial cells, stromal cells, vascular cells, and immune cells. We observed that methamphetamine exerts cell-specific effects on gene expression changes associated with neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal support dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Furthermore, cross-talk analysis revealed extensive alterations in cellular communication patterns and signal changes within the hippocampal microenvironment induced by methamphetamine exposure. Pseudotime analysis predicted hippocampal neurogenesis disorders and identified key regulatory genes implicated in chronic methamphetamine abuse. Transcription factor analysis uncovered regulators and pathways linked to astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, endothelial junction integrity, microglial synaptic remodeling, and oligodendrocyte-supported neuronal cell bodies and axons. Additionally, it highlighted the role of neural precursor cells in various forms of neurodegeneration. Conclusions: This study establishes a robust mouse model of cognitive impairment induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure. It provides valuable biological insights, characterizes the single-cell atlas of the hippocampus, and offers novel directions for investigating neurological damage associated with chronic methamphetamine-induced cognitive decline.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Variants of a chloride/bicarbonate transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), increase the risk of pancreatitis by two- to three-fold in up to 40% of the patients. However, the relationship between the duct-restricted CFTR-function and total exocrine tissue defect during pancreatitis remains less known and animal models do not clearly translate to human disease. To overcome this challenge, we developed a robust iPSC-derived model system of pancreatic ductal tissues from an idiopathic pancreatitis patient with a common CFTR variant to understand CFTR-associated ductal tissue pancreatitis leading to the complete exocrine defect. In the patient line termed PANx, we found deficient CFTR function as well as a distinct gene expression signature for ductal tissue pancreatitis marked by aberrant mucin production, inflammatory cytokines and pancreatic neoplasms. By applying clinically used CFTR-modulator drug ivacaftor, we observed a remarkable restoration of deficient CFTR-mediated fluid secretion as well as up to 40% reversal of the differential gene signature for PANx including the reduction in mucinous neoplasms and cytokines such as IL-11, CCL20 and CXCL8 that drive immune cell infiltration during pancreatitis. We further employed a microsystem device that modeled pancreatitis-associated hyperamylasemia, a diagnostic feature of acute pancreatitis attack, due to a ductal reaction affecting acinar cell-released amylase and viability. The key mucinous signature was validated in primary pancreatitis ductal tissues with a CFTR variant. Overall, we unraveled new layers of CFTR-related pathology in pancreatitis to help us better understand the course of this debilitating condition. Additionally, the test methods and model systems discovered in this study will significantly expedite the discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for treating idiopathic pancreatitis. For the first time, we provided molecular and physiologic evidence supporting the benefit of CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor in human CFTR-related pancreatitis.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Using a multimodal approach combining histology, in situ hybridization, comparative phylogenetics, and live imaging across multiple coleoid species, we characterize the structural and neuronal regulatory organization of the PSG. We show that the gland comprises two distinct tubular systems: secretory tubules specialized for venom production and smooth striated tubules positioned to facilitate venom transport toward the beak for injection into its prey. Molecular localization of filamentous and alpha actin confirms a circular smooth muscle layer surrounding the tubules. Mapping of six neuronal markers, including neurofilament (NF H), synapsin, and muscle type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, reveals dense and stereotyped neural innervation closely associated with the muscular compartments. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of cys loop ligand-gated ion channel sequences indicate a predominancy of excitatory acetylcholine- and dopamine-gated receptors in coleoid venom glands, implicating potential molecular agents involved in neural control of venom release. Consistent with neural regulation, ex vivo stimulation of the PSG elicits calcium signaling throughout the gland. Together, our results reveal a conserved venom gland structure among octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish, with a spatially distinct neuromuscular tissue organization indicating venom production and release sites modulated by a network of neuronal agents.

Identifying and estimating the different sources of variation of functional responses is a long-standing challenge. We develop here a statistical framework derived from a mechanistic stochastic process model that explicitly accounts for different sources of variation. We apply it to disentangle and estimate in particular 1) residual variance due to measurement errors and model misspecification, 2) between-predators variability, and 3) the interaction stochasticity, i.e. the intrinsic and mechanistic variability due to interactions processes between prey and predators. We show that it is possible to estimate these sources of variation under realistic experimental conditions. Our results also show that model fitting can compensate by overestimating residual source of variation, leading to biased parameter estimates when interaction stochasticity is misspecified. Applied to empirical data, the model reveals that standard assumptions, such as prey renewal and lack of spatial structure, fail to capture observed variability.

We rationally designed a library of enzyme-responsive glutamine (Q)-containing block elastin-like polypeptides (Q-block-ELPs) that reinforce fibrin clots through phase separation and covalent cross-linking. Q-block-ELPs incorporate glutamine residues within a peptide motif recognized by coagulation factor XIIIa, enabling site-specific grafting into fibrin networks during clot formation. By tuning polymer length, Q-block valency, and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, we engineered Q-block-ELPs to phase separate at body temperature and integrate into the fibrin architecture. In vitro, Q-block-ELPs increase fibrin network density and stiffness. In a thrombocytopenic mouse model, systemic administration reduced blood loss and accelerated clot formation.

Spectral analyses revealed localized strain-specific increases in infraslow and low delta power following visual deprivation, with C57Bl/6J enucleated and ZRDBA anophthalmic mice exhibiting more generalize nodal increase.

HCN channels are uniquely activated by hyperpolarization, rather than depolarization, a critical mechanism for controlling the involuntary pacemaker activity of the heart. In contrast, hERG channels are depolarization-activated and mediate K currents essential for action potential repolarization. Notably, certain hERG mutations, including those associated with long-QT syndrome, can induce biphasic activation by both hyperpolarization and depolarization. Despite the diverse voltage-dependent gating behaviors observed in CNBD channels, a unified mechanistic framework remains lacking. Here, we propose an allosteric model for their electromechanical coupling, featuring a single voltage-sensor transition coupled to two distinct conformational coupling modes between voltage-sensing and pore domains. With only three or four free parameters, this model recapitulates the biphasic U-shaped and bell-shaped conductance-voltage relationships commonly seen in CNBD channels. Fluorescence anisotropy-based homo-FRET experiments employing site-specifically incorporated noncanonical amino acids provide further support for the hypothesis, suggesting that the S5 helix movement plays a key role in hyperpolarization-dependent activation, while S4-S6 helix interactions are required for depolarization-dependent gating.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Gut microbiota exert an evolutionarily conserved influence on ageing, from invertebrates to humans. How do microbes that are physically confined to the gut lumen affect the systemic physiological process of ageing? In female Drosophila, we show that microbiota increase expression of the peptide hormone Tachykinin (Tk), which corresponds to reduced lifespan. Tk is required for microbiota to shorten lifespan, with knockdown rendering flies constitutively long-lived even in the presence of an intact microbiota. This lifespan extension does not come with canonical costs to fecundity or feeding, but impacts on triacylglyceride (TAG) storage suggest adaptive functions in metabolic homeostasis. In flies with defined (gnotobiotic) microbiotas, we show that we can model Tk-dependent effects of microbiota on lifespan and TAG by monoassociation with Acetobacter pomorum. These effects require Tk in the midgut, and the cognate TK receptor TkR99D in neurons, implicating a microbiota-gut-neuron relay. This relay also appears to compromise gut barrier function in aged flies, indicating roles in healthspan as well as lifespan. However, the effect of TkR99D is independent of its reported role in insulin signalling and adipokinetic hormone signalling which, respectively, are canonical regulators of lifespan and TAG metabolism, suggesting a non-canonical role for TkR99D elsewhere in the nervous system. Altogether our results implicate a microbiota-gut-neuron axis in ageing, via a specific bacterium modulating activity of a specific and evolutionarily-conserved hormone.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

However, factors determining the post-WGD cell fates remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that cytokinesis failure (CF) and mitotic slippage (MS), two major routes of WGD induction, differentially affected post-WGD viability and proliferation in human cells. Quantitative live imaging revealed poorer survivability of cells upon multipolar chromosome segregation at the first mitosis after MS than CF. Chromosome-specific labeling showed that the inefficient sister chromatid separation upon MS caused more skewed homologous chromosome distribution than CF. The skewed homologue distribution frequently led to physical isolation (> 10 m) of the centrosomes from all homologous centromeres, hindering these centrosomes from capturing any of these homologues. The difference in the frequency of this nullisomic chromosome segregation between MS and CF at least partially explained their difference in the viability of the subsequent daughter cells. Moreover, artificial separation of sister chromatids upon MS improved the evenness of homologue distribution, suppressed nullisomic homologue segregation in the following mitosis, and significantly restored the viability of their daughter cells. These results demonstrate the geometric arrangement of homologous chromosomes, defined by the presence or absence of sufficient sister chromatid separation upon WGD, as a key factor determining the proliferative characteristics of subsequent progenies.

Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, n = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations.

However, it remains unclear how sequence variations could introduce or alter such catalytic mechanisms in myoglobin. Here we used enzyme proximity sequencing (EP-Seq) to measure the peroxidase activity levels of >6,000 human myoglobin variants. The resulting fitness landscape reveals how aromatic substitutions, in particular surface-exposed tryptophans, can enhance peroxidase activity. Using protein language models in tandem with feedforward neural networks, we trained an accurate fitness predictor on the experimental dataset, and applied it to evaluate >4M double mutant variants. The predictions suggested a beneficial role for hole-hopping mutations in improving peroxidase activity. We experimentally tested 20 high scoring variants in a yeast display assay, all of which outperformed wild type myoglobin. Three selected variants were also tested in soluble format and similarly showed improved performance. A focused combinatorial library yielded a top double tryptophan variant (Q92W/F107W) with 4.9-fold higher catalytic efficiency than wild type.

However, only for few r-proteins tailored support mechanisms involving so-called dedicated chaperones could so far be revealed. Here, with the primary aim of identifying novel dedicated chaperones, we performed TurboID-based proximity labelling with all 46 large subunit r-proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which unveiled the fungi-specific Acl1 and the conserved Bcl1 as candidate dedicated chaperones of Rpl1. We show that the functionally cooperating Acl1 and Bcl1 both directly interact with Rpl1, form a trimeric Acl1-Rpl1-Bcl1 complex, and enable the nuclear import of Rpl1. Moreover, our crystal structure of the minimal Acl1-Rpl1 complex reveals how Acl1's ankyrin repeat domain shields a positively charged rRNA-binding surface of Rpl1. Our proximity labelling approach also permitted to establish novel interactions between four r-proteins and distinct importins and to illuminate r-protein neighbourhoods on successive pre-60S particles. Additionally, reciprocal proximity labelling with the known dedicated chaperones indicates that almost all appear to be transiently associated with pre-ribosomal particles. Our study provides for the first time comprehensive insight into the physical proximities of large subunit r-proteins along their entire life cycle.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

The results indicated dead mangrove sites contained evidence of nitrogen contamination (nitrate +14-fold, ammonia +5.6-fold), acidification ({Delta}pH = -1.3), and a collapse in bacterial diversity (p = 0.013). Community Stabilisation and restructuring proceeded according to deterministic patterns (R2 = 0.215, p = 0.018): metabolically versatile Alphaproteobacteria decreased by 75%, and acid-tolerant Bacillota increased, which is in accordance with the selection force of fermentative Metabolism in the face of compromised nitrogen cycling. Prediction of functional genes showed the loss of biosynthetic pathways (carbon fixation genes -12.6x, nitrogen fixation genes -2.4x, cellulose degradation genes -3.1x), detoxification systems (-1.7x to -2.2x), and maintenance machinery of genomes (DNA repair genes -3.3x to -6.4x), and substitution by stress response genes and fermentation genes enrichment ( +2.1x Environmental indicators (Hypha microbiaceae, Alicyclobacillaceae) classified the state of the ecosystem across sites.

We show that cells defective in fork reversal exhibit reduced nucleosome density at replication forks, accompanied by the loss of parental histones during their transfer onto nascent DNA. Mechanistically, we showed that PrimPol activation leads to single-stranded DNA gaps in fork reversal deficient cells; PARylation and DNA-protein crosslinking on single-stranded DNA subsequently evicts nucleosomes.

However, the role of bacteriophages that may inhibit microbialization by infecting and killing these bacteria remains poorly understood, especially their metabolic impacts on bacterial proliferation. To address this, we analyzed central carbon metabolism gene frequencies in viral communities from healthy (lytic-dominated) and degraded (temperate-dominated) Central Pacific coral reefs. We found that viral metabolism shifted broadly from being dominated by metabolism that builds up pools of central intermediates on degraded reefs dominated by temperate viral infection (\"anaplerotic\" reactions) to metabolism that consumes these pools to prioritize production of metabolic precursors for virion construction on healthy reefs dominated by lytic infection (\"cataplerotic\" reactions). This switch was shown by the over-representation of Entner-Doudoroff (ED) glycolysis genes on degraded, temperate-dominated reefs and of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) genes on healthy, lytic-dominated reefs. As a result of this metabolic dichotomy, our qualitative compartment modeling revealed two distinct ecosystem states: (i) healthy reefs, where lytic viral metabolism enhances viral production and suppresses bacterial overgrowth, and (ii) degraded reefs, where temperate viral metabolism accelerates bacterial proliferation. Because viral switching between lytic and temperate lifestyles is a known function of host physiological state, these findings position viral metabolism as both a driver of reef decline and a conservation lever, with metabolically mediated \"re-viralization\" offering a novel strategy to restore reef resilience.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Rodent models capture biventricular changes, including at the cell- and organ-scale, and pulmonary vascular remodeling seen in preterm humans. However, synthesizing these measures across scales and organ systems is challenging. We hypothesized that in-silico modeling of biventricular mitochondrial, myofiber, and organ-scale function plus circulatory function could capture key features of cardiopulmonary abnormalities due to preterm birth. Therefore, we calibrated a multiscale model to subject-specific biventricular pressure-volume data from a hyperoxic rat model of preterm birth alongside normoxic controls to investigate the impact of preterm birth on multiscale cardiopulmonary function. The calibrated model demonstrates excellent agreement with the data and captures the expected increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dilation also seen in preterm born. Simulations also predict an increase in right ventricular myofiber power and rapid septal wall flattening with subsequent rapid return to normal curvature, or septal bounce. By calibrating a multiscale model to organ-scale data, we identified correlations between septal motion, pulmonary arterial resistance, and right ventricular myofiber power, suggesting that septal bounce may be a non-invasive marker of preterm right ventricular dysfunction severity. Our multiscale modeling approach captures cardiopulmonary abnormalities across spatial scales and provides an innovative approach to explore the consequences of preterm birth beyond experimental data alone. This is a foundational step in understanding the impact of preterm birth on cardiopulmonary disease in childhood as well as adulthood.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

The thalamus can be divided into first- and higher-order (HO) nuclei. Unlike first-order thalamic regions which are known to primarily relay sensory signals to the neocortex, the functions of HO thalamic nuclei remain far less clear. Although previous studies indicate HO thalamic nuclei influence cortical processing and consciousness, most studies examined single thalamic nuclei in isolation. To investigate the relation between distinct HO thalamic nuclei, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across multiple thalamic nuclei simultaneously in awake and anesthetized mice with sensory stimulation. The effect of voluntary locomotion was also studied in the awake state. Surprisingly, we found that both LFP and MUA were strongly correlated across HO nuclei in both states, which cannot be explained by volume conduction alone but suggests the existence of shared synaptic inputs. Furthermore, in the awake state locomotion and sensory stimuli activated many HO nuclei, including those that have not classically been regarded as sensory or motor.

The study also involves analysis of co-evolutionary dynamics of BLs with related genes. PPI analysis identified NagZ as central interacting partner for BLs in P. aerugino-sa and Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting its pivotal role in BL expression, and highlighting its probable role as a potential drug target. In contrast, A. baumannii exhibited such a high diversity in protein interactions, that considering a single protein as topmost interacting partner was difficult. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strong co-evolutionary trends be-tween functionally-related proteins. A. baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae were found to be closely related in case of not just the chromosomally-encoded MBL-fold containing proteins, but also the true MBLs which are plasmid-encoded. On the other hand, similar evolutionary patterns for chromosomally-encoded BLs like AmpC and related genes was found in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Analysis of PFAM domains showed that catalytic and substrate binding domains are more conserved than accessory ones. Several motifs, such as, ASNGLI were found to be con-served across all MBLs and thus carry the potential to be significant drug targets.

We demonstrate through rigorous mathematical proofs that plasticity negates the functional equivalence between RNN and FNN. Our proofs address history-dependent plasticity, dynamical systems analysis, information-theoretic considerations, perturbational stability, complexity growth, and resource limitations. We demonstrate that neuronal systems that possess properties such as plasticity, history-dependence, and complex temporal information encoding have features that cannot be captured by a static FNN. Our findings delineate limitations of the unfolding argument that apply if consciousness arises from temporally extended dynamic neural processes rather than static input-output mappings.

Neural measures have deepened our understanding of these states, but their cost and limited ecological validity constrain broader application. This study evaluates heart rate variability (HRV) amplitude, a measure reflecting dynamic sympathovagal engagement, as a cost-effective and sustainable physiological marker of STE during \"numadelic\" virtual reality (VR) experiences. The unique numadelic aesthetic combined with multi-person can induce STE through dissolving self-boundaries and fostering embodied presence. Building on previous work linking non-ordinary states of consciousness (NOSC) with autonomic nervous system activity during psychedelic drug administration, we tested the hypothesis that HRV amplitude may reflect STE depth and relate to affective and relational outcomes during non-drug numadelic VR experiences. Specifically, ninety-six participants engaged in guided meditation within either a numadelic VR setting or a non-VR audio-guided group format. Physiological data (cardiac activity and respiration) were recorded during the meditation, alongside psychological assessments pre- and post-session. Findings confirm that HRV amplitude measured during numadelic VR correlates with subjective STE ratings. It also relates to compassion traits, and emotional improvement following VR practice. Additional analysis of data from a prior psychedelic drug study further validated the relevance of this measure across methods of inducing NOSCs. These results advance the psychophysiological mapping of STEs and highlight HRV amplitude as a potential real-time biomarker which may help to guide participants toward self-transcendent states within adaptive environments.

Its Large and Small Tumor antigens (LT, ST), splice variants of a common viral early transcript, drive viral replication and tumorigenesis by binding to and perturbing the function of host proteins. LT binds and inhibits RB1, deregulating E2F activity and host cell cycle control to permit viral replication during S phase. While the functions of LT and ST are relatively well characterized, how their expression is controlled is poorly defined. Here, we discovered that E2F1-3/DP1 dimers bind the MCPyV Non-Coding Control Region (NCCR) via a consensus E2 site close to the LT/ST transcriptional start site. Inhibiting E2F-NCCR binding, either by deleting the E2 site or treatment with a E2F small molecule inhibitor, downregulated LT/ST mRNA and protein expression in MCC cells and in 293A cells transfected with MCPyV. Our findings reveal an E2F/LT/RB1 positive feedback loop that appears to have evolved to support viral replication and is hijacked in MCC cells to promote cellular proliferation. Furthermore, we identified E2 sites in the NCCRs of PyVs closely related to MCPyV, including murine PyV, which mediate E2F/DP binding and potentiate viral early transcription. E2F/DP also bound weakly to the SV40 and BKPyV NCCRs, despite lacking an E2 site.

For biophysical problems, such as protein folding and association, a fundamental question in diffusion-based methods is how their learned functions correspond to thermodynamics. In this paper, we study diffusion models through the lens of theoretical biophysics, analyzing their underlying formulation of potentials and exploring their applications in scoring protein interactions. We develop simple theories rooted in statistical physics that relate thermodynamic potentials to the negative log of the probability of observing a system in a particular state. We include dimensional analysis of diffusion model equations and a table mapping AI and physics jargon. We then test a diffusion models ability to capture learned energies as negative log-likelihood values, - log p0(x0), by integrating over the diffusion-generated path or a probability flow path. We test these integrals on a simple 1D Gaussian mixture diffusion model and a protein-docking diffusion model, DFMDock. In the 1D case, we find that integration over both diffusion and flow paths can accurately recover ground truth probabilities. When we extract the learned docking energies for cases where DFMDock succeeds, we observe energy funnels with the minimum energy near the experimental docked structure, like those we observe with Rosetta, an empirically tuned physics-based biomolecular modeling suite. The learned energy performs comparably or outperforms Rosetta interface energy in 6 out of 25 cases at ranking the correctness of docked poses. These data show that we can extract a relevant learned energy function from a diffusion model and compare it to physical energy functions.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We therefore developed markeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/markeR), an open-source, modular R package that evaluates gene sets as phenotypic markers using various scoring and enrichment-based approaches. markeR generates interpretable metrics and intuitive visualisations that enable benchmarking of gene signatures and exploration of their associations with chosen study variables. As a case study, we applied markeR to 9 published senescence-related gene sets across 25 RNA-seq datasets, covering 6 human cell types and 12 senescence-inducing conditions. There was wide variability in gene set performance, as some signatures (e.g., SenMayo) were robust senescence markers across contexts, while others (e.g., those from MSigDB), performed poorly as such. We also used markeR to analyse gene expression in 49 GTEx tissues, revealing tissue- and age-related differences in senescence-associated signals. Together, these findings emphasise the difficulty of characterising molecular phenotypes and demonstrate the potential of markeR in facilitating the systematic evaluation of gene sets in various biological contexts.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

R.; Takizawa, S.; Koyama, A.; Niizato, T.; Habe, H.; Kawashima, H.", "abstract": "Fish navigation is modulated by visual stimulation and associated parameters, such as size, speed, and orientation, yet the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we experimentally investigate how systematically controlled stimulus speed influences the temporal and spatial collective dynamics of Hemigrammus bleheri. Using a simple and customisable top-down projection setup, we displayed clockwise-rotating black-dot patterns at three distinct speeds to simulate complex environmental motion cues. We quantified individual temporal responsiveness through angular movements, and evaluated group-level spatial organisation. Fish angular movements positively tracked the rotation direction of the visual patterns. Lower stimulus speeds elicited predominantly exploratory behaviour, while higher speeds induced a transition to strong motion-tracking behaviour, aligning fish orientation with the rotating patterns. Increasing stimulus speed also corresponded with greater nearest-neighbour distance, indicating reduced spatial cohesion. Notably, we observed transient schooling episodes not aligned with the rotational stimulus, reflecting periods in which internal social interactions outweighed stimulus-driven coordination. Using a newly defined free-schooling index, we show that such internally driven episodes were frequent at lower stimulus speeds but markedly reduced at higher speeds. Overall, these results demonstrate that speed-controlled visual stimuli modulate both individual navigation and group coherence, offering new insights into how visual cues shape fish collective behaviour dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Despite a long history of research, several important aspects of RNase HII functioning are poorly known including optimal pH, salts and thermal stability. This lack of empirical data hampers the selection of an optimal RNase HII for a specific practical application. In the present study, we compared biochemical properties of previously cloned RNases HII from E. coli, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Thermus thermophilus: optimal temperature, pH, salts, divalent cofactors, thermal stability and specific activity. As expected, the most thermostable enzyme was Tth RNase HII, and Mg2+ was the most preferential cofactor for all RNases. Gst RNase HII was partially inhibited by K+ ions, while other enzymes did not demonstrate preferences for any salt. The enzymes from E. coli and G. stearothermophilus were typical RNases HII, while Tth RNase HII was a JRNase (junction ribonuclease). All three RNases did not cleave a DNA-RNA3-DNA2-RNA1-DNA/DNA substrate. The presented results will facilitate usage of RNases HII in practical applications and provide a basis for further comparative studies of RNases HII from various organisms.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

P.; Tuin, S.; Wong, S.-W.; Boesze-Battaglia, K.; Miguez, P. A.", "abstract": "Objectives: Studies documented the association of melanoregulin (MREG), a cargo-sorting protein, with its binding partner, the autophagic protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) in macrophages which could affect bone physiology due to the importance of autophagy in osteoclast function. Herein we propose to test the hypothesis that MREG modulates bone remodeling. Therefore, we analyzed the Mregdsu/dsu mutant mice for bone mass, growth plate microarchitecture, and bone marrow-derived osteoclast function to understand how lack of MREG affects bone and mass at two different time points. Methods: Mice femurs from wild type and MREG-/- male mice (on C57BL6)/J background) were harvested at 4 and 10 months and imaged by microcomputed tomography to assess bone mass parameters. Femurs were processed for histology by H&E and TRAP staining for assessment of osteoclast numbers. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from 3-week-old mice were harvested to assess osteoclast differentiation and function via TRAP, resorptive assay and Western Blot for osteoclast differentiation markers. In addition, a separate cohort of mice were analyzed via EchoMRI to characterize total lean vs. fat whole body mass. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in bone volume of 10-month old mice in wild type vs. MREG-/- with MREG mutation suggesting a preservative effect on phenotypical bone parameters as the mice age. A reduction in adipose tissue but an increase in osteoclast numbers was found histologically in MREG mutant femurs. Bone marrow-derived cells, however, showed reduced osteoclastic function in MREG-/-. The mutant mice presented a total lean mass significantly increased compared to wild type per EchoMRI. Conclusions: MREG deficiency seems to impact osteoclast numbers in vivo but not in vitro, although in vitro function was reduced. MREG deficiency favors lean mass preservation over fat accumulation in bones and body composition as mice age. This study provides the foundation for a more in-depth investigation of MREG's role in bone and systemic metabolism. It is possible that MREG can be a future target for new therapeutic modalities in inflammatory and metabolic bone diseases.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Prior neuroimaging studies that used controlled stimuli and tasks have suggested that navigation-related information is represented broadly across the human cerebral cortex. While three regions in the anterior visual cortex have been well-studied, the extent and functional properties of regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices are not as well-characterized. To map and characterize the full cortical network that underpins active navigation in the real world, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity from participants performing a naturalistic navigation task. Banded ridge regression was used to fit high-dimensional encoding models for 28,134 features to this data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions: five prefrontal and three parietal regions, along with three regions in the visual cortex that had been identified and characterized in previous studies. Analysis of encoding model weights shows that these 11 regions transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs, and are organized along distributed cortical functional gradients. These results provide a unified description of the functional properties and organization of the cortical network that mediates naturalistic navigation. We anticipate that these maps will provide rich targets to inform more targeted future studies of human navigation.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

The right hemisphere components of the language network responded more strongly to nonverbal than to verbal materials, splitting the network's functional profile between the hemispheres. Similar patterns were observed across multiple association networks including putative cognitive-control, action-mode, and attention networks.

The technological advances of the recent \"omics revolution\" have enabled comparative genomics studies, which have started to unravel genetic signatures of longevity in vertebrates. Building on prior studies and incorporating a novel approach to detecting convergent positive selection, we conducted the first genome-wide survey of positive and purifying selection among hundreds of long-lived mammals and birds, two major vertebrate taxa with notable parallels in their evolutionary history. We discovered an extensive network of shared pathways under purifying selection in both mammals that are exceptionally long-lived for their body size (ELL) and large-bodied long-lived (LLL) birds. In our positive selection survey, we identified 16 genes, involved in eight distinct hallmarks of aging, with concordant signals of positive selection in LLL mammals and LLL birds at neighboring amino acid residues. These included two genes directly involved in cholesterol metabolism, as well as genes whose products clear oxidized metabolites and regulate peroxisomal autophagy. These striking parallels between long-lived mammals and birds, both in broad pathways under purifying selection, as well as in instances of genes under parallel positive selection in LLL mammals and LLL birds, together imply an ancient shared genetic toolkit for longevity, deeply conserved and repeatedly modified to produce longevity in diverse lineages.\n\nSignificanceWhile aging is nearly universal in vertebrates, lifespan can vary by several orders of magnitude. Further, extraordinarily long-lived species are dispersed throughout the mammalian and avian phylogenies, indicating repeated evolutionary origins of long life. In the first genome-wide survey of positive and purifying selection in long-lived mammals and birds, we found a striking level of parallelism in the signatures of selection in long-lived species in both clades. These included an extensive network of shared pathways under purifying selection, as well as several novel genes under parallel positive selection.

METTL3, as an RNA methyltransferase of key importance in adipose tissue development, functional preservation and metabolic homeostasis, is remarkably complex.Licoisoflavone A (LIC-A) is a prenylated flavonoid compound of licorice that has been suggested to display antiinflammatory, -hypertrophic, and -proliferative activities; it remains unknown whether it can directly modulate expression of METTL3 and impact functions of adipose tissue in obesity.Here in our study, 16 candidates in the top ranking molecules were screened out in the process of the molecular docking between our TCM formula Fangjihuangqin Decoction and protein METTL3 (PDB: 5TEY). Among them, LIC-A was considered as a potential upstream regulatory molecule of METTL3 and obviously promote the expression of METTL3.The effects of TNF- and LPS treatments on the inhibition of adipogenesis were successfully recovered by LIC-A treatment in the adipogenic 3T3-L1 cells, via the regulation of adipogenic cytokines, as well as the expression of inflammatory factors. These protective effects were similarly abolished with METTL3 knockdown, suggesting the role of LIC-A relies on METTL3.Moreover, in vivo data demonstrated that administration of LIC-A could significantly recover the body weight lipid metabolism, insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis in mice with reduced adipose depostion as well as abated systemic inflammation.

Using single-unit recordings from identified RVM ON-, OFF-, and NEUTRAL-cells and probabilistic modeling, we find that ON- and OFF-cells exhibit multi-phase population responses characterized by rapid activation and prolonged recovery dynamics lasting tens of seconds. In the absence of stimulation, the same neurons display coherent, quasi-periodic oscillations on the order of minutes, captured by Gaussian process models as predictable, low-frequency fluctuations. These rhythmic dynamics were specific to ON- and OFF-cells and occasionally coherent with autonomic parameters, suggesting coupling between nociceptive and homeostatic control loops.

To investigate the physiology of the myelin sheath, we implemented an imaging strategy that allowed optical measurements of myelin membrane voltage, with the aim to identify physiological changes of the myelin membrane during neuronal firing. We expressed the genetically encoded voltage indicator ASAP3 in mouse oligodendrocytes in vivo and subsequently investigated myelin physiology by optically measuring myelin membrane voltage. We found that myelin depolarizes during neuronal activity, which is blocked by inhibiting neuronal action potentials. Pharmacological and knock-out experiments of Kir4.1 showed that potassium uptake channels mediate action potential induced depolarization. Blocking myelin dependent potassium uptake and direct application of high potassium to identified axons induced axonal initiated and antidromic propagating action potentials. Our study shows that myelin is not an electrically passive insulator, but exhibits ion dynamics and its physiological response is fine tuned to neuronal activity. By facilitating potassium removal during action potentials, myelin supports high precision axonal firing.

CsubMADS1, a MADS-box TF from the microalga Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169, was previously shown to influence developmental processes and starvation-associated responses. In this study, overexpression of CsubMADS1 was associated with increased tolerance to nutrient-limiting conditions, particularly during stationary phase and nitrogen starvation. Overexpressing lines exhibited reduced neutral lipid droplet formation and decreased mucilage staining under these conditions, physiological traits typically linked to stress-associated responses in microalgae. RNA-seq analysis identified 19 chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) genes as upregulated in the overexpressors, six of which were validated by qPCR. In wild-type cells, CsubMADS1 was upregulated and CAB transcripts were downregulated during nitrogen starvation, indicating that both the transcription factor and these candidate downstream genes respond to nutrient stress. Six CAB genes contained CArG motifs within their 2 kb upstream regions, and CArG boxes from CAB24 and CAB8 were tested for binding. CAB24 belongs to the stress-responsive LI818 family. Agarose-based EMSA provided preliminary evidence of CsubMADS1 interaction with the CAB24 and CAB8 CArG motifs, with the enriched sequence resembling the AGL15-type C(A/T)8G motif.

Previous studies using sectional approaches have reported the impacts of in-vitro technologies on mammalian embryogenesis and offspring development. However, systematic and longitudinal comparisons between in-vivo and in-vitro spatiotemporal morphogenesis and cell lineage specification remain incomplete. This study aims to bridge this gap using 4D live imaging via a laser scanning confocal microscopy to capture dynamic embryo development from a CAG::H2B-GFP mouse line. The results showed that in-vitro culture under a confocal microscopy cumulatively slowed the increase in embryonic cell number and embryos size over time. Furthermore, in-vitro embryo compaction, cavitation, primitive cell migration and hatching deferred in both spatial pattern and temporal progression. Additionally, in-vitro and in-vivo cell lineages differed in spatial distribution and expansion rate. These findings demonstrate that in-vitro culture delays embryo development, alters morphological events and disrupts cell lineage specification at both spatial and temporal scales during pre- and early peri-implantation. This work provides insights on the detailed extent of similarities and differences between in-vivo and in-vitro embryogenesis, beneficial when translating in-vitro findings into clinical, industrial and ecological applications.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

While human-specific genes have been shown to promote neuronal production during cortical development, whether such genes also regulate gliogenesis has remained unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized role for the human-specific gene family NOTCH2NL in promoting astrocyte-lineage expansion. Reanalysis of human fetal single-cell transcriptomic datasets revealed that NOTCH2NL is robustly expressed along the gliogenic trajectory, from glial intermediate progenitor cells to astrocytes. Functional perturbations in a human astrocyte culture system demonstrated that NOTCH2NL is both required and sufficient for astrocyte proliferation. In vivo overexpression of NOTCH2NLB in the developing mouse cortex shifted progenitor output toward the astrocyte lineage, increasing the astrocyte-to-neuron ratio from the early postnatal period through adulthood. This phenotype was associated with an expansion of proliferative glial progenitors around birth. Single-nucleus transcriptomic profiling further showed that NOTCH2NLB suppresses neuronal gene programs while activating transcriptional modules related to cell proliferation and cellular homeostasis during gliogenesis. Together, these findings indicate that human-specific NOTCH2NL acts at a conserved developmental decision point to amplify astrocyte production. Our study extends the function of NOTCH2NL beyond neurogenesis and suggests that human lineage-specific gene duplications can modulate gliogenesis, providing a developmental mechanism that may have contributed to the coordinated expansion of neuronal and glial populations in the human cortex.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We developed a scalable proteogenomic framework integrating population-scale human genetics and plasma proteomics to identify genes tolerant of inactivation (i.e., dispensable) within hematopoietic compartments, thereby enabling safer targeted immunotherapies. Using CD33 as a validated benchmark, we observed that naturally occurring loss-of-function (LoF) variants lead to concordant RNA and protein depletion, supporting functional gene inactivation.

Paradoxically, RAF inhibitors can activate wild-type RAF signaling. Negative allostery is a central feature of the prevailing model for this phenomenon, wherein inhibitors induce RAF dimers in which inhibitor binding to one protomer promotes an active but inhibitor-resistant conformation in the other protomer. Here we systematically examined paradoxical activation of ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF using biochemical assays with isolated RAF/MEK kinase domain complexes. We found that type I and type II inhibitors induce paradoxical activation of all three isoforms, and that phosphomimetic mutation of the N-terminal acidic motif of ARAF and CRAF dramatically sensitized these isoforms to activation by type II inhibitors. The inhibition phase of paradoxical activation curves for type II inhibitors was suggestive of positive cooperativity, a finding in conflict with the prevailing model which implies negative cooperativity. In contrast to the kinase domain RAF/MEK preparations, full-length autoinhibited RAF/MEK/14-3-3 complexes were refractory to activation. Mass photometry confirmed that paradoxical activators promote BRAF dimerization. These findings support a revised model that does not rely on negative allostery. Inhibitors act on the RAS-engaged \"open monomer\" state to induce dimerization and activation. The open monomer and active dimer are structurally distinct species with differing affinities for inhibitor and ATP, creating a concentration window in which paradoxical activation occurs.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Previous work has established that loss of MMR prevents the excision of the thymine- containing strand across O6meG-T mismatches. Thus, MMR dysfunction is advantageous because it prevents a vicious cycle of attempted repair that leads to cell death. Here, we provide an alternative explanation to this prevailing mechanism of alkylation chemoresistance by MMR loss. We find that the MMR protein MutLa physically and functionally interacts with the base excision repair (BER) enzyme methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), which processes common alkylation adducts, such as 7meG and 3meA. Biochemical reconstitution demonstrates that MutLa activates MPG glycosylase activity at least partly by promoting MPG substrate binding. This glycosylase stimulation requires ATP hydrolysis as well as the MLH1-interacting region on MPG. Both MutLa or its ability to interact with MPG promote the generation of alkylation-induced abasic sites in cells, which contribute to the cytotoxicity of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), an SN2 alkylating agent which does not produce O6meG. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism of alkylation chemoresistance and uncover an unappreciated crosstalk between MMR and base excision repair.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

To elucidate the immune determinants underlying viral pathogenesis and delayed lung repair in the aged lung, a comprehensive time-course study was conducted. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high-dimensional flow cytometry were utilized to compare lungs from young and aged mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Aged hosts displayed diminished alveolar macrophage (AM) and dendritic cell (DC) but elevated monocyte-derived macrophage (MoM) and interstitial macrophage (IM) presence following infection. Additionally, enhanced accumulation of adaptive immune cells, including CD4+ tissue-resident helper (TRH) cells, CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, and a B cell subset resembling age-associated B cells, was observed in the memory phase. Pathway analysis revealed that elevated type I and II interferon (IFN/{gamma}) signaling, especially in MoM/IM subsets, distinguished the aged hosts from the young. Inhibition of IFN/{gamma} signaling after viral clearance improved long-term respiratory outcomes and reduced both IM and TRH populations in aged mice.

During the siege, seven of the local people hid within the stronghold walls. Two others, who could have been as well attackers as defenders, were found under the ruins of the main gate. The material culture found at Roca Vecchia and associated with the period of the siege includes Minoan-type pottery produced from local clay, imported Aegean pottery and an Aegean-type dagger, pointing to an established relationship between the site and the Minoan civilization. Therefore, the site offers an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the genetic components of the population inhabiting an indigenous settlement with increasing contacts with the Aegean world, and to shed light on the demic or cultural modes of the Minoan presence in the central Mediterranean. Results: With our work, we sampled six out of nine available unburied Middle Bronze Age individuals, contemporary with the siege and destruction of the site, and obtained genome-wide information for two individuals. When compared with available Minoan, Apulian and broadly Mediterranean genomes, the individuals showed a characteristic Bronze/Iron Age Italian peninsula genetic signature, with limited contribution from Minoans. Conclusions: We conclude that the local population of Roca Vecchia, at the moment of the siege, was predominantly autochthonous, with a minoritarian Minoan component. A Minoan genetic signal is indeed likely present in one out of two analysed individuals who were certainly part of the dwellers of Roca Vecchia. This confirms previous hypotheses supposing that a nucleus of foreigners coming from the Minoan world was living in the site and mixed with locals. Archaeological data suggest that the Roca Vecchia Aegean population component probably increased in the following centuries.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Unexpectedly, a portion of maternal tissue with low DNA methylation level, enriched for nutrient-supplier progenitor cell, is observed in the middle region of maternal decidua after implantation. The hypomethylated regions in the nutrient-supplier progenitor cell cluster are associated with cell proliferation.

However, integrative analysis at subcellular resolution meets many challenging questions due to its ultra-large volume, ultra-high sparsity, and severe susceptibility to technical conditions and batch effects. We introduce STUltra, a scalable and accurate framework for integrating subcellular-level spatial omics data across spatial, temporal, and biomedical dimensions. Built on contrastive learning, STUltra combines a robust graph autoencoder with an interval sampling step to enhance batch-effect correction and enable clear characterization of shared and condition-specific tissue structures. It also provides seamless extension to super-resolution platforms such as Visium HD, Xenium, and Stereo-seq. STUltra is thus capable of identifying finer-grained cluster dynamics with distinguishable profile features, offering insights beyond those of prior studies. For example, STUltra successfully delineates interspersed macrophages within colorectal tumors, aligns mouse brain hippocampus across three subcellular platforms, and maps long-term muscle continuum during mouse embryonic development. Furthermore, from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, STUltra detects disease-related astrocyte substructures and disentangles the regulatory network. Importantly, STUltra is remarkably scalable to process these datasets containing over 1,000,000 cells, outperforming existing tools in both accuracy and efficiency.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Mapping how genetic and environmental risk factors alter these cascades is critical for pinpointing disease susceptibility and guiding therapeutic intervention, yet this task requires dense sampling of cell-subtype and -subpopulation changes throughout the full course of disease. Bulk measurements provide scale but obscure cell-type and subpopulation resolution, whereas single-cell assays offer resolution but lack sufficient sample size and temporal coverage. We present DeepDynamics, a deep-learning framework that combines a smaller reference sc/snRNA-seq atlas with a larger bulk RNA-seq cohorts to infer cell-subpopulation and clinicopathological dynamics along annotated trajectories. Applied to Alzheimer's disease (AD), DeepDynamics mapped 1,092 cortical bulk profiles onto aging and disease trajectories, revealing faster accumulation of AD clinicopathologies, disease-associated glia, and specific neuronal subpopulations in APOE4 carriers. These changes, stronger in females, were accompanied by upregulation of cell-type-specific molecular pathways and early downregulation of heat-shock proteins across cell types. By unifying genetic risk, pathology, and cell-subpopulation dynamics, DeepDynamics provides a scalable approach to prioritize putative mediators of risk and resilience amid the myriad changes along the cascade, thus informing targeted therapies.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Here we identify a general principle we term echo-facilitated temporal sensitivity (EFTS), in which the auditory system exploits reverberation as a computational resource to selectively and dose dependently enhance perceptual and neural responses to rapid temporal changes. Using transitional click trains with subtle inter click interval (ICI) shifts, human listeners showed monotonically improved change detection across simulated echo levels. Concurrent EEG revealed systematic increases of a late change response with echo strength, while onset responses remained stable, indicating a selective boost to temporal-structure-transition processing. In awake rats, electrocorticography over auditory cortex replicated these effects; single units exhibited echo level dependent increases in ICI transition evoked firing, and receiver operating characteristic neurometrics yielded steeper functions and lower discrimination thresholds. Laminar local field potential analysis further revealed that echo-dependent divergence emerged last in the supragranular layer, after appearing in the granular and infragranular layers, consistent with an initial thalamocortical drive followed by intracortical amplification. Together, these findings establish EFTS as a cross-species mechanism for ecologically grounded temporal computation, through which reverberation sharpens neural representations of temporal structure and enhances sensitivity to rapid pattern changes, reframing echoes as structured signals that the brain uses to naturally optimize temporal integration in everyday listening.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Using transfer entropy (TE) analysis, we found that in the awake state the infra-slow (ISF < 0.1 Hz) oscillations of statistically independent resting state networks (RSN) largely drove the neurofluid (NF) pulsatility. NREM-sleep was associated with increased power of infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) vasomotor oscillations and with altered driving patterns between RSN and NF networks in the direction of a causally chained pattern. Importantly, within these independent signal sources, we found three distinct cross-frequency coupling frequency ranges occurring at ISF (<0.1 Hz), respiratory (~0.25 Hz), and cardiovascular (~1 Hz) frequencies, where the slower pulsations generally modulated the faster ones, except for a finding of inverted cardiorespiratory drive in NREM-2 sleep.

Seedlings are particularly vulnerable to water stress due to their shallow root systems, making belowground plasticity a potentially key component of species adaptive capacity. Quantifying root trait variability and its drivers can improve our understanding of regeneration success under increasingly warm and dry conditions. We quantified between species variation (BTV) and intraspecific variation (ITV) in seven root traits linked to water uptake, root-to-shoot ratio, maximum rooting depth, proportion of absorptive roots, specific root length, root tissue density, average absorptive root diameter, and root branching density, for seedlings of seven common, co-occurring tree species in forests of northeastern North America. We sampled seedlings under contrasting climate and light conditions, and assessed the influence of abiotic (climate, light conditions, soil properties) and biotic drivers (neighboring vegetation) as well as seedling characteristics (species identity, age, spermatophyte type) on root ITV at local and regional scales. Species differed significantly for some traits but differed even more strongly in multivariate trait syndromes, suggesting distinct belowground strategies. ITV was substantial but trait-dependent, with maximum rooting depth and root to shoot ratio being the most variable (coefficient of variation > 45%) and branching density the least variable. BTV was the primary driver of overall trait variation for three traits, explaining more than 60% of variation, whereas within-plot ITV accounted for more than 50% of variation in the remaining four traits. Local drivers did not outweigh regional factors, and the overall explanatory power of measured drivers was limited, suggesting that fine-scale heterogeneity, not captured in our study, may strongly influence root ITV. High ITV in most traits suggests substantial plasticity in roots, which may contribute to the adaptive capacity of seedlings facing climate change. Integrating this plasticity into mechanistic models is critical for predicting regeneration dynamics or root-mediated ecosystem processes. We propose a set of guidelines for integrating root traits into comparative studies and models based on trait measurability and extent of ITV. We further highlight the need to account for the scale- and gradient-intensity dependence of ITV-environment relationships.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Peptide vaccines are a promising strategy, as they focus on short, synthetic peptides specifically selected to trigger a T-cell immune response.

However, testing and validating biohybrid implants can be difficult and expensive due to material handling, fabrication methods and specialty medium components. The devices used to test potential samples can be large and expensive, requiring significant amounts of cell culture medium to operate. Additional, conventional static cell culture conditions do not accurately represent the vascular environment as shear and mechanical forces play key roles in the development of calcification. To address these challenges, a miniaturized, dual-channel flow chamber was designed and validated that allowed for real-time visualization of biohybrid calcification in a physiological environment. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were performed to determine the flow characteristics that generated physiological shear stress homogeneously across the sample surface. Micro particle tracking velocimetry measurements validated the simulated shear stresses near the sample surface. Two implant materials used for biohybrid construction, bovine pericardium and polycarbonate urethane, were inserted in the device and exposed to a flowing calcification medium for 14 days. Fluorescent fetuin-A was introduced into the calcification medium for real-time calcification monitoring. The two materials were compared with matched samples calcified in a large fatigue tester for 14 days. Our results showed similar material calcification for bovine pericardium and no calcification for polycarbonate urethane in the large fatigue tester and in our newly developed device. Biohybrid textile-reinforced fibrin-based scaffold populated with vascular smooth muscle cells started to calcify over 7 days in calcification medium. We conclude that this platform will provide novel insights into the origin and progression of pathological calcification and its potentially harmful health effects, which can occur as a result of tissue or metabolic abnormalities, disease, or implantation of certain biomaterials, by providing the ability to monitor the progression of calcification in biohybrid implants in real time, while also minimizing the cost and size of samples and reagents required for testing.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Existing virtual knockout methods estimate downstream effects of single-gene deletions but do not evaluate whether such perturbations disrupt global information flow or compromise cellular robustness. To address this limitation, we adapt a perturbation-response framework originally developed for protein structural dynamics to identify gene modules most susceptible to perturbation. We introduce the single-cell Perturbation Impact Index (scPII), a data-driven metric derived from gene regulatory networks that quantifies system-level responses to gene perturbations, without using any CRISPR screening information. Our results demonstrate that scPII effectively identifies genes whose perturbation has the greatest system-wide impact. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia revealed a strong correlation between scPII-derived gene impact scores and gene effect scores from genome-wide CRISPR screens.

While explicit adaptation is known to reduce sensorimotor confidence -- the perceived likelihood of successful action -- it is unclear whether implicit adaptation similarly affects confidence in sensorimotor judgments or motor awareness (knowledge of one's own limb position). To investigate this, participants made reaching movements to visual targets without seeing their hand. Cursor feedback followed an '' error-clamped '' trajectory: its radial position matched the hand, but its angular direction was fixed and independent of actual hand direction, a manipulation participants were told to ignore. The clamp direction varied sinusoidally over trials ({+/-} 10 {degrees} ; 12 cycles per session). Participants reported confidence by adjusting the size of an arc centered on the target or, in another task, centered on reported reach direction; larger arcs indicated lower confidence. Points were awarded when the arc encompassed the true reach direction, with fewer points for larger arcs, encouraging accurate and meaningful confidence reports. Fourier analysis of reach and report time series revealed a strong 12-cycle component in both, demonstrating robust implicit adaptation and corresponding changes in motor awareness.

Using RNA sequencing, we investigated changes in gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle of ten asymptomatic carriers of ALS mutations (8 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 2 SOD1 mutation carriers). We found that specific modifications of gene expression profiles are present in skeletal muscle before asymptomatic ALS gene carriers exhibit biomarker changes predictive of phenoconversion. We identified insulin signaling, AMPK signaling, and thermogenesis pathways, together with the TCA cycle as the main contributors to the dysregulated muscle transcriptome. Our data suggest that this metabolic reprogramming of skeletal muscle develops progressively during the transition to phenoconversion, characterized by a gradual increase in the expression of SREBF1 which encodes SREPB1, the key transcriptional regulator of lipid synthesis, in parallel with the progressive activation of AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. Our findings are consistent with a progressive enhancement in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, followed by a decline in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency as phenoconversion approaches.

This method, known as metagenomics, offers potential benefits for relative abundance estimates and epigenetic modifications, but is seldom applied to eukaryotic communities and eDNA. This study uses an expanded two-by-two design to compare fish species detection between multi-marker metabarcoding and metagenomics using two filter types (conventional versus high-flow). Environmental DNA was collected in a controlled setup and two field settings, which contained several fish species including European sturgeon (Acipenser sturio). Moreover, we explore methylation patterns obtained from nanopore native sequencing. All species present in the controlled environment were detected using both metabarcoding and metagenomics. In field settings, metagenomics detected more species than metabarcoding. High-flow filters recovered more species across all sequencing datasets, except in metabarcoding of field settings. Relative read counts between metabarcoding and metagenomics illustrate primer bias is present in the used primer sets. Most fish metagenomic sequences were identified as A. sturio across all eDNA samples.

Using a novel inducible knockin mouse model, we demonstrate that CCNY overexpression causes severe cachexia and profound hypoglycemia, resulting in death of adult mice independent of tumor burden. While these mutant mice maintain normal food intake and hepatic synthetic function, they succumb to metabolic starving state. Proteomics reveals that CCNY interacts with and stabilizes Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4), in agreement with defective pyruvate use at mitochondria and enforcing a Warburg-like shift to aerobic glycolysis.

Accordingly, CS serum activated the random migration of human neutrophils to a much greater extent than FBS, an effect attenuated by the BLT1 receptor antagonist CP 105,696. These findings highlight how bovine serum lipid composition is a major determinant modulating cellular responses and might thus impact experimental reproducibility.

A.; Thomas, R.; Sparago, E.; Wang, W.; Blower, M. D.", "abstract": "The SAF-A/HNRNPU gene encodes an abundant nuclear protein conserved throughout vertebrates, and is mutated in individuals with HNRNPU syndrome, a neurological human disease. SAF-A is important for maintaining lncRNA localization, splicing, and gene expression state. The mechanistic role of SAF-A in each of these processes is coordinated by one or more of its functional domains, which include an N-terminal SAP domain, a central ATPase domain, and a series of C-terminal RGG repeats embedded in a low-complexity region. The SAP domain and RGG repeats define two nucleic acid interaction domains, with both capable of binding DNA or RNA. Here we use an allelic reconstitution strategy to investigate the role of the SAF-A ATPase domain and RGG repeats. We show that both the ATPase and RGG repeats control SAF-A nuclear dynamics, and present genetic evidence that SAF-A interacts with nascent transcripts through the RGG repeats. The SAF-A ATPase domain and RGG repeats were also required for maintaining XIST RNA and facultative heterochromatin marks on the inactive X chromosome, with distinct effects of mutations that block ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis. Analysis of transcriptome datasets revealed that the SAF-A ATPase domain and RGG repeats are both required for proper mRNA splicing, but not for gene expression. Importantly, we found that like the SAP domain, the SAF-A ATPase domain and RGG repeats are required for cell proliferation. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of the SAF-A SAP, ATPase and RGG domains in essential functions of nuclear biology. These analyses will therefore inform our understanding of the disease state in HNRNPU syndrome.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Purpose: We demonstrate the application of HiP-CT in combination with the recently developed Eikonal Phase Retrieval (EPR) for resolving anatomical features in large hard and soft tissue structures on a sheep head, and show the applicability for zooming to resolve anatomical features with near-micron scale resolution. Materials and Methods: We imaged an entire skinned sheep head prepared in 70 % ethanol with HiP-CT at an isotropic voxel size of 16.5 m using the recently developed Eikonal Phase Retrieval (EPR) to reduce artefacts from bones. Local tomography zooms were taken in regions of interest: the eye (4.23 m voxels) and the coronal suture (2.20 m voxels). To compare to clinical imaging, we acquired T2-weighted MRI and CT of the sheep head and evaluated the contrast-to-noise ratio for differentiation of white and grey matter in the brain for all modalities. Further evaluations on HiP-CT images include structure tensor analysis for structural orientation in the brain as well as fibre tracking in the coronal suture. Results: HiP-CT combined with EPR achieved high contrast for both hard and soft tissue. Comparison to MRI showed similar soft-tissue contrast, but much higher spatial resolution. Structure tensor analysis in the brain revealed the orientation of the major white matter bundles. In the eye, near-micron scale features such as retinal layers and the bundles in the optic nerve were visualized. Fiber tracking allowed analysis of the orientation of collagen fiber bundles in the coronal suture. Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of HiP-CT to image a complete sheep head, ex vivo, and hierarchically zoom without sectioning to resolve few-microns features locally, enabling comprehensive three-dimensional visualization of intricate cranial structures and their spatial interrelations.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Large-scale initiatives, such as DepMap, have profiled cancer cell line responses to various drug treatments and gene knockouts, facilitating the development of computational models that predict sensitivity of cancer cells to different perturbations. Existing models utilize diverse methods for encoding perturbations, including various chemical fingerprints and types of gene-gene relationships. They also rely on different architectures and are often trained on distinct datasets. This variability makes it unclear which chemical, genetic, or cell line encoding is most informative for predicting cancer cell viability following perturbation treatment. To address this gap, we systematically evaluated various approaches to encode chemical and genetic perturbations and cell lines on the tasks of predicting cell viability and gene dependency. We found that for genetic perturbations, STRING- based encodings yield the highest performance, considerably outperforming GO-term and protein language model based encodings, which showed promising results in previous perturbation prediction studies. For chemical perturbations, while most encoders showed comparable performance, those pre-trained on other bio-assay data yielded the highest performance. Finally, we found that for cell line encodings, raw gene expression features outperformed more sophisticated approaches, such as transcriptomics foundation model embeddings, as well as genotype-based encodings.

Existing microarray imputation approaches, such as k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) or principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods, provide high accuracy but can be computationally intensive, while methods for whole-genome data are not designed for large cohorts. We developed slideimp, an R package that implements sliding window, groupable, parallelized K-NN and optimized PCA imputation to address these limitations. Results: Benchmarks on microarray DNAm datasets demonstrate that slideimp achieves up to 150x faster runtime and 10x-100x lower memory usage while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy over existing methods and implementations. For K-NN and PCA imputation, slideimp supports grouped imputation which enhances imputation efficiency and accuracy. In a whole-genome dataset, sliding window K-NN imputation substantially increased the correlation of the Horvath 2013 clock with chronological age from 0.131 to 0.477. Additional features include targeted imputation of CpG subsets for K-NN and estimation of imputation accuracy via repeated cross-validation. The efficient and flexible DNAm imputation methods implemented by slideimp can easily be applied to other high-dimensional data types.

However, studying rearrangements requires segmenting the genomes of interest into conserved regions, called synteny blocks, that highlight structural differences between genomes. Synteny blocks are typically defined from annotated genes or derived as a by-product of whole-genome alignments. As these procedures are heuristic and do not explicitly model rearrangements, they can obscure real variation, create false similarities, and affect phylogenetic inference. The importance of synteny block definition has long been recognized, as shown for example by discussions on breakpoint reuse, where different definitions of synteny blocks led to different estimates of rearrangement complexity in mammalian genomes. We present a formal framework for deriving synteny blocks directly from sequence data by partitioning genomic elements into blocks that do not contain breakpoints. A breakpoint is defined between a pair of genomes as an adjacency of shared elements that occurs in one genome but not in the other. Synteny blocks are therefore not allowed to span such boundaries, ensuring that rearrangements are not obscured. The framework is fully agnostic to the type of genomic element and applies to any genome representation expressed as sequences of elements, such as non-overlapping alignments, exact matches (MUMs/MEMs), k-mers, unitigs or minimizers. We formalize two optimization problems: minimizing the total genome length after replacement by synteny blocks (the Minimum-Length Synteny Block Problem) and minimizing the number of distinct blocks (the Minimum-Size Synteny Block Problem). We show that both problems are NP-hard in general. However, when blocks are required to be collinear and to contain a conserved element, we provide a linear time algorithm with respect to the number of input elements that simultaneously minimizes both objectives. The resulting method is simple, efficient, and produces large synteny blocks without obscuring rearrangements.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

In all cases, morphogenesis is powered by gradients in mechanical tension that arise downstream of signalling. Many pathways converge on RhoGTPases that modulate the cytoskeleton and cell contractility to control cell mechanics and, subsequently, shape changes. Despite their physiological importance, our understanding of how changes in signalling alter cortical mechanics to drive cell shape changes remains poor. Here, we use optogenetics to experimentally characterise the relationship between the amount of RhoGEF localised to the membrane, the downstream myosin recruitment, and the subsequent mechanical changes. We develop a predictive model of the temporal evolution of RhoGEF membrane localisation, cortical myosin enrichment, and cortical tension in response to a pulse of light. The increase of cortical myosin amount and the change in cortical tension both increased proportionally with the amount of membranous RhoGEF signalling. Using the characterisation of the mechanical changes induced by RhoGEF signalling, we show that the cellular shape changes induced by localised optogenetic recruitment of signalling proteins can be predicted with an active surface model of the cell cortex, directly linking gradients in signalling to shape change.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) remains a formidable clinical challenge because the leptomeningeal niche restricts drug penetration and immune surveillance. Current CNS-directed treatments rely on neurotoxic intrathecal chemotherapy, underscoring the urgent need for novel targeted strategies. Here, we uncover a profound niche-specific metabolic vulnerability in CNS-resident ALL cells, characterised by an obligate reliance on LRP8-mediated selenium uptake to sustain selenocysteine biosynthesis and GPX4 activity under profound glutathione limitation. We show that scarcity of thiols and cystine in CSF creates an inherently pro-ferroptotic microenvironment. Interference with selenocysteine biosynthesis under these conditions induces synthetic lethality in both in vitro and in vivo CNS-ALL models. This vulnerability is exploitable both by genetic targeting of the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway and, notably, through repurposing the FDA-approved agent Auranofin, which disrupts selenium utilisation, induces lipid peroxidation, and demonstrates CNS-specific anti-leukaemic efficacy with excellent tolerability in vivo.

This splice variant results in a 12 amino acid variation in peptide sequence. Breast cancer cells overexpress IR-A with an increased IR-A:IR-B ratio. Most of these data were obtained by examining mRNA expressions. In this work, we examined over 40 breast cancer cell lines and patient tumor samples for mRNA expression of the IR isoforms to show that most cells overexpressed IR-A compared to IR-B. Further we used mass spectrometry to demonstrate IR-A protein expression in the Du4475 cell line which has a high level of IR-A mRNA expression.

The CACNA1D variant, which encodes Cav1.3 L-type calcium channel is the focus of this study, because the C-terminus fragment of Cav1.3 has recently been identified as a transcription auto-enhancer of its own gene and able to prevent arrhythmic events in a mouse model of ischemic heart failure. Leveraging this intrinsic property, we hypothesized that the Cav1.3-C-terminus could reverse the arrhythmic events associated with the CACNA1D variant. Patch-clamp and optical mapping experiments demonstrated a loss of Cav1.3 function, characterized by reduced L-type calcium current densities, and decrease of conduction velocity, leading to inducible re-entrant arrhythmias in human induced pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). RNA sequencing confirmed this loss-of-function via the downregulation CACNA1D gene expression. Interestingly, Cav1.3-C-terminus treatment of hiPSC-CMs successfully normalized Cav1.3 gene expression, restored calcium currents, and conduction velocity, and prevented the susceptibility to arrhythmias.

While the screens identified multiple cellular processes--including RNA splicing, translation, and proteostasis--as modulators of TDP-43 phase states, our analyses underscore nuclear transport as a critical determinant of liquid-to-solid transitions. Inhibition of nuclear export prevents cytoplasmic accumulation of immobile TDP-43 assemblies, whereas enhanced export promotes irreversible, solid TDP-43 structures. We validated this mechanism in a brain organoid model of ALS, showing nuclear retention limits pathogenic aggregation and its associated defects. These findings establish nuclear export as a key regulator of TDP-43 phase transitions and define a mechanistic link between altered phase dynamics and neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Tumour burden tightly correlates with colitis disease severity suggesting elevated inflammatory tissue injury underlies tumour promotion in PKN2-targeted mice.

Identifying factors that differentiate regenerative and non-regenerative organisms could enable approaches for improving regenerative outcomes in non-regenerative species. Constitutive adult positional information can be required for regeneration, but has been poorly characterized across animal species. Here, we generated positional gene expression atlases for the limbs of one regenerative (axolotl) and one non-regenerative (mouse) vertebrate. Regional gene expression signatures in both species are highly overlapping and mirror multiple developmental positional information patterns, particularly along the primary limb axis. These expression signatures are largely harbored in connective tissue, including diverse fibroblast types, in both organisms. We also identified species-specific regional expression patterns, including for Proxima, a novel gene encoding a secreted factor with strong positional expression in axolotl. Positional gene expression similar to developmental patterns also exists between fore and hindlimbs and along anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral limb axes, but is notably stronger in axolotl than in mouse. Our results demonstrate that regenerative and non-regenerative vertebrate limbs share many, but not all, signatures of positional information.

While many studies have investigated DNA methylation as a response to a stressor at a single timepoint, less well-understood is how methylation may encode memory of past environments and influence the response to current environments (i.e., carryover effects). Oysters are an excellent natural system to study carryover effects due to their sessile nature, which may expose them to increased environmental variability. To better understand how methylation changes in response to a previous exposure of environmental stress, we conducted a fully factorial experiment exposing juvenile oysters to either control or hypoxic conditions at two timepoints separated by 60 days. After the second exposure, whole body tissue samples were collected and processed for methylRAD sequencing. Regardless of treatment, methylation was mostly found in exons. We found both the first and second exposure treatments contributed significantly to the observed variation in gene body methylation. Interestingly, oysters that were first exposed to hypoxia and later exposed to control conditions had methylation patterns that differed the most from any other condition. We found that differentially methylated genes identified in pairwise comparisons were mainly involved in the oxidative stress response, metabolism, and transcription. Together, these findings suggest that early life environments have a lasting impact on the epigenome and that the timing of stress elicits unique response strategies, which highlights potential targets of resilience for oysters.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

A unique molecular signature associated with these genes allows the prediction of the outcome of infection with great accuracy making the interaction Rps-Avr central to reduce disease incidence. In this study, we reassessed the identity of the avirulence gene whose protein product is recognized by Rps6. Following extensive soil sampling and single-spore isolation of a large population of P. sojae, we found two salient isolates carrying a rare recombination between two effectors, Avr3c and Avr4/6. Using a PCR assay and molecular markers, we showed that only alleles at the Avr3c locus were in perfect association with the phenotypes of the isolates. Furthermore, whole-genome resequencing and de novo assembly of the two isolates revealed the full extent of this genomic rearrangement. These results bring to light an unsuspected connection between Avr3c and Rps6 and offer a more reliable target for the pathotyping of P. sojae, which ultimately leads to a better use of resistant soybean material.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

While the molecular pathways regulating photoperiodic flowering are well-characterised in Arabidopsis and cereals, they remain poorly understood in many other groups of plants. FLOWERINGLOCUST (FT) genes are key components regulating the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages. In the legume Medicagotruncatula, a forage crop, six FT orthologs are present. To date, only the role of MtFTa1 has been described, promoting flowering after prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization), while the other five remains unclear.

MtFTb1 and MtFTb2 genes act redundantly and are required to up-regulate MtFTa1 under vernalised LD conditions. While Mtftb1 mutants flower normally under short-day (SD) and LD conditions, Mtftb1/2 mutants are delayed specifically under LD but retain a vernalization response. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and Mtftb1/2 mutants shows MtFTb1/2 are essential for MADS-box gene upregulation and modulate known and candidate flowering regulators under LD.

Here, we examine the molecular evolutionary history of the RAR1-SGT1 interaction across land plants. We identified a lineage-specific divergence of the RAR1-SGT1 binding interface in vascular non-seed ferns, which renders orthologs unable to interact outside of their lineage. Further investigation of interface diversity uncovered a single amino acid residue in RAR1 and three corresponding residues in SGT1 that dictate binding specificity. Ancestral state reconstruction supported stepwise evolution of specificity in SGT1 in leptopsporangiate ferns, which was initiated by a promiscuous intermediate state that widened its capacity to bind RAR1 before subsequent mutations locked in specificity.

In this study, we investigated how shoot traits that enhance transpiration influence root hydraulic properties, using the Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant epf1 epf2, characterized by high stomatal density and increased transpiration. Methods: Plant lines epf1 epf2 and Col-0 (wild type) were grown hydroponically and compared for stomatal traits, rate of water loss, leaf and root water relations, aquaporin expression, and root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr). Then, to assess responses to water deficit, osmotic stress was induced by adding 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the nutrient solution seven days before measurements. Key results: The epf1 epf2 double mutant exhibited ~150% higher stomatal density, yet stomatal conductance and short-term rosette water loss increased by only ~30% relative to wild type. Despite higher water loss, the mutant maintained its leaf relative water content, concomitant with a more negative leaf osmotic potential; root osmotic potential was similar between genotypes. epf1 epf2 showed lower Lpr than Col-0. Aquaporin transcript levels and the relative aquaporin contribution to root water transport did not differ between genotypes. Under osmotic stress, Col-0 instead showed lower Lpr than epf1 epf2, again without changes in aquaporin expression or relative contribution. Conclusions: Our results highlight an active contribution of the root as a modulator of the whole-plant hydraulic balance. Across scenarios where xylem tension was expected to increase, stomatal aperture and Lpr decreased. We suggest that enhanced transpiration elevates xylem tension, which acts as a long-distance cue, eliciting coordinated reductions in stomatal aperture and Lpr, thereby constraining water flux.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Indeed, water deficit has a negative impact on grapevine growth and yield but also impacts fruit and wine quality. To improve grapevine resilience to drought, developing strategies such as symbiosis with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi could be a promising. We focused on the benefit of using Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 for improving performances in controlled conditions of two highly used rootstocks (41B and SO4) under moderate to severe water deficit. At a field capacity of 14-40%, SO4 was more affected compared to 41B. Successful functional symbiosis was obtained for the two rootstocks, both in well-watered and water deficit conditions. Interestingly, colonization with R. irregularis improved growth and photosynthetic parameters in both 41B and SO4, especially under water stress, restoring them to the levels on non-stressed plants. Further analysis of mineral nutrition and aquaporin expression revealed contrasting responses between the two rootstocks. Whereas mycorrhization strongly enhanced phosphorus contents in both 41B and SO4 roots and leaves, the overall beneficial effects of the symbiosis on mineral nutrition were more pronounced in SO4. In contrast, the expression of VvPIP2.1, a highly water-permeable aquaporin involved in root hydraulic conductivity was increased in mycorrhized roots of 41B but repressed in SO4.

However, the contribution of integrated stomatal anatomy and physiology to wheat heat tolerance remains poorly understood, particularly under realistic field conditions and across divers germplasm. This study explored the role of stomatal anatomical and physiological traits in shaping wheat responses to heat stress. Across two years of multi-environment field trials encompassing 200 genotypes in season 1 and 50 genotypes in season 2, we examined stomatal conductance (g), anatomical traits including stomatal size and density, and the stomatal conductance operating efficiency (gse) across leaf surfaces, along with grain yield. Timely and delayed sowing treatments were used to expose key developmental stages (anthesis) to contrasting temperature regimes. Early sowing supported higher gs and gse, while delayed sowing impaired stomatal function despite similar theoretical anatomical capacity (gsmax), revealing a decoupling of structural potential and physiological performance under stress. The adaxial surface consistently exhibited higher gs, stomatal density, and gsmax than the abaxial surface, highlighting its dominant role in leaf gas exchange. Later sowing induced plastic shifts in anatomy, including smaller, denser stomata, particularly on the adaxial surface, suggesting an adaptive response to thermal stress. Significant genotypic variation was observed for g, gse, gsmax, and stomatal anatomical traits, with moderate heritability indicating genetic control. 125 putative QTL were identified for multiple stomatal traits across environments, including several stable loci on chromosomes 2B and 5B, and numerous closely clustered QTL for anatomical traits on chromosome 7B, highlighting key genomic regions underlying stomatal anatomy. In contrast, QTL for g and gse were fewer and season-specific, highlighting the environmentally sensitive nature of physiological stomatal regulation. 42 of the QTL identified were consistent with previously reported QTL for stomatal traits in wheat. Together, these findings elevate the role of stomatal traits, supporting an integrated breeding strategy that combines selection for favourable stomatal anatomy with efficiency physiological regulation.

In HRLC, ectopic expression of SymRK, or deregulated, auto-active versions of CCaMK and Cyclops stimulated LR formation in a NIN-dependent manner, but spontaneous RN were never observed. It appears that the previously described spontaneous RN formation induced by these versions requires the presence of the shoot. Interestingly, CCaMKT265D increased LR number in a cyclops mutant, revealing the presence of additional CCaMK targets mediating LR formation. Constitutive and ectopic expression of NIN under the ubiquitin promoter resulted in a significant increase in LR number. We compared the responsiveness of two Rosaceae that have either retained NIN (Dryas drummondii) or lost it (Fragaria vesca) to stimulation with the constitutively active variant CCaMK1-314. Intriguingly, CCaMK1-314 was able to increase LR formation in Dryas but not in Fragaria, pointing to consequences of the evolutionary loss of NIN on root architecture. Taken together our data provide evidence for NIN as a molecular link between symbiosis-signaling and LR formation. Non-inoculated nsp1 and nsp2 mutant plants as well as HRLC of these mutants exhibited increased LR densities that were no further increased by expression of CCaMK1-314.

Here, we report evidence of maternal care in the plant kingdom using Chlorophytum comosum as a model system. Biochemical and physiological analyses were conducted on mother (MRs) and daughter ramets (DRs) of C. comosum across four distinct developmental stages of the DRs (S1 to S4), ranging from the juvenile stage (S1) to the fully photoautotrophic stage (S4). It was observed that, during the progressive development stages, DRs first develop their photosynthetic potential, followed by the subsequent development of water and mineral uptake capacity. Biochemical and anatomical studies highlighted that stolon acts as a vital life-support conduit, analogous to a placenta, facilitating the translocation of nutrients and water from MRs to DRs. In the present study, the dynamics of sucrose-phosphate synthase, acid invertase, and starch concentrations in MRs and DRs clearly reveal metabolic communication between MRs and DRs and demonstrated the biochemical basis of maternal care in C. comosum. The findings further supported by the stolon severance experiment, in which detached DRs at stage S1 exhibited a 0% survival rate, which increased progressively with developmental stage and reached 100% survival at stage S4. At this stage, when DRs attain full independence, all biological communication between MRs and DRs was terminated. Although DRs achieved full autonomy by Stage S4, MRs maintain stolon-mediated physical connections for approximately two additional weeks, with gradual deterioration at Stage S5 and complete disconnection occurring naturally at Stage S6, indicating post-establishment maternal care. Chlorophyll fluorescence and stolon anatomical analyses during root-prevention and drought-induction experiments revealed that stolon connectivity is maintained when DRs fail to establish roots at Stage S3 or experience drought stress at Stage S4. Under these conditions, MRs continued to provide physiological support via the stolon until successful establishment. Together, these findings demonstrated that C. comosum exhibits maternal care until establishment is assured, thereby enhancing survival under environmental stress, and open new avenues for investigating the plant neurobiology and molecular communication underlying maternal care.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We used a common garden containing 46 Vitis vinifera (grapevine) cultivars to test the hypothesis that differences in grapevine susceptibility to esca (a complex vascular disease leading to dieback) result from cultivar-specific interactions between leaf gas exchange, and the anatomical structure, metabolism and microbiome of stem wood. Cultivars with better water use and conservation strategies tended to be less susceptible to esca whereas xylem anatomy did not affect esca susceptibility. Symptomatic plants displayed decreases in leaf gas exchange, stem starch storage and theoretical hydraulic conductivity in response to esca, regardless of genotype, whereas microbial communities were unaffected. Symptomatic stems accumulated more secondary metabolites (mostly glycosylated flavonoids and terpenes) in highly susceptible than in weakly susceptible genotypes. Cultivar-specific physiological traits therefore shape esca susceptibility in grapevines and defence metabolites transported in the xylem may play a key role in the onset of leaf symptoms. Integrative studies unravelling plant-microorganism-environment interactions are crucial to improve our understanding of complex plant diseases.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Comparisons across different EPN types and optimization of their different features have been difficult, as assays for their activity have not been reported for single, active units. As we were interested in optimizing EVs, we first developed a biological titration assay inspired by the methods used for infectious viral particles. With this assay, we optimized EVs using a modular platform, creating EVs composed predominantly of human-derived protein components. This system achieved efficient RNA delivery, with functional titers comparable to those of lentiviral vectors. The optimized chimeric proteins comprising the EV particles integrate domains from human epsin 1, human citramalyl-CoA lyase beta-like protein (CLYBL), and human CEP55.

P.", "abstract": "Background Intrinsic lymphatic contractility is essential for tissue fluid balance, immunity and organ function, yet no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments specifically restore lymphatic contractility. Lymph is returned to the circulation by ion channel-driven cyclic contractions of collecting lymphatic vessels. Although voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels drive cardiomyocyte excitability, their role in lymphatic muscle cell (LMC) physiology is not well defined. We identified NaV1.3, a NaV channel historically viewed as developmentally restricted and limited in adult tissues, as unexpectedly and selectively expressed in adult lymphatic muscle but absent from heart, vascular smooth muscle, and mature brain. We tested whether selective NaV1.3 activation restores impaired lymphatic pumping in aging and radiation injury. Methods NaV1.3 expression in LMCs was confirmed through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and immunostaining of mouse and human lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic contractility was quantified by in vivo fluorescence lymphangiography and interstitial fluid clearance was measured with a new bioluminescence assay. NaV1.3 function was assessed in young, aged, and radiation-injured mice. NaV1.3 knockout (Scn3a-/-) mice established the requirement of NaV1.3 for basal lymphatic excitability and responsiveness to the NaV1.3-specific activator, Tf2. Results In mouse and human lymphatic vessels, NaV1.3 is expressed in adult LMCs. Although dispensable for basal lymphatic contractions, NaV1.3 acted as a pharmacologically recruitable reserve that amplified contractile output. Acute NaV1.3 activation with Tf2 increased lymphangion ejection fraction and accelerated interstitial fluid clearance. Tf2 fully restored lymphatic pumping in aged mice and partially rescued radiation-induced contractile deficits. All Tf2 responses were abolished in Scn3a-/- mice, confirming NaV1.3 dependence. Conclusions NaV1.3 is a selectively druggable ion channel in adult lymphatic muscle that can be recruited to restore lymphatic pump function across aging and injury. Targeted NaV1.3 activation provides a molecular entry point for treating diseases characterized by lymphatic pump failure, a domain with no existing pharmacologic therapies.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We identify the in vivo branch point sequences bound by AtSF1 and delineate its RNA- binding landscape, revealing pervasive splicing defects dominated by aberrant 3' splice site selection. Structural comparison with human SF1 indicates that AtSF1 retains branch point recognition capacity but features a distinct domain organization, including a restructured C-terminal region absent in metazoans, suggesting a divergent RNA-binding mode that evolved to meet plant-specific splicing demands. AtSF1 targets are enriched for core circadian clock and defense genes, consistent with the long-period phenotype and immune-compromised phenotypes of sf1 mutants.

J.; Napolitano, C.; Hidalgo-Hermoso, E.; Tarlinton, R. E.", "abstract": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is distributed worldwide among domestic cats and non-domestic felids. Frequent spillover events from domestic cats to wild felids have resulted in fatal disease in individual animals and outbreaks in free-ranging populations. Domestic cats carry both endogenous FeLV (enFeLV; proviral copies of the virus in the cat genome) and exogenous variants of FeLV (exFeLV). These can recombine, producing variants with recombinant envelope genes and altered receptor usage, while non-domestic felid species, except for wildcats (Felis silvestris), do not have endogenous FeLV. This study applied amplification of the FeLV envelope gene combined with Illumina sequencing of PCR products to determine the envelope gene diversity and transmission dynamics of FeLV variants in a non-domestic species, guigna (Leopardus guigna), a small felid native to Chile and Argentina. Seven PCR amplicons from five free ranging guignas were sequenced. The Illumina contigs confirmed that the origin of infection was from Chilean domestic cats. However, a distinct guigna cluster was identified, characterised by unique variations that differentiate it from domestic cat sequences and may indicate that transmission is also occurring between guigna independent of domestic cats. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that all guigna sequences group within a Chile-specific FeLV clade, closely related to Chilean domestic cats but clearly distinct from international FeLV-A strains. We detected 96 intra-host variants across 43 genomic sites, 64 of which were non-synonymous, including one that resulted in a premature stop codon. Some of these have previously been reported in both domestic and non-domestic species from other regions. Additionally, intrahost variation analysis revealed greater genetic diversity and a higher number of non-synonymous mutations across the env gene in guigna. Unlike the variation patterns typically observed in domestic cats, where mutations in the env gene are predominantly located in the SU region, particularly within the receptor binding domain (RBD), here, a substantial proportion of mutations in guignas were found in the TM region. The pattern of mutations, with predominance of G to A transition (62.6%), strongly suggests an influence of the APOBEC-mediated hypermutation, antiviral immune system, on guigna isolates. Although FeLV-B primers produced amplicons, no genuine FeLV-B sequences were detected, consistent with amplification of FeLV-A templates due to primer cross-reactivity. The absence of large deletions or recombination signatures also indicates that only FeLV-A like strains are currently circulating in guignas. Our findings provide evidence of intra-species transmission within guigna populations, demonstrated using Illumina sequencing, a method not commonly applied in this context. Thus, this study offers a novel perspective on the disease dynamics of transmission between domestic and non-domestic felids.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Poor in vivo drug efficacy may stem from altered vulnerability of drug targets driven by host-specific environmental conditions. To enable validation and prioritization of candidate drug targets in vivo, we exploited CRISPRi (CRi) gene silencing in multiple mouse infection models. Inducible silencing of ftsZMab, a previously validated target, and three predicted targets (leuSMab, folPMab, fusAMab) confirmed their essentiality in vitro. We then assessed the in vivo vulnerability of these targets in both immunocompetent C57BL/6N and immunodeficient NSG mice by assessing the impact of CRi silencing on pulmonary mycobacterial burden. In NSG mice, silencing of all four genes led to comparable decreases in Mab burden. However, in C57BL/6N mice, the degree of Mab clearance varied among targets, suggesting that immune pressure may influence the outcome of CRi-mediated gene silencing. Notably, repression of fusAMab yielded a larger decline in mycobacterial burden in C57BL/6N mice despite a lower level of gene silencing in vitro, consistent with enhanced vulnerability of this target. Overall, this study demonstrated that ftsZMab, leuSMab, folPMab, and fusAMab are essential for Mab growth in vitro and, for the first time, validated their vulnerability to inhibition by CRi during infection. These data also identified potential context-dependent target vulnerabilities, which could inform the prioritization of bacterial drug targets and accelerate the development of effective therapeutics for Mab infections.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Rapid viral evolution makes current treatments less effective, highlighting the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Targeting host factors essential for viral replication may offer a highly promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. In this context, cereblon (CRBN), a substrate adaptor of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is found to promote both IAV and IBV replication as a key pro-viral host factor. Mechanistically, CRBN targets and degrades AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via the proteasome. This CRBN-driven degradation shifts the metabolism of the infected cells toward anabolism, promoting lipid droplet (LD) formation and creating a microenvironment favorable for viral replication. Genetic depletion or inhibition of CRBN stabilizes AMPK, significantly reduces LD formation, and effectively suppresses the replication of various IAV and IBV strains in vivo, demonstrating its broad-spectrum potential. Notably, Crbn knockout mice show marked resistance to lethal IAV infection. CRBN inhibition with immunomodulatory imide drugs--known CRBN inhibitors--significantly decreases IAV replication in vivo.

During persister formation, intact motility functions as an immediate behavioral defense that decreases intracellular bactericidal antibiotic concentrations to ensure survival. This initial behavioral defense provides critical time for transcriptional reprogramming in persisters, which, by downregulating the major outer membrane porins (OmpC & OmpF) that facilitate antibiotic influx, supplants the preceding motility-based strategy. Subsequently, in structurally fortified persisters, motility becomes dispensable and gradually diminishes - a process independent of cell bioenergetic profile - yet re-emerges as essential for timely resuscitation upon antibiotic removal.

By tracking bacterial growth and phage production over time, we uncover divergent, environment-dependent adaptive strategies among lysogens. Some populations evolve dramatically increased phage production, with titers rising over 1,000-fold, whereas in environments where phages impose strong fitness costs, prophages are either purged or domesticated. Across all evolved populations, adaptation is accompanied by defects in cellular segmentation arising from mutations in the divisome and Tat translocation pathways.

In most model and pathogenic yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, core septin subunits such as Cdc3 and Cdc12 are essential and their loss results in lethal cytokinetic defects. In Cryptococcus neoformans, by contrast, deletion of CDC12 yields viable cells that grow normally under permissive conditions, raising the question of how this pathogen maintains cell integrity without a functional septin complex. To address this, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type cells and a cdc12{Delta} mutant. The cdc12{Delta} strain showed a focused set of transcriptional changes, with induction of genes involved in cell wall remodeling, stress-dependent morphogenetic programs, and pathways that promote fitness under compromised cytoskeletal conditions. Genetic analysis of the most highly induced genes uncovered factors that contribute to proliferation in the absence of Cdc12, including a previously uncharacterized aspartic-type endopeptidase that becomes essential when septin function is lost. These findings outline the compensatory circuitry that permits septin-independent growth in C. neoformans and help explain why this pathogen can tolerate septin loss.

To test this, two legumes (Vicia faba L., i.e. faba bean, and Pisum sativum L., i.e., yellow pea) were grown in two fields in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada.

To investigate how repeated asymptomatic colonization shapes immunity and influences bacterial traits, we developed the Repeated Asymptomatic Murine Pneumococcal Colonization (RAMPC3) model using strains belonging to serotypes: 2 (D39), 3 (WU2), and 4 (TIGR4). Sequential colonization revealed strain- and exposure-order-dependent effects on bacterial burden, with initial colonization yielding robust carriage and subsequent exposures resulting in diminished burden and rapid clearance. Humoral profiling demonstrated antigenic imprinting: the first colonizing strain largely determined IgG and IgA specificity, with minimal diversification after repeated exposures. Reactivity was strongest for biofilm-associated antigens correlating with each strains biofilm-forming capacity. Using TIGR4 mutants deficient in biofilm formation, we confirmed that in vivo aggregate formation drives humoral responses. Human sera from naturally colonized adults mirrored these findings, favoring biofilm antigens independent from capsule. Protection was demonstrated as triple-colonized mice exhibited reduced mortality and bacteremia following pneumococcal pneumonia challenge. Moreover, the initial colonizing strain influenced protection against heterologous infection, underscoring the lasting imprint of the biofilm phenotype on immunity. Finally, IgA responses in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue paralleled serum IgA patterns, validating systemic measurements as a proxy for mucosal immunity. Collectively, these results reveal that biofilm formation during colonization is a key determinant of humoral immunity and protection, providing insight into pneumococcal biology and informing strategies to design next-generation interventions.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Among these, dihydrouridine is a conserved tRNA modification synthesized by the flavin-dependent enzymes DusA, DusB, and DusC, which introduces flexibility at defined uridine positions in the D-loop. While structural and biochemical studies in Escherichia coli have clarified Dus enzymes substrate specificities, their functional relevance in other bacterial pathogens remains uncharacterized. Here, we present the first functional characterization of the contribution of Dus enzymes to an important urinary tract pathogen, Proteus mirabilis. Insertional mutants were generated in dusA, dusB, and dusC in P. mirabilis strain HI4320 for evaluation of virulence-relevant phenotypes. All mutants grew similarly to wild-type under multiple culture conditions, although loss of dusB caused a fitness defect during growth in human urine. Disruption of dusB also resulted in increased biofilm biomass, impaired swimming motility, enhanced outer membrane permeability, and increased susceptibility to detergents and certain antibiotics, while disruption of dusA or dusC only impacted biofilm formation and susceptibility to detergents. In a murine model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, dusB was also critical for fitness in all organs during co-challenge against wild-type as well as overall colonization and ascending infection during independent challenge. In contrast, dusC did not contribute to fitness and dusA showed a modest, compartment-specific contribution to fitness, as the dusA::Kan mutant was outcompeted in the bladder. Together, these findings identify DusB as a key regulator of motility, membrane integrity, and host fitness in P. mirabilis, linking tRNA modification to virulence.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

The bacterial enzymatic pathways involved in epiT formation have been reported, where the desF gene that encodes 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts AD to epiT using NADPH as a cofactor. In this study, we quantitatively characterized DesF kinetic parameters and substrate specificity.

We demonstrated that Mtb Ku and shows limited translocation on DNA and primarily instead stays bound at the DNA ends. The reconstitution of an active Mtb NHEJ machinery, consisting of Ku and LigD, allowed us to characterize the dynamics of each step of the assembly of the Mtb NHEJ machinery at the single molecule level, revealing competition between Ku and LigD for DNA binding. In silico investigations highlighted key residues in Mtb LigD-Ku complex formation. We conducted a mutational analysis of these residues in the polymerase and the ligase domains, respectively. This investigation demonstrated that, although formation of the NHEJ complex is preserved in LigD mutants, mutations in the polymerase domain result in reduced enzymatic activity, whereas mutations in the ligase domain led to its enhancement.

Here we sought to comprehensively profile MOPRs on islets to assess how their activity shapes cellular physiology and secretion. First, we used RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and immunoblotting approaches to map islet expression. We observed robust expression of MOPR across multiple cell types in islets. Next, using a FRET-based approach, we show that MOPRs recruit canonical inhibitory pathways, reducing cAMP accumulation. Correspondingly, islets from constitutive MOPR knockout mice showed increased calcium influx and oscillations. However, MOPR knockout had no effect on insulin secretion, instead increase glucagon secretion. Surprisingly, while MOPR antagonism increased overall calcium, it reduced calcium oscillations and suppressed insulin secretion. By contrast MOPR agonism suppressed calcium, increased oscillations, and had no effect on overall hormone secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that MOPR can profoundly shape islet activity, with these effects likely driven by their actions on distinct cell types.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We find that mole-rat brain physiology impacts survival after surgeries, with higher carbon dioxide concentrations required for recovery compared to other rodents, likely due to a mutation in the chloride-potassium symporter KCC2. Having addressed these challenges through our optimized methodology, we used tetrodes and Neuropixels probes to record single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) across several cortical and subcortical regions for several weeks. We observed single units responsive to auditory and visual stimuli in the superior colliculus, and hippocampal recordings in freely moving mole-rats revealed prominent theta rhythms at frequencies lower than those observed in any other rodent species to date. Finally, we performed integrated three-dimensional and two-dimensional probe-track analysis within the same brain using tissue clearing, light sheet imaging, rehydration, and vibratome sectioning, and we present a newly developed stereotaxic brain atlas for implantation and histological alignment.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying these phenomena, particularly because of its robust and ethologically conserved social behaviors. Unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) produces behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in zebrafish that parallel core features of human anxiety and depressive disorders; however, its impact on social outcomes remains unclear. Here, we examined whether a 14-day UCS protocol alters social behavior in adult zebrafish using two complementary assays: the social preference test and the shoal cohesion test. Across two independent experiments, UCS did not elicit detectable changes in individual social approach or group-level cohesion. In contrast, UCS induced clear anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, validating the stress manipulation, with stressed fish displaying reduced vertical exploration and decreased time in the upper zone. Shoal cohesion measures showed a time-dependent decrease in both groups, consistent with habituation to the testing environment rather than a stress-specific effect. Together, these results suggest that social behavior in adult zebrafish is relatively resilient to UCS under the conditions tested, whereas anxiety-like responses are markedly affected. Future work should investigate whether factors such as stressor intensity, developmental stage, sex composition, or social hierarchy modulate the sensitivity of social behavior to chronic stress.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Hence, variant adaptation includes diminished induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISG) and/or evasion of their effector functions. Exogenous IFN treatment rewires innate responses to drive virus elimination, yet therapeutic trials to date have been unremarkable. Resolving this paradox could translate to variant-agnostic innate immunotherapy. By contrast, oncolytic viruses (OV) exhibit profoundly attenuated innate antagonism, resulting in potent IFN responses despite the inherently immunosuppressive nature of tumour microenvironments. Moreover, OV only undergo lytic replication within innate-deficient malignant cells, and not in cells where sufficient innate responses exist. This, combined with previous studies showing that OV suppressed replication of underlying oncogenic viruses in tumours, we explored whether clinical grade oncolytic Orthoreovirus (Reo) superinfection could eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from immune-competent lung epithelial cell lines in the absence of toxicity. Reo exerted profound activation of innate responses, including when SARS-CoV- 2 infection was already established, rewiring cells towards an antiviral state emulating that of Reo infection alone. Both intracellular and paracrine mechanisms induced ISG repertoires including multiple known anti-SARS-CoV-2 effectors, as well as others that remain unvalidated. Amongst these, we demonstrate the first direct evidence that MX2 and XAF1 restrict SARS- CoV-2 replication.

In this work, we optimized a bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BONCAT-FACS) workflow for low-biomass deep-biosphere sediments obtained during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 (IODP 385). BONCAT-FACS with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing as well as metagenomics of sediment communities was applied to characterize translationally active communities in hydrothermally altered subsurface sediments of the Guaymas Basin. Our results revealed a heterotrophic microbial population throughout all sediments examined, with taxa translationally active down to our deepest sampling point, 154 meters below the seafloor. Based on 16S rRNA gene identities, the translationally active microbial community was dominated by heterotrophic members of the Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Deinococci, and Alphaproteobacteria. These taxa are likely key contributors to cycling the large quantities of hydrothermally altered organic matter in Guaymas Basin sediments. To further elucidate the metabolic capacity of active taxa, we mapped 16S rRNA gene amplicons to metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) previously obtained from IODP 385.

Current enzymatic remodeling methods are limited in scope, producing only a narrow spectrum of glycoforms and struggling to achieve complete control over the synthesis of defined asymmetrical structures, which are often critical for enhanced mAb efficacy. We report a multi-step, fully enzymatic platform for the solution-phase synthesis of a comprehensive library of biantennary mAb glycoforms with complete control over the 1,3- and 1,6-mannose arm architecture. The strategy relies on two key catalytic steps: the use of the single domain of the {beta}-N-acetylglucosaminidase StrH (GH20-2) to achieve the regioselective hydrolysis of the GlcNAc residue on the 1,3-mannose arm of the intact antibody, thereby introducing asymmetry; and exploiting the intrinsic, broad acceptor flexibility of GnT-I to reinstall the 1,3-mannose arm GlcNAc even after the 1,6-mannose arm has been selectively extended and terminally capped with Neu5Ac or the -gal epitope. This robust, two-stage enzymatic remodeling methodology, demonstrated on infliximab and cetuximab, unlocks the complete chemical space of biantennary Fc-glycans for comprehensive, functional studies. We employed these well-defined glycovariants to determine the minimum structural requirements for anti--gal IgE binding and systematically evaluate binding affinities toward Fc{gamma}Rs, providing essential insights for the rational design of next-generation immunotherapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Recent developments in Ultrasound Contrast Agent (UCA, also known as microbubble) technology have provided novel opportunities to enhance targeted therapeutic delivery. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach of leveraging microbubbles to enhance immune cell targeting by directly attaching microbubbles to immune cells, enabling the targeted delivery and localization of immune cells into solid tumors using radiation force ultrasound (US) application. To create novel microbubble-immune cell conjugates, we created polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated microbubbles and attached them to differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells. These positively charged PEI microbubbles were formulated using azide-DBCO click chemistry between DBCO-labeled microbubbles and the azide functional groups on the PEI polymer. Following this step, we utilized electrostatic interactions to attach our positively charged PEI microbubbles to our negatively charged dHL-60 cells. We conducted viability experiments to assess the compatibility of these designs and verified that cell viability remained greater than 88% four hours after the conjugation process for different ratios of dHL-60 cells to PEI microbubbles. We used microfluidic chemotaxis platforms to quantify the microbubble-conjugated dHL-60 cell migratory behavior, examining parameters including migration velocity and percentage. Additionally, we investigated the impact of ultrasound power on primary human neutrophils to validate the functional responsiveness of these physiologically relevant immune cells. Here we demonstrated the possibility of ultrasound-responsive immune cell constructs as a targeted strategy without loss of function in migration capabilities. The novel PEI microbubble and immune cell conjugates reported in this work will be used to improve future immunotherapy techniques.

The rapid growth in accessible system sizes and timescales has intensified the need for efficient post-processing methods that extract meaningful insights from the resulting data. Interaction fingerprint (IFP) analyses are a valuable tool for elucidating key atomic interactions within molecular ensembles, yet current specialized software often struggle with extensive trajectories or complex systems. Here, we introduce InterMap, a Python package designed to accelerate IFP detection on large-scale molecular ensembles. By actively exploiting k-d trees, InterMap efficiently handles the massive amount of distance calculations necessary to detect IFPs, particularly when dealing with intra-molecular interactions. The seamless integration with MDAnalysis ensures broad format compatibility and allows using SMARTS patterns for flexible interaction definitions. InterMap adopts a deeply compressed binary encoding to manage IFPs, which makes it very memory-friendly. Furthermore, convenient interactive visualizations are provided to enhance data interpretation through a locally hosted web-browser application. Benchmark results indicate that InterMap significantly outperforms existing tools for processing complex biomolecular systems, achieving up to a 99% reduction in both runtime and peak memory usage.

C.; Berry, J. A.; Sandoval, I. C.", "abstract": "Retrograde memory loss, the inability to recall events preceding amnesia onset, is a well-documented consequence of anesthesia. Recent discoveries, pioneered by Drosophila research, have challenged the view that forgetting is a passive process, and have demonstrated that rather it is a highly active, well-regulated biological process. This work builds on this and makes a remarkable and unexpected discovery that anesthesia itself triggers a robust, widespread burst of activity in dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Here, we report that both cold-shock and CO2 anesthesia elicits strong activation in PAM and PPL1 DAN populations. This calcium activity is accompanied by robust synaptic release of dopamine. Strikingly, pharmacological experiments show that this response is input-driven, as it is completely abolished by Na+ channel blockers and dampened by nAChR antagonists. Using behavioral methods, crucially, we show that anesthesia-induced amnesia can be prevented by blocking activity in PAM and PPL1 neurons during anesthesia. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized active mechanism by which anesthesia induces forgetting, mediated by rapid dopaminergic signaling. This paradigm-shifting discovery redefines how we think about anesthesia-induced amnesia and the biology of forgetting.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

The rule that most species are relatively rare and few are common has been of central importance to many branches of ecology. This rule also implies that just a few species make up the majority of plant biomass in ecosystems. Focussing plant trait research on the most common species in a region could be useful for many applications, including understanding macroscale patterns of species assemblages at the continental scale, identifying strategies of abundant species or estimating landscape-scale fluxes of carbon and water. 2. Here, we rank species based on their total cover across an entire continental region - Eastern and Central Australia - and report the extent of trait coverage in terms of vegetation cover. To calculate species abundance and trait coverage, we used ~100,000 vegetation plots from the Harmonised Australian Vegetation plot database overlaid across Australia's vegetation classification scheme (the National Vegetation Information System), and we extracted traits from AusTraits, the most comprehensive regional trait database. 3. Just 113 plant species (<1% of species found in the region) or the combined species of 16 genera make up 50% of the entire vegetation; approximately 10% of species or the combined species from 10% of the genera (1132 species and 140 genera) make up 90% of vegetation cover. Plant trait coverage tended to be higher when expressed as a proportion of vegetation cover than as a proportion of species in the most common woody genera Acacia and Eucalyptus. Gaps in the trait coverage of very common species were obvious, particularly among the grasses of central Australia. Expressing trait coverage weighted by abundance revealed that only a few additional trait measurements of the most common species and genera would be needed to characterise the traits of most of the vegetation in this part of the continent. 4. Synthesis: Our results show that a small fraction of species dominates most of the continent. This means that strategic sampling of a few common yet unsampled species could dramatically boost trait coverage and help address the Raunkiaeran shortfall of traits. Targeting these species would substantially improve ecosystem flux estimates and understanding of successful plant strategies at continental scales, with major benefits for vegetation modelling.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Mapk1 mutant mice successfully modeled key aspects of the human MRR phenotype, including small stature, facial dysmorphism, and impaired cognitive function. Importantly, they recapitulated phenotypes identified in Rasopathy models with upstream Ras activation, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): oligodendrocyte lineage defects, reactive astrogliosis, memory deficits, and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli.

Here, we integrate high-resolution enhancer-promoter interactions obtained using targeted chromosome conformation capture and RNA-DNA contacts from RADICL-seq to uncover the role of RNA in modulating enhancer-promoter interactions. Both datasets were generated from human induced pluripotent cells at different stages across neural differentiation. As expected, most enhancer-promoter interactions were dynamic with only 38% shared across all cell states and 68% of promoter interacting regions overlapped at least one annotated neural enhancer. Integration with RADICL-seq data revealed a 9.3-fold enrichment for cis-interacting DNA regions to associate with at least one RNA. Among 18,346 cis-interacting promoters, only 1,170 (6.3%) lacked any RNA association, whereas 3,702 (28%) showed stable RNA association and 13,579 (74%) displayed dynamic RNA association across differentiation. Promoters associated with RNA engaged with higher number of enhancers and exhibited higher expression levels, while enhancers with RNA associations showed higher levels of chromatin activation marks. Promoters with dynamic RNA association were also more likely to be differentially expressed and enriched for relevant biological processes, phenotypes and diseases. Importantly, RNA-DNA association dynamics correlated strongly with DNA-DNA interaction dynamics; gain of RNA association on enhancers was typically accompanied by enhancer-promoter interaction gain, whereas concurrent RNA association gain on both promoter and enhancers frequently led to interaction loss. The correlation of RNA association on cis-interaction dynamics across differentiation were also captured in the community structure of the DNA-RNA network.

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has emerged as a potential mediator linking maternal immune activation (MIA) to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in offspring. Production of this cytokine is in-part regulated by the maternal gastrointestinal microbiome. However, it remains unclear whether IL-17A alone is sufficient to induce offspring brain abnormalities independent of maternal microbial signals. This study tests the potential for IL-17A to mediate fetal brain cortical architecture through administration of recombinant (r)IL-17A to pregnant germ-free (GF) dams. Pregnant GF mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of rIL-17A for six days, covering the mid- to latter half of the gestational period. Placental tissue was processed for histopathological evaluation, and cortical lamination was examined in the fetal brain using gold-standard immunohistochemical approaches. Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), a novel label-free imaging technique, was employed to further quantify cortical architecture. This is the first report of SLIM imaging performed in the mouse embryonic brain. Overall, administration of rIL-17A to pregnant GF dams during mid-to-late gestation resulted in normal placental morphology and fetal cortical lamination patterns, suggesting that IL-17A alone is insufficient for altering cortical neurodevelopment, at least at this gestational timepoint.

Prior work in sheep demonstrated that hSCS modulates gamma band (70-150 Hz) activity in the primary somatosensory and association cortices, implicating cortical involvement in pain modulation. Given, the interaction between low and high oscillations, we hypothesized that hSCS modulates gamma activity in a region- and time-dependent manner through specific coupling with theta rhythms (4-8 Hz). Using 96-channel subdural electrocorticography (ECoG), we computed theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and the corresponding modulation index (MI) to quantify the effects of hSCS. While the preferred theta phase of gamma activity remained consistent across conditions and regions, MI increased significantly post-stimulation, most prominently in the association cortex, where robust theta-gamma phase locking was observed. In contrast, the somatosensory cortex exhibited weaker and more variable locking. Temporally, both cortices demonstrated an early, rapid increase in MI post-hSCS, accompanied by a shift (association) and attenuation (somatosensory) of the secondary peak. These findings reveal distinct regional and temporal dynamics in PAC following hSCS and suggest complementary roles of somatosensory and association cortices in processing neuromodulatory input. hSCS appears to reorganize cortical cross-frequency interactions, supporting its role in reorganizing functional network dynamics relevant to sensory processing and the subjective pain experience.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we use a functional genomics approach to integrate evolutionary cues, single-cell sequencing, and metabolomics, identifying convergent signals that encode epigenetic memory of adaptive states in visceral adipose tissue natural killer (NK) cells. Cross-species analysis shows that genomic hubs linked to human accelerated regions (HARs) are conserved and active during dietary restriction, forming transcriptional compartments that regulate oxidative stress response and DNA repair genes. Targeted screens and multimodal profiling across human data and mouse models reveal convergent signals needed for persistent adaptation: cooperative transcriptional regulators (NRF2, CIRBP, NR4A2) at key HAR-linked genomic hubs, innate immune mediators (IL15-IL2RB), and metabolic cofactors from linoleic acid oxidation. Activity of these convergent signals reduces DNA damage and methylation and enhances epigenetic plasticity and cytotoxic functions, thereby decreasing tissue fibrosis and senescence while maintaining both local and systemic metabolic plasticity. Mechanistically, linoleic acid metabolism supplies acetyl-CoA to sustain H3K27ac epigenetic marks that maintain coordinated repair and cytotoxic programs after programming. IL15-IL2RB signaling links tissue metabolic state to NK cell function for coherent adaptive responses. We show that engineering of NK cells with this multimodal programming leads to long-term preservation of therapeutic phenotypes in metabolic aging models, rescuing systemic dysfunction through damaged cells clearance and leptin sensitivity.

One of the molecular hallmarks of cerebrovascular inflammation is the increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 on blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells. Exposure to amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides, one of the primary hallmarks of AD, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) induces VCAM-1 expression on the BBB endothelium, which facilitates extravasation of leukocytes into the brain thereby promoting an inflammatory response. Therefore, it is crucial to explore therapeutic agents that can inhibit VCAM-1 expression induced by A{beta} and TNF-. Short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, produced by the gut microbiota as byproducts of dietary fiber metabolism, are recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties.

Introgression of the primocane-fruiting (PF; annual flowering) trait into elite germplasm has enabled dual cropping in a single year, season extension, and cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite its economic performance, the genetic basis of PF is not well understood. It has been proposed that the PF trait is controlled by a major recessive locus, but its genomic location is unclear. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 365 tetraploid blackberry genotypes identified a single genomic region on chromosome Ra03 (~33 Mb) strongly associated with PF. Genetic linkage analysis in a biparental population confirmed that the same interval (32-35 Mb) was linked to the PF phenotype. Ten putative candidate genes were identified in this region. Allele mining using whole-genome resequencing of 17 genotypes highlighted two high-priority candidates: a CCCH-type zinc finger gene and a ubiquitin-specific protease gene. Use of an improved Rubus argutus Hillquist genome annotation (v1.2) enabled refined variant interpretation, including identification of regulatory 3 UTR polymorphisms in the zinc finger homolog. Two diagnostic KASP markers (PF1 and PF2), designed from the most significant GWAS SNPs, predicted the PF phenotype with over 96% accuracy in a validation panel of 494 tetraploid blackberries from multiple breeding programs. Together, these results provide the first high-resolution mapping of the PF locus in blackberry, identify candidate genes for flowering regulation in Rubus, and deliver diagnostic markers that can be immediately deployed in breeding programs.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

We examined this possibility by manipulating the strength of coupling between the left primary motor cortex (lM1) and the right primary motor cortex (rM1) and examined the impact on activity transfer between the two areas measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 60 right-handed individuals. In three experiments we manipulated the strength of the pathway connecting the lM1 and rM1 by applying paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) using three different patterns, two of which increase interregional coupling strength. We measured the impact on EEG communication transfer in the alpha, beta, and theta bands at rest. Augmenting the strength of the lM1-to-rM1 pathway enhanced the interregional communication volume in the high-theta/low alpha band, and both volume and speed in the beta band, respectively. These changes, visible at rest, are related to changes in the transcallosal inhibitory influence of the lM1 over rM1 cortical excitability following ccPAS. By contrast, augmenting the rM1-to-lM1 route failed to modulate communication transfer in right-handed individuals.

Retinotopic orientation representations in early visual areas changed similarly across groups, indicating that variability does not alter local sensory representations. In contrast, functional connectivity differed: low variability training enhanced task-dependent coupling between the intraparietal sulcus and V2, while high variability training differentially affected connectivity with hV4.

Mechanistically, we identify the glutamatergic projection from the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as critical for these empathy-like responses. SI induces hypoexcitability of OFC glutamatergic neurons and attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission within the VM[-&gt;]OFC pathway. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of OFC neurons or the VM[-&gt;]OFC projection restores empathic behaviors in SI mice. Furthermore, we uncover a molecular basis for SI-induced OFC hypoexcitability: the downregulation of Grik3, encoding a kainate-type glutamate receptor subunit.

Recent studies using univariate approaches have identified age-related changes in the association between fMRI signals from multiple individual brain regions and low-frequency respiratory and cardiac activity. Here, we investigate if whole-brain spatial fMRI patterns associated with low-frequency physiological processes (heart rate and respiratory volume fluctuations) present generalizable changes with age. Data from human participants of both sexes are included in the analysis. We find that chronological age can be predicted statistically beyond chance from patterns of low-frequency fMRI-physiology coupling, even after accounting for individual differences in physiological signal characteristics and brain anatomy. Notably, brain areas implicated in central autonomic regulation, including nodes within salience and ventral attention networks (e.g., insula and middle cingulate cortex), are amongst the strongest contributors to age prediction. Further, we observe that after removing physiological effects from fMRI data, the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability is still a reliable indicator of age. Together, these findings underscore the close integration between brain and body physiology, and highlight this interaction as a potential biomarker of the aging process.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Here, to address this question, we determined the response profile of temporal and inferior frontal language areas to the composition of up to four words into phrases. We tested whether brain activity increases with the number of merged words, and whether this profile differs for noun and verb phrases. To this aim, we used fMRI to quantify the brain responses to individual noun and verb phrases of varying length and to tightly matched word lists. Increasing phrase length was associated to an increase in activation in all regions of the temporo-frontal language network. The effect was more pronounced for phrases built around verbs than for phrases built around nouns, suggesting that verbs involve a more complex syntactic tree structure than nouns. Even with word lists, several regions, notably the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and opercularis and the posterior superior temporal sulcus showed clear increases in activity with the length of sequences, although the words could not be merged into phrases. By contrast, other regions (IFG pars orbitalis, anterior temporal lobe, temporo-parietal junction) did not react to scrambled word lists.

Improving visual acuity requires smaller pixels, which, in turn, require relaxation of electric field confinement to maintain effective stimulation of bipolar cells. Eliminating local return electrodes broadens the electric field but may inadvertently engage residual photoreceptors adjacent to the implant, thereby altering electrically evoked visual percepts. Here we quantify the contribution of residual photoreceptors to electrically evoked retinal responses across various implant configurations. Monopolar photovoltaic arrays with 20 {micro}m pixels and bipolar arrays with 100 {micro}m pixels were implanted subretinally in Long Evans rats, resulting in local degeneration of photoreceptors directly above the device. Responses were compared with those obtained in RCS rats, which lack functional photoreceptors. Implants were activated by patterns of 880 nm laser at pulse durations varying from 0.5 to 10 ms. Visually evoked potentials were measured in scotopic and photopic conditions, with and without the intravitreal application of mGluR6 agonist L-AP4 to block photoreceptor-driven ON pathways. Experimental thresholds were interpreted using a computational model of retinal network activation in distinct electric field geometries. In locally degenerate retina stimulated with monopolar arrays, blocking photoreceptor input yielded a rheobase (0.06 mW/mm2) and chronaxie (~3 ms) of the stimulation threshold, matching that measured in fully degenerate RCS retina, indicating direct activation of bipolar cells. In contrast, when photoreceptor input was intact, stimulation thresholds decreased significantly, and dark adaptation further modulated the threshold in a pulse-duration dependent manner. Bipolar arrays provided identical thresholds in locally degenerate and fully degenerate retina (0.2 mW/mm2) when stimulation was confined to the implant center; however, shifting stimulation to the implant's edge lowered the thresholds, revealing a contribution from adjacent photoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that residual photoreceptors can substantially influence responses evoked by subretinal prostheses in a degenerate retina, with direct consequences for perceptual uniformity in patients, such as edge brightening. These results provide guidance for design of the next-generation higher-resolution implants, supporting the use of local return electrodes to maximize resolution while minimizing the effect of photoreceptors in clinical applications.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Upon recognition, they become activated, produce proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cytotoxic molecules. MAIT cells are also activated by cytokines independently of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, however these two signals can also act in concert to finetune MAIT cell functions. Additionally, multiple other co-stimulatory signals have also been reported that can boost MAIT cell effector responses to TCR or cytokine stimulation. However, a comprehensive study exploring the role of surface bound TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) molecule 4-1BB, well known for its co-stimulatory function during conventional T cell activation, is lacking in the context of MAIT cells. In this study, we show that 4-1BB is the earliest and most highly expressed TNFRSF co-stimulatory molecule on MAIT cells upon activation by Escherichia coli, with expression seen as early as six hours where it was predominantly MR1 mediated. 4-1BB expression on MAIT cells following late activation was due to both TCR signaling and cytokine signaling. We found marked differences in MAIT cell activation and cytokine expression between 4-1BB+ and 4-1BB- MAIT cells suggesting 4-1BB expression on MAIT cells is associated with functional superiority. By blocking 4-1BB signaling or co-culturing with a 4-1BBL overexpressing cell line we demonstrated an important role of co-stimulation via 4-1BB in MAIT cells during activation.

To address this, we analyzed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data set of a developmental series from the chick midbrain axial level, spanning stages from gastrulation to post-neurulation. Focusing on a defined region enabled high-resolution analysis of transcriptional dynamics and subpopulation transitions. Transcription factor downstream activity inference identified several ubiquitously expressed chromatin and histone modifiers, previously not associated with ectodermal patterning, that exhibit canonical downstream activity spatiotemporally restricted to specific developing domains. Moreover, we uncovered genes that remain canonical downstream activity throughout the progression of individual ectodermal domains, while others displayed negative activity scores, reflecting a repressed or alternatively a non-canonical downstream activity status that changed between cell types and developmental stage but was independent of transcription factor binding availability status on open chromatin. Finally, ligand-receptor interaction analyses across germ layers highlighted global signaling networks coordinating early embryogenesis, which were verified by in situ hybridization-based gene expression data. In sum, our study provides novel insights into the gene regulatory inputs that shape ectodermal cell fate decisions during neurulation and establishes a new framework for analyzing scRNAseq data to understand tissue patterning over developmental time.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

Importantly, ROH have been shown to be enriched for deleterious alleles, suggesting a mechanism by which ROH prevalence can influence traits. Here we employ realistic forward-in-time population genetic simulations and a flexible quantitative model of a generic complex phenotype to explore how population history and genetic architecture influence ROH associations with a generic quantitative phenotype. We show that ROH are important for all simulated demographic histories and genetic architectures but especially when phenotypes have a recessive component. This is even more prominent when the rare-allele contribution to the phenotype is upweighted and in high-diversity populations (e.g. African). For a fully recessive phenotype, ROH can account for 25-45% of an individual's total phenotype score, depending on demographic history and rare-allele weight.

Here we compared mitochondrial morphology, protein expression, and calcium levels across CA1 and CA2 circuits. We found mitochondria in CA2 dendrites were larger than mitochondria in CA1 dendrites. However, both subregions harbored larger mitochondria in the entorhinal cortex (EC)-contacting distal dendrites compared to CA3-contacting proximal dendrites. Together, these data demonstrate both cell type- and input specific regulation of mitochondrial morphology that likely influences the function of these distinct circuits. To determine whether differences in mitochondrial fission or fusion account for cell and/or layer specific differences in morphology, we immunostained for OPA1 and MFF, which showed a general enrichment in distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and an unexpected increase in CA1 distal dendrites compared to CA2 distal dendrites. To show whether these morphological differences result in functionally distinct mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial calcium levels in live slices. We found a striking enrichment of mitochondrial calcium levels in CA2 distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and this layer-specific effect was significantly different from that in CA1 dendrites at baseline and after activity.

Live-cell imaging reveals BAG3 depletion impairs CME dynamics, increasing clathrin particle lifetimes. BAG3 depletion also alters endolysosomal compartments, increasing Lamp1+ puncta and tau co-localization. These findings highlight BAG3s role in CME, tau trafficking, and vacuolar processes, suggesting its dysfunction may contribute to AD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Melanoma outcomes have dramatically improved over the past decade, but some patients still experience disease recurrence, particularly those who present at later stage of disease. Prior studies identified an altered immune microenvironment in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) including the presence of dysfunctional CD8 T cells and CD4 T regulatory cells (Tregs), but the spatial organization of the SLN and the interactions of individual cell types have not been extensively studied. To understand how spatial organization of immune cells in the SLN is related to outcomes, we performed spatial proteomic profiling of Stage I and II melanoma SLN to generate an atlas of cell types. Following multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging, deep learning-based segmentation and clustering, we identified 33 subsets of T cells, B cells and Tumor cells. Lymphoid region analyses established a foundational spatial map of the melanoma SLN, revealing higher regional frequencies of activated and memory CD4 T cells in Stage I SLN and consistent positioning of T cells at functional spatial locations. To better understand cellular interactions, we evaluated the immediate neighbors around each index cell using Effect Size Interaction mapping (ESI-map), a novel computational toolkit for understanding spatial interactions. Nearest-neighbor analyses across biological replicates revealed rewiring in cell-cell interacting pairs across disease progression and patient outcomes, particularly with respect to exhausted TOX+ CD8 T cells. Stage II patients who experienced disease recurrence had notable enrichment of cellular interactions between Tregs and TOX+ CD8 T cells that was associated with reduced expression of granzyme B and interferon-{gamma} that was most pronounced in exhausted CD8 T cells. Together, these data demonstrate that the specific spatial interactions between Tregs and exhausted CD8 T cells in the SLN provide a novel immune signature for understanding melanoma outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

A.; Britton, S. E.; Lee, C. A.; Chenard, K. C.; Badyaev, A. V.", "abstract": "Background: Morphogenesis depends on spatial and temporal coordination of signaling pathways, yet the colocalization of proteins across pathways remains poorly understood. Here we examine cellular and histological localization of regulatory proteins forming core craniofacial developmental pathways during beak morphogenesis of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Results: We present an atlas of spatiotemporal coexpression of {beta}-catenin, Bmp4, CaM, Dkk3, Fgf8, Ihh, Tgf{beta}2, and Wnt4 across embryonic stages HH29-42 revealing both established and novel patterns of expression. Overall, in the earliest stages (HH29-32), most proteins show broad and overlapping expression across epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. By stage HH36, expression becomes increasingly compartmentalized, with pronounced differentiation among tissue types. Notably, at later stages, proteins showed tissue-specific distributions in boundary versus core regions of chondrogenic and osteogenic domains indicating coordinated cross-pathway patterning during cartilage and bone formation. Conclusions: Osteogenesis in the zebra finch beak is organized by coordinated signaling between boundary-associated cells and differentiating cores, with cross-pathway feedback establishing bone and cartilage differentiation while maintaining boundaries. Our results corroborated core elements of craniofacial signaling dynamics, while revealing unexpected subcellular localization for several proteins that showed regulatory complexity not captured by prior transcript-level maps. This atlas provides a protein-level baseline for comparative and mechanistic studies of beak morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The extraordinary repetitive content of human acrocentric short arms has prevented detailed investigations into recombination and de novo mutation. Integrating multiple sequencing technologies, we created 156 phased short arms and assessed 107 intergenerational transmissions from 23 samples in a four-generation pedigree. We observed a significant depletion (P<0.0001) of p-arm allelic recombination but one ectopic chr13-chr21 recombination breakpoint mediated by a 630 kbp segmental duplication mapping 1.6 Mbp distal to the SST1 array. In contrast, 18 maternal-biased q-arm allelic recombinations are significantly enriched within 5 Mbp of the centromere. Compared to autosomal euchromatin, the overall p-arm de novo single-nucleotide variant rate (1.33x10^-7 per base pair per generation) is 10-fold higher, with a significant reduction of C>T but increased C>G and A>C mutations. We hypothesize that acrocentric sequence composition biases and the dearth of allelic recombination contribute to an elevated mutation rate and unique mutational signatures suggestive of mismatch repair defects and oxidative stress-induced DNA lesions.", "date": "2025-12-17", "journal": ""}
