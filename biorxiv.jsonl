Research consistently showed that adolescents are less cooperative than adults, which is often attributed to underdeveloped mentalizing that limits their expectations of others. However, the internal computations underlying this reduced cooperation remain largely unexplored. This study compared cooperation between adolescents and adults using a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Adolescents cooperated less than adults, particularly after their partner's cooperation. Computational modeling revealed that adults increased their intrinsic reward for reciprocating when their partner continued cooperating, a pattern absent in adolescents. Both computational modeling and self-reported ratings showed that adolescents did not differ from adults in building expectations of their partner's cooperation. Therefore, the reduced cooperation appears driven by a lower intrinsic reward for reciprocity, reflecting a stronger motive to prioritize self-interest, rather than a deficiency in mentalizing or social learning. These findings provide insights into the developmental trajectory of cooperation from adolescence to adulthood.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Musilova, Z.", "abstract": "Photopigments, formed by an opsin protein bound to a light-sensitive chromophore, underlie vertebrate vision. Long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsins mediate red-light detection, and most teleosts retain a single functional LWS1. A shorter-shifted green-sensitive paralog (LWS2) is found only in a few lineages. By mining teleost genomes and sequencing retinal transcriptomes, we identify elopomorphs as an additional lineage retaining LWS2 (alongside characins and osteoglossomorphs), and we reveal a previously overlooked shorter-shifted paralog, LWS3, restricted to gobies (Percomorpha) and arising from an ancient duplication. Structural modeling of twelve LWS opsins uncovers convergent evolution at four key amino acid sites (214, 259, 261, 269) in the retinal-binding pocket, showing parallel substitutions in human MWS, teleost LWS2, and goby LWS3 relative to red-sensitive counterparts, consistent with repeated spectral shifts toward green wavelengths. In several lineages - including characins, mormyrids, gobies, and primates - these shorter-shifted LWS opsins have functionally replaced the canonical green-sensitive RH2 opsin. Retinal transcriptomes and in situ hybridization demonstrate variable lws3 expression across gobies, with localization to a distinct double-cone member in Amblygobius phalaena, analogous to rh2 expression in other fishes. Together, these results show that repeated convergent evolution toward green sensitivity over 500 million years involves coordinated changes at the molecular, regulatory, and functional levels, providing a striking example of multilevel sensory adaptation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

J.; Shin, S.; Nguyen, L. K.", "abstract": "Drug resistance inevitably emerges during the treatment of cancer by targeted therapy. Adaptive resistance is a major form of drug resistance, wherein the rewiring of protein signalling networks in response to drug perturbation allows the drug-targeted protein's activity to recover, despite the continuous presence of the drug, enabling the cells to survive/grow. Simultaneously, molecular heterogeneity enables the selection of drug-resistant cancer clones that can survive an initial drug insult, proliferate, and eventually cause disease relapse. Despite their importance, the link between heterogeneity and adaptive resistance, specifically how heterogeneity influences protein signalling dynamics to drive adaptive resistance, remains poorly understood. Here, we have explored the relationship between heterogeneity, protein signalling dynamics and adaptive resistance through the development of a novel modelling technique coined Meta Dynamic Network (MDN) modelling. We use MDN modelling to characterise how heterogeneity influences the drug-response signalling dynamics of the proteins that regulate early cell cycle progression and demonstrate that heterogeneity can robustly facilitate adaptive resistance associated dynamics for key cell cycle regulators. We determined the influence of heterogeneity at the level of both protein interactions and protein expression and show that protein interactions are a much stronger driver of adaptive resistance. Owing to the mechanistic nature of the underpinning ODE framework, we then identified a full spectrum of subnetworks that drive adaptive resistance dynamics in the key early cell cycle regulators. Finally, we show that single-cell dynamic data supports the validity of our MDN modelling technique and a comparison between our predicted resistance mechanisms and known CDK4/6 and Estrogen Receptor inhibitor resistance mechanisms suggests MDN can be deployed to robustly predict network-level resistance mechanisms for novel drugs and additional protein signalling networks.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Past work has consistently focused on the amygdala and hippocampus, two brain areas critical for emotion, memory, and learning. While there are SES differences in total amygdala and hippocampal volumes, there are many unanswered questions in this domain connected to neurobiological specificity and whether these effects vary by participant age or sex. To address these gaps, we combined multiple large neuroimaging datasets of children and adolescents with information about neurobiology and SES (N=2,765). We examined subdivisions of the amygdala and hippocampus, derived from Freesurfer, using linear mixed effects models. Higher SES was associated with larger volumes across all three amygdala subdivisions examined, the superficial cortical division, basolateral complex, and centromedial region. Within the hippocampus, SES was specifically related to volumes in the head, with no significant associations for the body or tail. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no significant interactions between SES and participant age or sex after correcting for multiple comparisons, suggesting these associations were relatively consistent across the developmental period examined (ages 5-18) and similar for males and females. These results fill in important gaps regarding the neurobiological specificity of SES effects, demonstrating associations across functionally distinct subdivisions of these critical brain structures.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

D-SPIN constructs probabilistic models of regulatory interactions between genes or gene-expression programs to fit the cell state distributions under different perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal key regulators of cell fate decisions and the coordination of distant cellular pathways in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN also dissects gene-level drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs acting on distinct regulators induce novel cell states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs.

Additionally, both drugs were tested in the human pediatric GBM cell line SF-188. DON (6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) was used as a positive drug control for glutamine targeting. Cerebral implantation of the VM-M3 cells, which are mesenchymal origin, invaded throughout the brain and the spinal column similar to that seen in children with HGG. Neither the CT-2A nor the VM-NM1 glioblastoma stem cell tumors showed distal invasion in syngeneic juvenile mouse brains. The maximum therapeutic benefit of MBZ and CPI-613 on tumor invasion, growth, and mouse survival occurred only when the drugs were administered together with a ketogenic diet (KD). MBZ treatment inhibited both the glutaminolysis and the glycolysis pathways in VM-M3 cells grown either in vivo or in vitro. Both MBZ and CPI-613 significantly reduced the in vitro growth and viability of the SF-188 cells. Moreover, drug administration together with the KD allowed for lower dosing thus minimizing toxicity while improving overall survival of the mice.

KaryoTap achieves an average accuracy of >85% for arm events and >90% for chromosome events at <$1 per cell, allowing scalable analysis of tens of thousands of cells per experiment. Through KaryoTap-based analysis of 11,555 cells, we performed in vitro evolution screens on immortalized human cells from mammary gland, pancreas and melanocytes. By comparing aneuploidy frequencies immediately after reversine-induced missegregation versus after extended proliferation, we quantified positive and negative selection for specific aneuploidies. Most aneuploidies - both gains and losses - are under negative selection, yet some chromosomal gains are under positive selection (such as 8q and 7q). We found that proliferative selective pressures can explain tissue-specific patterns of chromosomal gains observed in human cancers. Critically, when positively selected events were excluded from analysis, correlations between in vitro and cancer gain frequencies strongly decreased or disappeared, whereas excluding negatively selected events largely preserved these correlations. These findings demonstrate that proliferative selection shapes the landscape of chromosomal gains in cancer, with a more prominent role for positive selection.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

E.; Park, H.", "abstract": "Audio-visual speech processing is a fundamental aspect of human communication; however, the neural oscillatory mechanisms, particularly those involving alpha rhythms, that underlie attention in tasks requiring attention and suppression remain unclear. To investigate this, we employed a complex audio-visual paradigm designed to explore how alpha rhythms, along with slower frequencies, monitor and integrate audio-visual information under congruent and incongruent conditions. Participants were presented with a TED Talk video while listening to auditory stimuli under four conditions: (1) congruent audio delivered to both ears, (2) congruent audio in one ear and incongruent audio in the other, with attention directed toward the congruent audio, (3) congruent audio in one ear and incongruent audio in the other, with attention directed toward the incongruent audio and (4) all-incongruent stimulus. To examine lateralized attention effects, participants were divided into left-attending and right-attending groups across individuals. By analysing fluctuations in alpha power with regards to audio-visual congruency and the side of attention, we observed a notable finding: alpha power fluctuations falling within the faster delta/theta range to the direction of attention, corresponding to task difficulty and accuracy. This result indicates a lateralized relationship between low-frequency rhythms and alpha-band activity, highlighting the role of alpha rhythms as a mediator of attention in audio-visual speech processing. Indeed, inhibitory alpha power fluctuation follows previous observations of sensory filtering. These findings underscore the importance of lateralized neural dynamics in tasks involving selective attention and suppression, providing new insights into the oscillatory mechanisms underlying audio-visual integration in human communication.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

By comparing serum and tissue metabolomes of colonized and microbiome-depleted mice, we determined that the gut microbiota modifies these compounds extensively, altering their absorption and gating host exposure. By screening the metabolic products in human urine and stool samples, we established that steroidal glycoalkaloid metabolism varies inter-individually in a population.

These findings enabled the rational design of complex synthetic microbial communities that controlled host exposure to steroidal alkaloid metabolites in vivo. Importantly, microbial metabolism of Solanum metabolites alters their acetylcholinesterase inhibition in vitro and gut motility in vivo.

Here, we experimentally investigate the spatially-explicit impact of LDOC on the forest soil microbiome and the associated biogeochemical processes. Homogenized soil columns were subjected to realistic artificial precipitation for 3 months with the initial level of LDOC adjusted by the number of times the leaf litter was flushed in preparation for the experiment. Hydrological and geochemical parameters (redox potential, pH, dissolved oxygen, soil moisture, matric potential, chemical speciation) were measured continuously as a function of time and depth. The same initial microbial community developed into distinct communities under different LDOC and above and below the water table. The LDOC from leaf litter increased the availability of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in porewater four-fold and two-fold respectively in the first two weeks. This resulted in the expansion of the anoxic zone above the water table and a decrease in the soil microbial metabolic potential for cellulolysis and N2 fixation in unsaturated soil along with an increase of soil microbial metabolic potential for fermentation at all depths. Finally, increased LDOC decreased the stability, phylogenetic diversity, and complexity of the soil microbiome, limiting its functional diversity. Thus, management of leaf litter should receive more attention due to its indirect role in the impact of climate change on the soil microbiome.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

This study examines age-related changes in the mitochondrial structure of human and murine livers using a combination of Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) and mass spectrometry approaches. Methods: This study integrates mitochondrial structure analysis in a murine model with an analysis of liver architecture, lipogenesis, and genetically regulated gene expression in human cohorts. We explored the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS) complex using SBF-SEM, three-dimensional reconstruction with Amira software, and mass spectrometry techniques. Results: Aging leads to a reduction in mitochondrial size and complexity, resulting in changes in the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of murine liver cells that are comparable to those observed in aged human samples. We find that genetically modeled expression of MICOS complex genes OPA1 and CHCHD3 is associated with chronic liver disease phenotypes within a large biobank population. Furthermore, we observed dysregulated mitochondrial calcium handling and increased oxidative stress due to the disruption of the MICOS complex.

Sequencing-based spatial methods typically require surfaces coated with coordinate-associated DNA barcodes, but the physical registration of these barcodes to spatial coordinates is challenging, necessitating either high density printing of oligonucleotides or in situ sequencing/probing of randomly deposited, DNA-barcode-bearing beads. As a consequence, the surface areas available to sequencing-based spatial genomic methods are constrained by the time, labor, cost and instrumentation required to either print or decode a coordinate-tagged surface. To address this challenge, we developed SCOPE (Spatial reConstruction via Oligonucleotide Proximity Encoding), an optics-free, DNA microscopy-inspired method. With SCOPE, the relative positions of DNA-barcoded beads within a 2D shape, 2D image or 3D volume are inferred from the ex situ sequencing of chimeric molecules formed from diffusing \"sender\" and tethered \"receiver\" oligonucleotides.

Although experimental data has accumulated rapidly in recent years, addressing this question remains challenging, as the number of possible interactions is typically enormous even for proteins of moderate size. Here, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework for studying higher-order epistasis scalable to full-length proteins. Our model builds on the transformer architecture, with key modifications allowing us to assess the importance of higher-order interactions by fitting a series of models with increasing complexity. Applying our method to 10 large protein sequence-function datasets, we found that while additive effects explain the majority of the variance, within the epistatic component, the contribution of higher-order epistasis ranges from negligible to up to 60%. We also found higher-order epistasis is particularly important for generalizing locally sampled fitness data to distant regions of sequence space and for modeling an additional multi-peak fitness landscape.

Hence, neurons that are lost due to neurodegenerative disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury or peripheral neuropathy cannot be replaced. Transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons provides a potential replacement strategy, but how these neurons can be encouraged to functionally integrate into circuits remains a significant challenge. In the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) continue to be generated throughout life from basal stem cells and can be repopulated even after complete ablation. However, the specialized population of navigator OSNs that ensures accurate olfactory receptor-specific targeting of OSN axons to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) is only present perinatally. Despite this, some studies have reported complete regeneration of specific glomeruli, while others have found various degrees of recovery, following OSN cell death. Variability in the extent of both initial OSN ablation and subsequent repopulation of the OE, and the focus on anatomical recovery, leave the extent to which newly generated OSNs can reinnervate the OB unclear. Here, we employed the olfactotoxic drug methimazole (MMZ) to selectively ablate OSNs without damaging the basal stem cells that generate them, enabling us to assess the extent of functional recovery of OSN input to the OB in the context of complete OSN repopulation. We found profound deficits in the recovery of odor-evoked responses in OSN axons in the glomerular layer of the dorsal OB five weeks after OSN ablation, a time point at which OSNs are known to have repopulated the OE. Histological analysis of mature OSN axons in the OB at 10 and 20 weeks post-methimazole showed persistent region-specific deficits in OSN axon reinnervation of the dorsal and medial OB, with the dorsomedial region being particularly adversely affected. In contrast, reinnervation of the glomerular layer in lateral and ventral regions of the OB was essentially complete by 10 weeks post-MMZ. Hence, we have identified a region-specific deficit in OSN reinnervation of the mouse OB, which sets the stage to identify the mechanisms that mediate successful vs. unsuccessful axonal regeneration in an endogenous population of stem cell-derived neurons.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically analyzed how cortical neurons encode cognitive, sensory, and movement variables across 43 cortical regions during a complex task (14,000+ units from the International Brain Laboratory public Brainwide Map data set) and studied how these properties change across the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. We found that the structure of the neural code was scale-dependent: on a whole-cortex scale, neural selectivity was categorical and organized across regions in a way that reflected their anatomical connectivity. However, within individual regions, categorical representations were rare and limited to primary sensory areas, and neuronal responses were instead very diverse. With theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that the diversity of neural responses enables high-dimensional representations and, hence, high separability, allowing linear readouts to separate experimental conditions in many arbitrary ways. Indeed, when accounting for information that is actually encoded in each area, all cortical regions exhibit maximal separability. Our results indicate that cortical circuits prioritize diversity over categorical structure, supporting a computational regime geared toward high-dimensional, highly-separable neural representations.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that mRNAs enriched in optimal codons elicited dramatic increases in luciferase activities compared to less optimal sequences both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, transfecting low optimality test RNA suppresses the translation of co-transfected control mRNAs in dual reporter assays. Further, low optimality mRNAs activated innate immune pathways and the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2, a central event of the integrated stress response. eIF2 phosphorylation was suppressed by a GCN2 inhibitor, but not by other eIF2 kinase inhibitors. Using nucleoside-modified or circular RNAs also fully or partially abrogated these responses. Finally, optimal, but not non-optimal, circular RNAs have enhanced RNA lifespan and duration of protein expression. Our results show that RNA sequence, composition, and structure all govern RNA translatability. Further, RNA sequences with poor codon optimality are immunogenic and induce cellular stress. Together, we show that RNA coding sequence design is a key consideration for both mRNA and circular RNA therapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The combination of rAAV donor transduction and electroporation of single-cell mouse embryos with Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) enables highly efficient KI, but the insert size is limited by the viral packaging capacity. Here, we report the creation of up to 6.6 kb precise KI achieved in one step by using three rAAVs designed to insert one after the other. To fully characterize the edited genome with large KIs, we developed LOCK-seq (LOng-read sequencing of Captured Kilo-base targets), where relevant genomic regions are enriched via hybridization, achieving over 100-fold greater coverage compared to other long-read methods with enrichment. LOCK-seq simultaneously detects the presence of the KI allele, genotypes non-KI alleles and more importantly, uniquely identifies donor concatenation in the KI allele, and localizes random integration of the full or partial donor. Additionally, the multi-rAAV donor approach is successfully applied to cell lines, including lines intolerant of plasmid DNA, whereas LOCK-seq reliably and efficiently screens for KI clones. Together, the two approaches significantly improve the creation and precision of knock-in models.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/625457v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23bfd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@106b8cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e2235org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7fd1f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Hawlena, D.", "abstract": "Animals consume foods in specific quantities and ratios to meet a multi-dimensional nutrient target that maximizes their fitness. Attempts to reach this target in an ever-changing nutritional landscape often influence animal foraging behavior, habitat choice, and food-web interactions. Consequently, understanding the nutritional ecology of a species is instrumental in developing efficient management plans for its conservation. We quantified the dietary considerations of a critically endangered population of Acacia gazelles (Gazella arabica acacia), and compared their diet and nutrition to that of the sympatric Gazella dorcas, using behavioral observations coupled with nutritional and secondary metabolite quantification, and morphological measurements of trees. Acacia gazelles mainly consumed resources from two subspecies of the umbrella-thorn acacia (Vachellia tortilis) that differ in morphology, nutritional composition, and phenology, and prioritized consumption of specific trees based on their nutritional and defensive traits. Gazelles maintained a narrow nutritional target, tightly regulated their protein intake, and prioritized consumption of non-structural carbohydrates. Dorcas gazelles consumed a very different diet from the Acacia gazelle, but converged to a similar intake target. We conclude that suitable habitats for Acacia gazelle reintroduction must include sympatric populations of the two V. tortilis subspecies, that nutritional deficiency is unlikely to play a major role in explaining the slow rate of population recovery, and that the seemingly low competition between the two gazelle species does not necessitate controlling the Dorcas gazelle population. Our work demonstrates the importance of nutritional ecology as a major conservation tool.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Herein we show that vandetanib treatment suppresses MAPK signaling and enhances sensitivity to ET across ET-sensitive and ET-resistant ER+ cell lines and patient derived organoids. Vandetanib treatment reprograms transcription toward a less proliferative, more estrogen responsive, Luminal-A like state by enriching ER chromatin binding at canonical estrogen response elements. Multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads-mass spectrometry (MIB/MS) revealed kinase network reprogramming, including upregulation of PI3K and HER2 activity, as shared adaptive resistance mechanisms to vandetanib treatment. Co-treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, further enhanced sensitivity to vandetanib. Using an operating room-to-laboratory short-term ex-vivo assay coupled to single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate conserved gene expression changes in primary tumor cells, including increased HER2 activity signatures, following vandetanib treatment. Vandetanib sensitivity signatures were generated from cell line and primary human tumor cells which correlate with vandetanib sensitivity in ER+ patient-derived organoid and xenograft models.

J.", "abstract": "Centrosomes, the primary microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs), are crucial for early neuronal development, particularly in establishing polarity and promoting axon formation. Once thought dispensable in many terminally differentiated cells, growing evidence shows that many cells retain active centrosomes, while others do not, highlighting context-dependent roles in specialized functions. In some mammalian neurons, centrosome-mediated microtubule (MT) remodelling is essential for axon elongation, with centrosome dysfunction leading to axonal misrouting and growth defects. Although active centrosomes have been detected in embryonic tracheal terminal cells of Drosophila melanogaster, their activity in neurons in vivo has not been observed. Their gradual loss during embryogenesis has been reported as non-essential for organogenesis, as adult flies can eclose without centrioles. To investigate centrosome activity in neurons, we revisited Drosophila Sas-4 mutants, which exhibit centrosome loss (CL), and observed that 50% of homozygous mutant individuals fail to hatch as larvae. We analysed their development, focusing on the expressivity and penetrance of nervous system phenotypes, and examined centrosome localization in neurons. Our findings confirm the presence of centrosomes in wild-type motor and sensory neurons in Drosophila and their localization near the nascent axon in motor neurons. CL conditions resulted in axonal misrouting and muscle developmental abnormalities. Targeted downregulation of Sas-4 in the pioneer motor neurons aCC, pCC and RP2 induced axon guidance errors, indicating an autonomous role for centrosomes in axonal navigation. Colocalization of acetylated- and gamma-tubulin with centrosomes in motor neurons and MT repolymerization analysis further confirmed the presence of active centrosomes in these cells. Analysis of motor axons revealed that CL leads to motor axon tortuosity, a characteristic associated with neurodegeneration. This is the first direct association of CL with axonal morphological phenotypes, highlighting the role of centrosomes in neuronal development and their broader influence on nervous system structure and function.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Using an aspartate biosensor and live-cell imaging, we examine the interaction between aspartate abundance and cell proliferation in several models of aspartate limitation. While aspartate deficiencies intuitively interface with proliferation in some contexts, aspartate limitation from succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibition causes strikingly nonintuitive dynamics resulting from an outsized impairment of pyrimidine synthesis. Mechanistically, we find that SDH loss impairs pyrimidine biosynthesis by decreasing aspartate and accumulating succinate, which competitively inhibits mammalian aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase). This metabolic interaction persists in multiple models of SDH deficiency, causing pyrimidine insufficiency, replication stress, and sensitivity to ATR kinase inhibition. These findings define a novel role for succinate in modulating cellular nucleotide homeostasis, suggest a potential therapeutic vulnerability of SDH-deficient tumors, and demonstrate how cascading metabolic interactions can unfold to impact cell function.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The precise coordination between the replication of the chromosome with cell growth and division is essential for daughter cells to inherit an intact copy of the genome with the appropriate cell size. However, the molecular mechanisms that temporally and spatially integrate these essential processes have remained elusive in the field. Using the model system C. crescentus, we uncovered a previously unrecognized role for the conserved chromosome replication initiator DnaA in regulating cell growth and division dynamics. Through mutant analyses, transcriptional profiling, biochemical and high-resolution imaging, our data demonstrate that DnaA modulates cell size through direct transcriptional activation of enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. We identify a conserved cell wall biosynthetic enzyme, MurD, as a key downstream effector and demonstrate its unexpected ability to restrict cell size. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that the transcriptional regulation of murD requires the ATP-bound form of DnaA, the same nucleotide-bound form required for initiating chromosome replication. These findings highlight how bacteria leverage the conserved nucleotide-dependent switch, DnaA-ATP, to temporally orchestrate spatially distinct processes ensuring accurate progression of the cell cycle.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We observed that IPCs acquired a reduced sensitivity to multiple drugs and radiotherapy. Likewise, DTPs developed a reduced sensitivity to multiple drugs and radiotherapy, including a reduced sensitivity to T cell killing. IPCs and DTPs were less sensitive to mitochondrial apoptosis. Some IPCs downregulated antigen and upregulated PD-L1. In the IPCs that did not employ these mechanisms, a greater decrease in sensitivity to apoptosis occurred.

In this study, we analyzed longitudinal 1-photon calcium recordings in mice performing an olfaction-guided spatial memory task over an eight-week period that included habituation, training, and sleep epochs. Our results reveal that, while a minority of neurons initially conveyed significant information about the behavior of the animal, the bulk of task-related activity only emerged after the animals reached proficient performance. Although goal arm information is robustly represented at both the single-cell and network levels both during learning and in task proficient mice, it undergoes significant remapping throughout the learning process. Additionally, we identified the establishment of recurring sequences during learning and their replay at reward locations, with no evidence of them existing during odor sampling phase, during sleep or before training. These findings suggest that the mPFC predominantly establishes generalized task representations de novo during learning, relying only minimally on preexisting spatial representations and that sub-second neural sequences in the mPFC are more likely involved in evaluating behavioral outcomes rather than planning future actions.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

PRC2 deposits the repressive chromatin mark H3 lysine 27 tri-methyl (H3K27me3) through a read-write loop that involves direct interactions between PRC2 and H3K27me3. According to current models, the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop is initiated by the PRC2 subunits JARID2 and PALI1 that mimic H3K27me3. However, it is unknown what restricts the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop from spreading H3K27me3 indefinitely. To answer this question, we generated mutant mice where PRC2 subunits cannot mimic H3K27me3. Unexpectedly, the mutations led to delayed Hox genes activation and a homeotic transformation characteristic of a Polycomb gain-of-function in vivo and the spread of H3K27me3 beyond Polycomb domains in stem cells. Collectively, we show that H3K27me3 mimicry evolved to compete against the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop in a process that restrains PRC2 and restricts the spread of Polycomb domains.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

K.; Devaud, Q.; Palanker, D.", "abstract": "Objective: PRIMA subretinal implants provide prosthetic vision to patients blinded by age-related macular degeneration, with acuity closely matching the sampling limit of the pixel pitch: a single 100 m pixel per line of a letter corresponds to 20/420 acuity. Decreasing the pixel size in the same flat geometry is difficult due to the constrained electric field, especially considering a 40 m thick debris layer separating the implant from the target neurons. Here we optimize the electrode design to help overcome such limitations. Approach: An end-to-end modeling pipeline combines the retinal photovoltaic implant simulator (RPSim) based on the Xyce circuit simulator with an interface to COMSOL Multiphysics for electric field modelling. It was used to generate and characterize implants in an open-loop sampling-based optimization. Implant performance was evaluated with respect to voltage drop across bipolar cells (representing the stimulation strength), pattern contrast, and neural selectivity. Main Results: The highest selectivity in stimulation of bipolar cells was achieved with arrays having active electrodes on pillars and return electrodes connected in a mesh surrounding the photovoltaic pixels in the array. Such a design, even with pixels down to 20 m, provides stimulation strength exceeding, and contrast similar to that of flat 100 m PRIMA pixels. Significance: Using a novel 3-D electrode design, the pitch of the photovoltaic array can be decreased to 20 m, while providing performance that exceeds the flat 100 m PRIMA pixels. In humans, 20 m resolution on the retina corresponds to a visual acuity of 20/80 - a five times improvement compared to the current clinical device.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Experimental Design: We analyzed electronic health records from 1,087 PLWH and 394,437 PLw/oH with melanoma. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared. Spatial immune transcriptomics (72 immune-related genes) was performed on melanoma tumor samples (n=11), with downstream validation using multiplex immunofluorescence (n=15 PLWH, n=14 PLw/oH). Results: PLWH were diagnosed at a younger age, had greater representation of Hispanic and Black individuals, and showed reduced survival. They also had a markedly increased risk of brain metastases. PLWH experienced significant delays in initiating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and had worse post-ICI survival, even after balancing covariates. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in PLWH, with increased transcription of immune checkpoints (PD1, LAG3) and reduced antigen-presentation markers (HLA-DRB, B2M), with distinct spatial distributions in tumors and surrounding microenvironments. Multiplex immunofluorescence demonstrated features of an exhausted CD8 T cell compartment, including enrichment of PD1intLAG3- and PD1intLAG3 subpopulations, and a significant accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD11b HLA-DR- CD33). Conclusions: Melanoma in PLWH is associated with distinct clinical and immunological features, including delayed ICI treatment, reduced survival, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment with exhausted CD8 T cells and expanded myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

In this work, we extend identifiability results to network classes that include pairs of tangled reticulations. Our main result shows that binary semi-directed level-2 phylogenetic networks are generically identifiable under the Jukes-Cantor model, provided they are triangle-free and strongly treechild.

Specifically, we demonstrate that any two binary semi-directed networks that display different sets of 4-leaf subtrees (quartets) are distinguishable. This has direct implications for the identifiability of a network's reticulated components (blobs).

W.", "abstract": "Malaria merozoite surface proteins (MSPs), are thought to have important roles in red blood cell (RBC) invasion and their exposure on the parasite surface makes them attractive vaccine candidates. However, their role in invasion has not been directly demonstrated and their biological functions are unknown. One of the most abundant proteins is PfMSP2, which is likely an ancestral protein that has been maintained in the Plasmodium falciparum lineage and is a focus of vaccine development, whose function remains unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, we removed PfMSP2 from two different P. falciparum lines with no impact on parasite replication or phenotype in vitro, demonstrating that it is not essential for RBC invasion. However, loss of PfMSP2 led to increased inhibitory potency of antibodies targeting other merozoite proteins involved in invasion, particularly PfAMA1. In a solid-phase model, increasing concentrations of PfMSP2 protein reduced binding of different antibodies against PfAMA1 in a dose dependent manner. These data suggest that PfMSP2 can modulate the susceptibility of merozoites to protective inhibitory antibodies. The results of this study change our understanding of the potential functions of PfMSP2 and establishes a new concept in malaria where a surface protein can reduce the protective efficacy of antibodies targeting a different antigen. These findings have important implications for understanding malaria immunity and informing vaccine development.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

A.; Kao, A. B.", "abstract": "Cognitive abilities are central to how animals navigate complex environments. Beyond individual cognition, group living can also enhance navigation by pooling individually acquired information. One way this may be achieved is by following experienced leaders, which requires recognizing expertise within group members. Alternatively, accurate decisions could also emerge without expert opinions, through simpler mechanisms like the 'wisdom of crowds' principle that average out individual biases. Consequently, collective navigation strategies range from cognitively complex to simple, and yet, the prevalence or interplay of different collective strategies in nature remains unexplored. In this study, we asked: what is the navigation mechanism, requiring minimal cognitive demands, that is necessary and sufficient to quantitatively replicate the experimental results of a 2017 study on homing pigeons (Columba livia), which showed that sequential chains of bird pairs flying home -- similar to a game of telephone -- led to shorter homing routes compared to control birds flying individually or in fixed pairs. Our results show that the experimental data aligns closely with the simplest strategy -- route averaging. Surprisingly, the complex mechanism of selectively propagating the best flight through social learning offered no additional advantage. We further observed that mixed strategies, although not supported by the experimental data, in theory combined advantages from both averaging and active selection of better routes, resulting in even greater performance. Hence, our results highlight the potential for future research to investigate selective pressures shaping the evolution of cultural learning and trade-offs among different decision mechanisms theoretically available to social animals in nature.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, its impact on how voluntary actions are initiated and subjectively experienced remains underexplored. Similarly, how directing attention to different phases of an action, such as intention formation versus execution, and anticipating outcomes of an action, modulates the neural readiness for movement, has yet to be fully examined. This study investigates whether spatial proximity, attentional focus, and anticipated action outcomes influence action preparation and action awareness, using a virtual reality adaptation of the Libet clock paradigm during EEG recordings. Neural results reveal that attentional focus and anticipated action outcomes modulate different phases of motor preparation, as indexed by the readiness potential (RP) - a gradual buildup of neural activity preceding voluntary movement. Focusing on decision timing (without subsequent action outcomes) enhances early RP amplitude and decreases the late RP slope, suggesting increased preparatory neural engagement during intention formation. In contrast, focusing on action execution leads to a steeper late RP slope, indicating later and faster motor activity buildup when attention is directed toward movement onset. Anticipating action outcomes increased late RP slope, which was accompanied by the temporal binding effect: when a tone followed the action, both decision and action estimates shifted toward it. Spatial proximity also modulates early RP slope, with a steeper buildup in near versus far space, suggesting facilitated motor preparation within PPS. It further enhances the late RP amplitude when participants focused on their intention to act. Behavioural results show that actions are perceived as occurring earlier when the clock is displayed near compared to far, indicating that PPS influences the temporal perception of action timing. Overall, these findings highlight the dynamic interplay among external spatial context and internal cognitive processes in shaping motor preparation and action awareness. Importantly, a temporal internal attentional focus on intention to act modulates early RP - traditionally considered an unconscious stage of neural readiness. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how PPS and the locus of attention on specific action phases affect action preparation and awareness, with potential implications for future research on the sense of agency and voluntary action decision making.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in both sequencing and genotyping technologies have resulted in a considerable increase in the number of publicly available human ancient DNA datasets, creating new opportunities for development of methods for the inference of NFDS from time-sampled data. In this perspective, I present three brief simulation studies to show how time-sampled data can aid improve inference power. First, I show how multiple time points can help us distinguish between recent NFDS and partial selective sweeps, as well as other forms of balancing selection, based on allele frequency trajectories. I then demonstrate how selective effects can be distinguished from population history based on changes in genetic variation and the site frequency spectrum over time. Finally, I apply an approximate Bayesian computation approach to compare the power of multiple and single time point datasets in estimating the time for which NFDS has been shaping variation. Thus, I argue that data from multiple timepoints can facilitate the generation of new methodological approaches for better inference of NFDS.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The biosynthesis of NRPs relies on non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), in which adenylation (A) domains play a pivotal role in defining the core structure by selectively recognizing and activating amino acid substrates. Accurately predicting the substrate specificities of A-domains is thus essential for understanding the core structural and biosynthetic logic of NRPs. Here, we present DeepAden, a two-stage deep learning framework. In the first stage, a graph attention network (GAT)-based model localizes 27-residue binding pockets within 6 A of bound substrates and convert these into pocket representations. In the second stage, pocket representations are then encoded alongside substrate information using pretrained language models, and aligned using contrastive learning. In addition, we introduce a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-guided data augmentation strategy to mitigate class imbalance and improve robustness, particularly for nonproteinogenic substrates. DeepAden achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art tools on a benchmark dataset, and enabled the identification of two Streptomyces NRPS gene clusters through accurate A-domain substrates specificity predictions.

Mice showed improved performance and neural encoding if they could sample the statistics longer per trial. Textures with more exploitable structure, specifically higher cross-frequency correlations improved performance, background encoding and vocalization activity. Activating parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons had an asymmetric effect, improving detection and neural encoding of vocalizations for low correlations, and impoverishing them for high cross-frequency correlations. In summary, mice exploit stimulus statistics to improve sound detection in naturalistic background noise, reflected in behavioral performance and neural activity, relying on PV interneurons for temporal integration.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Design: Cross-sectional, laboratory-based observational study. Participants: Eighteen unfrozen retinas from 12 Chinese donors (9 young, 34-55y; 9 old, 68-92 y). Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (10x, v3.1) generated 223612 cells, batch-corrected with scVI; age-related signatures were defined by intersecting single-cell and pseudo-bulk differentially expressed genes, then cell-type-specific panels were rank-ordered with L1-regularised logistic regression plus recursive feature elimination and interpreted through hallmark-pathway enrichment and transcription-factor regulon mapping. Main Outcome Measures: Age-related cellular composition shifts; cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes; machine-learning classifier accuracy and feature rankings; transcription factor regulon activity changes. Results: Eleven major retinal cell populations were identified. Aging showed declining rod-to-cone ratios, reduced bipolar cell proportions among interneurons, and increased astrocyte abundance. Muller glial cells exhibited the most pronounced transcriptional changes, followed by bipolar cells and rods. Machine-learning classifiers achieved 80-96% accuracy across cell types (microglia 96%, horizontal cells 93%, bipolar cells 91%, cones 90%, rods 89%). Shared aging signatures included mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory activation. Cell specific vulnerabilities emerged: mitochondria-centric stress in rods/bipolar cells, proteostasis-retinoid metabolism in cones, and structural-RNA maintenance in horizontal cells. Conclusions: This study provides the first machine learning derived, cell-type specific aging signatures for human retina in a Chinese cohort, revealing both conserved molecular hallmarks and distinctive cellular vulnerabilities that inform targeted therapeutic strategies for retinal aging.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, existing computational approaches typically rely on grouping cells into discrete populations before making comparisons, which can limit resolution for detecting state-dependent changes. Here, we introduce Kompot, a statistical framework for comparative analysis of multi-condition single-cell data. Kompot quantifies both differential abundance, capturing how cells redistribute across the phenotypic space, and differential expression, identifying condition-specific transcriptional changes that may be localized, heterogeneous, or oppositely regulated across states. By modeling cell density and gene expression as continuous functions over a shared cell-state representation, Kompot enables single-cell resolution inference with principled uncertainty estimates, without requiring predefined clusters or cell types. Applying Kompot to aging murine bone marrow, we identified a continuum of shifts in hematopoietic stem cell and mature cell states, transcriptional remodeling of monocytes independent of compositional changes, and divergent regulation of oxidative stress response genes across cell types. We demonstrate the utility of Kompot in disease settings by identifying cell-state and gene expression changes associated with improved efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in melanoma. Additionally, Kompot enables multi-sample comparative analysis by accounting for sample-to-sample heterogeneity. By capturing both global and cell-state-specific effects of perturbation, the Kompot framework is broadly applicable to dissecting condition-specific effects in complex single-cell landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, activin's role in tumourigenesis has been relatively overlooked compared to TGF-{beta}'s. We generated and characterized a dual specificity human antibody that recognizes both activin A and B and compared its activity in syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with an activin A-specific antibody. We demonstrate that activin A and B are central to the function of CAFs and therapeutic inhibition of activin results in a reduction of collagen rich desmoplastic barriers, enabling the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. This is correlated with an upregulation of the T cell chemoattractant CXCL10, which is normally repressed by activin signalling. Interestingly, despite greater T cell infiltration, activin A inhibition resulted in poorer survival in the KPC mouse model of PDAC and slightly larger tumours in the breast cancer model, indicating a tumour suppressive role of activin A-rich CAFs. Strikingly, however, treatment with the same anti-activin A antibody of PDAC tumours where SMAD4 is deleted in the tumour cells, resulted in increased survival, which was potentiated with additional treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These results suggest that anti-activin therapy has potential for the cohort of PDAC patients exhibiting inactivation of SMAD4.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

This cascade involves a series of enzymatic steps, including activation by the E1 enzyme Uba7, conjugation by the E2 enzyme UbcH8, and ligation by an E3 ligase. Central to this process is the ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) of Uba7, which facilitates the transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8. However, the structural and mechanistic details of this interaction remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the solution NMR structure and functional analysis of the ubiquitin-fold domain of human Uba7, the E1 enzyme in the ISGylation cascade. Through detailed NMR titration experiments and mutational studies, we mapped the interaction surface of Uba7-UFD with UbcH8, identifying key residues and their contributions to the E1-E2 interaction. We found that Uba7-UFD is flexible in its free form; this flexibility is conserved across ubiquitin-like systems but shows a regional shift that may play an important role in correct E2 and Ubl selection. Chemical shift perturbation and mutational analysis further demonstrate the importance of specific residues, particularly Cys996, in maintaining UFD's structural integrity and binding capacity. Additionally, mutations designed to alter the flexibility and length of the loop region between UFD and UbcH8 show significant effects on binding, indicating that these regions are crucial for efficient E2 recruitment.

While evolution of gene regulation has been extensively studied by comparative functional genomics [3, 4], the role of fluctuating environments in selecting for, shaping, and maintaining gene regulatory networks has not been elucidated. Laboratory evolution experiments find that under metabolic fluctuations, regulation of metabolic genes is often lost, leading to their constitutive expression [5-8]. To identify general properties of fluctuating environments that tune expression levels and select for gene regulation, we quantify the impact of regulation on fitness in strains with perturbed gene expression dynamics under metabolic fluctuations. We reveal that expression levels can be shaped by selection to enhance phenotypic memory of past environmental states, reducing the impact of gene induction lags on long-term population growth. By quantifying growth dynamics in a wide range of metabolic fluctuations, we identify catabolite symport flux as a key determinant of selection for gene regulation. By independently perturbing the ability to sense the environment and the control of expression levels, we discover sign epistasis between sensing and control in a gene regulatory network, and identify its molecular underpinnings. Due to this epistatic interaction, maintenance of sensing enhances the ability of evolution to tune gene expression levels in a fluctuating environment.

Yet for temperate phages, the genetic and functional basis of this specificity remains less well understood. Depolymerases appear unexpectedly rare in prophage genomes, raising unresolved questions about which prophage genes mediate capsule tropism, whether this apparent scarcity reflects biological or ecological differences versus annotation limits, and whether prophage-encoded receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) are functionally active. To address these questions, we analysed 3,900 Klebsiella genomes from diverse ecological niches to identify prophage-encoded proteins mediating capsule tropism. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlating prophage protein clusters (from 8,105 prophages) with confidently assigned bacterial K-loci. GWAS identified high-confidence predictors for 16 out of 35 most diverse K-loci, of which 14 were receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) belonging to classical depolymerases (n=6), SGNH hydrolases which deacetylate polysaccharides (n=6), and structurally novel RBPs (n=2). Overall, we predicted K-locus specificity for 26 putative depolymerases, of which 12 were deemed as strong predictions against 10 K-loci. In parallel, we attempted recombinant production of 50 putative depolymerases selected from 469 candidate proteins identified in prophages from a representative subset of 99 bacterial isolates, together with an additional 10 depolymerases selected based on GWAS predictions. All recombinant proteins were tested against a Klebsiella reference panel of 119 K-types. Of the 50 manually chosen putative depolymerases, 34 failed to yield detectable recombinant expression, a pattern unlikely to be explained by degraded or defective prophages. Of the 14 active enzymes, 5 targeted a K-locus different from that of their bacterial host, and enzyme specificity could not always be reliably inferred from sequence similarity or structural homology. Comparison of GWAS predictions with experimental validation results revealed that 10 of the 12 strongest GWAS predictors were confirmed experimentally, while 2 produced soluble protein but showed no detectable activity against the tested K-types. Together, these results highlight the intrinsic difficulty of predicting activity and capsule specificity of prophage-encoded RBPs from genomic information alone. Finally, analysis of 4,598 high-completeness prophages revealed that SGNH-domain hydrolases are among the most prevalent enzymatic domains in prophage RBPs. Two SGNH-domain RBPs identified by GWAS were experimentally confirmed as active esterases, supporting capsule deacetylation as a widespread alternative to polysaccharide depolymerisation in temperate phages. Our findings reveal that Klebsiella prophages encode structurally diverse RBPs, suggesting temperate phages may rely not only on depolymerisation but also on capsule modification---such as deacetylation---for infection. This also implies that capsule diversity in K. pneumoniae may be substantially underestimated, with implications for phage specificity, competition and vaccine design.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Our results show that mutations within the ATP-binding regions cause local rearrangements at the nucleotide-binding sites, affecting the interface between the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) relative to wild-type CFTR, rather than abolishing ATP binding entirely. We further indicate that, for the NBDs to approach one another productively, protonation of the aspartate side chains in G551D and G1349D CFTR may be necessary to mitigate charge repulsion. The F508del mutation induces increased rigidity within the protein core, impeding the rearrangement of transmembrane helices required for channel opening. Ivacaftor does not directly perturb the ATP-binding sites, consistent with emerging evidence that it exerts its effects allosterically on regions distal to the nucleotide-binding sites. Collectively, our findings enhance our understanding of CFTR dynamics and provide a versatile framework for exploring the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations and evaluating potential therapeutic agents.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Leveraging data from over 16,300 ancient individuals, we apply this method to identify a set of a million SNPs that we call the \"Compatibility\" panel, and which has been effectively assayed in a large fraction of ancient human DNA experiments published to date. We also identify a subset of these SNPs, the \"Compatibility-HO\" panel, which further restricts to positions that have been assayed in more than ten thousand modern individuals from more than a thousand diverse populations using the Affymetrix Human Origins (HO) genotyping array. The Compatibility panel reduces spurious Z-scores due to different sequencing platforms by nearly an order of magnitude, while retaining around 65-85% of statistical power for f-statistic analysis.

Codon usage bias or CUB modulates mRNA stability translation kinetics and cotranslational protein folding. While well characterized in unicellular organisms the regulatory scope of CUB in humans remains incompletely defined. Here we present a genome wide analysis of codon usage across approximately 20000 human protein coding genes. Genes with the strongest codon bias are enriched in high stoichiometry processes including epidermal differentiation and oxygen and carbon dioxide transport and harbor fewer synonymous variants than expected with a correlation of minus 0.24 and a highly significant p value. Codon optimization is spatially regulated such that structured protein domains show stronger bias than intrinsically disordered regions consistent with cotranslational folding constraints. Frequently used codons are supported by higher cognate tRNA gene copy numbers with a positive correlation of 0.49 consistent with translational selection. After correcting for GC3 content correlations between ENC and adaptation indices largely disappear allowing mutational pressure to be disentangled from translational selection. Together these results establish codon usage bias as a selectively constrained feature of the human genome and provide a framework for interpreting synonymous variation in functional genomics and guiding evolutionary and translational analyses across biological contexts.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Targeted chromocenter disruption in Drosophila testes subjected to natural and artificial mechanical stress compromises nuclear mechanostability, leading to deformed nuclei, DNA damage, and chromosome breaks. Conversely, enhancing chromocenter coalescence through genetic means improves mechanostability. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that chromocenters enable physically linked chromosomes to respond collectively, rather than individually, to mechanical challenge, and dissipate external forces over a larger nuclear surface.

Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed considerable inconsistencies in how fatigue and motor learning were defined and measured. None of the studies examined the effect of fatigue induced by combined physical and cognitive exertion, and only 7 studies investigated fatigue induced by cognitive exertion. Acuity tasks were the most frequently used to assess motor learning, employed in 14 studies. Notably, all participants were between 16.5 and 31 years of age, and reporting of key demographic and physiological characteristics such as sex, gender, physical activity level, and body mass index was inconsistent or absent. This review highlights the need for comprehensive definitions of both fatigue and motor learning to improve consistency and reproducibility across studies. Given the limited research on the effects of fatigue induced by cognitive and combined physical and cognitive exertion, future studies should prioritize using these experimental manipulations. Also, future studies should diversify the motor learning tasks used in research to allow both direct and conceptual replication.

Using interspecific crosses, we identify the genetic basis of the caudal horn size difference between Bombyx mori and its closest relative B. mandarina. One major QTL contributes more than 10% to the mean horn length difference between the two species. This QTL encompasses a conserved Wnt-family gene cluster, key upstream regulators that are well-known for their roles in morphological diversification in animals. Using allele-specific expression analysis and CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts, we show that cis-regulatory changes to Wnt1 and Wnt6 contribute to the species difference in caudal horn size.

NMDAR disruptions, including pharmacological blockade and anti-NMDAR encephalitis, can mimic symptoms of schizophrenia. These observations support the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, which posits that symptoms arise from abnormal corticolimbic glutamatergic signaling. Further evidence for this theory includes abnormal expression of NMDARs and decreased dendritic spine density in the PFC of individuals with schizophrenia, as well as altered spine density and synaptic transmission caused by genetic manipulation of NMDARs. However, it is unknown how progressive loss of NMDAR function in the PFC during adolescence - a developmental time period associated with significant synaptic pruning and symptom onset in schizophrenia - affects excitatory synaptic structure and function. In this study, we used in vivo genome editing to ablate expression of the Grin1 gene, which encodes the obligate GluN1 subunit of NMDARs, in medial PFC neurons of female and male adolescent mice. We assessed synaptic density and function in layer V pyramidal neurons at multiple time points using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, integrated with confocal imaging of dendritic spine architecture in recorded neurons. NMDAR ablation caused an early decrease in basilar dendritic spine density, followed by a rebound in spine density and corresponding increase in AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting that synaptic compensation maintains an allostatic set point. Our findings demonstrate that NMDAR ablation initially disrupts local PFC networks, followed by recovery via compensatory processes that could be impaired in disease states.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

A hallmark of meiosis is widespread post-transcriptional regulation, including delayed translation to ensure timely protein production at specific meiotic stages.

We show that CDM1 affects several meiotic processes, including chromosome recombination, condensation, and cytokinesis. CDM1 localizes to dynamic cytoplasmic foci that closely associate with components of processing bodies and stress granules, forming three-phase condensate assemblies. Biochemical and cellular assays reveal that CDM1 is an RNA-binding protein with an intrinsic ability to drive the formation of ribonucleoprotein condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDM1 binds mRNAs present in prophase I and represses their translation until later meiotic stages, coinciding with the disassembly of CDM1 condensates. These findings identify CDM1 as a post-transcriptional regulator that fine-tunes the expression of meiotic genes to ensure proper progression of microsporogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Flowering plants (angiosperms), the dominant terrestrial clade, exhibit maximal biochemical complexity, extraordinary species diversity (over 100,000 species), relatively recent origins (~160 million years), ~200-fold variation in genome size and relative compact coding regions compared with other eukaryotes. These features present both a unique challenge and opportunity for pre-training DNA language models to understand plant-specific evolutionary conservation, regulatory architectures and genomic functions. Here, we introduce PlantCAD2, a long-context, plant-specific DNA language model with single-nucleotide resolution, pre-trained on 65 angiosperm genomes, together with a series of cross-species public benchmarks for evaluation. Comprehensive zero-shot testing shows that PlantCAD2 (676 million parameters) efficiently captures evolutionary conservation, surpassing the 7-billion-parameter Evo2 model in 10 of 12 tasks. With parameter-efficient fine-tuning, PlantCAD2 also outperforms the 1-billion-parameter AgroNT across seven cross-species tasks. Moreover, its 8 kb context window substantially improves accessible chromatin prediction in large genomes such as maize (AUPRC increasing from 0.587 to 0.711), underscoring the importance of long-range context for modeling distal regulation.

P.; Rubiano-Buitrago, P.", "abstract": "In classic coevolutionary interactions, host plants are thought to accrue novel chemical defenses which are later countered by detoxification strategies and sometimes sequestration in specialist herbivores. We recently discovered that unusual nitrogen- and sulfur-containing (N,S-) cardenolides in some milkweed species are highly toxic, and broken down to less toxic forms which are sequestered by monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). Here we isolated and purified five dominant cardenolide toxins from the tropical milkweed, Asclepias curassavica, a globally abundant host plant of monarchs, and fed them to caterpillars individually or in mixture. We hypothesized that the two N,S-cardenolides in A. curassavica (uscharin and voruscharin) would reduce caterpillar growth and sequestration more than other abundant related cardenolides (15-Hydroxy calotropin, frugoside, calactin). Overall, cardenolide treatments caused monarchs to feed more and grow more compared to controls; nonetheless, one N,S-cardenolide (voruscharin) was not stimulatory and caused substantial reductions in growth efficiency. Consuming N,S-cardenolides caused caterpillars to sequester the lowest total amounts of cardenolides, and also reduced their efficiency of sequestration. We next tested the phytochemical diversity hypothesis, that toxin mixtures pose a substantial burden for caterpillars compared to individual compounds provided in equimolar concentrations. We prepared two types of mixtures, one containing equal concentrations of the five compounds and another \"realistic mixture\" where toxin concentrations reflect their natural proportions in leaves. Mixtures had a negative impact on caterpillar feeding, growth, sequestration, and sequestration efficiency compared to the average of single compounds. The equal and realistic mixtures had similar impacts on feeding and growth, but feeding on the realistic mixture resulted in the lowest sequestration. We conclude that as a result of coevolutionary interactions, even sequestering herbivores may be thwarted by highly specialized plant metabolites such as N,S-cardenolides, and that phytochemical mixtures strengthen plant defense. Toxin mixtures likely challenge detoxification and transport of plant defenses, reducing the herbivores growth and sequestration.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Only 1.0% of the 861,591 possible descending-descending neuron pairs form such contacts, but when present, synaptic strength grows linearly with partner number regardless of transmitter identity. By definition, any synapse connected to a descending neuron within the cord is axo-axonic. Thus, we uncovered the ascending-descending and interneurons-descending axo-axonic relationship. Neurons with many partners (high-degree nodes) integrate into the network without clustering into a densely interconnected 'rich-club' of hubs. The connectome identified an octet of ascending neurons (AN08B098) whose axo-axonic input to the Giant Fiber descending neurons (DNp01) predicted modulation of escape control.

Upon oligomerization at the plasma membrane, RTKs become activated and initiate major downstream signaling cascades, such as the ERK pathway, which modulates cytoskeletal dynamics through phosphorylation of cytoskeletal regulators, regulation of actin-binding proteins, and transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes involved in cell structure and motility. Light-inducible RTK systems have been developed to achieve spatiotemporal control of RTK clustering and activation for both basic cell biology research, and engineered applications, such as controlling cell migration, proliferation, or differentiation. However, these systems are limited by high basal RTK activation, where substantial RTK activation occurs even before induction, leading to unintended ERK activation and downstream effects. Here, we report a chemically inducible RTK platform that minimizes basal activation while enabling direct visualization of RTK clustering at the plasma membrane upon induction. Single-cell imaging reveals visible RTK clusters after induction, with total RTK abundance in the clusters correlating with ERK phosphorylation levels. Using this system, we achieved precise and rapid control over multiple ERK-dependent cellular processes, including disassembly of spectrin-based membrane skeleton and nuclear entry of transcription factors STAT3 and CREB, while maintaining minimal basal activity before induction. In contrast to previously developed inducible RTK systems, which can perturb cytoskeletal structures or transcription factor dynamics even without stimulation, our design preserves native cellular architecture and nuclear signaling until activation is intentionally triggered.

To mitigate this issue, we propose that systematic sensitivity analysis should be a mandatory step in GSMN validation. This approach quantitatively assesses the reliability of flux predictions by probing a model's responsiveness to perturbations in its core objective function and environmental inputs. We demonstrate this approach using the fungus model Penicillium rubens iPrub22. First, we evaluate the sensitivity of predicted fluxes to variations in the stoichiometric coefficients of the biomass reaction. Then, we examine the model's metabolic behaviour under alternative nutrient conditions. Finally, we assess whether secondary metabolite production, governed by its own regulatory logic, remains robust to changes in the biomass objective function formulated for growth.

Physiological and transcriptomic profiling across source and sink tissues revealed that biomass partitioning to flowers shifted only under complete phosphate withdrawal. Analyses of key phosphate-responsive genes highlighted the involvement of lipid biosynthesis, glycolysis, and phosphate mobilization from organic pools. In contrast to source tissues, phospholipid biosynthesis remained active in sink organs. While the transcriptional response of key regulators, such as SPX DOMAIN GENE (SPX), PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR1 (NIGT1) followed canonical patterns, high-affinity nitrate and phosphate transporters remained expressed at elevated Pi.

One possibility is that this continuous flow is enabled by a seamless stream of cortical activity. However, emerging evidence suggests that even during ongoing behaviors, cortical neural populations undergo brief periods of silence. This 'off-state' can be detected as wake slow waves in EEG, similar to the slow waves characterizing deep sleep. Here, we leveraged the spontaneously occurring fluctuations in smartphone touchscreen interactions in combination with EEG to investigate the dynamics of slow waves during behavior. We find that slow waves occur in bursts - characterized by short consecutive intervals - interleaved with longer periods of absent slow waves. During smartphone use, the probability of bursts increased compared to rest, and the duration of burst-absent periods was lower. During the bursts, however, the likelihood of generating smartphone interactions was substantially diminished. Conversely, the periods of absent slow waves were more permissive to the behavioral output. We propose that slow wave burst dynamics are state-dependent, configured to create temporal windows permissive to action generation. This configuration, in turn, allows behavioral outputs to leverage the windows of opportunity that emerge between slow wave bursts.

However, the relation between sequence composition and chain dynamics has rarely been studied. Here, we characterize the dynamics of a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of identical chain length but with highly diverse sequences. In spite of the strong variation of chain dimensions with sequence in this set inferred from single-molecule FRET, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy yields chain reconfiguration times that are almost independent of sequence. This surprising observation contrasts with the slowdown in dynamics, attributed to internal friction, that has been observed in more compact disordered proteins. We investigated this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies with near-quantitative accuracy, with explicit inclusion of the FRET dyes improving agreement with experiment while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble. Critically, the simulations also reproduce the lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across the sequences and allow us to rationalize this observation as arising from two competing factors as the chains get more compact. The narrowing of end-to-end distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the corresponding intrachain diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that end up resulting in only a small variation of reconfiguration times with chain dimensions. These compensating factors \"buffer\" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics, which may help to conserve function as sequences evolve.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

These adaptations are associated with an increased expression of hepatic de novo serine synthesis enzymes, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1). This study tested the hypothesis that enhanced hepatic serine synthesis is necessary for glucose and lipid adaptations to SAAR. Hepatocyte-specific PSAT1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) littermates were fed a high-fat control or SAAR diet. In WT mice, SAAR increased liver PSAT1 protein (~70-fold), serine concentration (~2-fold), and 13C-serine (~20-fold) following an intravenous infusion of [U-13C]glucose. The elevated liver serine and partitioning of circulating glucose to liver serine by SAAR were attenuated in KO mice. This was accompanied by a blunted improvement in glucose tolerance in KO mice fed a SAAR diet. Interestingly, SAAR decreased liver lysine lactoylation, a SAA-supported post-translational modification known to inhibit PHGDH enzymatic activity. This suggests dietary SAAR may increase serine synthesis, in part, by lowering lysine lactoylation. Beyond glucose metabolism, dietary SAAR reduced body weight, adiposity, and liver triglycerides similarly in WT and KO mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that hepatic PSAT1 is necessary for glucose, but not lipid, adaptations to SAAR.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a crucial role for the lipid transport protein PDZD8 in maintaining basal ganglia circuit integrity. PDZD8 deficiency leads to marked lipid and lipofuscin accumulation selectively in the SNr, accompanied by enhanced striatal inhibitory inputs and reduced SNr projections to the ventromedial thalamus (VM) and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (SNc, VTA). This circuit reorganization results in functional disinhibition and hyperactivation of dopaminergic neurons, producing maladaptive reinforcement of striatal inhibition. Our previous findings revealed that PDZD8 deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired fear memory, behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings demonstrate that lipid accumulation in the SNr disrupts inhibitory output and dopaminergic regulation, forming a maladaptive basal ganglia thalamocortical loop.

These organelles are part of the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells, which mediates many processes, including secretion of proteins to the exterior of the cell, uptake of material by endocytosis, and compartmentalized degradation of cellular components. The period of eukaryogenesis after the merger of prokaryotic lineages but preceding the last eukaryotic common ancestor, is inferred to have involved a progressive increase in cellular complexity through expansion of organelle-specific protein machineries. However, the steps and stages of organelle emergence during this period are poorly understood as no extant organisms exist from this period, precluding the use of comparative genomics to determine the properties of ancestral proteins present. Membrane trafficking pathways linking organelles are regulated by Arf family GTPases, including Arf1 and Arf6, both present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Here we use ancestral sequence reconstruction and molecular cell biological characterization to explore the properties of the ancestor of the Arf1 and Arf6 GTPases. Arf1 has a major function at the Golgi apparatus in regulation of the secretory pathway, whereas Arf6 regulates endocytic pathways at the plasma membrane and endosomes. Our results indicate that the ancestral Arf1/6 protein localizes to both the Golgi and the plasma membrane. We find that localization to the plasma membrane is due to a C-terminal polybasic motif that unexpectedly is also found in a number of modern Arf1 proteins from a wide diversity of eukaryotes. Our data suggest that the ancestral Arf protein acted at both internal compartments and the cell periphery, a feature preserved in a number of modern Arf1 proteins.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, immature OSNs respond selectively to odorants and exhibit graded responses in a higher concentration range than mature OSNs, suggesting that they provide a distinct odor input stream. Finally, in mice that lack mature OSNs, sensory input from immature OSNs is sufficient to mediate odor detection and discrimination behavior. What remains unknown, however, is how these immature OSNs contribute to odor-guided behavior in the healthy, intact olfactory system. Here we show, using male and female mice, that chemogenetically silencing immature OSNs impairs odor detection ability without affecting their odor discrimination ability. Furthermore, immature OSN silencing reduces the amplitude of odor-evoked dendritic calcium responses in OB neurons in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that immature OSNs provide distinct odor input that complements mature OSN input to contribute to odor-guided behaviors in the healthy, intact olfactory system.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here we develop a trait-based consumer-resource framework to test how recipient populations reshape the ecological niches of their feeders and competitors. Invasion analysis shows that recipients expand either their feeder's or the feeder's competitor's niche, depending on the populations' relative competitive abilities on limiting resources. In terms of biogeochemistry, ecological outcomes result in diverse N-loss pathways; specifically, when growth is limited by both organic matter and nitrate, we observe increased nitrous oxide production. Additionally, the model suggests that anammox bacteria occupy a wider range of organic matter and nitrate supply regimes than denitrifying populations, consistent with their more frequent detection across diverse marine environments.

To resolve this longstanding controversy, we developed a mechanistic model that integrates seemingly contradictory experimental observations into a coherent explanatory framework. Using an optimized multi-level rule-based modeling approach the model explicitly captures lateral membrane organization, receptor complex dynamics, endocytic routing and downstream signaling. Simulations reveal a previously unrecognized compensatory mechanism in which rapid recycling of partially immobilized receptor assemblies amplifies and stabilizes signalosome formation. The results further indicate that internalization and recycling are essential for stable long-term {beta}-catenin activation, offering an explanation why these processes are required for excessive signaling in cancer cells. The model further predicts that ordered membrane domains enhance signaling not merely by colocalizing receptors and DVL but by increasing effective residence time through rebinding-driven cluster stabilization. Integrating diverse experimental measurements into a unified simulation framework quantitatively reconciles conflicting experimental reports on the necessity of receptor internalization for pathway activation.

We discovered genes that encode more immunogenic peptides and that are involved in developmental pathways are more potent in recruiting T cells to local tumor sites, while the recruitment of B cells and macrophages is stipulated by a different molecular program.

An alternative approach, structure-based protein-protein docking, predicts the bound complex structure from the unbound monomer structures without requiring MSAs. In this work, we propose a novel method to adapt co-folding models for structure-based protein-protein docking by replacing their template module with a docking module, followed by training end-to-end with a flow-matching objective. We apply our method to AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) using the OpenFold implementation and transform it into a generative docking model, which we name AF2Dock. We evaluate AF2Dock and various baseline methods on the PINDER-AF2 benchmark and an antibody/nanobody test set. When using non-holo inputs, AF2Dock shows competitive performance compared to other structure-based docking methods and, in the case of nanobody complexes, outperforms all other docking methods tested here. Although AF2Dock underperforms co-folding AF-M and AF3 in success rates when using non-holo inputs, it produces orthogonal predictions and successfully identifies correct structures for targets where co-folding models fail. Ablation studies confirm that full-parameter fine-tuning of the AF-M components is critical for performance and reveal that, surprisingly, the inclusion of ESM embeddings can hinder success rates in certain cases such as nanobody complexes.

As brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can directly connect the brain and the external world by yielding comparable motor outcomes with artificial apparatus, a central question is whether the BMI-controlled movements share neural dynamics or underlying mechanism with natural movements. To enable a systematic comparison, we developed a feedforward BMI framework with distinct planning and executing epochs that enables ballistic cursor control to intercept moving targets. This BMI allowed monkeys to voluntarily initiate neural states which controlled the direction and timing to launch a ballistic movement, like skeet shooting. Based on this, we found similar neural representations and computational structures across arm- and brain-controlled conditions. Notably, in addition to resembling the rotational structure in natural reaching, the neural population dynamics during open-loop BMI also shared preserved manifolds with those during reaching arm movements. These findings suggest a fundamental principle, and reveal a set of basic computational motifs for the neural control of movement in an abstract hierarchy in the absence of constraints from actuators.

Here, we leveraged a large collection of C. auris isolates from multi-facility clinical outbreaks within the same urban area to identify genomic patho-adaptations that promote persistence and dissemination in the healthcare environment. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed loss-of-function mutations in the uncharacterized C. auris transcription factor gene RBA1 to have independently emerged multiple times within these outbreaks. We provide evidence that loss of RBA1 results in increased C. auris adhesion to plastic and human keratinocytes, enhances biofilm formation in multiple conditions, and exacerbates fungal burden in a mouse model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Finally, we uncover that loss-of-function mutations in RBA1 have independently emerged during multiple outbreaks of C. auris infections across the globe, and that RBA1 mutant lineages are present among isolates collected from large ongoing clinical outbreaks. Taken together, the results of this study reveal loss-of-function mutations in the C. auris RBA1 as a novel and clinically relevant genetic determinant of enhanced outbreak characteristics and virulence factor-gene expression.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

One such condition is autoimmune uveitis, a sight-threatening ocular inflammation driven by retina-specific T cells. Using a model of spontaneous experimental autoimmune uveitis (sEAU) we showed that gut commensals provide immune stimuli that trigger the disease. Here we report that uveitis-promoting microbes are present in human gut flora and that colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with commensal flora from healthy human donors was sufficient to provoke disease. Severity of sEAU correlated with expansion of Akkermansia and contraction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing Firmicutes, followed by decreased SCFA levels and a dominant gut Th1 effector response. Mechanistic gain-of-function experiments, enriching GF sEAU mice with Akkermansia, reproduced these microbiome, metabolite and immune phenotype shifts, and exacerbated disease. We propose that Akkermansia promotes autoimmunity by outcompeting SCFA-producers and enhancing Th1-type responses. Notably, an inverse correlation between Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobia) and Firmicutes was also present in fecal microbiome of patients with uveitis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. These findings reveal a stereotypic gut microbial interaction network that regulates systemic immune balance, and may represent an ecologically conserved mechanism through which the gut microbiome modulates autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

P.; Klinman, J. P.", "abstract": "Enzyme catalysis has been shown to depend on distal pathways that channel thermal energy from solvent to the active site. In soybean lipoxygenase (SLO), experiments identified a cone-shaped network connecting loop residue Gln322 to Leu546 but not Leu754 in the active site. Here, microsecond molecular dynamics and a correlated motion-based protocol provide an atomistic analysis of such long-range communication. The developed approach enables systematic screening of communication between active site-specific residues that directly contact bound substrate and surface-exposed residues at the protein/solvent interfaces. In doing so, it provides a deeper molecular insight into experimentally mapped networks by resolving communication trends across diverse conformational ensembles. The simulations recover the experimentally demonstrated thermal initiation loop and the Leu546-directed cone in SLO, exclude the negative-control Ser596, and explain the preference for Leu546 over Leu754 through shorter, more correlated helical pathways. Mutational analysis further reveals the impact of single-site mutations on the network preference between Leu546 and Leu754. These results unify experiments and computation, corroborating an anisotropic channeling of thermal energy in SLO and establishing a general framework for computing distal intra-protein pathways that may enable the thermal activation of enzyme function.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

While antibody-based therapies exist, the development of small-molecule inhibitors has been hindered by the flat, featureless binding interface. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, druggable cryptic pocket within the SIRP D1 domain (the WYF pocket), revealed through a structure-based fragment screening campaign using x-ray crystallography. This pocket, defined by residues Trp38, Tyr50, and Phe74, is only accessible in a conformation that is incompatible with CD47 binding, making it a candidate for structure-based drug design and immune checkpoint inhibitor development. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biophysical assays, we demonstrate that access to this cryptic site is dynamically controlled by a single \"gatekeeper\" residue, Gln52. The rotameric state of Gln52 dictates a conformational equilibrium between a \"closed,\" state and a ligand-accessible \"open\" state. We validated this mechanism by engineering SIRP mutants to bias this equilibrium. A Q52F mutation locked the pocket in a closed state, abolishing both CD47 and fragment binding, while Q52A and Q52R mutations biased the protein toward an open state. These \"open-biased\" mutants not only exhibited decreased affinity for CD47 but also significantly improved binding to small-molecule fragments that inhibit the SIRP-CD47 interaction. This work reveals the intrinsic conformational plasticity of SIRP and establishes a validated structure-based roadmap for a new class of allosteric inhibitors. This 'flexibility-for-inhibition' strategy functions by trapping a non-binding conformation and represents a broadly applicable framework for targeting this and other challenging immune checkpoints.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular composition of cell type-specific brain EVs, particularly astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs), remains poorly defined. We performed comparative proteomic analysis of neuronal (NDEVs), microglial (MDEVs), and astrocytic (ADEVs) from mouse brain using magnetic immunocapture and LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. Each EV subtype displayed distinct molecular fingerprints. NDEVs were enriched in synaptic and neurogenesis-related proteins (e.g., APP, SNAP25, GPR158 and BDNF), whereas MDEVs contained immune and phagocytic markers (e.g., TMEM119, CX3CR1, CD11B). Strikingly, the ADEV proteome closely mirrored the recently characterized GlialCAM interactome from leukodystrophy research, encompassing GlialCAM/MLC1 and associated partners involved in ion and water homeostasis (EAAT1/2, AQP4, GJA1), together with GPCRs such as GPRC5B. This overlap suggests that ADEVs encapsulate a molecular scaffold characteristic of astrocytic endfeet, potentially extending their signaling functions to the extracellular space. In conclusion, our study provides a detailed comparative proteomic characterization of brain cell type-specific EVs, revealing that ADEVs contain the GlialCAM/MLC1 network and GPCRs.

It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes causing cell death followed by stromal cell activation and scar deposition at later disease stages. While a marked accumulation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells is observed in MASH in humans and mice, the role of adaptive immune cells in fibrosis progression remains debated.\n\nMethodsTranscriptional data were curated from human datasets and preclinical mouse models, including mice deficient in TCR{beta} T cells (Tcrb-/-), which lack conventional CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic T cells, in diet-induced fibrosing MASH for single-cell RNA-sequencing. Specific human and mouse liver transcriptomic immune signatures were corroborated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.\n\nResultsMASH was associated with the expansion of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Auto-aggressive CXCR6+PD1+FASLG+ CD8 T cells were enriched in livers of high-fat-diet-fed mice and correlated with MASH and fibrosis. Notably, Tcrb-deficient mice in a chemical and dietary preclinical MASH model developed fibrosis to the same extent as wild-type mice and exhibited exacerbated pro-fibrotic type 3 inflammation. Loss of conventional CD8 T cells neither impacted myeloid cell number nor phenotype within the fibrotic niche. Neutrophil- and non-conventional lymphocyte-derived GM-CSF and IL-17A were central drivers in the fibrotic niche composed of pathogenic macrophages and activated myofibroblasts. Furthermore, myeloid cells were identified as the main source of CXCL16 in diseased livers, retaining auto-aggressive CD8 T cells to the scar and contributing to their accumulation. Thus, non-adaptive cells, including scar-associated macrophages (SAMs) and myofibroblasts, are sufficient for MASH-driven fibrosis in this model.\n\nConclusionsTargeting myeloid cells and fibroblasts should be prioritized as anti-fibrotic therapies for MASH.\n\nGraphical abstractThe immunopathological niche in fibrosis\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/694415v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3347corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1caf433org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1667167org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f23f6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAdaptive and innate immune cells localize to the human MASH fibrotic niche\nC_LIO_LICD8 T cells increase with MASH severity while MHC-II+ cells accumulate with fibrosis\nC_LIO_LICXCR6+FASLG+ CD8 auto-aggressive T cells accumulate at the scar\nC_LIO_LICXCL16+ scar-associated macrophages retain CD8 T cells in the fibrotic MASH niche\nC_LIO_LILiver injury, inflammation and fibrosis persist in the absence of conventional T cells\nC_LI\n\nImpact and implicationsMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease in which fibrosis is a key determinant of patient outcomes and survival.

Currently, most insights into these pathways come from bulk assays that obscure the fate of individual virions, thereby concealing intricate mechanistic details that can inform on therapeutic intervention strategies. Here, we applied single-particle fluorescence imaging to directly observe the early checkpoints of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry pathways and separate binding from internalization. Fluorescent virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with either G614 or Omicron BA.5 S protein variants were imaged on HEK293T-ACE2 (TMPRSS2-negative) and classified at the single-particle level as surface-interacting, crossing, or internal. At baseline, G614 VLPs show higher binding and a larger internalized share than BA.5 VLPs, revealing general divergence in early entry behavior between variants. A trivalent anti-S receptor-binding domain aptamer reduces G614 binding and lowers its internalization. Conversely, the aptamer does not block BA.5 VLP cell binding but increases its internalization efficiency. Pitstop 2, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, causes no significant change in this observation window, consistent with early clathrin-sensitive events having already progressed. Quantification of trajectories reveals variant-specific mobility: BA.5 displays higher step length than G614, consistent with greater lateral scanning and surface retention. Together, these compact single-particle readouts expose variant-resolved early checkpoints in entry and provide a simple platform to test how ligands and pathway probes shift binding and internalization.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

This study tested whether early post-stimulus signal magnitude in the sensory window (0-150 ms) predicts subsequent P300 amplitude (300-600 ms) at the single-trial level. Using data from the ERP CORE auditory oddball dataset (N = 40 participants; 1,661 accepted trials), early activity was quantified as root mean square (RMS) amplitude at electrode Fz. A linear mixed-effects model revealed a statistically reliable negative association between early RMS and P300 amplitude at Pz ({beta} = -0.064, SE = 0.0245, z = -2.61, p = 0.0085). However, early RMS explained minimal trial-level variance (R{superscript 2} = 0.0042), indicating a modest effect. Model diagnostics confirmed adequate assumptions for inference (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.9995, p = 0.9690). Exploratory complexity measures (permutation entropy, Lempel-Ziv) were not predictive. Because RMS reflects both signal magnitude and within-trial variability, the findings are most conservatively interpreted as evidence that higher early signal energy is associated with slightly reduced P300 amplitude, possibly reflecting resource competition, refractory effects, or state-dependent processing. The results provide methodologically rigorous evidence for a small but reliable coupling between early and late ERP components, while highlighting the importance of distinguishing amplitude-based measures from trial-to-trial variability.

In this study, the qualitative influence of commonly used extraction methods on the phytochemical composition of aromatic medicinal herbs was investigated using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Ten aromatic medicinal herbs belonging to the families Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, and Asteraceae were subjected to six extraction approaches: simple distillation, essential oil (essence) extraction, hydroalcoholic tincture, infusion, decoction, and decoction of distillate. All extracts were analyzed under standardized HPTLC conditions using silica gel 60 F254 plates, a toluene-ethyl acetate (93:7 v/v) mobile phase, anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid derivatization, and a standard as a reference compound. Across all investigated species, the extraction method exerted a stronger influence on band number, intensity, and polarity distribution than botanical differences among the herbs. Essential oil and tincture extracts consistently produced the highest diversity of bands, particularly in higher Rf regions corresponding to non-polar and semi-polar compounds. Aqueous methods, including infusion and decoction, predominantly yielded low-Rf polar bands with reduced overall diversity, while simple distillation showed minimal extraction efficiency.

Single-cell sequencing technologies allow for co-capture of TCR alpha and beta chains, and their antigen specificity can be determined through peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimer binding and capture of a co-attached barcode oligo. However, SC sequencing often includes a high level of dropouts and risk of cross-contamination. Similarly, barcoded pMHC readouts often suffer from significant background noise. These issues complicate the automatic assignment of pMHC recognition to TCR clonotypes. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method for data denoising - Improved T-cell Receptor Antigen Paring 2 (ITRAP2). This approach significantly reduces noise in single-cell pMHC readouts and allows for accurate identification of TCR specificity. ITRAP2 incorporates statistical tests and confidence metrics for each TCR-pMHC pairing, offering user flexibility in pairing rigor, and allows multiple pMHC assignments to the same T-cell clone in the event of cross-binding within the pMHC multimer library. We tested this method on an in-house generated dataset of 8141 single cells, screened for CD8 T-cell binding using a panel of 100 different barcode-labelled pMHC multimers holding virus-derived peptides, and on a larger public dataset from 10x Genomics with 208,589 T-cells evaluated for recognition using a panel of 50 different pMHCs. In both datasets, ITRAP2 was able to recover TCR-pMHC hits that were missed either when investigating the raw data or analyzing the data using alternative tools. Importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the pMHC multimer library is crucial for accurate pMHC-TCR pairing and that a minimum of 25 pMHC multimer should be included to optimally determine background characteristic, and assigning true positive events.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Both proteins are essential for efficient virus replication, but the intrinsic sequences that determine segment 7 splicing balance are not fully defined. Here, we systematically investigated how conserved cis-acting splicing elements regulate 7 splicing. We found that while the splice acceptor sequence is optimal, both potential upstream polypyrimidine tracts regulate splicing, the 5' region acting positively and the 3' region negatively to maintain M1 expression. We could not unambiguously identify the mRNA2 branch point, but two closely spaced motifs can act redundantly. Saturation mutagenesis of the mRNA2 splice donor sequence showed that it is nearly optimal but that nucleotides 51 and 55 modestly downregulate splicing efficiency. Most introduced mutations that change splicing balance are nonsynonymous in M1. Nevertheless, mutations in the polypyrimidine tract and branch points that significantly perturbed M1:M2 balance resulted in viable viruses. In contrast, the splice donor sequence was intolerant of mutation. We conclude that M1:M2 balance is maintained via suboptimal splice donor and polypyrimidine tract splicing signals, with the latter allowing more evolutionary flexibility to vary the ratio and/or M1 sequence.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The silver-ruthenium antimicrobial AGXX exerts potent bactericidal effects through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, its potential synergy with antibiotics has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we show that sublethal concentrations of AGXX strongly enhance aminoglycoside-mediated killing across a diverse panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive MDR clinical isolates, including highly aminoglycoside-resistant strains. Combinational treatments significantly reduced the effective concentrations of gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin required for bacterial killing. Mechanistic analyses revealed that AGXX/aminoglycoside co-treatment induces pronounced intracellular ROS accumulation, resulting in severe proteotoxic stress, extensive protein aggregation, and DNA damage. Scavenging ROS abolished synergistic killing, establishing oxidative imbalance as the primary driver of the synergy between both antimicrobials. We further identify polyphosphate as a key bacterial defense mechanism that mitigates ROS accumulation, proteotoxicity, and genotoxic stress during combinational treatment. Moreover, AGXX/aminoglycoside synergy was preserved in an artificial urine medium and across clinical UPEC isolates, underscoring its relevance to urinary tract infections. Together, these findings position AGXX as a potent aminoglycoside adjuvant that restores antibiotic efficacy through ROS-driven macromolecular damage, supporting its development for combination therapies against MDR bacterial infections.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Single hCOs were implanted into the retrosplenial cortex of adult immunodeficient mice and monitored for up to 8 months. Optical coherence tomography was used for label-free imaging of xenograft vascularization and structure, enabling quantitative assessments of capillary density and graft volume. To probe neuronal activity, human neurons were labeled with a calcium sensor before implantation using either adeno-associated or lentivirus for sparse or dense neuronal labeling, respectively. Fluorescent imaging was conducted using two-photon, widefield, and swept confocally-aligned planar excitation microscopy for single cell, whole-graft, and volumetric calcium imaging, respectively. Results from these modalities indicate an increase in neuronal activity and synchronicity over time during in vivo graft maturation.

In the brain, these chromatin changes are thought to underlie age-associated deficits in the activity-dependent gene transcription necessary for memory consolidation. Here, we show that the levels of a specific histone post-translational modification, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me3) is markedly increased in the hippocampus of aged mice and that the activity-induced increase in H3K4me3 that is observed in response to a learning stimulus in young mice, is severely blunted in the aged hippocampus. H3K4me3 typically marks open, accessible chromatin at the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of actively transcribed genes. We identify altered H3K4me3 peaks at TSSs and show that ca. 90% of the activity-induced H3K4me3 changes at TSSs are either absent or reduced in the aged hippocampus. To understand the biological significance of these age-associated changes, we screened a library of pharmacological compounds for compounds that can alter H3K4me3 levels in hippocampal neurons. We show that treatment of aged mice with one of these, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001, restored normal learning and memory in object location and recognition tasks. Furthermore, we show that ORY-1001 treatment increased long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity deficient in the aged hippocampus.

Cathodal tDCS was used to slightly reduce cortical excitability, thereby simulating a shifted brain state during CLAS and allowing us to compare the effects of standard CLAS to CLAS delivered under altered cortical conditions (CmodCLAS). Twenty-three participants [mean age (SD) 21.3 (2.6) years] completed two experimental nights: one with CLAS alone and one with CLAS combined with cathodal tDCS (CmodCLAS). Overnight retention on declarative memory tasks and morning learning performance were assessed. Memory outcomes revealed that CmodCLAS, but not CLAS alone, significantly improved overnight retention on the figural paired-associate task. In the EEG, CmodCLAS shifted the time-locked response to acoustic stimulation toward more negative potential values at the frontal region. CmodCLAS also prolonged slow oscillation (SO) duration at frontal sites while shortening SO duration at occipital sites, an effect not observed during standard CLAS. These findings demonstrate that the baseline level of cortical excitability during sleep modulates both the cognitive and electrophysiological effects of CLAS. They highlight the importance of brain state for non-invasive CLAS during sleep and suggest that CmodCLAS may serve as a useful approach for enhancing prefrontal cortical function during SWS.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We identify a ligand/receptor trafficking clock in rodent and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in which the cyclic turnover of Netrin-1 and its receptors Neo1 and Unc5b (NNU) governs self-renewal capacity and abscission dynamics. In G1, NNU complexes undergo Clathrin-mediated internalization and lysosomal degradation, a process required for timely post-mitotic bridge abscission. At later stages of the cycle, NNU activate Src within early endosomes, inducing a genome-wide redistribution of the transcriptional co-activator Yap1. This reshapes gene regulatory networks by activating stemness- and ectoderm-associated transcriptional programs enriched for Sox2/Nanog binding and by repressing mesodermal- and cell cycle-related targets enriched for Sox2 and Tcf3. Functionally, recombinant Netrin-1 reduces functional heterogeneity and enhances clonogenicity in G1, uncovering a tractable strategy to canalize stem cell behavior.

We introduce CLaSSiNet, a first-of-its-kind modular computational pipeline that integrates connectivity, 1D periodicity, and 2D regularity classifiers to automatically segment, classify, and map nanoscale network architectures with unprecedented classification resolution (~256 nm) in single-molecule localization microscopy datasets. CLaSSiNet uniquely distinguishes four organizational states (1D periodic networks, 2D polygonal ordered networks, disordered networks, and non-network states) and is robust to experimental noise and compatible with both node- and link-based labeling strategies. Using CLaSSiNet, we achieve the first spatially resolved, quantitative mapping of organizational heterogeneity in the actin-spectrin membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a broadly conserved membrane scaffold in animal cells. We uncover previously unrecognized subcellular patterning, with ordered 1D and 2D networks enriched at cell edges and junctions, while non-network states dominate the cell body. CLaSSiNet further reveals mechanical coupling principles: actin stress fibers bias the formation and orientation of 1D periodic networks and enrich nearby non-network regions, suggesting coordination between spectrin lattices and contractile actin bundles. Comparative analysis across cell types shows that neurons favor 1D periodic architectures in neurites and 2D polygonal networks in somas, whereas U2OS and 3T3 cells adopt these architectures to a lesser extent, highlighting cell-type-specific tuning of spectrin network design.

This taxane-induced release of GEF-H1 occurs rapidly, is independent of tubulin post-translational modifications, and can be recapitulated using purified proteins. In vitro reconstitution assays combined with analyses of microtubule structure revealed that microtubule binding by GEF-H1 is inhibited by microtubule-stabilizing agents that expand the microtubule lattice, such as taxanes and GMPCPP, but not by others, including GTP{gamma}S and discodermolide, which stabilize a compacted microtubule lattice.

DSB repair by NHEJ is very efficient at high damage levels of 1 or more DSBs per cell, much less efficient at lower damage levels and almost absent if only ~0.05 DSBs per cell are induced. Repair at this low DSB level can be induced if cells are pre-treated prior to DSB induction with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that the intracellular radical level modulates the efficiency of DSB repair at low damage levels. Here, we have investigated if the inefficiency of repair at low DSB levels contributes to the carcinogenic potential of DSBs or, counterintuitively, may serve as a mechanism to limit cancer development. We have analyzed the repair of high and low levels of radiation-induced DSBs in primary fibroblasts from 136 childhood cancer survivors, half of whom developed a second independent tumor later in life, and compared it to the response of primary fibroblasts from 68 individually matched cancer-free individuals. Although childhood cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals repaired DSBs at high damage levels equally efficiently, their response to low DSB levels differed drastically. While repair in cancer-free individuals was nearly absent at a level of ~0.05 DSBs per cell, childhood cancer survivors repaired DSBs at this low damage level as efficiently as after high damage levels. These results suggest that most of the cancer survivors analyzed here carry a genetic predisposition that affects their response to low levels of DSBs. They also support the idea that the absence of repair observed in cancer-free individuals represents a mechanism limiting cancer formation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated deletion of the gene encoding actin-binding protein profilin1 (Pfn1) leads to downregulation of PM PIP2 content in cells. This is also phenocopied when either Pfn1-actin interaction is genetically disrupted or F-actin is depolymerized implying that Pfn1-dependent PIP2 alteration could be somehow related to its actin-regulatory function. We further show that phospholipase C activity is critical for Pfn1-deficient cells to exhibit the PIP2-related phenotype. These findings, taken together with experimental evidence for select signatures of elevated PIP2 hydrolysis in Pfn1-deficient cells, raise a possibility that altered PIP2 hydrolysis may play a role in at least partly contributing to Pfn1-dependent regulation of PM PIP2. Furthermore, our lipidomic studies unexpectedly found that Pfn1 loss leads to dramatic alterations in several other important forms of cellular lipids, revealing a previously unrecognized role of Pfn1 as a broad regulator of cellular lipid environment that extends beyond PPI control.

Lipidomics revealed a selective enrichment of highly unsaturated CL species, accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of the cardiolipin biosynthetic and remodeling enzymes CDS1/2, PGS1, CRLS1, TAZ, and HADHA. Lipidomics also revealed a time-dependent increase in membrane-associated lipids including phosphatidylcholine (PC), serine, and phosphatidylinositol (PI).

Spatial imaging techniques confirmed cardiolipin accumulation and redistribution in differentiated cells, while Raman-based direct classical least squares (DCLS) analysis provided label free mapping of lipid species. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and protein protein interaction network analysis further identified biological pathways related to bone remodeling, cardiolipin metabolism, and osteoblast-specific signaling.

As a result, it is of critical importance to appropriately account for biological heterogeneity when calibrating mathematical models to infer cellular processes and predict behaviour. Recent approaches consider ordinary differential equations with random parameters to quantify heterogeneity in dynamical processes of cells. In this setting, statistical inference is performed to characterise the distribution of these random parameters within a cell population. One significant limitation of this approach is the tacit assumption that there are no substantial deviations in these distributions across experimental replicates. In this work, we propose a flexible Bayesian hierarchical differential equation modelling framework that quantifies and distinguishes both inter-experimental heterogeneity (heterogeneity between experimental replicates) and intra-experimental heterogeneity (biological heterogeneity within replicate populations). We consider two recent studies that employ mathematical models to interpret flow cytometry snap-shot data and quantify heterogeneity in nano-particle cell interactions and cell internalisation processes. Using simulation data, we demonstrate that substantial inaccuracy in the inferred dynamics can arise when experimental heterogeneity is not accounted for. By contrast, our hierarchical approach is robust to variability in inter-experimental and intra-experiemental heterogeneity and our method simplifies to previous methods when inter-experimental heterogeneity is negligible.

Hydrogen peroxide induced a dose-dependent delay in colony expansion in most deletion strains, yet 15 mutants consistently maintained robust growth.

Here, we characterize its cardiac aging profile and compare it with two other species: the deep-sea shark Etmopterus spinax and the short-lived teleost Nothobranchius furzeri. Histological analysis revealed extensive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis throughout the ventricular myocardium of S. microcephalus, affecting both compact and spongy layers of both sexes. This fibrotic pattern was absent in E. spinax and N. furzeri, suggesting it is a specific feature of S. microcephalus. We also observed extreme lipofuscin accumulation within cardiomyocytes of S. microcephalus, which correlates at the ultrastructural level with abundance of damaged mitochondria and the presence of strikingly enlarged lysosomes filled with electrondense material of likely mitochondrial origin. Additionally, in the myocardium of S. microcephalus we found abundant deposition of the oxidative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine. Remarkably, despite showing multiple canonical markers of aging such as fibrosis, lipofuscin accumulation, and oxidative damage, S. microcephalus individuals appeared healthy and physiologically uncompromised at the time of capture. These findings suggest that S. microcephalus has evolved resilience to molecular and tissue-level aging hallmarks, supporting sustained cardiac function over centuries and offering new insights into the mechanisms of extreme vertebrate longevity.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

To determine whether Pol II acts as a limiting factor for transcription, we combined acute perturbations with quantitative single-cell imaging and genome-wide profiling. We find that transcription remains stable across 70-180% of normal Pol II levels in human cells. This robustness emerges from hierarchical buffering mechanisms operating on distinct timescales. Within tens of minutes after monoallelic depletion of Pol II subunit POLR2A, cells maintain steady transcriptional output by drawing polymerases from a nucleoplasmic reserve pool. However, over hours, cellular Pol II holoenzyme levels also recover, driven by constitutive excess POLR2A subunit production rather than feedback sensing. Finally, strong depletion over days activates additional compensatory mechanisms. Together, these results reveal how temporal separation of buffering mechanisms provides robustness to perturbations of essential machinery, illuminating how cells maintain homeostatic control of essential complexes.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Group or atlas-based parcellation schemes use a shared common space, ensuring that each individual has the same number of brain parcels, which facilitates standard analytic approaches. However, studies reveal individual differences in the boundaries of brain areas. Extracting signals using atlas-based schemes can result in varying levels of blurring of signals across homogeneous areas within a specific individual's brain. Individualized parcellation schemes can be obtained when sufficient data are available; however, these approaches introduce a significant analytical challenge: the number of parcels and networks differ across individuals. Here, we introduce IndivSTATIS, a new multivariate method based on the STATIS framework, designed to integrate individualized parcellation schemes while maintaining comparability across participants in a shared component space. The resulting network/node component scores can be used to predict individual differences measures (e.g., age, behavior). By allowing individualized parcellations to be compared within a common component space, IndivSTATIS provides a solution for incorporating individual network variability into larger studies, with potential to improve the sensitivity and interpretability of functional brain markers across both basic neuroscience and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

It is not well understood how NAPs affect one another's binding and diffusion, and hence nucleoid organization, in different growth phases. We addressed this question by tracking single molecules of the non-specific NAP HU-PAmCherry in living Escherichia coli cells to investigate nucleoid organization and NAP-chromosome interactions. We analyzed the mobility of HU-PAmCherry in different growth phases and further examined how two NAPs, Dps and H-NS, impact HU dynamics. We found that HU mobility depends on the growth phase. In exponential phase, HU has two distinct mobility states: a fast-diffusing state and a slower, interacting state. In stationary phase, we observed a third population of very slow molecules, indicative of either stable HU binding or confinement within densely compacted DNA regions. This result supports reports of chromosome compaction and rigidification in deep stationary phase. We found that deletion of dps increases HU mobility in stationary phase, consistent with our previous finding that Dps promotes short-range DNA contacts and nucleoid compaction in deep stationary phase. Although hns deletion leads to nucleoid compaction in exponential phase, we measured overall faster HU diffusion in exponential-phase {Delta}hns cells as well as an additional third population of very slow HU molecules in these cells. In stationary phase, deleting hns increases the fraction of these stably bound HU molecules. Together, our results show that growth-phase-dependent nucleoid reorganization by Dps and H-NS influences the behavior and function of other NAPs.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

To model PD pathology in vitro, preformed fibrils of -syn (PFFs), which can be taken up by cells, provide a seed that drives misfolding and aggregation of endogenous -syn, with new aggregates amplifying this process. External application of PFFs to dopaminergic neurons (DNs) increases aggregate formation, marked by -syn phosphorylation at serine 129 (pS129-syn), a pathological PD marker. Building on this, we developed an automated synuclein seeding assay to quantify new -syn aggregates in iPSC-derived DNs. Using pS129-syn as a readout, we show that PFFs elicit a time- and dose-dependent increase in pS129-syn aggregates. Our high-throughput assay further revealed that aggregate formation depends on endogenous -syn levels. Treatment with PFFs produced a greater increase in pS129-syn aggregates in iPSC DNs derived from a PD patient with a triplication in the SNCA gene, which encodes the -syn protein and which elevates total -syn levels, relative to DNs from an isogenic iPSC line from the same individual, in which the SNCA gene mutation had been corrected by CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast, no pS129-syn signal was detected in neurons in which all copies of the SNCA gene had been knocked out (KO).

Understanding signaling pathways that mitigate exhaustion and reinvigorate CD8+ T cell effector function is a key goal for immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we show that an activating mutant of phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) led to a reduction of FoxO1-dependent TCF-1+ stem-like progenitor CD8+ T cells that are required for sustaining antigen-specific T cells in response to chronic viral infection. Nonetheless, mice expressing activated PI3Kdelta maintained CD8+ T cell responses that were skewed instead towards effector-like cells in a FoxO1-independent manner, associated with an amplified IL-21-STAT3 response axis and improved viral control. Activated PI3Kdelta limited TOX expression, prevented epigenetic changes associated with T cell exhaustion, and promoted effector differentiation and function from both progenitor stem-like cells and cells with an exhausted phenotype. Together, this work uncovers a key role for PI3Kdelta activation in shaping the balance and plasticity between effector function and exhaustion while promoting T cell persistence during chronic infection, providing insight for immunotherapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Sustained treatment with low-dose tamoxifen depletes subcutaneous adipocyte progenitors and promotes glucose intolerance and hepatic lipid deposition in obese female mice. Hyperplastic adipose tissue expansion, especially in subcutaneous depots, preserves metabolic health during a chronic positive energy balance by facilitating nutrient storage and attenuating inflammation. Adipocyte progenitors are renewed in part through Wnt signaling pathway activation, which is altered in women with obesity or T2D. Estrogen receptors are expressed in several adipose cell types, but the distinct actions of tamoxifen in adipocyte progenitors and the mechanisms that explain their depletion during endocrine therapy are not defined. The direct impact of tamoxifen was evaluated in subcutaneous adipose stromal cells from humans and adult mice. Self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation were measured, and analyses of gene expression and progenitor or preadipocyte populations were performed. Mechanistic insight was gained from primary adipose stromal cells of obese female mice, in which the Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (Wisp2) was lost following endocrine therapy. Wisp2 gain and loss of function studies were carried out in adipose stromal cells to define the link between estrogen signaling and adipocyte progenitor maintenance. We found that tamoxifen treatment disrupts the protection of adipocyte progenitors by estrogen, mediated through suppression of Wisp2.

While the role of polarity proteins is well-established in epithelial systems, their function in mammalian cardiomyocytes remains poorly understood. Global deletion of the polarity protein, Llgl1, has been shown to impair cardiac trabeculation and disrupt cardiomyocyte junctions in zebrafish. Here, we investigate the role of Llgl1 in mammalian cardiomyocyte function. Methods: We developed a mouse model whereby Llgl1 is deleted from cardiomyocytes (Llgl1CKO) and assessed cardiomyocyte intercalated disc integrity, cell cycle activity, cardiac function, and electrophysiology. We subjected mice to myocardial infarction to test if permanent Llgl1 deletion, or inducible Llgl1 deletion in adult cardiomyocytes (Llgl1TamCKO), influences the cardiac injury response. We performed RNAsequencing and in vitro knockdown and viral overexpression experiments to delineate the mechanisms by which Llgl1 influences cardiomyocyte phenotypes. Results: Llgl1CKO mice display disrupted intercalated disc integrity indicated by reduced protein density at cardiomyocyte junctions, associated with electrical conduction defects that manifest as ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, Llgl1CKO mice display enhanced cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity extending into adulthood. Llgl1CKO mice and mice whereby Llgl1 is deleted by tamoxifen induction in adulthood both show improved cardiac function and reduced scar size following myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, Llgl1 alters mechanotransduction and cell cycle pathways in the heart, and regulates proper localization of N-cadherin to the cell membrane, a process that is optimized by phosphorylation of five serine residues at the C-terminus of Llgl1. Conclusions: We elucidate a key role for Llgl1 in establishing proper intercalated disc integrity in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Disruption of intercalated discs and mechanotransduction via Llgl1 knockout is associated with cardiac arrhythmia, elevated cell cycle activity and resistance to cardiac injury. These studies shed light on mechanisms underlying intercalated disc establishment and connect disrupted cardiomyocyte junctional integrity with enhanced cell cycle activity.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, the biophysical and conformational details of such compaction in situ, at the kilobase- and sub-kilobase length scale relevant to the activity of transcriptional regulatory elements, remain under debate. Rather than inferring such compaction from indirect measurements of features like DNA accessibility, we sought to directly probe sub-kilobase contacts between nearby nucleosomes. We developed an improved version of radiation-induced correlated cleavage with sequencing (RICC-seq), which we term RICC-seq 2.0, and used it in parallel with Micro-C to cross-validate our measurements of chromatin structure in both diverse cell types with different levels of linker histone and different levels of chromatin compaction, as well as a CRISPRi system for pan-H1 depletion. Using this system, we find that chromatin fiber de-compaction upon H1 depletion is global across the genome, reducing the contrast in inter-nucleosome contacts between acetylated chromatin and the rest of the genome. Surprisingly, this does not dramatically change higher-order chromatin organization such as nuclear compartments. Nevertheless, we observe a broad increase in accessibility at tens of thousands of sites and an increase in expression of over a thousand genes, which are enriched in polycomb repressive complex targets. Investigating the local chromatin compaction at upregulated genes as opposed to genes that do not change transcription, we observe that upregulated genes are not specifically de-compacted. Rather, our data support a model in which linker histone globally induces local compaction of nucleosome contacts and an increase in linker lengths, and repression by PRC1/2 is particularly dependent on these local features of chromatin architecture.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

A deeper understanding of the genetics of C. glabra is essential for studying its evolutionary history and biology, with potential implications for agricultural improvement of pecan. Here, we present the first nuclear genome assembly and annotation of C. glabra. The assembly is chromosome-level and phased, representing the first assembled polyploid genome in the genus Carya. A total of 64 pseudochromosomes were assembled and phased into four haplotypes. The haplotype A assembly spans 600.4 Mb, comprises 55.0% repetitive sequences, and contains 30,947 protein-coding genes, with a BUSCO completeness score of 97.7%. Functional annotation assigned 94.3% of haplotype A genes to gene families, and 79.7% and 86.3% of genes were annotated with Gene Ontology terms and protein domains, respectively; 635 putative plant disease resistance genes were found in haplotype A. The other three haplotypes exhibited similarly high-quality annotation metrics. Our genomic analyses also suggest that C. glabra is an autotetraploid. Comparative genomic analyses revealed high collinearity among the four haplotypes of C. glabra and the published genomes of three other Carya species, although structural variation among the genomes of these species was identified. In addition, we provide an improved chloroplast genome assembly and the first mitochondrial genome for C. glabra.

Bryophytes are crucial yet understudied components of this biome, with major knowledge gaps in their distribution, diversity, and conservation status. Objectives: This study aimed to consolidate and expand the knowledge of the Caatinga's s.l. bryoflora by integrating data from field inventories, herbaria, and literature into a comprehensive occurrence database. Methods: Floristic surveys were conducted in five localities. A dataset was assembled from the three data sources. Multivariate Generalized Linear Models, UPGMA, and Indicator Value analyses compared bryophyte communities among vegetation types. Taxonomic beta diversity was calculated for the entire biome. Conservation analyses assessed species representativeness inside and outside Protected Areas. Results: A total of 627 bryophyte taxa (608 species, 15 varieties, and 4 subspecies), including 54 endemics, was documented for the Caatinga s.l., with five new records added. Ecotone areas showed the highest richness (441 taxa). Bryophyte communities differed among vegetation types, with species turnover as the main driver of beta diversity (0.991). Although 76.4% of all taxa and 64.8% of endemic taxa have at least one record within a Protected Area. Conclusions: The historical perception of low biodiversity in the Caatinga bryoflora is refuted, revealing high diversity across vegetation types. Data gaps in distribution and conservation status are addressed. Strong sampling bias towards Protected Areas likely overestimates in situ protection. Systematic sampling in under-collected regions and stronger conservation policies are urgently needed to safeguard this component of dry forest biodiversity", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

A long-standing premise derived from comparative studies is that the orientation of the orbits determines eye position, and thereby the extension of this overlap, the binocular field. In addition, to produce an accurate neural representation, the binocular field must integrate with the position of retinal high-acuity areas and with the extent of uncrossed retinal projections. It remains unknown, however, whether the binocular field is already formed at the time of eye-opening, as well as when and how it integrates with neuroanatomical visual traits during development. Using the diurnal rodent Octodon degus, a suitable animal model for visual neuroscience, we combined CT-based 3D cranial reconstructions, quantitative measurements of visual-field geometry, whole-mount retinal topography, neural tracing of retinal projections, and behavioral assays to reconstruct the postnatal assembly of the binocular visual system. We show that orbital and ocular orientations shift substantially after birth, broadening the dorsal binocular field; that retinal ganglion cell distributions sharpen into a horizontal visual streak and a defined area centralis; and that ipsilateral projections to the superior colliculus mature in parallel to binocular expansion. These changes coincide with the emergence of binocular-dependent behaviors such as depth discrimination and looming-evoked escape responses.

In non-neuronal cells, V1-V0 association is higher in perinuclear lysosomes, correlating with increased acidity of this population. In neurons, axonal V0-positive vesicles move bidirectionally, whereas V1-V0 -positive vesicles move almost exclusively in the retrograde direction, consistent with the higher acidity of retrograde lysosomal vesicles. Depletion of DMXL2, a subunit of the mRAVE complex that promotes V1-V0 assembly, reduces V1 association, acidification, transport, and proteolytic activity of retrograde lysosomal vesicles in the axon.

Recombinant protein expression requires adaptation of the host cell proteome to accommodate recombinant expression. However, this adaptation has not been well characterized. A better understanding of the adaptation to recombinant protein expression may inform us of pathways important to the process of expression. The proteome of a laboratory yeast was measured each of the 4 days of recombinant laccase expression to determine the adaptations of the proteome. Whereas a sizeable portion of the proteome had altered levels in response to nutrient depletion in batch growth, a smaller portion of the changes was specific to the laccase expression. By comparing yeast strains of different origins and laccase production capacities, we found that each strain tends to display a distinct response to heterologous expression, regardless of the origin of the laccase. For example, the chaperones Hsp26 and Kar2 were specifically elevated in a whey-derived strain upon laccase expression. Nonetheless, the higher capacity to produce active recombinant laccase in some strains appears to be more strongly associated with small groups of proteins that are constitutively expressed at different levels. These results indicate that strains of different origins each provide a unique cellular milieu that, in some cases, is more favorable for the expression of a given recombinant protein. This study provides potential new targets for strain engineering to improve the yield of select recombinant proteins and provides the first insights into the dynamics of the yeast proteome during recombinant laccase expression.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Notably, our data point to NC2 being specific for TBP binding at the TATA box and suggest that TATA promoters show both TAF-dependent and TAF-independent initiation in vivo. These data suggest a model for the increased burst size observed at TATA promoters and provide a comprehensive resource for linking structural and biochemical results to in vivo data.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Given the high frequency with which RNA is found in genomic DNA, it is unknown which DNA polymerase is responsible for catalyzing RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. In this work we establish bacterial DNA polymerase I (Pol I) as a robust reverse transcriptase. We tested several bacterial Pol I enzymes and found that all possess RT activity with B. subtilis Pol I showing RNA-dependent DNA synthesis activity similar to the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase. We tested RNA embedded in DNA and found that replicative DNA polymerase PolC arrests at a single template ribonucleotide while, in contrast, Pol I is able to efficiently traverse long stretches of templated ribonucleotides. We conclude that Pol I is responsible for RNA templated DNA replication, allowing for replication forks to navigate RNA that persists in genomic DNA.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we report de novo designed proteins that bind DELE1, block its oligomerization, and inhibit DELE1-mediated ISR activation. Several designs form stable complexes with DELE1 and disrupt its oligomerization in vitro while preserving DELE1's ability to bind HRI. In cells, these designs suppress ATF4 induction during mitochondrial stress and impair the recovery of elongated mitochondrial morphology following transient insult. Crystal structure analysis, structural modeling, and targeted mutagenesis confirm that the designed proteins engage a critical interface required for DELE1 oligomerization.

P.; Martin, L.; Magee, J. C.; Grienberger, C.", "abstract": "Spatial learning depends on the rapid formation of hippocampal CA1 place cell representations through behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). BTSP is driven by dendritic calcium plateau potentials in the distal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and is thought to arise from the interaction of an excitatory target signal from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3) with inhibitory feedback reflecting the current CA1 population state. However, the cellular source of this feedback remains unknown. To identify this circuit element, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with bidirectional optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of dendrite-targeting oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons. We found that axonal and somatic activity of OLM interneurons increased with learning and was spatially biased toward behaviorally salient locations, closely matching the evolving CA1 population representation and the environment-specific EC3 target signal. Causal manipulations revealed that optogenetic silencing of Chrna2alpha-positive OLM interneurons, a genetically defined OLM subset, late in learning increased dendritic plateaus and promoted place cell formation at stimulated locations, whereas activation of the same population early in learning suppressed plateau initiation and place field formation. Together, these findings identify OLM interneurons as the key inhibitory feedback element that dynamically regulates BTSP and stabilizes hippocampal representations during learning.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

While simple in vitro assays provide insight into discrete metabolic processes, they cannot recapitulate the complex multi-organ interactions that involve absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes. This limitation has perpetuated a heavy reliance on animal experimentation to predict integrated outcomes like hepatic and renal clearance in humans. In this study, we developed a multi-tissue chip (MTC) to evaluate the PK parameters of intravenously (IV) administered drugs. The MTC platform provides continuous oxygenation through media recirculation and interconnects three MPSs (liver, kidney, skeletal muscle) to study drug metabolism, excretion and distribution within a single in vitro system. The functionality of each MPS was characterized for more than 15 days with single- and multi-tissue chips. A diverse set of drugs from all extended clearance classification system (ECCS) classes with various clearance mechanisms was evaluated on the MTCs and on-chip PK parameters were evaluated, such as hepatic metabolism, uptake, and disposition, tubular secretion and reabsorption, and muscle distribution. These PK parameters were successfully correlated to clinical parameters for IV drugs: hepatic clearance (CL,H), renal clearance (CL,R), volume of distribution (VD) and then these parameters were extrapolated to human drug exposures using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.

We find that widely used sampling strategies introduce node-degree biases that allow models to exploit trivial graph-structural cues rather than biological signals. Across multiple benchmarks, simple degree-based heuristics match or exceed state-of-the-art graph neural network models under these biased evaluation protocols. We further introduce a degree-aware sampling approach that eliminates these artifacts and provides more reliable assessments of GRN inference methods.

These viruses can establish asymptomatic persistent infections in mucosal-associated lymphocytes and can infect lymphocytes in utero. Although adenovirus is a DNA tumor virus, it has not yet been shown to initiate cancer in humans. Epidemiological studies of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), point towards an infectious etiology. The ETV6/RUNX1 fusion protein results from a chromosomal translocation t(12; 21) believed to initiate ALL. This translocation can be detected in utero and has been identified in as much as 40% of clustered cases of leukemia, which are those most likely to have been initiated by an infectious agent. Infectious agents have not yet been detected in leukemic cells, causing speculation that the oncogenic agent has been lost in the transformed progeny through a \"hit and run\" mechanism. In the current study, we attempt to model the \"run\" of adenovirus in B-lymphocytes by forcing expression of leukemic fusion genes to determine if they create an environment that is refractory to adenovirus persistence. Here we show that the common leukemic fusion proteins, ETV6/RUNX1 or RUNX1/MTG8, reduce adenovirus persistence in a B-lymphocyte line but do not dampen the initial acute infection phase. Further, we show that ETV6/RUNX1 can bind to the viral genome and that some viral gene expression appears to be suppressed through the activities of HDACs in ETV6/RUNX1-expressing cells. Finally, we show that the expression of virally silenced cellular genes remains repressed even after the loss of the virus from infected cells. The results of the current study provide support for how adenovirus could be lost from translocation containing lymphocytes and provide evidence that adenovirus can leave a lasting imprint on cells previously infected in the form of an epigenetic echo.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Spontaneous-remission of Cancer (SRC), well documented in humans, is the paradoxical process of natural permanent tumor elimination by host-tissue system without any toxicity, recurrence or cancer stem-cell formation. This rare biological phenomenon is usually associated with immune activation, apoptosis, tumor microenvironment as well as oncogenic suppression. Thus, to understand this strikingly complex event, it is utmost important to look into the genetic and molecular landscape in-depth. Majorly, cancer mortalities occur due to epithelial tumors, hence, to find out the contributing pathways involved we interrogated epithelial malignancies: Neuroblastoma (neural-crest tissue), and Melanoma (skin tissue). Neuroblastoma, the most prevalent tumor type in newborns, arises from embryonic nerve cells and have a very diverse clinical trajectory. Similarly, Melanoma another common skin tumor, developed from malignant transformation of melanocytes (cells producing melanin pigment). It is well-known that in numerous patients, both these malignant tumors spontaneously regress permanently, while in others, these tumors escalate to fatality. We investigated microarray expression of spontaneous regression of malignant neuroblastoma tumors (n=498), the patients having 4 temporal stages (S1-S2-S3-S4), and malignant melanoma tumors (n=22) having 4 time points (T1-T2-T3-T4) [i.e. total 520 patients, each 8 remission-route steps]. We studied differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common in both regressing Neuroblastoma and Melanoma, and analyzed the protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as protein-miRNA networks. One crucial ubiquitous gene factor was found across each stage of both the regressing tumors. This focal gene codes for a spectrin-repeat protein which acts as a linker between nucleus-cytoskeleton, and aids in maintaining normal cells nuclear and cellular integrity (demarcated as a significant morphological change in tumor cells) by abetting the formation of Mut-S complex, which is a significant player in mis-match repair pathway. Strikingly, both this protein and miRNA were found to be commonly targeting PIK3CA protein through separate paths. We endeavor to unravel the mechanism of action and decipher the common gene factors across the entire tumor regression process in both Neuroblastoma and Melanoma. We meticulously identified the underlying biological pathways responsible for spontaneous regression.

We introduce DANT (Density-based Across-day Neuron Tracking), an unsupervised framework that jointly estimates probe motion and neuron identity by alternating between density-based clustering in feature space and probe-motion correction inferred from provisional matches. Estimated drift is used to re-register spike waveforms across sessions, after which clustering is recomputed; this iterative loop continues until the set of matches stabilizes. In parallel, DANT learns a decision boundary from match and non-match assignments derived from the clustering results, enabling it to reject low-similarity candidate pairs. Applied to weeks-long Neuropixels recordings from the cortex and striatum in freely moving rats during stable behavior and task switching, DANT substantially increases match yield and reduces false negatives while maintaining a low false-positive rate relative to existing approaches.

However, growing theoretical and experimental evidence question the generalizability of such findings from constrained studies to ambulatory behavior, highlighting a limitation in our understanding of how the brain controls movement. To address this question, spiking neural activity during highly-practiced, routine movement (walking) and goal-directed behavior (reaching towards food) were compared in an unconstrained setting. Kinematic trajectories of the contralateral arm during reaching and walking were statistically similar, as were the average single-neuron firing rates during these respective movements. However, the dimensionality of reaching was higher than that of walking and existed in largely non-overlapping subspaces. Further, when modeled as dynamical systems, reaching decayed 3-5 times more quickly than walking. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the low-dimensional structure of motor cortex is more complex for goal-directed reaching than in highly-practiced natural movements. Since this difference is primarily observable at the state and dynamical systems level, these findings suggest behavioral context plays a significant role in the coordination of otherwise kinematically similar movements, providing indirect evidence for non-cortical circuits such as central pattern generators.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Transplantation of ventral midbrain-patterned DA (vmDA) progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells, aimed at restoring DA neurotransmission in the striatum, is being developed and currently explored in ongoing clinical trials. One factor that may improve the maturation and fate determination of DA neurons in vivo is the intercellular communication within the graft environment, ultimately affecting the therapeutic outcome. In this study, we co-transplanted vmDA progenitors with either glial, ventral forebrain or striatal progenitors into a preclinical xenograft PD model to investigate how these interactions shape the development, maturation, and function of therapeutic DA neurons. Our findings show that co-grafts with ventral forebrain progenitors increase the yield of DA neurons and also promote their functional maturation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that co-grafts with striatal neurons promote functional maturation and the acquisition of DA subtype identity. From these data, we identified EBF3 and PBX3 as candidate transcription factors directing DA neuron maturation and subtype specification, and then functionally validated their role in brain organoids. Taken together, our data highlight that the cellular microenvironment, including specific interactions with neighbouring cells, guides in vivo DA neuron specification and maturation.

To distinguish the role of NLRC5 expressed within tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, we studied B16-F10 melanoma expressing NLRC5-FL (B16-N-FL) or NLRC5-SA (B16-N-SA) in Nlrc5+/+ and Nlrc5-/- mice. Both tumors were efficiently controlled in both Nlrc5+/+ and Nlrc5-/- hosts with abundant immune cell infiltration, enriched for activated and differentiated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, NK, NKT and iNKT cells. B16-N-FL and B16-N-SA tumors showed increased collagen deposition and vascularization, with upregulation of CCL4 and CXCL9 chemokine genes in B16-N-SA tumors. Depletion of either CD8+ T cells or NK1.1+ cells increased the growth of B16-N-FL and B16-N-SA tumors in Nlrc5+/+ mice, and that of B16-N-SA tumors in Nlrc5-/- hosts.

We found that populations were generally more genomically differentiated across large spatial scales than across long temporal scales. Among a subset of 389 MAGs well represented in all datasets, 68.4% showed weak population divergence over time but strong global-scale differentiation. This was evident in the abundant and widespread cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. In contrast, only 6.4% of the MAGs exhibited weak divergence over time and space, with SAR11 MAGs being a clear example, likely reflecting their high dispersal and recombination rates. Other groups, such as SAR86 and Flavobacteriales, showed strong divergence at temporal and spatial scales, suggesting seasonal and/or regional adaptation. Positive selection was more readily detectable in the long-term coastal observatories than in the global ocean, despite the more significant population divergence observed across broad geographic scales. Temperature consistently showed a significant association with the population structure of many MAGs.

Three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, experimentally incubated in N. khasiana pitcher fluid, was conducted to assess time-dependent structural degradation. Quantitative micro-CT parameters, including volume, surface area, and surface-to-volume ratio, were analyzed to visualize and quantify time-dependent structural degradation and three-dimensional morphological changes in the prey during digestion. A triphasic digestion sequence was identified - comprising rapid soft-tissue hydrolysis, progressive exoskeletal fragmentation, and stabilization of chitinous remnants. The acidic, enzymatic fluid (pH 2.5-4.0) promoted uniform degradation through synergistic enzymatic, oxidative, and acidification processes, while dissolved CO2 enhanced acid stability and catalytic efficiency. The integration of micro-CT morphometrics and biochemical insights reveals a coordinated digestion mechanism in N. khasiana, optimized for efficient prey breakdown and nutrient assimilation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate how the redistribution of species abundance over the past 50 years affects the potential for predator-prey interactions among North American birds. We first predict potential predator-prey interactions based on existing data and functional traits, then construct a novel, abundance-weighted metric of interaction potential for each pair of predator and prey in local communities. Across North America, the potential for predator-prey interactions has been increasing over time. We further show that this widespread increasing trend in interaction potentials is mostly driven by higher abundances of predator species. The spatial redistributions of predators and prey lead to turnover of interactions within local communities, and the turnover is less associated with changes in climate but more associated with human-induced land use changes. Our novel approach and results highlight the importance of considering traits, abundance, and species interactions - including known and potential interactions - when studying the ecological consequences of species range shifts.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Such applications require pigs harboring genetic modifications, including knockouts, human transgenes, and conditional alleles. Although such complex allele combinations can be assembled by sequential editing of fetal fibroblasts, followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), SCNT is often associated with developmental abnormalities. Direct genome editing of pig zygotes offers an alternative route; however, achieving long-fragment knock-in, particularly at multiple loci, remains challenging. Here, adeno-associated virus (AAV) donor vectors for long-fragment knock-in in pig zygotes were evaluated, and tested whether transient inhibition of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which becomes overactivated during AAV transduction, could enhance knock-in efficiency. AAV6 donors supported efficient ACTB-mEGFP knock-in (33%), whereas short-term treatment with the ATM inhibitor AZ32 increased the efficiency to 66%. In addition, AZ32 enhanced simultaneous double knock-in at ACTB and UBB, generating a higher proportion of double-positive blastocysts (52% vs. 19% in controls), without affecting blastocyst formation rates or total cell numbers. Embryo transfer yielded ACTB-mEGFP and UBB-mScarlet-I3 double knock-in fetuses (33%), including an F0 fetus composed almost entirely of double knock-in cells. These results demonstrate that combining AAV donors with transient ATM inhibition is an efficient strategy for long-fragment knock-in at multiple loci in pigs.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we assessed the ability of recently developed computational protein design tools to establish such a workflow for validating paramyxovirus receptor-binding protein de novo binders as such reagents. The family Paramyxoviridae includes various members that cause severe disease and exhibit re-occurring zoonotic spillover events, with documented human infections over the past decades. We successfully designed, identified, and characterized mini-proteins targeting the receptor binding proteins of Nipah virus, Langya virus, and Measles virus while screening as few as 10-16 designs per target. The resulting functional binders have moderate to low nanomolar affinities and display high on-target specificity. We further showed that our most promising Nipah virus receptor-binding protein binder is able to inhibit human receptor binding in vitro and competes for an epitope that overlaps with that of the neutralizing antibody HENV-117. However, despite these promising results, this Nipah binder is only weakly neutralizing, preventing therapeutic applications.

Common Integration Sites (CIS) near oncogenes significantly increase the risk of clonal expansion and malignant transformation. Current tools for integration site (IS) analysis lack comprehensive functionality for safety assessment, particularly in identifying risk-associated genomic regions and tracking clonal dynamics over time. Results: We developed LISA (Longitudinal Integration Site Analysis), a comprehensive R package specifically designed for gene therapy safety evaluation. LISA incorporates a novel approach that trains integration site profiles using cumulative curves derived from normal cell infusion samples and normal patient samples, with subsequent statistical testing to distinguish these normal samples from those with exceptional clonal expansion, thereby enabling effective identification of dominant clone formation. For longitudinal studies, LISA monitors fluctuations in clonal dynamics via Richness and Evenness metrics, and integrates this cumulative curve-based statistical testing approach into its early warning system to detect potentially dominant clones. Additionally, LISA features an optimized CIS detection algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity, achieved through chromosome-position encoding and a seed-site strategy, which facilitates efficient analysis of large-scale clinical datasets. The package also provides systematic functional annotations, including annotations for Safe Harbor regions, enhancer/promoter elements, and proximity to three curated gene sets: adverse event-associated genes (AE genes, n=36), cancer-related genes (n=980), and immune-related genes (n=2,485).

To ensure the highest quality of its content, human pathway data in Reactome is manually curated. However, manual curation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and increasingly difficult to keep up with the ever-growing biomedical literature. Large language model (LLM)-driven artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are transforming many fields, including bioinformatics resource development. Applying LLM/AI technologies in Reactome may offer a powerful way to scale curation and consolidate pathway-related data into a single resource. This manuscript describes the first stage of our attempt to adopt LLM/AI technologies for Reactome manual curation. We developed an LLM workflow that can assist curators in adding new genes to existing pathways and refining the functional annotations of existing ones. The workflow predicts pathways in which genes are likely to function, identifies PubMed-indexed literature that may support these predictions, generates text summaries describing potential molecular mechanisms, and extracts functional relationships among biological entities from full-text PDF papers. To validate the workflow output, we used a computational approach based on semantic similarity between LLM workflow-generated summaries and Reactome manual annotations. The results show significant enrichment of high-similarity matches. Manual evaluation of 19 genes indicated that more than half of the outputs are useful for supporting curation. Based on these results, we developed an enhanced workflow that incorporates protein-protein interaction data, facilitating Reactome's reaction-based annotation. In summary, our initial adoption of LLM/AI technologies produced encouraging results and provides a practical framework for integrating AI-assisted methods into Reactome's curation pipeline.

Understanding and evaluating how upland rice responds to drought stress is critical to improving resilience and yield stability. In this study performance of sixteen upland rice varieties were evaluated under non-stressed, moderately stressed and highly stressed conditions. Drought stress was introduced by irrigating upland rice at 70% and 50% field capacity (FC) whereas non-stress treatment was irrigated at 100% FC. Irrigation in moderately stressed and highly stressed conditions was also withheld for six days at lateral crop stages to observe temporary wilting by inducing a stress interval. Data on agronomic traits of upland rice was collected in three experimental replications. Results indicated that performance of upland rice varieties was significantly altered under stress conditions and highest performance was observed under non-stressed conditions. Yield losses for short duration and long duration varieties ranged 35-60% and 24-62% under moderate stress whereas it ranged 43-78% and 52-73% under highly stressed conditions, respectively. Overall varieties Dawk Kha, Khao/ Sai and Dawk Pa-yawm, indicated higher stability under stressed conditions therefore, these long duration varieties could be used for obtaining better yields under diverse agroclimatic conditions and under unpredicted weather patterns.

Galantamine derives from the metabolic precursor 4'-O-methylnorbelladine, which undergoes cytochrome P450-mediated para-ortho' C-C phenol coupling to yield nornarwedine. Two competing terminal routes have been proposed: (i) reduction of nornarwedine to norgalanthamine, followed by N-methylation, or (ii) N-methylation of nornarwedine to narwedine prior to reduction. Here, we identify three N-methyltransferase (NMT) candidates from Leucojum aestivum: LaNMT, related to coclaurine NMTs, and two {gamma}-tocopherol methyltransferases (TMT) homologs, LaTMT1 and LaTMT2. Subcellular localization studies revealed distinct compartmentalization, with LaNMT targeted to the ER-cytosol, LaTMT1 to plastids, and LaTMT2 to the Golgi apparatus. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that LaTMT2 methylates both nornarwedine and norgalanthamine, with a kinetic preference for nornarwedine. Agroinfiltration for transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed LaTMT2 as a catalytically efficient and substrate-promiscuous enzyme that supports both terminal routes.

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encodes prediction errors via theta-band activity, but causal evidence in humans remains limited. Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIs) offers a non-invasive approach to modulate deep cortical regions including the dACC. METHODS: Thirty-four individuals with food addiction were randomly assigned to active theta-band tTIs or sham stimulation. Participants completed food and monetary incentive delay tasks in a satiated state while EEG was recorded before and after stimulation. Feedback-related negativity (FRN) and stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) were examined at both mean ERP and trial-by-trial levels using behavioral and model-derived prediction errors. RESULTS: Trial-by-trial analyses showed that tTIs selectively enhanced neural sensitivity to unfavorable food outcomes. Averaged FRN amplitudes for negative behavioral prediction errors increased after stimulation in the active group ({Delta} FRN = -1.91 V, p = .038, d = 0.55), with no change in the sham group. A similar enhancement was observed for negative model-derived prediction errors ({Delta} FRN = -1.71 V, p = .004, d = 0.82).

Modulation of the endocannabinoid system through inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) represents a promising target that may influence both cognitive functions and the neuroendocrine system. However, mechanisms linking FAAH inhibition to these outcomes remain poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesised that FAAH inhibition by URB597 counteracts scopolamine-induced memory deficits and modulates neuroendocrine reactivity differently in males and females. We tested the effects of URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) in Sprague Dawley rats at baseline and during a scopolamine challenge (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Recognition memory was assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) task, which also served as a mild stressor. Plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone, vasopressin, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured. URB597 pretreatment counteracted the cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine, showing greater efficacy in males. FAAH inhibition reduced ACTH, corticosterone, vasopressin, and aldosterone concentrations, while PRA remained unaffected. Correlation analyses revealed sex-specific associations. In males, better recognition performance was associated with lower ACTH, corticosterone, and vasopressin, whereas in females, cognition correlated negatively with aldosterone and positively with PRA. These findings demonstrate that FAAH inhibition elicits cognitive protection, associated with the attenuation of neuroendocrine stress responses, and this effect is distinct in males and females. By linking behavioural and endocrine outcomes, this study identifies dual actions of FAAH inhibition and underscores the importance of sex as a biological variable in endocannabinoid-based therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically profiled RNA interactions of a cohort of clinically approved anticancer agents and uncovered widespread RNA off-targeting. Cisplatin, a frontline chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors, has emerged as a prominent RNA-binding drug. While the primary mechanism of action of cisplatin has been attributed to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, it has also been shown to bind RNA molecules. However, the extent of RNA binding in cancer cells and its functional relevance in platinum-based chemotherapy remained unknown. To map specific RNA targets of cisplatin in vivo, we developed PlatRNA-seq, a click-chemistry-enabled transcriptome-wide assay. Using this approach and integrated genomic, biophysical, and computational analysis, we show that cisplatin binding is enriched at guanine-rich regions of transcripts, with a pronounced affinity for RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) secondary structures. Cisplatin accumulates preferentially near the 5' ends of transcripts associated with R-loop formation and RNA pol II stalling. Mechanistically, cisplatin binding to rG4s modulates their formation and stability. Importantly, we provide evidence that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity is mediated in part through its binding to RNA, revealing a noncanonical RNA-based mechanism of action. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor biopsies of treatment-naive ovarian cancer patients further shows that the expression of rG4-enriched cisplatin-RNA targets predicts platinum sensitivity, underscoring the prognostic and clinical relevance of drug-RNA interactions. Together, these results demonstrate that RNA off-targeting by small molecules is not passive but can modulate therapeutic outcomes and may be leveraged to overcome current limitations of chemotherapeutic agents. Our findings highlight the importance of systematically investigating RNA interactions of clinically used small molecules to better inform therapeutic and prognostic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Lateral root formation starts with priming, predisposing subsets of pericycle cells with the potential of future lateral root formation through semi-periodic elevations in auxin (signalling). While various mechanisms have been suggested, the most broadly accepted hypothesis proposes a genetic, cell-autonomous root clock akin to the clock underlying vertebrate somitogenesis. Still, while gene expression variations were observed, so far this clock has not been proven. From a functional and evolutionary perceptive it is furthermore an open question whether lateral root priming is not more likely to arise from an emergent tissue level process similar to phyllotaxis. To help settle this debate in this study I use general knowledge of oscillator dynamics and simple models of auxin signalling to underline the unlikelihood of a root clock driving lateral root priming. I show how within a single cell oscillations are limited to a small parameter domain, with constraints intensifying due to the presence of multiple AUX/IAA and ARF types. Furthermore, I demonstrate how non-meristem based oscillations, due to a lack of memory of oscillator phase, can not drive periodic prebranch site formation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Between-season carry-over in social associations is widely observed and can have important benefits for individuals, ranging from reduced conflict between neighbours to cooperative nest defence. Yet the underlying drivers of social carry-over effects remain unclear, as current research has predominantly focused on species where breeding territories are influenced by individuals' non-breeding spatial distribution, making it challenging to disentangle social and spatial preferences. Sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) form communal night-roosts with fission-fusion dynamics around the roost-site. During spring, breeding individuals split from the roost to occupy nearby tree hollows, but remain non-territorial, allowing us to test whether individuals exhibit a preference to breed in proximity to winter social associates. We find that male - but not female - winter social associations are correlated with breeding location; males bred closer to their winter associates, and more socially connected males tended to breed closer to the roost location. Male cockatoos are largely philopatric to their natal roost, and exhibit long-lasting foraging associations, preferentially with kin. Our results demonstrate carry-over between these social networks and the fine-scale arrangement of breeding individuals, consistent with an active choice to retain stable, across-context social relationships.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Although high-quality chloroplast genomes are now routinely generated, downstream comparative analyses still rely on fragmented toolchains requiring separate tools for annotation, codon analysis, and SNP detection, extensive manual curation, and ad hoc scripting, which limit reproducibility and scalability. Results: We present the Chloroplast Genome Analysis Suite (CGAS), an automated Python-based pipeline designed as a comprehensive solution for comparative chloroplast genomics. CGAS integrates nine core analytical modules into a single, reproducible workflow operating directly on annotated GenBank files and pre-aligned FASTA datasets. The pipeline performs automated gene content analysis, publication-ready gene table generation, chloroplast structural characterization (LSC/SSC/IR boundaries and GC content), codon usage and amino acid composition analyses enabling batch processing of 10-50+ genomes, SNP detection with transition/transversion statistics, intron feature characterization, simple sequence repeat identification, and nucleotide diversity profiling. Unlike existing tools, CGAS emphasizes biologically informed handling of edge cases, including trans-spliced genes (e.g., rps12), IR-mediated gene duplication, and annotation artifacts. All outputs are generated in standardized, publication-ready Excel and Word formats with timestamped provenance. Conclusions: CGAS provides a unified, automated, and biologically robust framework for comparative chloroplast genome analysis. By minimizing manual intervention and emphasizing batch processing, the suite substantially accelerates methodologically consistent analyses. The pipeline is openly available at https://github.com/abdullah30/Chloroplast-Genome-Analysis-Suite-CGAS and readily extensible, supporting its adoption as a standardized analytical backend for chloroplast comparative genomics.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Computational tools are needed to assess such variants at scale, yet existing predictors rarely consider loss of specific interactions, particularly when variants perturb binding interfaces without significantly affecting protein stability. To address this problem, we present MutPred-PPI, a graph attention network that predicts interaction-specific (edgetic) effects of missense variants by operating on AlphaFold 3-based protein complex contact graphs with protein language model embeddings imposed upon nodes. We systematically evaluated our model with stringent group cross-validation as well as benchmark data recently collected within the IGVF Consortium. MutPred-PPI outperformed all baseline methods across all evaluation criteria, achieving an AUC of 0.85 on seen proteins and 0.72 on previously unseen proteins in cross-validation, demonstrating strong generalizability despite scarce training data. To demonstrate biomedical relevance, we applied MutPred-PPI to variants from ClinVar, HGMD, COSMIC, gnomAD, and two de novo neurodevelopmental disorder-linked datasets. Disease-associated variants from ClinVar and HGMD showed strong enrichment for both quasi-null and edgetic effects, whereas population variants from gnomAD increasingly preserved interactions with higher allele frequencies. Notably, we observed a strong edgetic disruption signature in highly recurrent cancer variants from both the full COSMIC dataset and a subset of variants from oncogenes. Recurrent tumor suppressor gene variants and autism spectrum disorder-associated variants exhibited moderate quasi-null enrichment, whilst neurodevelopmental disorder-linked variants showed a weak edgetic disruption signature. These results indicate distinct PPI perturbation mechanisms across disease types and show that MutPred-PPI captures functionally relevant molecular effects of pathogenic variants.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Benchmarking showed that comprehensive detection of exoPS gene clusters requires highly contiguous high-quality genome assemblies. We applied epsSMASH to high-quality bacterial genome catalogues representing four major ecosystems: Human gut, soil, ocean and activated sludge from wastewater treatment systems. In all catalogues, epsSMASH identified exoPS BGCs in most genomes (52.8-85.4%), with a median of 1-2 exoPS BGCs per genome. The number of exoPS BGC per genome was highly variable, with some taxa containing up to 19 distinct exoPS BGCs. Pel BGCs were abundant in human gut, ocean and activated sludge microbiomes, and were detected in 14 different phyla, making it the most phylogenetically widespread BGC in these environments. The vast majority (62-96%) of detected exoPS BGCs were uncharacterised. By constructing gene cluster families from uncharacterised systems, we identified novel and phylogenetically widespread exoPS BGCs. We investigated a novel exoPS gene cluster from the activated sludge microbiome and showed that it is conserved in most genera within the order Sphingomonadales.

The activation of sex hormone receptors may explain these differences, but the exact genetic drivers remain poorly understood. Furthermore, current bladder cancer biomarkers have inconsistent sensitivities and specificities in practice, making early diagnosis a challenge. This study approaches bladder cancer biomarker discovery through machine learning techniques on gender and disease-stratified RNA-seq data. Training sets limited to differentially expressed genes were subjected to four different feature selection methods: differential gene expression analysis adjusted p-value, recursive feature elimination with support vector machine, logistic regression, and an optimized random forest procedure. Gene panels were compared and aggregated across selection strategies and cross-validation folds to identify robust biomarkers for sex-specific bladder cancer development and progression. When applied to unseen datasets and limited to 50 genes or less, male and female-specific panels achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 and 0.914, respectively, in distinguishing bladder cancer samples from non-tumor controls. Genes such as PRAC1 and PCDH11Y were identified as high-impact predictors related to sex hormones or chromosomes for male tumor development. In the female-specific panel, genes related to aberrant androgen signaling across tumor types like AR, PLXNA1, USP54, and PMEPA1 were influential.

We used canonical SASP factors on our microenvironment microarray (MEMA) platform to systematically identify SASP-associated drivers of tumorigenesis in breast and lung cancer cells. We found multiple SASP factors enhanced the proliferation and overall cell numbers for both lung and breast cells grown on the MEMA, and that there was significant overlap in SASP-associated growth-promoting factors between the two different cell types. We validated the ability of several factors, including IL-6, TGF-{beta} and EGF, to drive growth in in vitro assays. Interestingly, these factors were effective in driving growth and survival in cells that were altered (either immortalized or fully transformed) but not in normal cells and impacted breast cells differently depending on the age of the patient. RNAseq identified upregulation of wound-healing and stem-cell programs in SASP factor-treated cells. Many of these same SASP factors were present in conditioned media collected from senescent cells, which enhanced the growth of both lung and breast cancer cells, and inhibitors of the specific SASP factors partially reduced growth. Similarly, targeted inhibition of EGF partially reduced lung tumour growth in xenografts when senescent but not normal fibroblasts were co-implanted. Our findings have identified core SASP drivers of tumorigenesis and suggest that effective tumorigenesis driven by SASP is multifactorial and requires alterations in the target cells to achieve maximal response.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here we present design of cathepsin S selective chemical probes and cathepsin S-cleavable antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) through substrate profiling with unnatural amino acids. First, Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library (HyCoSuL) technology incorporating a broad spectrum of unnatural amino acids was applied to comprehensively investigate the substrate specificity of cathepsin S. This approach enabled the identification of highly selective tetrapeptide motifs that served as scaffolds for the design of optimized fluorogenic substrates, irreversible inhibitors, and fluorescent activity-based probes (ABPs). These tools demonstrated high selectivity toward cathepsin S over closely related family members in both biochemical and cellular settings. We then translated these findings to develop cathepsin S-activated ADCs, incorporating the optimized peptide motifs as protease-cleavable linkers for targeted payload release. Using these linkers, we further generated MMAE-based antibody-drug conjugates directed against HER-2 and the TROP-2 proteins, demonstrating cathepsin S-dependent cytotoxicity in HER-2-positive as well as HER-2-negative/TROP-2-positive breast cancer models. Finally, we employed anti-cathepsin S antibodies in combination with mass cytometry (CyTOF) to assess the spatial distribution of cathepsin S expression in breast cancer patient samples. By correlating cathepsin S levels with tumor-associated markers such as TROP-2 and HER-2, we identified potential co-expression patterns that support the rationale for personalized therapy using antibody-drug conjugates selectively activated by cathepsin S.

One common method of simulating drought in experimental conditions is by applying polyethylene glycol (PEG) to plants. We investigated drought growth responses in Medicago lupulina (black medic) using PEG to simulate drought stress. We grew Medicago lupulina plants inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti in Magenta boxes under controlled conditions and randomly assigned them to one of three treatments: a control, PEG applied to the bottom (PEG added to the bottom-watering container of a magenta box), or PEG applied from the top (PEG poured over the growth media). After 60 days, we measured true leaf number, nodule count, and below- and above-ground dry biomass. PEG treatments significantly reduced above-ground growth, including total biomass and leaf number, but unexpectedly increased nodulation. Our results suggest that while PEG effectively simulates drought stress on above-ground growth parameters, it may not accurately simulate drought effects on rhizobial symbiosis. PEG treatments had no effect on below-ground biomass, suggesting that increased nodulation is not a result of increased plant investment in below-ground growth under simulated drought. We hypothesize that PEG, as a persistent liquid that plants do not absorb, created conditions favorable for nodulation. Overall, these results highlight the importance of interpreting PEG-simulated drought experiments with caution when assessing mutualistic interactions.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In Chrysanthemum seticuspe, we found that flower petals, unlike leaves, mount a localized resistance response resulting in red spots appearing at fungal penetration sites. We observed an intensification of the coloured response as infections progressed. To investigate the basis of this phenotype, we performed a time course paired transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis on mock inoculated vs B. cinerea inoculated petals and leaves. Infection triggered strong transcriptional reprogramming in petals, with clear induction of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid/anthocyanin pathway genes and candidate regulators, consistent with the visible pigmentation. Metabolite profiles reflected this response, showing time dependent accumulation of infection induced flavonoids such as quercetin, tilianin, and their derivatives, as well as cyanidin-based anthocyanins in infected petals. Integrating both omics datasets with MEANtools highlighted an anthocyanin associated transcript metabolite module, including a module putatively involved in the synthesis of polyyne type phytoalexins. Antifungal assays demonstrated that selected flavonoids and cyanidin derivatives inhibit B. cinerea in a dose dependent manner, supporting a direct antifungal role of these compounds. Altogether, our results show that C. seticuspe petals deploy a spatially confined, multi-layered chemical defence in which pathogen induced flavonoids and anthocyanins operate as active components of resistance against a necrotrophic pathogen. We anticipate that future paired omics analyses in combination with spatial omics and bioactivity assays will yield insights into the role of specialised defence molecules in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we assessed the genetic diversity, population structure, and phylogenetic relationships of 545 accessions representing 17 Urochloa species conserved in the ILRI Forage Genebank for the last four decades at its Zway field site in Ethiopia. Large numbers of genome-wide SNP and SilicoDArT markers were generated by the GBS based Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT)seq platform, providing valuable resources for genetic analysis in Urochloa spp. From these, we filtered a subset of high-quality SNP and SilicoDArT markers suitable for cross-species analysis, which was then used to characterize species differentiation and to detect admixture patterns across wild and cultivated species. Hierarchical clustering grouped all 545 accessions into two major groups, clearly separating the brizantha complex (U. brizantha, U. decumbens, and U. ruziziensis) from the rest of the species, which were primarily wild and less domesticated relatives. The analysis further identified four well-defined phylogenetic clades, largely consistent with previously reported evolutionary relationships within the genus. The three clades, primarily composed of wild species, exhibited clear genetic separation, high diversity, and strong geographic structuring with limited admixture, reflecting reproductive isolation (their apomictic nature) and differing ploidy levels that have driven local adaptation. In contrast, the brizantha complex exhibited extensive admixture and comparatively lower genetic variation, consistent with their historical polyploidization events, shared ancestry, and domestication (particularly in the key forage species U. brizantha and U. decumbens). Population structure analysis using the admixture model revealed multiple genetically distinct clusters and populations across clades, including species-specific clusters, mixed-species groups, and within-species populations, highlighting substantial genetic variation within and among species shaped by historical gene flow (particularly among diploid and sexual types), differences in ploidy levels, and adaptive divergence. The identification of genetically differentiated populations in wild species underscores their potential as reservoirs of unique adaptive traits such as drought tolerance, waterlogging and disease resistances, and nutrient-use efficiency. Meanwhile, the genetically diverse cultivated gene pool provides valuable resources for improving biomass productivity, nutritional quality, and resilience to environmental stress. Our findings provide a comprehensive genetic overview of one of the most important tropical forage genera and offer strategic insights for the conservation and utilization of Urochloa genetic resources.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In both cognitive and clinical contexts, external rhythms have been shown to enhance performance when they are aligned with, predict, or entrain stimuli onsets or relevant moments in time. In this study, we aimed to understand the impact of external and internal rhythms on performance in a task devoid of rhythmic temporal structure. We thus investigated the differential impact of auditory beats (1, 2, 5 Hz or no beat) on detection in a non rhythmic, dynamic search task requiring the continuous deployment of attention. We additionally assessed whether the influence of auditory beats on detection was modulated by individual rhythmic preferences as measured by their spontaneous motor tempo. Overall, we found that auditory rhythms enhanced visual task performance, even in the absence of rhythmic structure within the measured task, improving both detection accuracy and response speed. This enhancement was tempo dependent, with the strongest facilitation observed at 2 Hz. The magnitude of the observed benefits varied with individual spontaneous motor tempo, such that participants with slower SMTs exhibited the greatest performance benefits due to the presence of auditory rhythms. We propose that rhythmic stimulation may serve as a powerful scaffold for sustained performance in the context of dynamic and temporally unpredictable environments.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Classical models emphasize a closed-loop circuit (CLC) linking dorsal putamen (PUTd) with motor cortex, but this pathway is anatomically segregated from affective processing regions. Anatomical and clinical evidence point to an alternative: an open-loop circuit (OLC) from ventral putamen (PUTv) that may route affective signals to motor cortex. Here, we conducted two experiments to test whether a functional OLC exists in humans and whether it is differentially engaged by incentive conditions. First, in 7 T resting-state fMRI (multi-echo), PUTv showed robust functional connectivity with both affective and motor regions, including the cingulate motor area (CMA), even after accounting for PUTd variance. This connectivity pattern supports the plausibility of an independent pathway linking affective basal ganglia regions to the motor cortex. Second, in 3 T task fMRI (incentivized reaching), jackpot (high-reward) and robber (high-loss avoidance) incentive conditions produced distinct behavioral and neural signatures. Jackpot produced a speed-accuracy trade-off, with faster movement initiation but more false starts. Neurally, this coincided with engagement (BOLD responses relevant for initiation speed) being reduced in CLC nodes but not in OLC. Robber, in contrast, eliminated engagement in both OLC and CLC nodes, instead recruiting stopping-related regions (e.g., STN), consistent with an avoidance phenomenology. Together, these findings support a versatile architecture for movement initiation that flexibly engages distinct cortico-subcortical circuits depending on incentive phenomenology, and offer a candidate mechanism through which affective salience and valence modulate voluntary movement.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Mitochondrial toxins can induce acute degeneration of DA neurons and Parkinsonism-like phenotypes in animal models, and epidemiological studies have linked pesticide exposure to increased PD risk; however, the long-term effects of pesticide exposure remain elusive. Here, we examined both the acute and long-term effects of rotenone exposure in mice to understand PD onset, progression, and recovery. A 21-day regimen of rotenone intraperitoneal injections (2.5 mg/kg/day) induced robust Parkinsonism-like deficits by the 4th week, including impaired locomotion, increased anxiety-like behaviors, and deficits in motor balancing and coordination. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by pronounced reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Unexpectedly, these functional impairments fully resolved by 12 months, and rotenone-treated mice behaved equally well as age-matched controls. In parallel, the TH expression and DA neuron density in SNc were restored to control levels. Together, these longitudinal results demonstrate that chronic rotenone injection induces robust but reversible Parkinsonism in the acute phase, with limited long-term consequence on Parkinsonism upon toxin cessation. These findings contrast with the prevailing view that environmental pesticide exposure irreversibly drives PD and instead they reveal a substantial resilience and adaptive capacity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in vivo.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Variants in human CYFIP2 cause neurodevelopmental disabilities including vision deficits, but how it functions to shape visually-driven behavior is unclear. Here we measured multiple visually-mediated behaviors, brain-wide activity, and conditional rescue of behavioral defects in larval zebrafish to define cyfip2's roles in assembling visual sensorimotor circuits. cyfip2 mutants display severe deficits in prey capture and dark and light flash responses, despite normal optokinetic responses, indicating intact retinal phototransduction but disrupted downstream sensorimotor integration. Both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity are reduced in the optic tectum of cyfip2 mutants, as measured by phospho-ERK immunostaining and pan-neuronal calcium, consistent with impaired functional input from retinal ganglion cells. Finally, using conditional transgenic alleles to temporally control Cyfip2 expression, we identified a critical window from 30-50 hours post-fertilization during which Cyfip2 acts through Rac1-dependent actin polymerization but not FMRP-mediated translation to establish visual behavior circuits.

E.; Kobeleva, X.; Schmidt, R.", "abstract": "Identifying neural oscillations is essential for linking fast brain dynamics to underlying cognitive states. However, this is challenging because oscillatory events can be brief, embedded in 1/f-like background activity, and may comprise an unknown number of spectrally distinct states. Conventional approaches often apply narrowband band-pass filters to one or a few predefined frequency bands, followed by fixed power- or amplitude-thresholding to identify oscillatory events. Although recent unsupervised alternatives based on Hidden Markov models (HMM) address these limitations, they still require a priori specification of the number of states and can underfit or overfit when the number of states is misspecified. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric method that identifies distinct oscillatory states while inferring an appropriate number of states directly from the data. This method combines time-delay embedding (TDE) with the Dirichlet-process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM). TDE augments the signal with time-shifted copies, enabling the DP-GMM to capture frequency-specific local autocovariance structures, while the Dirichlet-process prior adapts model complexity by pruning inactive components. We benchmarked the approach against a filter-based thresholding method and the time-delay embedded HMM using single-channel synthetic data designed to mimic neural time series (e.g., EEG, MEG, and local field potentials), with multiple frequency components embedded in 1/f-like noise. In this setting, the proposed model reliably recovered multiple distinct frequency components under noisy conditions while also inferring the correct number of oscillatory states. Applied to a resting-state motor-cortex MEG dataset, the model identified multiple frequency-selective, short-lived oscillatory states that exhibited substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in peak frequency, occurrence rate, and power. Overall, this provides a fully unsupervised route to discovering frequency-selective oscillatory states without predefining frequency bands or selecting the number of states in advance.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we applied two environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis methods, species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and cetacean-targeting metabarcoding using Ceta prmers, to detect Indo-Pacific finless porpoises' eDNA in Hong Kong waters. First, we empirically validated the performance of the qPCR primers previously designed in another study. Then, in March 2025, water samples were collected from surface and bottom water layers in 20 locations in the Soko Islands area, a major habitat of the Indo-Pacific finless porpoises. The qPCR analysis detected the finless porpoise eDNA in eight out of 40 samples, but all of the eDNA concentrations were below the limit of quantification. Ceta metabarcoding detected the finless porpoise eDNA from seven out of 40 samples. The qPCR and Ceta metabarcoding approaches showed comparable detection rates for Indo-Pacific finless porpoise. Interestingly, the Ceta metabarcoding method detected a transient cetacean species, the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), from a single location. Both methods showed consistent detection rates between surface and bottom water layers, with no statistically significant difference. Overall, the two eDNA analysis methods successfully detected the finless porpoise eDNA in Hong Kong waters, demonstrating the potential of these approaches for monitoring the Indo-Pacific finless porpoises and other cetaceans in this region.

We utilize a large a set of human bone samples from medieval cemeteries in south-western Norway. Detailed microscopic analyses have been carried out, showing diverse levels of preservation. The extent of bioerosion is correlated with the results from metagenomic analyses as well as environmental factors. Microbiome diversity is greater and more evenly distributed in well-preserved bones with limited bioerosion, particularly those recovered from burials beneath church floors, contrasting with outdoor cemeteries.

While existing NMD rules categorize PTCs as NMD-triggering or NMD-evading, they cannot quantitatively predict the degree of NMD activity for a given endogenous PTC variant. To provide quantitative insight into NMD, we used saturation genome editing (SGE) to systematically introduce all possible PTCs (TAA, TAG, TGA) at every codon position spanning the first, penultimate, and three internal exons of the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. Combining targeted sequencing with NMD inhibition, we measured mRNA expression and NMD activity for 722 PTCs and 211 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Our data validate known positional trends in NMD activity but reveal unexpected complexity. In the penultimate exon, the PTC position effect extends beyond the binary 50-55 nucleotides (nt) rule, revealing a quantitative relationship between the PTC-EJC distance and NMD activity. At the 5' end, NMD is completely absent in the first 21 codons of LMNA, followed by sharp activation over the next 4 codons. Both patterns, at the 5' end and in the penultimate exon, are unexplained by current models. Finally, internal exons show robust NMD with outliers consistently mapping to predicted readthrough-permissive sequence contexts, including the conserved readthrough promoting TGA-CT motif.

These branches are regulated by distinct GAP complexes: GATOR1 (Depdc5-Nprl2-Nprl3) inhibits RagA/B, and TSC (TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7) inhibits Rheb. Despite the prevailing view that these pathways converge only at mTORC1 itself, several observations suggest upstream crosstalk. This gap is especially striking in organisms like C. elegans and S. cerevisiae that lack the TSC complex yet maintain fully responsive mTORC1 signaling. How these inputs are dynamically coordinated under complex physiological conditions and in organisms lacking the key components remain unknown. We performed unbiased quantitative proteomics in C. elegans and identified the GATOR1 complex as a previously unrecognized RHEB-1 (C. elegans ortholog of Rheb) interactor. Through biochemical validation in human cells, we show that nucleotide-free Rheb associates with the Nprl2-Nprl3 subunits of GATOR1, whereas GTP-bound or membrane-detached Rheb mutants fail to bind. Nutrient stress, but not direct pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1, robustly induced this interaction. In TSC2-null cells, where Rheb is constitutively GTP-loaded, Rheb-Nprl2/3 binding was strongly diminished and was restored by expressing the nucleotide-free RhebS20N mutant, demonstrating that Rheb's nucleotide state governs this interaction. Pulldown assays confirmed that the Nprl2/3 heterodimer is sufficient for binding nucleotide-free Rheb. Structural modeling using AlphaFold3 consistently positioned Rheb at a conserved site on Nprl3 distinct from the RagA/B GAP-active surface of Nprl2, supporting a non-catalytic mode of association. Together, these findings identify a conserved, nutrient-regulated physical interaction between Rheb and the Nprl2/3 subunits of GATOR1, revealing a previously unrecognized point of convergence between the growth factor and amino acid branches of the mTORC1 pathway.

Method: We implement two quantum algorithms for DNA multi pattern string matching for k-mer detection based on Grover's amplitude amplification with quantum random access memory (QRAM). The first algorithm uses an enumerate-m oracle that sequentially checks a loaded text substring against all m patterns achieving O({surd}S) query complexity for S text positions but requiring O(mxL) work per oracle call. The second algorithm employs nested Grover search with an outer loop over text positions and an inner loop over pattern space, reducing oracle complexity to O(L) while performing O({surd}Sx{surd}m) in total. Results: We present two quantum implementations of multi-pattern string matching tailored for k-mer detection. Leveraging quantum parallelism and Grover-inspired search primitives, our methods accelerate dictionary-based pattern matching, particularly in contexts involving large sequences, such as genomic data, and extensive pattern sets. Conclusions: While implementation challenges such as QRAM overhead remain, this study demonstrates both the promise and current limitations of quantum-enhanced string matching, establishing a foundational step toward quantum readiness in bioinformatics.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Using an identical active space, basis set, and frozen-core treatment, we benchmark VQE electronic energies against classical restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) force-field energies across an ensemble of peptide conformations. While VQE and active-space RHF energies show systematic agreement within the defined electronic subspace, both exhibit weak correlation with MD-derived energetics, highlighting the fundamentally different physical contributions captured by electronic structure methods and classical force fields. These results demonstrate that NISQ-era quantum chemistry provides complementary, rather than redundant, information relative to classical MD and delineate the scope and limitations of applying VQE to biologically relevant peptide fragments.

W.; Thompson, L.; Chen, J.", "abstract": "Autophosphorylation of CheA is key to initiation of the phosphorylation cascade that eventually controls the direction of downstream flagellar motors for chemotaxis signaling in motile bacteria. The phospho-transfer reaction, from ATP bound in the P4 catalytic domain to a specific His residue in the P1 substrate domain in CheA, can be significantly accelerated within core signaling unit complexes containing chemoreceptors, CheA and CheW. Previous studies have proposed that CheA autophosphorylation activity is regulated by changing the dynamics of P4 and/or altering its interactions with P1 in response to signals transmitted from chemoreceptors. However, the positions of CheA P1 and P2 domains in the core signaling unit are not well-characterized because they form only transient interactions with other domains. Though previous studies have identified possible domain-domain interaction surfaces, especially for P1 and P4, a bottom-up analysis of these interactions has not been performed. Here, we employed extensive molecular simulations to analyze interactions among CheA domains using a hybrid resolution (HyRes) protein model designed for dynamic protein structures and interactions. The results revealed multiple major modes of dynamic P1/P4 interactions. In particular, P1 was found to bind dynamically near the preferential binding surfaces on P4 even in the ATP free state. ATP binding to P4 reduces the motion of P1 binding and promotes a trans- productive-like mode that brings His48 in close contact with the bound ATP for possible autophosphorylation. The predicted non-productive and productive P1/P4 interaction modes appear highly consistent with existing NMR, mutagenesis, and chemical modification data. Together, these findings provide a more complete picture of the dynamics of domain-domain interactions of CheA and new insights into the possible regulation mechanism of its autophosphorylation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here the monocrotaline (MCT) rat has been investigated as a model of an inflammatory lung with developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) on which an ALI is superimposed. 14 days following a single systemic dose of MCT, the lung is functionally normal, but stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in an altered response. The MCT/LPS lung is morphologically similar to LPS alone, with respiratory mechanics showing increased elastance, reduced compliance and increased tissue resistance. Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid demonstrated a cellular infiltrate, with large macrophage-like cells, increased secreted angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and total protein. The lung transcriptome is pushed towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, (interferon (IFN)-{Upsilon}, interleukin 6 (IL6), CD68 and CD80) compared to LPS alone. Additionally, the MCT/LPS lung has gene transcription signatures for enhanced cell death and DNA damage responses, higher levels of multiple complement components, dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin pathway with reduced ACE2 and increased AGTR1, increased factors such as Erythroferrone that would increase iron levels, and increased fibrinogen and A2M, that would promote thrombosis. Thus, the MCT-treated rat represents an animal with no overt clinical distinction but following LPS stimulation elicits an exacerbated pathogenic lung response. The MCT-treated rat is a simple model that might be beneficial for understanding an M1 lung pathology with activated complement, low ACE2, high iron, and a propensity to clot in the context of developing cardiovascular disease.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We first validated this model, confirming substantial reductions in eIF3d mRNA and protein levels in dorsal root ganglia. Baseline assessments revealed no differences in mechanical, thermal, cold, or spontaneous pain behaviors between eIF3d+/- (HET) and eIF3d+/+ (WT) mice, indicating intact basal nociceptive function. In pain models involving peripheral inflammation and metabolic stress, including methylglyoxal injection, IL-6 administration and paw incision, HET mice displayed significantly reduced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. In contrast, HET mice exhibited increased second phase nocifensive behavior in the formalin test, possibly indicating enhanced central sensitization. Hyperalgesic priming was comparable between HET and WT mice following IL-6 exposure. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced mice were unaffected by eIF3d reduction. These findings demonstrate that eIF3d selectively modulates nociceptive plasticity under defined stress conditions and suggests a context dependent role in the regulation of inflammatory and central pain sensitization.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we determined how neurons in the brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transform a world-centric (allocentric) reference frame to one that is body-centric (egocentric), which is essential for navigating to a goal. PFL1 neurons in the fly's central complex, the navigation center, have two dendrites; one of these receives input from neurons that encode a head direction vector, while the other receives input from neurons in a neuropil called the fan-shaped body (FB). Therefore, we investigated whether PFL1 neurons transform allocentric vectors to an egocentric reference frame. We developed a computational model that shows how PFL1 can transform an allocentric direction vector encoded by FB neurons to an egocentric reference frame by nonlinearly combining it with the head direction input. In tethered flying flies, we simultaneously recorded the head direction input to as well as the output of PFL1, which we used to constrain and fit our model. This allowed us to infer that PFL1 neurons receive a stored direction that persists across behavioral trials for the same fly but appears to be random across flies, fundamental characteristics of a goal.

Synapse loss has been known for decades as the strongest correlate with cognition and disease progression in AD patients, but the molecular mechanisms that drive synapse degeneration remain elusive. Here, we identify Sarm1, a new class of NAD+ hydrolase required for Wallerian degeneration of periphery nerves after injuries, as the key mediator of synaptic degeneration in AD brains. Sarm1 knockout largely reversed synapse loss, amyloid burden, and cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice. We found that Sarm1 is enriched in synaptic terminals and becomes activated in synaptic dystrophies adjacent to Abeta; plaques, leading to synapse degeneration and subsequent neuroinflammation. Sarm1 deletion in the AD mice prevented synaptic dystrophies and rescued short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Further, Sarm1 deletion protected synapses from C1q tagging and phagocytosis, and C1q-MERTK signaling in complement cascades was significantly reduced. The reduced synapse degeneration, in turn, broke the feed-forward loop of \"glia activation-neuroinflammation-Abeta deposition\". These data suggest that Sarm1 plays a key role in driving synapse degeneration in AD before C1q-tagging and phagocytic clearance, and targeting Sarm1 may offer a novel intervention to attenuate synapse degeneration and memory loss in AD.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, identifying robust brain-psychopathology associations with neuroimaging has proven difficult, in part due to substantial heterogeneity within and comorbidity between diagnostic categories. Transdiagnostic bifactor models aim to characterise this structure by separating shared from unique symptom variance, yielding more reliable and potentially more accurate latent dimensions of psychopathology. However, the extent to which these behavioural models improve brain-psychopathology associations remains largely uncharacterised. Using two large developmental cohorts, we compared 11 previously published bifactor models applied to the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) to traditional CBCL summary scores. For both symptom-scoring approaches, we systematically evaluated their reliability and multivariate associations with whole-brain structure (MRI) and function (resting-state fMRI). We found no consistent evidence that bifactor-derived factor scores strengthened reliability or brain-psychopathology associations, relative to summary scores. Whole-brain predictive models revealed broadly distributed neural signatures that were highly similar between corresponding factor and summary score constructs, with general factors and total problems approaching numerical equivalence. Nevertheless, factor scores displayed more distinct neural signatures between general, internalising, and externalising dimensions than did summary scores. Together, these findings suggest that existing CBCL bifactor models of psychopathology do not systematically strengthen the predictive utility of psychiatric neuroimaging, possibly reflecting fundamental limits on the proportion of CBCL symptom variance captured by brain features. While bifactor models may aid in separating neural correlates across constructs, improving phenotypic assessment depth, rather than alternative phenotypic modelling, may provide more tangible improvements to association strength moving forward.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We introduce a low-rank tensor decomposition framework specifically designed for cross-bispectral EEG data. The model expresses the bispectrum as a product of a single spatial mixing matrix and a compact source-interaction tensor, yielding a structured and interpretable representation of the data. Unlike classical tensor decompositions such as Tucker and its special case PARAFAC, where either the core tensor is unconstrained or restricted to rank-one terms, our formulation incorporates a source-space interpretation directly through the tensor Qmnp, making the decomposition well suited for identifying dominant coupling components. After obtaining the low-rank representation, spatial demixing is performed using MOCA to derive clear and interpretable source maps. Through simulations, we show that the method consistently retrieves the dominant structure of the bispectrum across a wide range of conditions, including changes in SNR, dipole orientation, amplitude balance, and source complexity. Applied to resting-state EEG, the method produces anatomically plausible parietal generators associated with the strongest alpha-band bispectral interactions. Overall, the framework provides a principled and computationally efficient approach for reducing and interpreting cross-bispectral EEG data, offering source-level insights that are difficult to obtain using standard tensor factorization techniques.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Longitudinal vis-OCT imaging after optic nerve crush (ONC) revealed that VHRFs emerged as early as 6 hours post-injury and peaked before the significant RGC loss. Confocal analysis showed that these VHRFs corresponded to activated amoeboid microglia undergoing vertical migration from the outer to inner retina and horizontal movement toward the optic nerve head area. Similar amoeboid microglia were also observed in the anterior segment, suggesting a global ocular inflammatory response to the ONC injury. RNAscope in situ hybridization further demonstrated elevated IL-1{beta} expression in vitreous amoeboid microglia. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of IL-1 signaling with an IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced VHRFs, suppressed microglial migration, and delayed RGC loss.

Differences in murine cardiomyocyte biology and repeated failures to translate discoveries into novel therapies for septic shock underscore a key translational need for human-relevant disease modeling. We sought to investigate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) exposed to mortality risk-stratified septic serum as a model of SAMD. Methods: Serum from children with septic shock (n=120) was stratified by Pediatric Sepsis Biomarker Risk Model (PERSEVERE) II mortality probability as low, intermediate, or high risk. We conducted aptamer-based proteomic analysis of septic serum to determine differentially expressed proteins in children with high compared to low mortality risk. We treated iPSC-CMs with risk-stratified septic serum and defined contractile and mitochondrial functional and transcriptomic responses. Results: We found 612 differentially expressed proteins in children with high mortality probability, most prominently interleukins (IL)-6 and -8. High-risk septic serum reversibly depressed iPSC-CM contractility as measured by percent shortening, while low-risk septic serum had no impact. Further, high-risk septic serum depressed basal mitochondrial respiration, maximum uncoupled respiration, and coupled oxidative phosphorylation in iPSC-CMs relative to low-risk serum. We identified distinct patterns of gene expression due to risk-stratified serum with 5,293 differentially expressed genes, including upregulation of acute phase reactants and apolipoproteins and downregulation of chemokines, as well as transcriptional changes reflective of chronic IL-6 and IL-8 signaling. Conclusions: Septic serum from children with high mortality risk exhibited distinct proteomic signatures, notably enriched for IL-6 and IL-8. Human iPSC-CMs differentially responded to risk-stratified septic serum, recapitulating phenotypic features of SAMD including reversible contractility depression and mitochondrial dysfunction with high-risk septic serum.

Minor groove binders (MGB), such as MGB-BP-3, are a promising new antibacterial with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria but thought to have limited potency against Gram-negative bacteria. Objectives: This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of MGB-BP-3 under nutrient-limited, physiologically relevant conditions to better mimic in vivo environments. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against a panel of ESKAPEE pathogens in both rich (Cation Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth, CA-MHB) and nutrient-limited media (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, RPMI-1640 + 10% Luria-Bertani, LB). Synergy with efflux pump inhibitors and membrane permeabilizers was evaluated via checkerboard assays. Permeability was assessed using a fluorescent DNA-binding cell permeant (Hoechst 33342) accumulation assay. MICs were determined in the presence of different concentrations of ions, using both wild-type and efflux-compromised strains. In vivo efficacy was assessed using the Galleria mellonella infection model. Results: The activity of MGB-BP-3 against Gram-negative bacteria was improved by shifting the medium from rich to nutrient-limited conditions. Specifically, it showed potent activity against E. coli in nutrient-limited media (MIC 3.1 M) but was inactive in rich media (MIC 700 M). Synergy with efflux inhibitors occurred mainly in rich media, indicating barriers to intracellular accumulation were not present in nutrient-limited conditions. Increased permeability correlated with enhanced susceptibility and efflux-deficient strains were more susceptible, confirming the role of efflux pumps in resistance. MGB-BP-3 provided dose-dependent protection in G. mellonella larvae infected with E. coli or S. aureus. For example, at concentrations of 12.5 M and 100 M, MGB-BP-3 was able to protect the larvae by more than 70% over 5 days of treatment, respectively. Conclusions: Nutrient-limited media better reveal MGB-BP-3's activity against Gram-negative bacteria and align with in vivo efficacy, highlighting the need for host-mimicking conditions in antibiotic screening.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

During long-term colonization, P. aeruginosa adapts to the CF lung by downregulating virulence factors and adopting a biofilm-associated, mucoid lifestyle. Despite the expected reduction in immune activation due to these adaptations, excessive inflammation persists, a paradox that remains poorly understood. Our objective was to identify novel bacterial mediators sustaining persistent inflammation by P. aeruginosa in the CF lung. To this end, we analyzed clinical P. aeruginosa CF isolates, cultured them in synthetic CF sputum medium, and exposed 3D lung epithelial cell cultures to the resulting cell-free supernatants. There was considerable variability in pro-inflammatory activity among the isolates, with a subset of the isolates inducing strong IL-8 secretion by the 3D cells despite low production of known virulence factors. Comparative proteomics analysis of the cell-free supernatants of pro- and anti-inflammatory isolates revealed several mediators not previously linked to inflammation. Thirteen of these candidate pro-inflammatory mediators were selected for further analysis. Using P. aeruginosa transposon mutants lacking the respective mediators, DksA (a transcription factor) was confirmed as an immunomodulatory mediator in the 3D lung model. Finally, analysis of existing transcriptomes of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum, revealed that dksA was found to be one of the most strongly expressed genes in this patient population, highlighting the relevance of our findings.

A total of 3,588 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for seven antifungal agents (amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, isavuconazole, olorofim, and terbinafine) were obtained from 19 international laboratories. Four of seven antifungals met the CLSI M57 guidelines criteria to determine the ECV. Established ECVs for amphotericin B were found to be high with 8 g/mL for S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, and 4 g/mL for S. schenckii. Itraconazole ECVs were 4 g/mL for S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Posaconazole ECVs were 4 g/mL for all three species (tentative for S. globosa), while the terbinafine ECV for S. brasiliensis was 0.12 g/mL. Olorofim demonstrated good in vitro activity, particularly against S. brasiliensis. Overall, this study establishes validated ECVs for key antifungals against Sporothrix species and identifies a low prevalence of non-wild type (NWT) isolates, supporting ongoing antifungal resistance monitoring.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Although several different enzymes like transporters and acyl-CoA synthetases are involved, the sequential mechanistic steps of the process are poorly understood. Here, we have addressed the role of the caveola coat protein caveolin1 and the acyl-CoA synthetase FATP1 in the process as both have major impacts in the uptake and storage of fatty acids in vivo and in vitro. Using live cell microscopy and mass spectrometry-based quantification of LCFA metabolism, we found that FATP1-mediated uptake and metabolic processing of LCFAs is coupled to, and dependent on caveolin1. Furthermore, both proteins stimulate the incorporation of LCFA into phospholipids and triacylglycerol, but not in sphingolipids. Using correlative light and electron microscopy we found that membrane contact sites are formed between FATP1-enriched endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and caveolae. Analysis of their temporal stability showed that they are dynamic but frequently persist over minutes. We propose that caveolae directly couple the plasma membrane (PM) to the ER for directed LCFA transport and metabolic processing.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We combined polygenic scores derived from genome-wide association studies of adult g and educational attainment, conditioned on their prediction of adult g, to create adult 'polygenic g scores' which we used to chart the course of cognitive development of 10,000 white British children from infancy through early adulthood. We integrated cross-sectional regression, latent growth curve, and cross-time common factor analysis to systematically characterise cognitive development. Polygenic g score showed minimal prediction in infancy, modest prediction in childhood, and substantial prediction by early adulthood, accounting for 12% of the variance. Higher polygenic g scores were associated with faster cognitive growth in latent growth models. Prediction was strongest for a cross-time common cognitive factor (15%), reflecting substantial stable genetic influences across development. We also examined the polygenic g score's prediction of educational achievement, behaviour problems, and anthropometric outcomes and found similar developmental increases in prediction for educational achievement. Together, our findings demonstrated that adult polygenic g scores can be a useful tool for charting the development of cognitive traits.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Dominance and subordination are defined by priority of access to resources in competitive contexts. While dominant individuals can control access to resources, subordinates must obtain food through alternative strategies. In direct encounters with dominants, subordinates are expected to adjust their behavior to the partner on a moment to moment basis. However, the decision dynamics in such situations remain unclear. We tested large-billed crows in a dyadic feeding experiment to examine whether social status shapes feeding behavior. Using tracking analysis, we quantified the time series of approach velocity toward food and assessed whether its dynamics were modulated by the partner's movements. Subordinates adjusted the velocity of their reaching movements. Specifically, a dominant's approach increased a subordinate's reaching speed, suggesting that subordinates accelerated to avoid aggression under dominance pressure. In contrast, this effect was weak or absent in dominants, indicating asymmetric social influences on foraging. Taken together, these findings suggest that subordinates fine tune the kinematics of feeding behavior in response to dominant movements, whereas dominants do not.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are key regulators of fasting metabolism, yet their role in controlling urea cycle genes has not been fully defined. Here we identify FoxOs as direct regulators of hepatic argininosuccinate synthase 1 (Ass1). Because FoxOs often act through Kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) in amino acid metabolism, we tested whether Ass1 regulation requires Klf15. Acute hepatic FoxO1/3a knockdown in fasted mice selectively reduced Ass1 expression, lowered blood glucose, and shifted urea-cycle amino acids, with arginine decreased and ornithine increased, even in Klf15-deficient livers. Silencing Ass1 phenocopied these metabolic effects, indicating that Ass1 mediates a key FoxO-dependent branch of fasting adaptation. Mechanistically, we mapped a functional FoxO-binding element within an upstream Ass1 enhancer: FoxO1/3a activated the enhancer in reporter assays, EMSA confirmed binding, and in vivo luciferase imaging and liver ChIP demonstrated fasting-inducible enhancer activity and FoxO occupancy.

This corona significantly influences nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in vivo, making detailed characterization essential for the rational design of effective, targeted nanomedicines. Recent proteomics studies have identified proteins enriched on ionizable lipid nanoparticle (LNP) surfaces and demonstrated their functional effects on nucleic acid delivery. However, the structural architecture of these protein-LNP interactions remains unclear. In this study, we used cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to directly visualize protein coronae on LNP surfaces in their native, hydrated state. Unlike hard nanoparticles (e.g., polystyrene) that develop distinct \"fuzzy\" protein shells, LNPs extensively associated with lipoproteins through membrane fusion rather than discrete shell formation. This structural organization was consistently observed across four LNP formulations with varied helper lipids. Parallel analyses of extracellular vesicles (EVs) showed similar lipoprotein fusion behavior, suggesting this mechanism is characteristic of lipid-based nanoparticles. Mass spectrometry identified 37 proteins across formulations, with apolipoproteins representing a substantial fraction, confirming the biochemical signature of lipoprotein engagement. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how proteins interact with LNPs unconventionally, which likely influences biodistribution and organ targeting. This alternative mode of protein-nanoparticle interaction fundamentally redefines LNP-biological system engagement and necessitates a re-evaluation of design principles to engineer specific lipoprotein engagements for improved therapeutic outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We introduce a path-integral formalism to identify the maturation trajectories of the rare clones ending at the desired target affinity, estimate their probabilities, and maximize them over the antigen-concentration temporal profile.

However, the concentrations of concomitant agents required to suppress resistance emergence remain undefined. This study aimed to quantify the concentration-dependent effects of companion drugs on macrolide resistance using an improved time-kill assay and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling approach. Methods: Time-kill assays were performed on M. avium ATCC 700898 using azithromycin alone or in combination with ethambutol, rifampicin, amikacin, or clofazimine. Total and resistant bacterial populations were quantified over 28 days. A pharmacodynamic (PD) model describing the dynamics of susceptible and resistant subpopulations was linked to a pharmacokinetic (PK) model incorporating alveolar macrophage concentrations to simulate resistance and bactericidal rates under various dosing regimens. Results: Macrolide resistance most frequently emerged at 2 to 4x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin, whereas resistance was less frequent at 8 to 16x MIC or sub-MIC levels. The addition of companion drugs suppressed resistance emergence even at sub-MIC levels. PK/PD simulations demonstrated that standard-dose ethambutol effectively prevented macrolide resistance, whereas rifampicin provided minimal protection. More frequent dosing schedules enhanced resistance suppression compared with once-daily regimens. Conclusion: This study defines the concentration-dependent contributions of concomitant agents to macrolide resistance suppression in M. avium and establishes a quantitative PK/PD framework for evaluating resistance emergence.

Agonists of these receptors can cause a disinhibition of principal neurons by inhibiting GABA release or interneuron firing. However, direct evidence for a similar action of tianeptine has not previously been reported. We therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on in vivo and in vitro measures of inhibitory synaptic transmission. CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and local field potential (LFP) activity were recorded in area CA1 of anaesthetised rats. To obtain a more direct measure of the actions of tianeptine on GABA release, we also conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (sIPSCs and eIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Intrahippocampal infusion of tianeptine (15 mM; 1 microlitre) caused a marked reduction in paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the population spike (20-ms inter-stimulus interval) elicited in the CA1 cell-body layer. Separate recordings in the stratum radiatum revealed an enhancement of beta and gamma-frequency LFP activity, an effect of tianeptine that we have reported previously. Infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline caused a similar reduction in PPI but did not induce beta/gamma oscillations. In mouse hippocampal slices, tianeptine (50 micromolar) reduced both sIPSC frequency and eIPSC amplitude. These results confirm that tianeptine causes a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells, but suggest that a simple blockade of GABAergic transmission is not alone sufficient to explain its effects on hippocampal network activity.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We then asked how direction and orientation preferences depend on visual-field location and how tuning similarity among units depend on lateral and vertical distance. Retinal boutons were strongly tuned and closely matched the topographic organization of direction- and orientation-selective ganglion cells, confirming that SC receives a highly ordered, retino-centric code for motion and edges. With increasing depth, SC neurons progressively deviated from this organization. Pairwise and population analyses revealed only weak local clustering, confined to very small spatial scales, and no robust global maps of direction or orientation.

These cells drive type 2 immune responses critical for wound healing and the development of protective immunity. Macrophages, particularly monocyte-derived macrophages that seed the lung after infection, are central effectors of these responses and may be distinct from the tissue-resident populations they replace. However, the cellular and molecular factors governing the attrition of tissue-resident (TR) macrophages and their replacement remain poorly understood. We find that ILC2s and IL-4/IL-13-producing CD4+ T cells bi-directionally interact to regulate alveolar macrophage (AM) populations during infection. In the absence of these cells, type 2 immune responses are muted, leading to impaired anti-parasitic immunity in the lung during re-infection. This correlates with diminished expansion of type 2-polarized monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (Mo-AMs), which are metabolically and transcriptionally distinct from TR-AMs. While Mo-AMs highly upregulated expression of Arg1, this was not essential for development of protective immunity in the lung. Concomitant with a more glycolytic metabolism, ILC2-induced Mo-AMs selectively upregulate arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15), which promotes the capacity of macrophages to attack parasites in vitro.

Investigation of CYP6Z gene expression and genetic diversity analyses indicate that resistance is primarily associated with transcriptional upregulation rather than fixed coding mutations since no predominant haplotype was selected. Structural characterisation reveals a flexible, promiscuous active site in CYP6Z enzymes, enabling binding of multiple insecticide classes.

The shells form in water, are structurally diverse, and show exceptional resistance against high temperatures and the strongest chemicals. Combining single-cell transcriptomics and mass-spectrometry of the shells, we identified the amino acid sequences of the shell-forming proteins.

A subset of CTCF sites also provide insulator activity and barrier activity to block inappropriate enhancer-promoter communication and spreading of histone modifications and non-coding transcription into loci where it is unwarranted.  Paradoxically, other CTCF sites mediate enhancer and promoter communication, partly by supporting DNA loop extrusion within chromatin domains. Despite intensive study and abundant data, it remains poorly understood how CTCF directs these different functions. In this study we provide new data and mine published data that show that CTCF utilises zinc fingers 9 to 11 and an upstream DNA binding consensus sequence resembling CAGCTGTTCC to mediate high affinity binding and enhancer-blocking insulator activity. A single high affinity CTCF binding site from the IL3 locus is able block IL3 promoter activation by an upstream enhancer. Mutation of a CTGCAGCTTT sequence upstream of the CTCF core motif abolishes insulator activity. We propose that CTCF is able to confer insulator and barrier activity upon a specific subset of CTCF sites that contain the upstream DNA consensus binding motif, thereby allowing CTCF to function differently in different contexts.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We test this prediction by comparing the rates of multivariate skull morphological evolution required to traverse the boundaries between adaptive zones against genetic drift expectations. Our dataset includes 11,793 specimens spanning 231 species from 12 mammalian clades, each containing unique ecological transitions into new adaptive zones. Using a quantitative genetics framework, we estimated the phenotypic distances between ancestral and derived adaptive zones and contrasted them with null expectations under genetic drift. While a few adaptive zone invasions (e.g., marsupials and rodents) are consistent with drift, most exhibit substantially elevated rates of evolution. These results suggest that directional selection has recurrently shaped mammalian cranial evolution during major ecological shifts.

C.", "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, and effective treatment options are limited once photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are lost. In advanced stages, vision restoration requires strategies that replace or bypass degenerated retinal circuitry. Retinal sheet transplantation using fetal neural retinal tissue has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating long-term survival, integration with the host retina, and partial restoration of light-driven responses. We previously showed that such transplants can restore fundamental visual response properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rapidly degenerating rats. However, it remains unclear whether restored retinal input can support higher-order cortical computations that depend on the integration of classical and extra-classical receptive field mechanisms. In this study, we extend this investigation by evaluating whether fetal retinal sheet transplants can restore extra-classical surround modulation in neurons of higher visual areas (V2). Fetal retinal sheets (E18-E19) derived from donor rats were transplanted into one eye of Rho-S334ter line-3 rats at ages P41-P78, when rod degeneration is nearly complete and cones are largely nonfunctional. Animals were assessed 2.2-9.3 months post-surgery using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings from V2, optokinetic testing, OCT imaging, and histology. Control groups included normal-vision rats, age-matched degenerated rats (AMC), and sham-operated line-3 rats. Transplants survived long term, developed laminated and rosetted photoreceptor structures, and integrated with the host retina. Optokinetic testing revealed significant improvement in spatial acuity in transplanted eyes compared with degenerated controls beginning at three months post-surgery. Transplanted rats exhibited a markedly higher proportion of visually responsive V2 neurons than degenerated animals (21.0% vs. 8.2%). They also showed significantly shorter response latencies and larger visually evoked response amplitudes, indicating improved transmission of retinal signals to the cortex. To quantify surround suppression, neurons were tested with sinusoidal gratings confined to the classical receptive field and gratings extended to full-field size. Transplanted rats displayed robust surround suppression properties similar to normal controls, including significantly reduced firing rates and narrower tuning under full-field conditions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on net responses to CRF and FF stimulus sizes reliably distinguished control and transplanted neurons from degenerated ones but could not separate control from transplant, further indicating similar response properties in these two groups. These findings provide the first demonstration that retinal sheet transplants restore not only basic visual responses but also higher-order cortical mechanisms involving extra-classical surround suppression. This recovery of surround suppression in V2 suggests that transplanted retinal tissue can re-establish functionally meaningful circuits capable of supporting complex visual processing. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of retinal sheet transplantation for advanced retinal degenerative disease and provide the first evidence of surround suppression in the rat V2.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

However, they can be recovered through ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) and stochastic mapping. By implementing and validating a new ASR and stochastic mapping package compatible with both single-locus and multispecies coalescent analysis, we show how reconstructing substitutions along tree branches provides a practical approach to phylogenetic inference that has a number of advantages, in terms of both efficiency and in the information gained about the tempo and mode of molecular evolution. Based on a range of simulated datasets, we observe that substitution histories are recovered more accurately and precisely on time trees with relaxed clocks compared with unconstrained substitution trees that lack temporal directionality (maximum likelihood and Bayesian). We show that codon-partition models with site-rate heterogeneity (i.e., with four nucleotide states) can effectively approximate synonymous and non-synonymous substitution histories while requiring far less runtime than computationally demanding 61-state codon models. In turn, this provides a low-bias estimator of dN/dS that can outperform existing stochastic-mapping methods. Lastly, we ground-truth the stochastic mapping approach by showing that it can recover expected patterns in molecular evolution and pathogen transmission in three different case studies: i) that smaller mammals tend to have faster substitution rates than their larger relatives, ii) that the rate of change in 3Di structural-alphabet characters in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase anticodon binding domain is associated with amino acid substitution rate, and iii) that influenza A virus spread more frequently to nearby locations than distant ones, in a major H3N2 outbreak in New Zealand. These three effects were more pronounced when based on count estimates (via stochastic mapping) rather than evolutionary rates and branch lengths (the standard approach).

One genomic prediction method that has not been fully explored is graph attention networks (GAT). By directly analysing graphical data with the attention mechanism, GAT can incorporate the genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) structure to regularise predictions. There are many possible graph structures informed by knowledge of trait genetic architecture. The graphical representation of the inferred trait genetic architecture can be used as prior knowledge for GAT to effectively learn key features of trait genetic architecture and enhance the prediction patterns. Here, we investigated whether incorporating prior knowledge into GAT improved performance compared to GAT models representing a continuum of G2P structures, ranging from infinitesimal to fully connected. Applying the Diversity Prediction Theorem, we also combined these diverse G2P structures into an ensemble of GAT genomic prediction models to integrate complementary strengths of multiple models. The results for flowering time traits in two maize nested association mapping datasets showed a lack of consistent performance improvement in the prior knowledge GAT model. However, consistent outperformance was observed for the ensemble of GAT models. Improved predictions from the ensemble model may be driven by its ability to capture a more complete representation of the trait genetic architecture through the integration of information from diverse G2P structures, as is proposed by the Diversity Prediction Theorem. Our results show that an ensemble of GAT models can enhance prediction performance.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In cell-based studies, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and e-cigarette vapor extract (EVE) consistently suppress LPS-induced TNF- secretion across macrophage/monocyte models, including primary mouse and human cells and complementary cell lines, indicating a reproducible immunosuppressive effect on mature myeloid cells. Brief ex vivo exposure to CSE also alters myeloid subset composition and modifies the proliferative behavior of Tet2-knockout cells, suggesting that smoke-related cues can reshape competitive dynamics among mutant and wild-type myeloid progenitors. To assess consequences of smoking behavior in vivo, we used a custom nose-cone inhalation system to deliver controlled exposures to combustible cigarette smoke or e-cigarette aerosol to mice. Chronic exposure increased myeloid proliferation, consistent with smoking behavior inducing premature aging of the hematopoietic stem cell pool.

Bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics is typically determined by standard in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). However, the results from these assays often do not correlate with therapeutic outcomes, potentially because the test conditions do not reflect those at the infection site. We sought to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in simulated wound fluid (SWF), a medium resembling wound exudate, compared with MHB. We observed discordance in AST results for representative antibiotics across six of nine antibiotic classes tested in SWF compared with MHB against MRSA USA300. The antibiotic classes showing the most significant discordant AST results included tetracyclines, to which USA300 was more resistant (up to a 128-fold shift), and {beta}-lactams, to which MRSA was unexpectedly more sensitive (up to a 256-fold shift) when tested in SWF. Genome-wide assays and subsequent mechanistic characterizations revealed that the increased resistance to tetracyclines is mediated by MntC, an extracellular binding protein of a manganese ABC transporter system, whereas the drastic sensitization to {beta}-lactams was driven by cell envelope remodelling in SWF. Further, Galleria mellonella incision wound infection results matched the in vitro susceptibility phenotypes of the tetracycline doxycycline and the {beta}-lactam cefuroxime in SWF but not in MHB, suggesting that this host-mimetic medium is a better predictor of MRSA in vivo wound infection therapeutic outcomes. Together, this work addresses the relatively long-recognized shortcomings of the MHB-based standard AST by uncovering alterations in MRSA antibiotic susceptibility in wound exudate-like fluid relative to MHB. It uncovers potentially clinically relevant antibiotic response determinants, identifying MntC as a potential new target for adjuvant therapy.

This study investigated start-up and stabilisation dynamics in five parallel 10-L CSTRs operated as direct scale-downs of a full-scale agricultural biogas plant, using identical inoculum, substrate composition, organic loading rate (2.57 g VS/ L day), hydraulic retention time (55 days), and temperature (37 C). The reactors were monitored for 213 days (3.9 HRTs), with one reactor operated for an additional 330 days. All reactors showed highly reproducible behaviour but experienced a transient disturbance, characterised by volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation and fluctuating methane production after approximately one HRT. This disturbance was likely caused by a higher effective daily organic loading rate compared to full scale, resulting from once-daily feeding excluding weekends. Increasing the feeding frequency led to VFA degradation and recovery, and stable process performance was achieved after approximately three HRTs, with methane yields of 285 NL CH4/kg VS. The microbial community showed pronounced dynamics during start-up, including major genus-level shifts within Cloacimonadia and a transition in aceticlastic methanogens from Methanothrix to Methanosarcina compared to the full-scale system. Although microbial composition stabilised after about three HRTs, it remained dynamic during prolonged operation and diverged from the original inoculum.

To better understand how airborne fungi, including known allergens, vary across broad spatial and temporal scales, we leveraged a pre-existing air sampling network to obtain bioaerosol samples from 7 national parks representing diverse biome types across the United States, with samples collected from each site every three days over an entire calendar year. We used marker gene DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR to characterize fungal assemblage composition and concentrations, including the concentrations of ten known allergenic genera. As expected, the composition of the airborne fungal assemblages, including the amounts and types of known allergens, varied across biomes. We also observed substantial temporal variation in the total amounts and types of fungi detected, particularly at higher latitude sites. While some of the temporal variation in allergen abundances followed seasonal patterns, we detected pronounced daily and weekly fluctuations in taxon-specific allergen abundances, with higher wind speeds generally associated with higher fungal allergen concentrations.

Using this model, we demonstrate that Lm exploits a Trojan-horse transmigration mechanism via infected monocytes. Lm-infected THP-1 monocytes displayed a ~4.8-fold higher monocyte transmigration and ~8.12-fold greater intracellular bacterial delivery across the placental barrier compared with non-pathogenic Listeria innocua (Li). Monocyte transmigration was associated with claudin-1 and occludin disruption, increased paracellular permeability, and localization of infected monocytes at junctional breach sites. Monocyte-mediated placental traversal required the Lm virulence factors Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) and internalin B (InlB), as lap- and {Delta}inlB mutants exhibited Li-like transmigration and an ~90% reduction in intracellular bacterial delivery, despite normal monocyte uptake. Lm-infected monocytes induced a ~1.86-fold increase in sVCAM-1 secretion, which was LAP- and InlB-dependent, consistent with pro-transmigration endothelial phenotype. In contrast, extracellular traversal required LAP and internalin A (InlA), as lap- and {Delta}inlA mutants exhibited severe defects comparable to Li, whereas {Delta}inlB and {Delta}hly were minimally impaired. Exposure of monocytes to extracellular Lm further amplified transmigration and barrier permeability.

Increasingly, evidence suggests that interactions are a common feature of infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to both the nonlinearities and stochasticity inherent to infectious disease transmission, and the frequency of confounding (e.g., by shared seasonal forcing), purely statistical methods for characterizing interactions may be prone to failure. Here, we perform a simulation study to evaluate several non-mechanistic approaches for inferring causality from time series data: generalized additive models (GAMs), Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Specifically, we use a two-pathogen mechanistic transmission model, calibrated to produce dynamics resembling outbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to generate synthetic datasets with a range of values for interaction strength and duration. We then apply each method to all synthetic datasets. We find that Granger causality, transfer entropy, and CCM all fail to consistently infer whether data contain signal of an interaction; in particular, methods tend to incorrectly identify interactions where none are modeled (average sensitivity = 80.6%, 92.1%, 72.1%, respectively; average specificity = 31.0%, 33.3%, 33.1%). Furthermore, we find little to no association between point estimates from each method and true interaction strength. In contrast, GAMs infer the existence of interactions more accurately than the other methods (sensitivity = 85.2%, specificity = 72.5%), and consistently yield larger point estimates for stronger interactions. However, their practical utility is limited by an inability to evaluate interaction asymmetry (i.e., whether the effect of pathogen A on pathogen B is identical to that of B on A). We conclude that accurately and comprehensively characterizing pathogen-pathogen interactions based on outbreak data remains a significant challenge. For this reason, it is critical that any proposed methods be rigorously evaluated before being used to draw conclusions about interactions.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Favourable client-scaffold interaction energies within condensates were associated with client partitioning, while client-scaffold interactions competed with scaffold self-interactions.

Finally, we probe the molecular basis for the strong binding interaction between TDP-43 and G4 quadruplex structures and discover similarly avid interactions with cytosine-rich DNA I-motifs.

However, scarcity of building blocks likely led to the evolution of heterotrophic, predatory species. In this work we reconstruct a simple model of such interactions between RNA molecules, based on RNA strands found in sinkhole mineral pools in the Dead Sea. These RNA strands exhibited significant stability in this divergent chemical environment, and contained sequence motifs reminiscent of two ribozyme species, suggesting they could be ancestral to both. We built a system in which a single ancestral RNA strand serves as a limiting resource forming two different species of ribozymes that compete over it. One of these species is capable of metabolizing the other in order to free more of this resource, driving the assembly of additional copies of itself. This interaction resembles a rudimentary food chain, the dynamics of which is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature and magnesium concentrations, with competitive advantage shifting between the species. Taken together, these findings highlight a hypothetical feature of prebiotic life, and hint at the possibility that heterotrophic RNA is a phenomenon that might still occur today in some unique geochemical niches, and even in the overlooked background of modern biological systems.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The trait has been challenging to improve in these clonal crops because it is recessive and linked to undesirable agronomic traits. In blackberry and red raspberry, breeding programs have used recessive mutants at the S locus to generate prickleless cultivars for the last century. In this study, we identified independent loss-of-function mutations in a WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX transcription factor, WOX1, as the genetic basis of the prickleless S locus in both blackberry and red raspberry. We mapped the S locus using integrated genome-wide association, bulked segregant analysis, and identity-by-descent analyses informed by breeding pedigrees. Additionally, we generated a genome sequence from Luther Burbank's prickleless blackberry variety Burbank Thornless that contained an additional allele of WOX1. To verify the gene's role, we used gene editing to knock out WOX1 in an elite prickled commercial blackberry line. All edited plants were prickleless and lacked glandular trichomes, confirming that WOX1 controls a joint developmental pathway. Other plant traits were unchanged, indicating WOX1 is a specific and safe target for improvement. Gene editing can enable breeders to remove prickles directly from elite varieties, reducing the need for extensive breeding cycles and delivering safer, easier-to-harvest cultivars to growers.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

These two components exchange forces continuously--fluid motion deforms the cortex, and cortical deformation in turn redirects intracellular flow. Yet most cellular mechanics simulations treat either the fluid or the cortex in isolation, leaving their mechanical interplay largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed a fluid-structure interaction framework based on the moving-particle semi-implicit (MPS) method that solves the coupled dynamics of cytoplasmic flow, internal pressure, and cortical elasticity. We applied this framework to cytokinesis, focusing on how the cleavage plane is positioned. While the mitotic spindle is known to specify the furrow site, prior work has emphasized biochemical cues emanating from the spindle, whereas a direct mechanical cue has been difficult to interrogate. Our simulations show that spindle elongation generates cytoplasmic flows that create a pressure minimum near the spindle midzone; when the cortex is modeled as an elastic shell, this pressure landscape drives a localized cortical invagination at that site. We therefore propose that spindle-driven cytoplasmic flow provides a mechanical positional cue for cleavage-furrow initiation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

It is metabolized into glutamate through the action of the 5-oxoprolinase enzyme, the only enzyme known to act on this metabolite. 5-OP has long been known to be relatively inert with a proposed role as an osomoprotectant. Recent studies on the 5-oxoprolinase enzyme in mammalian cells have, however, shown that knockdown or deletions of the 5-oxoprolinase make mice (and humans) prone to heart failure. This was ascribed to oxidative stress due to a two-fold elevation in 5-OP. To examine the consequences of 5-oxoproline accumulation more rigorously, we have created a yeast model for 5-oxoproline accumulation. We observed retardation of growth only when intracellular levels of 5-OP were increased 12-20 fold over the normal levels. A transcriptomics study was carried out under these conditions. We observed that while a large number of genes were regulated upto 2-fold, there were no single prominent pathways amongst them. Among the key genes upregulated were different efflux pumps. Using knockouts and also overexpression of selected genes, we could observe that many of the upregulated genes were involved in the cellular response to 5-OP accumulation. However, it did not appear that there was any significant oxidative stress response. The study suggests a need to reevaluate previous suppositions of the 5-OP induced oxidative stress response. Instead, we propose an alternative model to explain the possible consequences of 5-oxoprolinase deficiency based on these findings made with the yeast model.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here we show in Drosophila that mechanical threat induces not only locomotion but cardiac deceleration. We further identified two pairs of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, called DA-WED neurons, that are responsible for threat-induced cardiac deceleration. Silencing DA-WED neurons suppresses threat-induced cardiac deceleration, while activation of DA-WED neurons can replace threat to induce cardiac deceleration. Our calcium imaging analysis shows that threat activates DA-WED neurons. Interestingly, silencing DA-WED neurons to block threat-induced cardiac deceleration reduces locomotion. Conversely, direct manipulation of cardiomyocytes to artificially induce cardiac deceleration promotes locomotion. Together, our data reveals a neuronal mechanism in which mechanical threat regulates the heartbeat through dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and suggests how these neurons possibly prompt feedback from the heart to modulate behavior.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that E. coli OMVs are internalized by epithelial cells via clathrin-mediated, receptor-dependent endocytosis. Using a high-throughput screen of over 1,500 human single-pass transmembrane proteins, we identify T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain 1 (TIM-1) as a strong OMV-binding receptor. Functional validation revealed that TIM-1 overexpression markedly increased OMV uptake, whereas TIM-1 knockout and antibody-mediated blockade significantly impaired internalization across multiple cell lines. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that TIM-1 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the OMV surface via its known phosphatidylserine-binding domain. Uptake of OMVs by TIM-1 triggers proinflammatory cytokine production which can be reduced by preventing this interaction. Additionally, OMVs from multiple bacterial species hijack TIM-1 for entry, making it an intriguing antivirulence strategy.

In this study, we established and characterized an integrated in vitro and in vivo platform for CCHFV research. Virus propagation was optimized by comparing Vero E6 and SW-13 cell lines. SW-13 cells supported efficient CCHFV replication resulting in pronounced virus-induced cytopathic effects, whereas no detectable cytopathic effects were observed in Vero E6 cells.

This study examined how legacy salt inputs from Roman saltworks in the Tiber River delta (Fiumicino, Italy) continue to shape present-day groundwater chemistry, microbial community structure, and metabolic potential of the coastal aquifer. We analyzed groundwater samples from non-salinized and salinized units of the same aquifer using integrated hydrogeochemical characterization, flow cytometry, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and functional metabolic assays. Salinized samples exhibited elevated chloride, bromide, sodium, and sulfate concentrations, with distinctive ionic ratios (Br/Sr, Cl/K, SO/Ca) indicating dissolution of salt deposits rather than contemporary seawater intrusion. Salinization reduced the microbial diversity and shifted communities from diverse freshwater-adapted families toward an abundant halotolerant assemblage dominated by Campylobacterota (families Sulfurimonadaceae and Sulfurovaceae). Functional annotation suggested broadly conserved potentials for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. However, the Biolog assays revealed higher heterotrophic respiration and carbon substrate use but lower functional diversity in salinized samples, with particularly enhanced polymer degradation. Ordination analyses showed a clear separation of aquifer units along the salinization gradient, with coordinated chemical and microbial vectors indicating alternative ecosystem states sustained by millennia-old anthropogenic salt inputs. Our findings showed that ancient saltworks can drive persistent hydrogeochemical alteration, select specialized halotolerant microbiomes, and reconfigure carbon and nutrient processing while maintaining core biogeochemical functions, with critical implications for coastal groundwater management strategies.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

SurfDiff supports one-to-one and one-to-many comparisons by combining local structural alignments with physicochemically and spatially aware neighbourhood analysis. It assigns residue-level uniqueness and similarity scores, which can be aggregated into surface-level similarity, selectivity, and a discriminability score that captures conservation across desired targets while penalising similarity to undesired off-targets. These scores, calculated solely from the targets without any knowledge of the binders, reliably predict known experimental selectivity for diverse binders including small molecules, peptides, antibodies and antibody mimetics across viral antigens, cytokine isoforms, GPCR subtypes and serum albumin. They also correlate strongly with binding and neutralisation data across pathogen variants, and substantially outperform commonly used bioinformatic metrics such as sequence substitution matrices and structural similarity measures. SurfDiff provides a generalisable and interpretable approach to protein surface profiling, enabling selective or cross-reactive binder design, cross-species prioritisation, and facilitating immunogen selection.

These properties make them being faced with substantial applications in the industries of food, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and agriculture. Commercial estragole and anethole are currently obtained from extraction from their original plants, which suffers from unstable quality and resources. Microbial synthesis is a promising alternative approach to sustainably obtain estragole and anethole, but has not been achieved. In this study, we modularly redesigned the synthetic pathways based on the Escherichia coli chassis. Firstly, a p-coumaryl alcohol over-accumulator (436.28 mg/L) was engineered to facilitate the validation of the undemonstrated downstream module. De novo biosynthesis of estragole and anethole was achieved by stepwise analysis and BioBricks assembly. The intracellular availability of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) was revealed to be the key limiting factor, and was enhanced by deregulating the synthesis. Finally, the productions of estragole and anethole were improved by 246.88% and 202.44% compared with the initial strains. This study represents the first synthesis of estragole and anethole in microbial chassis, and the demonstration of microbial synthesis of propenyl phenols.

Both sRNAs and TFs modulate gene expression, but the former function via post-transcriptional mechanisms, while the latter act at the transcriptional level. However, it remains unclear why both regulatory layers are conserved through evolution, rather than one being sufficient. Here, we experimentally identified that CRP, a global regulator, regulates 25 small RNAs (sRNAs) in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, CRP also controls 80% of the target genes of these sRNAs. This architecture led us to identify 34 novel sRNA-mediated feed-forward loops (sFFLs) circuits where CRP regulates both an sRNA and its target within the CRP regulon. Quantitative PCR analysis of 16 such sFFLs revealed that each type possesses a distinct cAMP dose-response profile, suggesting that different sFFL structures embody unique regulatory logic. Specifically, coherent and incoherent type 3 and 4 sFFLs exhibit broader dynamic ranges in their dose-response compared to open-loop controls. Coherent and incoherent type 1 and 2 sFFLs appear more energy-efficient. Altogether, we propose that sRNAs cooperate with TFs through sFFLs to optimize both the energy efficiency and the diversity of signal response profiles. Therefore, sRNAs serve as critical components integrating transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks across diverse cellular pathways.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

N.; Goddard, E.", "abstract": "Attentional selection not only increases behavioural performance and neural information for attended stimuli but, in some instances, induces changes in stimulus appearance. While reported appearance changes have mostly concerned the effects of attending to a particular spatial location, here we report a shift in appearance that occurs when attention is directed to one component of a rapidly alternating stimulus. Our stimuli included two frames of different colours, which alternated at 3.75Hz or 7.5Hz. Participants reported the perceived dominance of one frame's colour in the target stimulus, by comparison with a reference stimulus. We found that when one stimulus frame was more salient than the other, capturing exogenous attention, there was an illusory perception that the frame was physically present for a greater proportion of time. When the frames were matched in salience, endogenously directing attention to one frame produced a smaller shift in appearance. Our results add to the body of literature demonstrating that attention can change appearance, in this case altering the appearance of attended versus unattended stimuli that are presented at the same spatial location. Furthermore, our results support the notion that in 'temporal transparency', where rapidly alternating stimuli are perceived as two translucent surfaces, attentional selection of one surface can account for the apparent paradox that feature conjunctions are perceived at stimulus alternation rates higher than predicted by the temporal limits of feature binding for other stimuli.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

While FLG null mutations are major genetic risk factors for AD, they explain only a fraction of disease heritability, suggesting a potential role for the skin microbiome. Objective: To determine how early-life skin microbiome composition and its interaction with host genetics contribute to distinct atopic phenotypes in infancy. Methods: We analyzed >1,000 skin swabs from 429 infants in the VITALITY cohort using deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing at 2-3 months (pre-diagnosis) and 12 months (post-diagnosis). Differential abundance, strain-level, and microbial genome-wide association analyses were performed to identify taxonomic and functional features associated with AD, FS, FA, and their co-occurrence, as well as with FLG mutation status. Results: Within AD, microbial signatures differed by co-occurring FA or FS. At 12 months, Staphylococcus epidermidis was enriched in infants with AD alone, whereas infants with AD and FA exhibited decreased Staphylococcus hominis and Lactococcus species, along with increased Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis and Malassezia slooffiae. At 2-3 months, early skin dysbiosis characterized by enrichment of Staphylococcus species was associated with subsequent development of AD with FS or FA, but not AD alone. Among infants with AD, FLG mutation carriers exhibited additional microbial shifts, including reduced Streptococcus species and increased Malassezia slooffiae. Strain-level analyses revealed mother-infant sharing of skin microbial taxa associated with AD, and microbial genome-wide association analyses identified species-specific genes linked to AD severity. Conclusions: Infant atopic phenotypes are associated with distinct, phenotype-specific features of the skin microbiome that emerge both before and after clinical disease onset. By resolving microbial differences within AD according to allergic co-occurrence, host genetics, and early-life timing, this study highlights the infant skin microbiome as a potential target for early risk stratification.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

The genomes of LMG 5496 (6.23 Mb; 58.78% GC) and EC33 (5.98 Mb; 58.97% GC) contained 5,563 and 5,312 coding sequences, respectively, and shared highly conserved metabolic and functional profiles. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI {approx} 100%) and phylogenomic analyses confirmed their close evolutionary relationship within phylogroup 02b. Despite overall similarity, EC33 retained a complete repertoire of Type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors, while LMG 5496 exhibited deletions in two core effectors, correlating with reduced virulence. Functional annotation identified 16 high-confidence T3SS effectors, 12 shared and four strain-specific, reflecting divergent molecular strategies. Enhanced pathogenicity of EC33 was linked to the presence of hypervirulence gene Q4ZSY4 and loss of AvrPph3, suggesting host immune evasion. Both strains possessed largely conserved copper resistance genes, with minor differences in detoxification enzymes. Prophage profiling revealed distinct histories: LMG 5496 carried two intact prophages, EC33 one. This comparative genomic analysis provides new insights into adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and shaping virulence within clonal P. syringae lineages.

We have tested cornea models based on an immortalized hTCEpi corneal epithelium cell line for infection research using four derivatives of the N. gonorrhoeae MS11 strain that differ in pilus expression. We show that bacterial adherence depends on the functional type IV pilus in the early stages of infection, and that the formation of bacterial microcolonies and biofilms on the model surface leads to tissue destruction. The infection induces a specific cytokine response characterized by an increase in the secretion of IL-8 and TNF-a, but not of IL-6. The testing of trifluoperazine, a drug that induces pilus retraction, on infected corneal tissue models showed that the drug strongly diminished the number of adherent gonococci only when applied simultaneously with bacteria, and not when bacteria were allowed to form microcolonies on the tissue surface.

Among the few small-molecule inhibitors developed, 4EGI-1 and its analogue i4EG-BiP have shown promise in cellular and preclinical models. These compounds disrupt eIF4E binding to its partner eIF4G while enhancing association with its negative regulators, the 4E-BPs. Despite their chemical similarity and overlapping functional effects, structural data suggest the two ligands engage different regions of eIF4E, lateral for 4EGI-1 and frontal for i4EG-BiP, raising questions about the basis of their shared activity. Here, we integrate molecular simulations, site-directed mutagenesis, and fluorescence binding assays to elucidate the binding mechanism of both ligands. Molecular dynamics and binding experiments on mutants reveal largely consistent interaction patterns, while funnel metadynamics free-energy calculations indicate that the frontal binding mode is thermodynamically preferred for both compounds. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the conformational rearrangement induced by frontal binding selectively promotes 4E-BP1 over eIF4G association, owing to the greater plasticity of the 4E-BP1 binding motif. These findings reconcile divergent structural observations and highlight how ligand-induced dynamics can be exploited to reprogram eIF4E interactions, offering a framework for next-generation therapeutics targeting dysregulated translation.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

These reactions are principally intracellular events; however, to date, only phosphorylation has been shown to occur within the extracellular space.

Using a split-luciferase complementary assay, we revealed that N-glycosylated METTL9 is secreted extracellularly via the ER-Golgi pathway. Endogenous METTL9 is highly expressed in HL60 cells during neutrophil-like differentiation and secreted extracellularly. METTL9 catalyzes N{pi}-methylhistidine formation in plasma proteins, in which the thyroxine transporter transthyretin (TTR) and copper transporter ceruloplasmin are identified as substrates for methylation in vitro. Both methylations occur at the His-x-His motif, a recognition sequence for METTL9, and TTR methylation decreases its binding affinity to zinc.

Optimizing Cas9 activity remains essential for reliable genome-editing applications, yet the factors limiting its in vitro cleavage efficiency are not fully understood. Among these, protein aggregation has been suggested to critically impair Cas9 functionality, although its role has not been systematically analysed. Here, we investigate Cas9 aggregation under different environmental conditions and evaluate its impact on in vitro DNA cleavage efficiency. Using fluorescently labelled Cas9 and single-molecule fluorescence techniques, we quantify aggregation as a function of buffer composition, ionic strength, salt concentration and sgRNA presence, and relate these properties to cleavage activity. Our results show that Cas9 aggregation significantly reduces DNA cleavage efficiency, with higher aggregation levels consistently correlating with lower activity. In contrast, buffers with higher ionic strength or stabilizing components reduce aggregation and enhance Cas9 performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that Cas9 aggregation plays a critical role in determining in vitro cleavage efficiency and highlights the importance of controlling protein aggregation to optimize CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing applications and delivery strategies.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

TCV is a (+) RNA virus that normally produces two sgRNAs: the 1,724-nucleotide (nt) sgRNA1 expressing movement proteins, and the 1,449-nt sgRNA2 expressing capsid protein. A single amino acid change, A113V, within a region shared by TCV RPs p28 and p88, diminished sgRNA1 levels and delayed viral systemic spread. Interestingly, three second-site RP mutations emerged in infected plants that, alone or in combination with A113V, resulted in over-production of sgRNA1 or accumulation of two alternative sgRNAs of 1,876 and 1,601 nt, and rescued A113V defects. The alternative sgRNAs originated from nearly identical recombination events, their size difference reflecting varying 5 extensions. Structural modeling of the TCV replication complex showed a conical ring architecture containing p28, p88, and a partially double-stranded RNA. While A113 may interact with TCV genomic RNA or host factors to promote (-) sgRNA1 synthesis, the second-site mutations likely influenced binding and entry of RNA template into the p88 active site.

Here, we present a scalable system to identify functional transposon configurations in non-model bacteria through pooled library screening. We selected 18 promoters across multiple bacterial phyla to independently drive expression of the transposase and antibiotic resistance marker, generating 324 promoter combinatorial variants for each of six antibiotic resistance markers. We developed a high-throughput, automated workflow to deliver all 1,944 mariner-based transposon variants in a single experiment and applied this to 92 non-model bacteria spanning multiple phyla. From this, we identified functional transposons for 43 strains, with high-level mutagenesis (102-104 unique insertions) in 13 species, including seven with no previously described transposon mutagenesis. We then expanded to a dual-transposase system, mariner or Tn5, and devised a single transposon insertion sequencing method for high-throughput screening of 3,888 configurations. To demonstrate the practical utility of our screening approach, we used a top-performing variant to generate a genome-wide transposon mutant library for Comamonas testosteroni KF-1, a bacterium that metabolizes plastic- and lignin-derived polymers.

Here, we integrate two decades of field surveys, citizen-science records, and standardized transects to reconstruct the invasion of the snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis on Ibiza and its impact on the endangered, endemic lizard Podarcis pityusensis. We found a marked acceleration in range expansion despite intensified culling, evidence for the transition from establishment to spread stages of this invasion. Spatially explicit invasion maps combined with citizen reports of lizard disappearance show a non-linear acceleration in the interval from predator arrival to local prey extirpation, shortening from over ten years in early-invaded areas to three years in recently invaded areas. The observed patterns are consistent with density-dependent predator pressure, which generates a wave-like, rapidly advancing invasion front evidenced by declining snake body condition and reduced efficiency of snake captures in long-invaded areas. Our study empirically confirms theoretical predictions of nonlinear spread and impact dynamics and highlights how citizen science can crucially help documenting early invasion stages. Effectively incorporating the non-linear dynamics of invasions into conservation strategies is urgent to mitigate invasion-driven transformations of fragile island ecosystems worldwide.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Background: Malaria remains a major public health challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To address the lack of contemporary entomological data, particularly in Kinshasa Province, this four-year study characterized key entomological parameters, including mosquito species composition, abundance, biting behavior, and insecticide resistance. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study (2018-2022) in three health areas representing rural, peri-urban, and urban settings in Kinshasa Province. Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled using CDC miniature light traps and pyrethrum spray catches. Insecticide susceptibility of adult females was assessed using WHO tube tests, and a generalized estimating equations model evaluated the effects of year, season, site, sampling location, and collection time on mosquito abundance. Results: A total of 1,449 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected: 50% in the rural health area of Bu, 49% in peri-urban Kimpoko, and 1% in urban La Voix du Peuple. The species captured were An. gambiae s.l. (85%), An. paludis (11%), and An. funestus (4%). An. gambiae s.l. was significantly more abundant indoors and after 10 PM. The overall entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was 4.6 infective bites per person per year, with An. gambiae s.l. contributing the highest rate. An. paludis showed a localized transmission peak in Impuru during the rainy season (EIR = 8.87). Resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was widespread, with an estimated 0.94 frequency of the kdr L1014F mutation. Bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl remained effective. Conclusions: This study confirms that An. gambiae s.l. remains the predominant malaria vector and plays a central role in transmission in Kinshasa. However, an emerging role of An. paludis in rural settings was observed. These findings underscore the need for vector control strategies tailored to diverse ecological settings. Continued entomological surveillance will be essential to track biting behavior and resistance patterns and ensure that interventions remain effective over time.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Z.; Ruegg, J.; Cui, Y.; Behrendt, L.", "abstract": "Although fluctuating conditions are a hallmark of microbial habitats, how the timing of chemical stress influences single-cell inhibition and recovery is not well resolved. Using a microfluidic platform, we continuously tracked photosynthetic performance in thousands of individual cells of a coral-associated microalga (Symbiodiniaceae sp.) exposed to identical cumulative doses of the photosystem II inhibitor diuron delivered either as constant or fluctuating profiles. Fluctuating exposure produced stronger early inhibition than constant exposure, but as concentrations declined it enabled partial recovery that did not occur under time-averaged constant conditions. These dynamics revealed distinct response subpopulations that differed in both the magnitude and timing of inhibition, including groups that regained activity exclusively under fluctuating stress. Quantifying per-cell decline kinetics showed that fluctuating exposure synchronizes the onset of inhibition across cells, creating a narrow temporal window in which a subset of cells can recover once stress levels fall, whereas constant exposure yields more heterogeneous but uniformly declining trajectories. These results demonstrate that stress timing, not cumulative dose alone, governs whether photosynthetic inhibition is reversible at the single-cell level. More broadly, our findings illustrate how temporal variability and intrinsic phenotypic heterogeneity jointly govern cellular function, highlighting stress timing as an important and often overlooked axis shaping microbial performance in dynamic environments.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

We conducted a comparative analysis of two hybrid zones between Ischnura elegans and Ischnura graellsii in North-central (NC) and North-western (NW) Spain to evaluate how differences in reproductive barriers shape patterns of hybridization and admixture. First, we quantified five prezygotic barriers in the NC hybrid zone--where no barrier estimates previously existed--and compared them with published data from the NW hybrid zone. Second, we conducted genomic analyses using 5,702 SNPs to assess genetic structure, differentiation, and diversity between species; and 381 SNPs with species-specific alleles to characterize hybrid classes and introgression across both regions. Reproductive isolation was strongly context dependent. Mechanical reinforcement acted in the same cross direction in both hybrid zones, but the NC hybrid zone also showed stronger gametic (fertility) isolation. Consequently, total prezygotic isolation was higher in the NC hybrid zone. These differences were also observed genomically: the NC hybrid zone exhibited limited and largely unidirectional introgression, whereas the NW hybrid zone showed more extensive admixture, bidirectional gene flow, and reduced interspecific differentiation, consistent with a longer or more sustained history of hybridization. Our results demonstrate that hybridization outcomes can differ markedly between hybrid zones involving the same pair of species, underscoring the importance of evaluating spatial variation in reproductive barriers and introgression to assess the presence, asymmetry, and repeatability of reinforcement, as well as the microevolutionary processes shaping hybrid zone structure.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Fitness trade-offs between intracellular and extracellular niches could drive the emergence of stable endosymbiosis if adaptation to the intracellular niche reduces fitness in the extracellular niche, reinforcing endosymbiosis through niche specialisation by the endosymbiont. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying phenotypic divergence between endosymbiotic and free-living populations of a facultative algal endosymbiont along trait axes predicted to contrast between its intracellular and extracellular lifestyles. Consistent with endosymbiont specialisation, we observed strong divergence involving multiple traits between endosymbiotic and free-living populations. Specifically, endosymbionts showed convergent losses of multiple nitrogen metabolism pathways, increased export of maltose and glucose, increased sensitivity to acidification, higher and less variable photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced free-living growth rate. Intracellular environments are stable, safe from natural enemies, and come with a reliable supply of specific nutrients, but are acidic and place demands upon endosymbionts to provision their hosts; our data suggest that adapting to this niche is likely to reduce free-living growth and survival of endosymbionts.

Given the limited availability of human post-mortem tissue resources and the importance of integrating multi-omic data from the same samples, there is a critical need for methods that enable parallel, cell-type-resolved genomic profiling. We present optimised protocols using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) to isolate nuclei from different human and mouse brain cell types for downstream multi-omic analysis. Our approach enables the robust purification of neuronal, oligodendrocyte, microglial and other glial-origin nuclei from both adult and fetal brain tissue. We demonstrate that FANS-isolated nuclei are compatible with a wide range of genomic assays, including profiling of DNA modifications, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression.

It is catalyzed by collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs) that are 2{beta}2 tetramers consisting of two identical catalytic -subunits (encoded by P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3) and two {beta}-subunits that are protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). The functions of isoenzymes I and II (P4HA1 and P4HA2) are widely studied but very little is currently known about the role of P4HA3. Here we show that P4ha1 is generally the most abundant isoform in mouse, whereas P4ha3 expression is tissue and developmental stage specific. P4ha3 expression is highest in the developing skeletal system and peaks at E12.5 together with the other isoforms. Postnatal P4ha3 expression is low and mainly present in calvaria, lung, heart and muscle. The P4ha3 expression virtually disappears at or after 1 week of age in all tissues studied. To evaluate the P4HA3 function in collagen synthesis, we produced cells that lack P4HA3 (P4ha3 / ) and cells that have P4HA3 as the only isoform (P4ha1-/-;P4ha2-/-) by CRISPR/Cas9. C-P4H activity assays indicated no 4Hyp formation in type I collagen by the P4ha1-/-;P4ha2-/- cells, suggesting that the remaining isoform P4HA3 does not participate in type I collagen synthesis. The P4ha3-/- cells secreted intact pepsin-resistant collagen that had a similar 4Hyp content and melting temperature as in WT cells, and the secreted collagen assembled correctly into supramolecular collagen fibrils. In conclusion, our results provide new insights into collagen biosynthesis and suggest that prolyl 4-hydroxylation of type I collagen is mediated by P4HA1 and P4HA2 but not by P4HA3.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

In contrast, lifestyle factors such as exercise, nutrition, and sleep chiefly reduce stochastic noise and raise the damage level compatible with survival, shifting the median but not the maximum.

Segregation of a particular voice from background noise occurs partly through enhanced cortical tracking of amplitude fluctuations in the target signal. Measuring a person's cortical tracking allows decoding their focus of attention and may be used for neurofeedback in hearing devices, potentially aiding their users with speech-in-noise comprehension. Most studies on cortical tracking have employed typical hearing (TH) individuals, whereas studies in people with hearing impairment whose cortical tracking may differ are still scarce. The objective of this study was to compare cortical speech tracking of HA (n=29) and CI users (n=24) to that of age-matched TH individuals (n=29). We recorded EEG data while the participants attended one of two competing talkers (one with a female and one with a male voice), in a free-field acoustic environment. Importantly, HA users as well as CI users used their personal, clinically-fitted devices. Cortical speech tracking was assessed through linear backward and forward models that related the EEG data to the speech envelope. For the CI users, electrical artifacts stemming from the implant were addressed through a bespoke method for artifact rejection. We found that the HA group exhibited cortical tracking and attentional modulation that were largely comparable to those of the TH group. CI users also showed successful cortical tracking. However, they displayed a profound deficit in attentional modulation, seen in the significantly poorer neural segregation of the attended vs. the ignored speech streams.

Studies of competition and fitness traits in parasitoids have primarily focused on interference competition, with less attention paid to parasitoids under exploitative competition. Theoretical studies predict that interference competition will decrease the resource utilisation of parasitoids, while exploitative competition will not. In our study, we investigated the impact of intraspecific exploitative competition among parasitoids on fitness traits, including resource utilisation, the percentage of offspring that emerged from parasitised eggs, and the percentage of female offspring produced from parasitised eggs. We investigated whether these fitness traits were influenced by the presence of conspecific foraging females, as well as by parasitoid and resource densities. Since we were studying the effect of exploitative competition, we used Trichogramma chilonis, a non-aggressive egg parasitoid. Corcyra cephalonica, a stored grain pest, was used as the host. We found that T. chilonis resource utilisation increased in the presence of conspecifics. However, the density of those conspecifics and the resource density did not affect resource utilisation. The presence of conspecific foraging females did not affect the rate of offspring survival. However, at a lower resource density, offspring survival was higher than under resource-abundant conditions. We explored this counterintuitive pattern using a simple mathematical model, which shows that superparasitism, occurring at high parasitoid density, can lead to high emergence. This is because, given only some progeny survive, the chance of parasitoid emergence increases with the number of eggs laid in the host. The secondary sex ratio of the progeny was unaffected by the presence of conspecifics or by parasitoid or resource densities. We conclude that for T. chilonis, the presence of competitors has a positive effect. Its high performance under competitive conditions may contribute to its efficiency as a biological control agent.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

As a consequence, population persistence often depends on the potential to rapidly evolve in the face of these challenges. However, while evolution in response to single stressors has been widely studied, experimental evidence for adaptation to multiple stressors is sparse and remains inconclusive, due to a lack of consistent experimental designs and metrics across systems. To overcome this limitation, we here used a meta-experimental evolution approach to test how environmental complexity shapes adaptive evolution across a diversity of taxa. We exposed 14 species of bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and plants, to single versus multiple stressors for multiple generations, and measured their fitness in the presence or absence of stressors. We show that across taxa, populations evolving under multiple stressors adapted more slowly, and exhibited fitness costs when exposed back to control environments. The magnitude of these effects varied with the identity of the stressors (e.g., temperature, salinity, copper). Further, all species followed a consistent pattern of greater fitness gains with greater initial fitness reduction at the start of the experiment. Our results are consistent with the predicted cost of complexity when selection acts on pleiotropic genes. Accounting for the complexity of environmental stress should thus prove crucial to prevent biodiversity loss and its cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}

Although recent studies have resolved the genetic basis of virulence in two Dutch G. pallida populations, it remains unclear how conserved this genetic adaptation is in populations from different regions. To investigate this, we first selected eight Dutch G. pallida populations on the GpaVvrn-containing potato variety Seresta and confirmed a previously identified virulence locus. Second, by analysing the allele frequencies of four virulence-associated SNPs in Dutch, British, and French GpaVvrn-selected G. pallida populations, we found that the same allele is consistently selected by GpaVvrn across Western Europe. Third, we analysed the propagation of eight G. pallida populations on 26 GpaVvrn-containing potato varieties and showed that a population's allele frequency of a single SNP (T173N) accurately reflects its reproduction on GpaVvrn. Fourth, we developed an allele-specific quantitative PCR (AS-qPCR) assay to determine a population's alternative allele frequency (AAF) of T173N and showed that AS-qPCR-based AAFs reliably indicate virulence levels on GpaVvrn in Dutch and German G. pallida populations. Together, these findings suggest that a common allele is consistently selected by GpaVvrn in populations from different regions across Western Europe.

Leguminous crops contribute to these goals by providing protein-rich seeds and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixing symbiosis (NFS) with rhizobia. Beyond their nutritional and agronomic benefits, legumes face major challenges from insect herbivores such as the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. While NFS can enhance plant defences against aphids, the influence of plant and aphid genotypic variation on these rhizobia-mediated effects remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how genotype interactions influence rhizobia-mediated defence priming by using two Medicago truncatula genotypes (A17 and R108) grown under NFS with Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 or nitrate (NI) feeding conditions and infested with three clonal lines representing two pea aphid biotypes. We analysed aphid performance, plant fitness, and plant leaf expression of defence genes associated with the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathways over a 12 day period following aphid infestation. Aphid fitness varied significantly with both plant and aphid genotypes and was further modulated by rhizobia inoculation. Expression of defence marker genes involved in SA and JA pathway was dependent on specific plant aphid genotype combinations and was significantly modulated by rhizobia inoculation. This pattern suggests that both SA and JA mediated plant defences contribute to regulating aphid weight, possibly through different mechanisms or in response to different plant-aphid interactions. Our study shows that plant and aphid genotypes, rhizobia inoculation and interactions (G *G*R) are thus central components driving plant-aphid-rhizobia interaction dynamics.

Here, we show that retinotopy in primary visual cortex (V1) determines the topological structure in neural population activity in the macaque. We analysed large-scale extracellular recordings from two macaques implanted with 896-channel Utah arrays in V1 performing a receptive field mapping task, with high-contrast moving bars. Isometric Mapping (isomap) applied to the neural population activity revealed a loop-like manifold. Persistent homology on 10-dimensional embeddings confirmed a single dominant one-dimensional loop. To test whether retinotopy alone can account for this structure, we constructed a minimal neural response model and simulated activity with the same stimuli as the macaque neural data. The model reproduced the loop-like topology observed in the brain. Taken together, the experimental and simulated data show that retinotopic maps naturally induce loop-like neural manifolds in response to moving stimuli, directly linking travelling waves and rotational dynamics. Our results provide a basis for further analysis on how neuronal populations encode and process visual information at the population level.", "date": "2025-12-23", "journal": ""}
