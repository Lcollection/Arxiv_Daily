However, their delayed-onset of therapeutic action, frequently reported side effects, and incomplete clinical efficacy impose significant challenges for clinicians and patients' adherence to treatment. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the major non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid with a wide range of potential clinical applications such as a either a standalone drug or as an add-on treatment. In our study, we found that in chronically stressed male mice, CBD (30 mg/kg) rapidly induced behavioral improvement within 7 days, which was quicker than the high dose of escitalopram (ESC, 14 days). Additionally, repeated administration of a low and initially ineffective dose of CBD (7.5 mg/kg) potentiated the anti-stress effects of ESC (10 mg/kg) in mice subjected to 10 or 21 days of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Furthermore, our results suggested the involvement of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase (NAPE-PLD) located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the anti-stress effects of the 7-day treatment with ESC + CBD. This combination restored CUS-induced decreased expression of NAPE-PLD in the PFC. The behavioral effects of ESC + CBD were not observed in either constitutive NAPE-PLD knockout (KO) mice or mice with a CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletion of NAPE-PLD in the PFC. ESC + CBD treatment facilitated NAPE-PLD expression in parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the PFC. As a conclusion, we suggest that CBD might be useful as an add-on therapy to optimize the action of antidepressants, possibly by restoring the inhibitory/excitatory balance of the PFC via NAPE-PLD-mediated signaling.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

M.; Hidber, F.; Deupi, X.; Carleton, K.; Musilova, Z.", "abstract": "Photopigments, formed by an opsin protein bound to a light-sensitive chromophore, underlie vertebrate vision. Long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsins mediate red-light detection, and most teleosts retain a single functional LWS1. A shorter-shifted green-sensitive paralog (LWS2) is found only in a few lineages. By mining teleost genomes and sequencing retinal transcriptomes, we identify elopomorphs as an additional lineage retaining LWS2 (alongside characins and osteoglossomorphs), and we reveal a previously overlooked shorter-shifted paralog, LWS3, restricted to gobies (Percomorpha) and arising from an ancient duplication. Structural modeling of twelve LWS opsins uncovers convergent evolution at four key amino acid sites (214, 259, 261, 269) in the retinal-binding pocket, showing parallel substitutions in human MWS, teleost LWS2, and goby LWS3 relative to red-sensitive counterparts, consistent with repeated spectral shifts toward green wavelengths. In several lineages--including characins, mormyrids, gobies, and primates--these shorter-shifted LWS opsins have functionally replaced the canonical green-sensitive RH2 opsin. Retinal transcriptomes and in situ hybridization demonstrate variable lws3 expression across gobies, with localization to a distinct double-cone member in Amblygobius phalaena, analogous to rh2 expression in other fishes. Together, these results show that repeated convergent evolution toward green sensitivity over 500 million years involves coordinated changes at the molecular, regulatory, and functional levels, providing a striking example of multilevel sensory adaptation.\n\nSignificance statementVertebrate vision depends on opsins, which detect specific wavelengths of light. Most teleosts retain a single long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (LWS1), while a green-sensitive paralog occurs only in a few lineages. We identify a previously overlooked green-shifted opsin, LWS3, restricted to gobies, and show that LWS2 and LWS3 have repeatedly evolved green sensitivity through convergent amino acid changes. These shorter-shifted opsins have functionally replaced the canonical green-sensitive RH2 opsin in multiple teleost lineages and even in primates. By integrating genomic, structural, and expression data, we reveal how multilevel convergent evolution--from molecular tuning to photoreceptor specialization--has repeatedly shaped green-light vision over 500 million years, illustrating the remarkable evolutionary flexibility of vertebrate visual systems.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Despite the plethora of algorithms developed over the past decades, accurate spike-time inference methods for spike rates exceeding 20 Hz are lacking. More importantly, little attention has been devoted to the quantification of statistical uncertainties in spike time estimation, which is essential for assigning confidence levels to inferred spike patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce (1) a statistical model that accounts for bursting neuronal activity and baseline fluorescence modulation and (2) apply a Monte Carlo strategy (particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling) to estimate the joint posterior distribution of spike times and model parameters. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised algorithms, as evaluated on the CASCADE benchmark datasets. Analysis of fluorescence transients recorded with the ultrafast genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP8f demonstrates that our method can resolve interspike intervals as short as 5 ms. Overall, our study describes a Bayesian inference method for detecting neuronal spiking patterns and quantifying their uncertainty. The use of particle Gibbs samplers enables unbiased estimates of spike times and all model parameters, and provides a flexible statistical framework for testing more specific models of calcium indicators.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

When only portions of the genome are of interest, read alignment on wholegenome sequencing (WGS) data can be replaced by a fast mapping step.

Our 'molecule mapping' approach, implemented in the tool MoleMap, uses a minimized open-addressing k-mer index of the reference genome and a fast k-mer clustering procedure. We demonstrate that MoleMap's accuracy is competitive with standard alignment and mapping tools and its running time outperforms other mapping tools on 32 threads by a factor of 3 to 8 and read alignment tools by a factor of 10 to 60. Its low memory footprint allows us to analyze whole genomes on a standard laptop computer.

To quantify the full behavioral repertoire following SCI, we adapted motion sequencing (MoSeq) to identify sub-second behavioral \"syllables\" and capture their usage and sequential organization without predefined features. We identified biomechanically distinct variants within syllable classes that are shared across injury severities and found that recovery is jointly structured by injury severity and individual mouse identity. Changes in sequences, however, unfold along a conserved temporal trajectory. By compressing behavior into a single metric, we uncovered clusters of coevolving locomotor and non-locomotor behaviors.

I.", "abstract": "The ventriloquism effect, where sounds are mislocalized towards a spatially disparate but temporally synchronous visual stimulus, is well established. Liang et al. (2022) provided first evidence that chemosensory cues can similarly bias sound localization. This study, conducted in 2023, replicates and extends their behavioral findings, using diffusion modeling and EEG to identify underling computational and neural mechanisms. Participants localized (left vs. right) each sound in eight-item sequences, with trigeminally-potent odorants presented concurrently with the first four sounds (left, right, or both nostrils). Unbeknownst to participants, some sounds originated from the center. For central sounds, the proportion of right-ward responses increased with right-nostril stimulation but decreased with left-nostril stimulation (relative to controls). This bias was strongest in the second half of the sequence and disappeared at larger sound eccentricity. Diffusion modeling showed the bias was best explained by changes in drift rate (perceptual evidence accumulation), not in starting point (decision bias). EEG alpha-band activity lateralized towards the chosen side for central sounds, consistent with attentional orienting towards the perceived location, and was diminished at large eccentricities with incongruent chemosensory stimulation. The findings corroborate an odorant-sound spatial ventriloquism effect and provide novel insights into the cognitive and attentional processes involved.\n\nPublic significance statementOur findings reveal that trigeminally potent odors can subtly influence sound localization judgments, even when those odors are irrelevant to the task at hand. This influence is strongest when sound information is uncertain (i.e., when unbeknownst to participants, a sound that had to be localized as coming from the left or right side, originated from a central location), suggesting that trigeminal stimulation can act as a spatial cue under ambiguous conditions. In addition, concurrent EEG cording revealed that the influence of odorant stimulation was also reflected in neural correlates of auditory spatial attention. Critically, diffusion modeling showed that the observed cross-modal bias occurs at a perceptual level. These findings highlight that the human brain integrates information from the chemical sense and hearing more deeply than previously assumed, revealing that even task-irrelevant odors can shape spatial perception in other senses.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

While mRNA methylation such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) that has been widely studied in memory, the role of mRNA acetylation remains largely unknown. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), the only known form of RNA acetylation in eukaryotes, promotes mRNA stability and translation. In this study, we identified the ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampal homogenates and synaptosomes through ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq). The Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to induce and evaluate memory acquisition and forgetting processes. We show that synaptic ac4C levels are dynamically regulated, increasing after memory formation and returning to baseline after natural forgetting. The dynamic changes of ac4C-mRNAs regulated by memory were validated by ac4C dot-blot, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and acRIP-qPCR analysis. We further demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer, in mouse hippocampus is important for spatial memory via regulating memory-related mRNAs, proteins, and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we generated a freely-accessible website (http://ac4catlas.com) that included the dataset of ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampus.

Models that deal with misidentification have been proposed. However, these models assume that only one sample can be collected per individual at one occasion. This is not true for several monitoring programs based on DNA, for example for those that extract the DNA from faecal samples. The models do not take repeated observations into account, leading to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop an approach that extends the latent multinomial model (LMM) of Link et al. (2010) using a Poisson distribution to model the number of samplings of the same individual on a given occasion. We then conduct simulations to test how our new model performs. As an illustration, we applied the new Poisson model to a collection of Eurasian otter faeces (Lampa et al., 2015). Our model yields unbiased estimates of population size when the expected number of samples per individual ({lambda}) is sufficiently high: simulations with {lambda} [&ge;] 0.36 and five capture occasions or with {lambda} [&ge;] 0.23 and seven or more occasions. In contrast, when {lambda} = 0.11 (corresponding to about 42%, 53% and 62% of the individuals being detected with respectively 5, 7 and 9 occasions), the population size is consistently underestimated. Applying the model to the otter dataset confirms the presence of misidentifications, consistent with the authors' expectations. Our findings indicate that repeated observations can be modelled without bias. The application on otters shows that our model is necessary to accurately estimate population size in presence of misidentification and repeated observations.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Our recent work indicated that activation of endogenous CD45 in human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) induced expression of multiple EndoMT marker genes. We hypothesized that CD45 may contribute to atherosclerosis; however, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying how CD45 may contribute to EndoMT and the impact of therapeutic manipulation of CD45 expression in atherosclerosis are unknown. Methods: We generated a tamoxifen-inducible EC-specific CD45-deficient mouse strain (EC-iCD45KO) on an ApoE-deficient (WT/ApoE-/-) background and fed them a Western diet (WD) to produce atherosclerosis. We enriched mouse aortic ECs with anti-CD31 beads to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. Cellular, biochemical and molecular approaches were used to investigate the effect of endothelial CD45-specific deletion on EndoMT and lesion development in an ApoE-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. Results: EC-iCD45KO mice showed reductions in lesion development, plaque macrophage infiltration, and expression of cell adhesion molecules when compared to WT/ApoE-/- controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that loss of endothelial CD45 decreases EndoMT marker expression and TGF-beta signaling in atherosclerotic mice, which is associated with reduction of lesions. Mechanistically, CD45 loss increases Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) expression in mouse aortic ECs and Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) expression in the aortic root. Endothelial CD45-deficiency also inhibits EndoMT and TGF-beta; signaling in atherosclerosis. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that genetic depletion of endothelial CD45 protects against EndoMT-driven atherosclerosis by promoting FGFR2 and KLF2 expression while inhibiting Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling and EndoMT. Consequently, targeting endothelial CD45 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce EndoMT in atherosclerosis.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the circadian humidity entrainment in various insects across multiple orders. Insect species respond to humidity cycles with distinct patterns, some active during wet periods or at the arid-humid transition. When the humidity cue is removed, most species continue to show rhythmic activity associated with the previous arid-humid (AH) cycles. Fruit flies shift their activity accordingly when humidity cycles are altered and remain in the new rhythms under the following free-running conditions (FRC; constant humidity, HH). Moreover, Drosophila clock and hygrosensation mutants lack rhythmic activity during (AH) and after humidity entrainment (FRC with HH), indicating that core clock components and hygrosensors are essential for circadian entrainment. Our findings provide strong evidence that humidity is likely to serve as a potential zeitgeber for circadian entrainment in most, but not all, insect systems and will likely have broad applicability and importance across animal systems. While light and temperature act as the primary zeitgebers, understanding the mechanisms of humidity entrainment will help us better interpret the behavioral patterns of terrestrial animals, particularly those susceptible to dehydration.\n\nOne Sentence Summary: Humidity entrainment of the circadian clock synchronizes insect activity to environmental changes.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Juvenile songbirds learn their songs by an imitative process, and after learning adults use a millisecond-precise spike timing code to control vocal acoustics. Current theories suggest that developmental changes in neural firing rates, rather than precisely timed spike patterns, underlie the emergence of learning. Here we tested the hypothesis that songbirds transition from a rate-based to a spike-timing-based motor code during the process of vocal development. To do so, we recorded vocal motor neurons across development as individual Bengalese finches learned their songs. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that despite dramatic changes in firing statistics during development, millisecond-scale spike pattern codes for vocal acoustics are present throughout all stages of vocal development. Furthermore, firing rate fluctuations are no more predictive of song output in young learners than in expert adults. The dramatic changes in spiking statistics observed during song learning therefore do not reflect a developmental change in the timescale of motor coding, but instead signals the selection of a particular subset of precisely timed spike patterns.

We show that the highest energetic barrier for cholesterol translocation from the outer leaflet is lower than that from the inner leaflet. Mutagenesis experiments and complementary simulations of SMO mutants validate the role of critical amino acid residues along the translocation pathways.

Expanding a geometric framework developed for quantifying the structural complexity of local-scale surface environments, we generate high-resolution, global maps of the key complexity measures of height range, rugosity, and fractal dimension. We illustrate how patterns in these complexity attributes across the globe reflect the distribution of ecosystems, land cover types, and the presence of people.

While the mechanism regulating sleep in adults are relatively well understood, little is known about its counterpart in early developmental stages. Here we report a neuropeptidergic circuitry that modulates sleep in developing Drosophila larvae. Through an unbiased screen, we identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as critical regulators of larval sleep. Our genetic and behavioral data suggest that HugPC neurons secrete Hugin peptides to activate Insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which expresses a Hugin receptor PK2-R1. IPCs, in turn, release insulin-like peptides (Dilps) to regulate sleep. We further show that the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is dispensable for adult sleep. Our findings thus reveal the neuromodulatry circuit that regulates developmental sleep in larvae, and highlight differential impacts of the same modulatory axis on early-life sleep and adult sleep.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory---an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences' nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus---a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains---and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities---spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

They engage in multiple functions such as adhesion, signaling, etc. at the cell surface, so their correct manufacture is of vital importance. Glycans are assembled step by step through enzyme-catalyzed monomer addition reactions as they transit through compartments of the Golgi apparatus. The constraint of fixed residence times across Golgi compartments creates tradeoffs: a short residence time does not give complex glycans enough time for reactions to run to completion, while a long residence time might execute undesirable reactions, which inevitably occur due to enzyme promiscuity. It is not clear how the Golgi reconciles this trade-off.\n\nTo study this, we devise a from-first-principles model of glycan manufacture with a focus on maximizing glycan yield. Pareto-optimal solutions are a class of solutions that reconcile trade-offs in simultaneously maximizing the yield of multiple glycans. We explore Pareto-optimal solutions for multiple glycan manufacture, and show that small changes in residence times or relative glycan yields can change the optimal enzyme distribution. Together, these results establish Pareto optimality as a unifying framework for interpreting Golgi compartment organization, and for controlling glycan outputs in industrial settings such as manufacture of biotherapeutics, many of which are glycosylated.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

They are controlled centrally and peripherally in a coordinated manner to elegantly match T3-mediated energy expenditure (EE) to energy availability. Hypothyroidism reduces EE and has long been blamed for obesity; however, emerging evidence suggests that, instead, obesity may drive thyroid dysfunction. Thus, we used a mouse model of diet-induced obesity to determine its direct effects on thyroid histopathology and function, deiodinase activity, and T3 action. Strikingly, overnutrition induced hypothyroidism within 3 weeks. Levels of thyroidal THs and their precursor protein thyroglobulin decreased, and ER stress was induced, indicating that thyroid function was directly impaired. We also observed pronounced histological and vascular expansion in the thyroid. Overnutrition additionally suppressed T4 activation, rendering the mice resistant to T4 and reducing EE. Our findings collectively show that overnutrition deals a double strike to TH biosynthesis and action, despite large efforts to adapt--but, fortunately, thyroid dysfunction in mice can be reversed by weight loss. In humans, BMI correlated with thyroidal vascularization, importantly demonstrating preliminary translatability.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a general mechanism that couples a Markovian system to at least one other degree of freedom, such as a mechanical system, to achieve noise resistant coherent oscillations with a desired frequency. We introduce two approaches, targeting different dynamical modes in the Markovian system, and derive a governing principle for the non-Markovian system by analyzing the eigenvalues of the coupled dynamics. This principle is validated using a trimolecular reaction system, successfully producing sustained and coherent oscillations. Our study provides theoretical insights into how any chemical system can be coupled to another non-Markovian system to produce sustained and coherent oscillations with a precise period. We also make a fundamental observation that stability and control of stable limit cycles must arise from the non-Markovian part of the coupled system.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Neu1 deficiency in human AD brains and 5xFAD/Neu1-/- mice leads to sialic acid retention on APP and its secretases, enhancing amyloidogenic cleavage and A{beta}42 production. Additionally, Neu1 deficiency increases lysosomal exocytosis, contributing to extracellular A{beta} release and neuroinflammation.

In this study, we investigated whether F. nucleatum displays disease-specific vulnerabilities to indole derivatives across 16 clinical isolates from CRC (n=6), Crohns disease (n=6), healthy individuals (n=3), and an oral lesion (n=1). Using HPLC, we found that CRC-associated isolates produced a 3-4-fold higher level of endogenous indole compared to healthy isolates (p < 0.05), including indole, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3CA), which is a metabolite enriched in CRC patient samples. Exogenous indole derivatives (0.25-2 mM) selectively suppressed CRC isolates, exhibiting 40-50% reductions in biofilm formation (*p < 0.001) and bacterial invasion of colon cancer cells, while non-CRC isolates displayed minimal or no response. Mechanistically, indole derivatives triggered distinct, disease-specific changes in virulence gene expression, with naive Bayes classifier achieving 90% accuracy in disease association (AUC = 0.90-0.92; accuracy = 0.74-0.75; p < 2 x 10-16). This disease-adapted vulnerability was independent of subspecies identity, suggesting niche-specific phenotypes. Furthermore, exogenous indole derivatives, I3A and indole, strengthened epithelial tight junction gene expression while inhibiting bacterial invasion, demonstrating dual host-protective and pathogen-suppressive effects.

Despite the promise of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), their narrow margin between efficacy and residual virulence presents major safety challenges. This study bridges a critical knowledge gap in ASF vaccinology by identifying innate and adaptive correlates of protection. This was achieved by using an established model with two groups of pigs differing in baseline immunological status (farm and specific pathogen-free [SPF]). The animals were immunized with an attenuated ASFV strain and subsequently challenged with a related, highly virulent genotype II strain. By applying a systems immunology approach, we correlated kinetic data, including serum cytokines, blood transcription modules (BTMs), T-cell responses, and antibody levels, with clinical outcomes to track protective and detrimental immune responses to the virus over time. Key innate correlates of protection included early and sustained IFN- response, activation of antigen presentation BTMs, and controlled IL-8 levels during immunization. Lower baseline immune activation observed in SPF pigs in steady state was linked to increased protection. Adaptive correlates encompassed cell cycle, plasma cell, and T-cell BTM responses lasting until day 15 post-immunization. Consequently, an effective response from ASFV-specific Th cells prior to challenge indicated protection. After the challenge, an early IFN- response, along with low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a strong induction of memory Th and Tc cells, correlated with improved clinical outcomes. The model highlights the critical role of host-specific factors in vaccine efficacy and provides a valuable framework for optimizing ASFV vaccine design while distinguishing between protective and detrimental immune responses.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Yet we lack systematic understanding of the microbial taxa that drive decomposition of chemically distinct carbon pools and of the metabolic pathways they employ across environmental gradients. Here, we address this critical gap using the first continental-scale soil dataset pairing shotgun metagenomes with high-resolution molecular characterization of SOM chemistry. We use data from 47 standardized soil cores - selected using microbial respiration rates from 106 soils across the United States - to assemble 0.76 terabases (Tbs) of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (828 MAGs) and identify 66,727 distinct SOM molecules. Integrating these datasets revealed widespread microbial potential for depolymerizing chemically-recalcitrant carbon compounds previously considered stable. Notably, we uncover complementary metabolic specialization between genera affiliated with two abundant bacterial orders, Rhizobiales and Chthoniobacterales, and an archaeal order, Nitrososphaerales. This metabolic partitioning is consistent across soil depths and activity levels, suggesting coordinated decomposition of chemically-complex carbon through distinct but complementary biochemical strategies. The metabolic potential for depolymerization of chemically-recalcitrant compounds is supported by the abundance of these molecules across the soils, as indicated by Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS), and by flux balance analysis of metabolic models. Our continental-scale integration of microbial genotypes with their chemical substrates reveals that a substantial fraction of SOM that is considered to be relatively stable harbors decomposition potential that current Earth system models fail to capture.

GWAS identified marker trait associations that revealed 59 SNPs related to B/Y, Y/P, HI and DM across all of the 21 chromosomes out of which 32 SNPs had high confidence protein coding regions. These associated SNPs were functionally characterized using different wheat databases. Their functional annotation revealed that some of the proteins expressed by these regions including elongation factor alpha and cytochrome p450 exhibit direct response to heat stress and several transcription factors that help repair damaged DNA or act as chaperones and restore cellular activity play a central role in rendering heat tolerance to wheat. 2B was identified as QTL hotspot having 6 significant SNPs that were related to proteins having substantial role in heat tolerance. Haplotype analysis of these SNPs revealed the patterns of inheritance of these SNPs.

In particular, the type Ia afferents are affected, which mainly encode muscle stretch velocity. Predictive frameworks of sensorimotor control, such as Active Inference and Optimal Feedback Control, suggest that velocity signals should inform position estimates. Such a function would predict that errors in perceived limb position and velocity should be correlated, but this prediction remains empirically underexplored. We hypothesised that an online evaluation of the integral of sensed velocity influences the perceived arm position during active movements. Using a virtual reality-based reaching task, we investigated how vibration-biased proprioceptive feedback influences voluntary movement control and inference of arm position and movement. Our results suggest that muscle vibration biases perceived movement velocity, with downstream effects on perceived limb position and reflexive corrections of movement speed. We found that (i) antagonist vibration during active movement caused participants to both overestimate their movement speed while also slowing down, (ii) movement speed and endpoint errors were correlated, with muscle vibration affecting both in congruent directions, and (iii) adjustments in movement speed to muscle vibration are sufficiently fast to be reflexive.

Quantification of these services is lacking so far. Thus, it is not possible to predict scenarios (e.g. future climates). Based on data from a comprehensive groundwater ecosystem study comprising four zones of varying land use and groundwater / surface water exchange, we parameterized a quantitative dynamic food web model (recharged organic carbon, microorganisms using the biodegradable fraction of this carbon, and fauna grazing on the microorganisms). With the model satisfactorily reflecting the field data, we calculated five further scenarios, three of which without fauna (mortality e.g. due to contamination, sudden peaks of temperature etc.). Two of the \"fauna\" and two of the \"no fauna\" scenarios were run with temperature elevated by 1.5{degrees}C and 3{degrees}C, respectively. The ecosystem service of carbon degradation was expressed as the difference in carbon concentration between the beginning of the simulation and the end of the simulation. In most scenarios, remaining carbon increased over time. The remaining carbon in some scenarios was up to 6.6 times as high in the \"no fauna\" scenarios compared to the reference case. Fauna was thus shown to fulfil a service by promoting microbial carbon degradation that may be substantial. Sustainable drinking water production is more reliable and less costly, the more active the groundwater fauna in the production area is.

M.; Zhang, J.", "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a systems-level disorder driven by the failure of interconnected biological networks, demanding therapeutic strategies and analytical frameworks that operate beyond single-target paradigms. The multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is a promising therapeutic candidate due to its senolytic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, its precise systems-level impact on AD-relevant gene networks remains unresolved. Here, we employ the GeneTerrain-GMM (gt-GMM) framework, a novel method combining topological data analysis with unsupervised clustering, to dissect the mechanism of dasatinib in a human SH-SY5Y neuronal model. By analyzing high-throughput gene expression data from a curated network of 100 AD-implicated genes, we demonstrate that dasatinib, unlike an inert control, induces a profound, global reorganization of the gene expression landscape. This response is characterized by a smooth, highly coordinated topography, which gtGMM decomposes into a dominant, statistically robust functional module. Strikingly, this single module integrates canonical AD pathways with distinct signatures of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, a convergence that provides a powerful mechanistic fingerprint of the drugs action. Our findings reveal that dasatinibs effect is not diffuse but is focused on a critical connection linking protein misprocessing to inflammation and programmed cell death. This study provides a systems-level rationale for the therapeutic potential of dasatinib in AD and showcases the ability of topological data analysis to uncover the higher-order logic of complex drug-gene interactions.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

B.; Rowntree, A.; Chopra, K.; MacKellar, E.; Noble, B.; Dixon, H. L.; Healy, C.; Clarke, R. B.; Papalopulu, N.", "abstract": "Long-term recurrence in breast cancer is driven by reactivation of dormant disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) and remains a major clinical challenge, particularly in oestrogen receptor positive (ER) tumours. This process is underpinned by regulation of the cell cycle machinery that controls quiescence maintenance and exit. HES1, a Notch pathway transcription factor, regulates key cell cycle genes and has been shown to demonstrate protein expression oscillations.\n\nHere, we sought to establish whether HES1 oscillations may regulate ER+ cancer cell quiescence and reactivation. To investigate this, we developed a fundamental in vitro model of cell cycle arrest and re-entry based on reversible CDK4/6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) with palbociclib, compatible with quantitative single-cell live-imaging of a knock-in endogenous HES1 reporter. Consistent with earlier findings, HES1 exhibited [~]24-hour protein oscillations in cycling cells demonstrating a reproducible dip in protein expression prior to S-Phase. During CDK4/6i-mediated arrest, the [~]24h HES1 oscillation was lost, HES1 levels were maintained at a moderately higher level and HES1 exhibited smaller dips. Similar changes were observed in unperturbed, spontaneously quiescent cells. Following release from CDK4/6i and cell cycle re- entry, these alterations were reversed and the characteristic G1/S HES1 dip was observed. Preventing this dip at the point of release, by inducibly sustaining HES1 with a Tet-On system, upregulated the cell cycle inhibitor p21, impeded cell cycle re-entry and induced cell death. These findings suggest that manipulating HES1 dynamics could represent a promising therapeutic approach to prevent reactivation of dormant tumour cells.\n\nSignificance StatementBreast cancer can recur years after initial treatment due to reactivation of dormant tumour cells. Understanding how these cells exit dormancy is crucial for preventing relapse. We investigated HES1, a transcription factor with rhythmic protein oscillations, and its role in regulating quiescence in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER) breast cancer cells. Using live-cell imaging and a reversible cell cycle arrest model, we show that HES1 dynamics change during dormancy and reactivation, and that disrupting these oscillations prevents cell cycle re-entry and induces cell death. These findings reveal HES1 protein dynamics as a potential therapeutic vulnerability and highlight a novel strategy to target dormant cancer cells to prevent their reactivation.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Flexible prioritisation in working memory (WM) is supported by neural oscillations in frontal and sensory brain areas, but the roles of different oscillations remain poorly understood. Recordings in humans suggest an interplay between prefrontal slow frequency (2-8Hz) and posterior alpha-band (10Hz) oscillations regulating top-down control and retrieval of WM representations, respectively. Complementary work, primarily in non-human primates, suggests an additional role for beta (15-30Hz) oscillations in clearing or inhibiting stimuli from entering WM. Here we investigated the role of neural oscillations in prioritising WM content using electroencephalography (EEG) as participants (humans of any sex) performed a task requiring frequent priority switches between two memorized oriented bars. Behavioural performance revealed switch costs, which scaled with the angular distance between the two items, suggesting that priority shifts are modulated by shift magnitude. Time-frequency analyses revealed increased frontal theta (4-8Hz) and decreased central-parietal beta (15-25Hz) power during switches. Crucially, only beta power scaled with the magnitude of the priority shift and predicted the fidelity of neural decoding of the newly prioritized item during subsequent recall. Theta power, by contrast, was elevated on switch trials but did not vary with update magnitude or decoding strength, suggesting a more general role in signaling control demands. Our findings highlight a particular and previously overlooked role for beta-band oscillations in the flexible prioritisation of WM content.\n\nSignificance StatementWorking memory permits flexible switching between mental representations, so we can focus on what is most relevant at the moment. Different brain rhythms in frontal control and sensory memory storage areas orchestrate switches but their respective roles remain unclear. Here, using EEG, we show that power reductions of [~]20Hz oscillations over central-parietal regions, usually associated with the motor system, closely track the magnitude of the required switch and the fidelity of the prioritized memory. In contrast, slower 4-8Hz (theta-band) activity over frontal regions increases during priority switches but tracks neither magnitude nor fidelity. Our findings suggest a unique function for central-parietal beta oscillations in the flexible control of working memory.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we focus on globular protein members of the methyltransferase family: the TrmD-Tm1570 protein, which contains two deep 31 knots, and the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570, all from Calditerrivibrio nitroreducens. Using various biophysical experimental techniques and computer simulations with AI-based methods, we studied their thermal and thermodynamic stability, as well as their mechanical unfolding. Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the Structure-Based C Model (SBM-C) and UNRES (coarse-grained), we show that native contacts alone are not sufficient to fold double-knotted proteins. However, native contacts are sufficient to fold the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570 into their native conformations. Using the same model, we identified four possible unfolding and untying pathways, in which each domain can self-tie independently at some stage of the process. Optical tweezers (OT) experiments show that this process is also reversible, although the stretched state remains knotted. In addition, we observed higher thermal and mechanical stability in Tm1570 compared with TrmD, which is partly attributable to the position of the knot core. Overall, our results suggest that double-knotted protein from the SPOUT family can only partially self-fold, and that full knotting may require the assistance of a chaperone.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The full suite of visual analysis entails activity across several visual areas and feedback from later areas to earlier ones. This raises the question of whether the early sensory representation indexed by the C1 is read out for perceptual decisions or whether it is passed over in favour of more advanced representations. To address this question, we asked whether the C1 would predict time-pressured stimulus contrast comparisons independently of physical stimulus conditions, a phenomenon known as choice probability. We found that the C1 did this for a narrow range of response times, indicative of decision readout since the C1 is a transient signal. This effect could not be accounted for by stimulus differences, choice history, or any other choice-predictive signal that we could identify in either the time or frequency domain, either before or after target onset. It also preceded the onset of evidence-dependent decision formation estimated from the centroparietal positivity by tens of milliseconds, together providing an approximate timeline of early evidence readout and its delayed impact on the decision.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The most specific autoantibody response in SLE, present in 20-30% of patients, targets the Sm-protein and has been shown to recognize a linear Sm-derived B cell epitope containing a post-translational modification (PTM) of arginine termed symmetrical dimethyl arginine (sDMA). As autoantibodies to other PTM-modified proteins are often promiscuous, we aimed to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of anti-Sm antibodies.\n\nMethodsSpecificity and promiscuity/cross-reactivity of anti-Sm IgG were measured by ELISA in SLE patients and healthy donors using peptides containing either sDMA or unmodified arginine. Inhibition and cross-reactivity were determined using competitive ELISA and affinity purification. Recognition of endogenous EBNA1 by anti-Sm IgG was performed by Western blot using lysates of EBV-bearing lymphoblastoid cell lines.\n\nResultsThe sDMA residue is recognized by anti-Sm+ SLE patients regardless of the peptide amino acid sequence, with a modest impact of amino acids flanking sDMA on recognition.

In this study, we examine enzyme selectivity within kinetic networks corresponding to known inhibition mechanisms. We demonstrate that competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors do not affect substrate specificity, regardless of rate constants. In contrast, noncompetitive and mixed inhibition can alter specificity and can lead to non-monotonic responses to the inhibitor. We show that mixed and non-competitive inhibitors achieve substrate-selective inhibition by altering the effective free-energy barriers of product formation pathways that are enabled by the inhibitor's presence.

Two other families of insecticidal proteins--Prb proteins from bacterial symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes and a marine bacterial pathogen, and IPD113 proteins from ferns--are two-domain (2D) proteins structurally resembling domains I and II of Cry proteins. Despite the structural resemblance, the amino acid sequence identity among these families is only [~]10%, supporting the prevailing view that they evolved independently through convergent evolution. However, the possibility of remote homology and ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence supporting divergent evolution of these protein families. We found that proteins containing Cry-like two domains are distributed far more broadly across bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea than previously recognized. Phylogenetic analyses separated the structurally similar proteins into five clades including Cry, IPD113, Prb, and 2D/3D-mixed clades. Domain-level trees revealed intermixing within domain II, with nematocidal Cry proteins frequently clustering with IPD113 and 2D/3D-mixed clades, suggesting domain swapping events across these clades. Conserved amino acid motifs and domain core structures across clades further support a shared evolutionary origin. Phylogenetic and structural analyses suggest a bacterial origin of the fern IPD113 gene and its horizontal transfer via fungal symbionts, as well as multiple HGT events into diverse terrestrial and marine eukaryotes and archaea. This work redefines the evolutionary landscape of the insecticidal protein families, revealing their unexpectedly wide taxonomic distribution, possibly shaped through bacterial ecological networks and close biological interactions such as symbiosis.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

However, successful DNA extraction and long-read sequencing remain highly organism-dependent. Molluscs, a diverse phylum of invertebrates, pose particular challenges due to inhibitory compounds and degraded or fragmented DNA, often necessitating careful optimization of extraction protocols. Here, we present a case study on the freshwater mussel Anodonta anatina (Bivalvia: Unionidae), evaluating two preservation methods, six DNA extraction protocols, and two post-extraction clean-up steps for their effects on DNA quality and PacBio HiFi sequencing yield from a single individual. The PacBio Nanobind and CTAB protocols produced high-quality DNA from fresh foot tissue but performed poorly on flash-frozen tissue, which is the most common preservation method. Post-extraction clean-up generally degraded DNA and did not improve sequencing yield. Unexpectedly, the column-based Omega Mollusc Kit, although not designed for high-molecular-weight DNA, outperformed the PacBio-recommended Nanobind kit and the manual CTAB method on flash-frozen tissue. It generated high DNA quantity and purity, sufficient integrity for HiFi sequencing, and effective contaminant removal. While the resulting DNA may be too fragmented for Oxford Nanopore sequencing, the Omega Mollusc Kit offers a practical, cost-effective first approach for testing DNA extraction and PacBio sequencing in new mollusc genome projects of relatively large species when tissue is flash-frozen. When fresh tissue is available, Nanobind or CTAB remain the recommended options.

Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers from 287 specimens across five ocean regions, including type localities in Bora Bora (T. coccinea) and Galapagos (T. tagusensis), we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships and inferred demographic history through approximate Bayesian computation. We also generated high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies for three morphologically distinct morphotypes from the Brazilian coastline. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses revealed two well-supported clades: a small, geographically restricted T. tagusensis clade confined to the Galapagos Islands, and a large cosmopolitan clade containing all worldwide samples, including T. coccinea from its type locality. Chromosome-level genomic analyses confirmed that the three morphotypes represent a single species, sharing a triploid karyotype of 14 chromosomes with extensive synteny and gene-tree discordance consistent with incomplete lineage sorting. Dispersed-route analyses identified the Centralwestern Pacific as the ancestral source, with at least three independent, human mediated colonization events establishing populations in the Southwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Pacific. However, preliminary analysis suggests a Galapagos (Southeastern Pacific) origin rather than Centralwestern Pacific for the T. tagusensis and T. coccinea cluster.

Female mice on the other hand, develop cystic kidneys but progress slowly. ADAMTS9 deletion disrupted ciliogenesis by the loss of ciliary transition zone (TZ) protein TMEM67 cleavage, leading to loss of the MKS/B9 module - a key component of the ciliary gate. Functional analysis of all eight ciliopathy patient variants of ADAMTS9 identified to date, showed TMEM67 C-terminus failed to localize to the transition zone, thus disrupting a key regulatory mechanism in patient renal ciliogenesis. Modeling ADAMTS9-mediated TMEM67 cleavage utilizing our novel TMEM67-cleavage deficient mice revealed loss of TZ formation but not elevated canonical Wnt signaling as the underlying mechanism driving cystogenesis.

How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery.

C.; Pirikahu, S.; Kussmaul, C.; Opatowski, L.; Domenech de Celles, M.", "abstract": "Pathogen-pathogen interactions occur when infection with one pathogen influences ones chance of infection or disease due to another. Increasingly, evidence suggests that interactions are a common feature of infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to both the nonlinearities and stochasticity inherent to infectious disease transmission, and the frequency of confounding (e.g., by shared seasonal forcing), purely statistical methods for characterizing interactions may be prone to failure. Here, we perform a simulation study to evaluate several non-mechanistic approaches for inferring causality from time series data: generalized additive models (GAMs), Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Specifically, we use a two-pathogen mechanistic transmission model, calibrated to produce dynamics resembling outbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to generate synthetic datasets with a range of values for interaction strength and duration. We then apply each method to all synthetic datasets. We find that Granger causality, transfer entropy, and CCM all fail to consistently infer whether data contain signal of an interaction; in particular, methods tend to incorrectly identify interactions where none are modeled (average sensitivity = 80.6%, 92.1%, 72.1%, respectively; average specificity = 31.0%, 33.3%, 33.1%).\n\nFurthermore, we find little to no association between point estimates from each method and true interaction strength. In contrast, GAMs infer the existence of interactions more accurately than the other methods (sensitivity = 85.2%, specificity = 72.5%), and consistently yield larger point estimates for stronger interactions. However, their practical utility is limited by an inability to evaluate interaction asymmetry (i.e., whether the effect of pathogen A on pathogen B is identical to that of B on A). We conclude that accurately and comprehensively characterizing pathogen-pathogen interactions based on outbreak data remains a significant challenge. For this reason, it is critical that any proposed methods be rigorously evaluated before being used to draw conclusions about interactions.\n\nAuthor SummaryPathogen-pathogen interactions occur when infection with one pathogen either increases or decreases a persons risk of infection or illness due to a second, distinct pathogen. Because interactions affect several common human pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, a better understanding of interactions could improve epidemic control. However, past work has shown that simple methods commonly used to study interactions can lead to inaccurate conclusions. Here, we tested four methods frequently used in other fields, including ecology and neuroscience, to see whether they may also be useful for identifying interactions. Specifically, we tested each method using simulated outbreak data generated using a mathematical model. We found that most methods struggled to correctly determine whether an interaction effect was present; in particular, methods often falsely identified interactions when none occurred. Although one of the tested methods, generalized additive models, performed comparatively well at identifying interactions, it provided relatively little additional information about the interactions. Because pathogen-pathogen interactions are so challenging to study, it is important that researchers rigorously test methods before applying them to interactions, so as not to publish potentially misleading results. More broadly, a complete understanding of interactions will likely require a variety of approaches, including both laboratory and modeling studies.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake.

To address this, we developed CIN-seq, a targeted single-cell multiomics method that enables large-scale profiling of rare CIN phenotypes and captures their temporally regulated gene expression. Applying CIN-seq, we investigated viable, spontaneous multipolar mitosis, an abnormal division process that cancer cells can survive. Genomic analysis revealed that this mitosis produces polyploid or chromosomally variable progeny, confirming its role in genomic instability. Aneuploidy of Chromosome 16 was linked to increased tripolar mitosis, a finding validated with CRISPR imaging. Transcriptomic analysis showed activation of the Rho GTPase cycle, which was associated with cytokinesis failure, while PTEN attenuation emerged as a key player of viable multipolar mitosis by promoting cell cycle progression and survival via BCL2L1. We also uncovered a novel link between this phenotype and degranulation-like stress responses, which may contribute to cancer cell adaptation to chromosomal instability.

Pyramidal neurons in glioma-infiltrated tissues display clear volume shrinkage in somas and branches, tapering from the soma to nearby dendritic compartments. By integrating these morphological variations with spatial and bulk transcriptomic profiles, we find that glioblastoma tissues exhibit dysregulation of 15.29% of genes, including overexpression of TERT, whereas infiltrated tissues show 7.74% gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A and TP53.

We introduce a computational model of arm state inference grounded in Bayesian sensory integration and compare its behaviour to findings from three classical sensorimotor studies. The model allows us to contrast the predicted behaviour of two proprioceptive configurations: one relying primarily on position signals and another relying primarily on velocity signals, reflecting the distinct contributions of type II and type Ia muscle spindle afferents. Our simulations show that a system with strong reliance on velocity-based feedback tends to represent movement relative to previously estimated positions. In a simulated reaching task with briefly presented offset visual feedback, such an Agent produces systematic endpoint errors even after visual feedback is removed. In contrast, an Agent relying mainly on positional feedback is able to correctly update its inferred hand position after visual feedback is removed, thereby limiting this type of biased endpoint errors. When biased visual feedback remains continuously available, or when muscle vibration is simulated, the two configurations produce very similar behaviour. These results indicate that markedly different assumptions about the weighting of positional and velocity proprioceptive cues can yield similar observable behaviour in some of the often-used experimental setups designed to probe state inference processes. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the composition of proprioceptive signals when building computational models and interpreting human sensorimotor experiments. We highlight the task conditions under which our model predicts clear behavioural differences arising from the relative contribution of velocity versus positional feedback.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are limited by hepatotoxicity and poor kidney tropism. This study aimed to develop a minimally invasive approach that overcomes both challenges. We evaluated in pigs a technique leveraging external perfusion systems to transiently isolate native kidney vascularization. Using a percutaneous femoral approach, fluoroscopy-guided catheterization of the kidney artery and vein enabled the establishment of a temporary isolated kidney perfusion circuit permitting native kidney in-situ perfusion. AAV delivery was then assessed by detecting construct encoding Td-Tomato protein, its mRNA and fluorescence 6 days after the perfusion. The method was achieved with two different external perfusion systems and was not associated with procedure related mortality or any major complication. Td-Tomato was detected in the perfused kidney without a significant detection in the liver which showed no inflammatory infiltrates. We developed, in pigs, a minimally invasive method permitting in-situ native kidney perfusion that enables kidney-targeted AAV delivery. Besides, it limits liver off-target transduction, potentially reducing its main side effect, hepatotoxicity, when AAV is systemically injected. It offers fast-track translational possibilities for developing kidney-targeted gene therapies.

GEMGen encodes desired phenotypic transitions as text-based representations of up- and down-regulated gene sets, enabling transferable modeling across experimental platforms and data modalities. Trained on large scale chemical perturbation data, GEMGen robustly identifies phenotype-oriented compounds and mechanistically related but structurally distinct candidates across multiple benchmarks. Applied to signatures induced by genetic perturbations, GEMGen produces small molecules that phenocopy gene knockdown effects and identifies chemically novel inhibitors, including previously unreported KEAP1 inhibitors that activate NRF2 signaling. Extending this approach to a disease relevant model of fibrosis, GEMGen generates compounds that reverse profibrotic transcriptional programs and cellular phenotypes.

H.; Giacani, L.", "abstract": "Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum) causes systemic syphilis, exclusively infects humans in nature and can persist for decades in the absence of treatment despite generating robust adaptive immune responses. The T. pallidum repeat (Tpr) family of outer membrane proteins are immunogenic but have been implicated in immune evasion due to antigenic variation, indicating that Tprs are virulence factors displayed on the spirochetes surface. Long-term survival of T. pallidum is largely attributed to the sparse surface-exposed outer membrane proteins and antigenic variation exhibited by the major surface protein TprK, which undergoes phase variation. Mechanism of antigenic variation has been studied for decades; however, functions of Tprs in this extracellular pathogen have not been experimentally determined. In this study, we determined TprD and TprK location, their role in adherence and in clearance of T. pallidum by macrophages. Using our now established heterologous surrogate system and gain-in-function approach using non-adherent related spirochete, the B314 strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, we show that both TprD and TprK are surface exposed to some extent on engineered B. burgdorferi as well as on T. pallidum Nichols and SS14 strains. We further demonstrate that both proteins mediate adherence to different mammalian cells in vitro and mouse antibodies generated against TprD and TprK putative surface loops bind spirochetes and promote J774A.1 macrophages-mediated opsonophagocytosis. Thus, surface-exposed adhesins TprD and TprK of T. pallidum contribute to binding to different types of cells which likely reflect the pathogens ability to colonize different tissues, and they are also targets of opsonic antibodies.\n\nIMPORTANCESyphilis remains a major global public health challenge and is exacerbated by the rising number of cases of congenital infection and increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission in syphilitic patients. A critical barrier to improving understanding of the molecular basis of syphilis pathogenesis owe to fragility of T. pallidum, inability to grow it in pure culture, and difficulty in generating knockout mutants in predicted virulence factors due to their possible essential role in spirochetes viability. Our findings provide experimental evidence linking Tpr proteins to host cell adherence, their ability to generate humoral immune response in the rabbit model of infection as well as in humans which could facilitate clearance by macrophages.

While MAYV infection is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, its tissue tropism, systemic dissemination, and potential non-vector transmission routes remain incompletely understood. Here, we establish a comprehensive murine model to investigate MAYV pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on reproductive tissues and gestational stages. Following intraperitoneal infection, MAYV rapidly disseminated to lymphoid, visceral, musculoskeletal, and reproductive organs, inducing hematological and biochemical alterations that mimics of human infection. In pregnant females, viral dissemination and host responses differed markedly according to gestational stage. Early pregnancy was characterized by placental permissiveness, fetal exposure, and transcriptional signatures associated with inflammation and antiviral responses, whereas mid gestation showed a more restricted placental profile. Infectious viral particles were also detected in reproductive tissues and enriched sperm samples, supporting the biological plausibility of sexual transmission. In addition, in vivo imaging using a luminescent MAYV reporter gene enabled real-time visualization of viral kinetics and tissue persistence. Together, these findings identify viral tropism, with gestational stages as a critical determinant of placental permissiveness and fetal exposure to MAYV, establishing a robust in vivo platform to study MAYV dissemination, transmission potential, and host-pathogen interactions.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The flagellum of V. cholerae serves not only as a motility organelle for host seeking and colonization but also as a key environmental sensor and signal transducer, directly regulating virulence and biofilm formation. Despite its central role, the trade-off mechanisms between motility loss and enhanced host adaptability remain poorly understood. To address this, we analyzed 3,135 cholera-related samples and found that flagellar mutations in V. cholerae cluster primarily in genes such as flhB, fliA, fliF, fliD, and fliM. Using a flagellar mutant library, we observed that colonization ability was inversely correlated with FlgM secretion. Mechanistically, high intracellular FlgM inactivates the {sigma}28 factor FliA, leading to transcriptional derepression of the quorum-sensing master regulator hapR. HapR in turn upregulates methionine metabolism and transport, thereby enhancing V. cholerae colonization in vivo. Through further validation with a uniquely constructed 6N-labeled mutant pool in an adult mouse model, we demonstrated that motility loss promotes environmental adaptability via the FlgM-FliA-HapR-methionine axis. Our study demonstrates that the secretion level of the flagellar regulator FlgM drives an adaptive shift in V. cholerae from motility to colonization within the host. This shift is mediated through quorum sensing and methionine metabolic reprogramming, revealing a novel mechanism that provides new insights into bacterial evolution and pathogenicity.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

We first show that the uncharacterized Avs7 family recognizes the major capsid protein (MCP) of tailed phages.

L.", "abstract": "Pathogenic Rickettsia species are obligate intracellular bacteria that must reside in a mammalian host or arthropod vector cell to survive. Although these bacteria transition between different intracellular environments during infection, they encode few putative transcription factors, and their gene regulatory networks are largely unknown. Because of their inextricable relationship with eukaryotic cells, transcriptional profiling of the pathogen is complicated by the abundance of contaminating host RNA, especially in infection conditions or stages where the bacterial burden is inherently low. Here, we employ a hybrid capture technique (PatH-Cap) to improve library preparation by enriching bacterial transcripts while depleting host and rRNA molecules. Using PatH-Cap, we explored transcriptional changes throughout the first 24 hours of infection, including infection initiation - an infection stage which has been difficult to profile with standard library preparation methods. We then clustered genes based on their temporal trends, revealing cohorts of genes whose expression is up- or downregulated at different stages of infection. We also highlighted the diverse temporal expression trends of genes with known roles in growth and pathogenesis, including translation and cell division genes, secreted effectors, and secretion system components. Lastly, we identified 310 antisense RNA molecules, many of which also showed strong temporal trends. This work demonstrates that sensitive transcriptional profiling approaches like PatH-Cap hold great promise for dissecting gene expression networks driving infection in intracellular pathogens that have historically posed significant technical challenges.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhen investigating poorly annotated genomes, such as those in obligate intracellular bacteria, transcriptional analyses can reveal gene sets active under specific conditions and form the foundation for future targeted approaches.

The mechanism by which ATRX modulates chromatin is unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structure revealed that ATRX recognizes and modulates the nucleosome through its C-terminal regions by embracing and unwrapping [~]18 base-pair nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit sites in the presence of ADP*BeF3. Strikingly, the DNA minor groove between SHL6 and SHL7 is profoundly deformed by a \"pin-like\" structure in ATRX, which uniquely intercalates the aromatic side chain of a phenylalanine into the base stackings. Biochemical assays revealed the crucial role of this phenylalanine in sliding the nucleosome without affecting the ATPase activity. Such a \"pin-like\" structure mimics a \"foot-step\" on the DNA ladder, which differentiates ATRX from other remodelers. To translocate the DNA on the nucleosome, two more features, including a disordered insertion that contacts the histone surface and a positively charged loop bridging the cross-gyre interactions, serve as essential anchors for the nucleosome modulation by ATRX.

V.; Ugedo, L.; Torrecilla, M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major clinical challenge, and its neurobiological basis remains unclear. The locus coeruleus (LC), a key noradrenergic hub, shows altered activity in TRD models, and serotonergic 5-HT7 receptors have emerged as potential modulators of this circuit. Methods: We assessed the impact of 5-HT7 receptor activation on LC function in Wistar Kyoto rats, an established TRD model, using in vivo extracellular recordings, in vitro patch-clamp assays, and receptor expression analysis. Results: Systemic administration of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, increased LC neuronal firing in both strains, with a significantly greater effect in Wistar Kyoto rats. This response was prevented by a 5-HT7 antagonist confirming receptor specificity. Glutamatergic blockade altered AS19 effects in a strain-dependent manner, whereas in vitro assays revealed no differential postsynaptic modulation and similar presynaptic inhibition across groups. Western blot analysis showed elevated 5-HT7 receptor expression in the LC, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala of Wistar Kyoto rats, alongside reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 5-HT7 receptor activation exerts complex, circuit-dependent modulation of LC activity, influenced by glutamatergic and serotonergic inputs. Enhanced receptor expression in limbic regions and altered LC responsiveness may contribute to TRD pathophysiology and highlight 5-HT7 signaling as a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Patients have characteristic electroretinography abnormalities, including reduced cone responses, delayed and reduced rod responses to low light flashes and paradoxically large rod-driven responses to bright flashes of light. To model this condition, we generated the Kcnv2 E151X mouse line and assessed its structural and functional retinal features. Methods: We have employed CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing technology to generate a mouse line with an early stop mutation in position E151 - orthologous to the commonly encountered E143X mutation in humans - and performed a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western Blot to confirm the absence of the full-length KCNV2-encoded protein, Kv8.2. To assess how closely it models the human disease, we have characterised the KCNV2 mutant mouse line at histological and functional levels employing immunohistochemistry and electroretinography, respectively. Results: Kcnv2 mutant mice showed markedly reduced photopic responses and reproduced the supernormal rod phenotype as described in affected individuals. In the morphological context, mutant retinas demonstrated strong and early glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation together with reduced counts of cone arrestin positive cells as well as photoreceptors in general. Conclusions: The Kcnv2 mutant mouse line replicates key functional and structural hallmarks of KCNV2-associated retinopathy.

Replication, segregation and expression of kDNA are highly complex processes that involve an estimated [~]300 proteins, only a fraction of which have been identified and characterized. Here, we report the development of an unbiased genetic screen in the experimental model Trypanosoma brucei to identify novel factors involved in kDNA maintenance. Our approach uses a combination of genome-wide RNA interference, a novel kDNA staining protocol, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Of the 20 highest-ranked genes identified, six are known kDNA maintenance factors. One hit, Tb927.8.4240, a gene of previously unknown function, was selected for experimental validation and follow-up. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy using a tagged version of the protein reveals a dynamic localization during the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated ablation of Tb927.8.4240 results in the progressive but incomplete loss of kDNA, with only a minor effect on the tripartite attachment complex, suggesting the protein is involved in kDNA replication but not segregation. The growth phenotype of Tb927.8.4240 ablation is fully rescued in a kDNA-independent genetic background, confirming a specific role in kDNA replication.\n\nIn summary, we describe a functional genetic screen for the identification of kDNA maintenance factors in trypanosomes, validate one hit as a novel kDNA replication factor, and provide a prioritized hit list as a promising starting point for the future identification of additional factors.\n\nIMPORTANCETrypanosomatid parasites cause several important diseases in humans and their livestock, such as sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and nagana. Critical for survival of these parasites in their hosts and vectors is faithful maintenance and expression of their mitochondrial DNA, called kinetoplast DNA (or kDNA). Indeed, several established anti-trypanosomal drugs interfere with these processes. Kinetoplast DNA maintenance is an extraordinarily complex process and incompletely understood. Here we describe the development of a functional genetic screen in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei for the identification of genes that are important for kDNA maintenance. The top 20 screening hits include six known kDNA maintenance genes, which validates this screen. Using gene knockdown by RNA interference and localization studies with ultrastructure expansion microscopy we characterize one hit, a gene with the systematic identifier Tb927.8.4240, as a novel kDNA replication factor.

Its chemical composition and organization are strongly influenced by external factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient availability and their delivery mode. In batch culture systems, yeast cells grow in a closed environment with limited nutrients, leading to well-defined growth phases that reflect major metabolic transitions. While global proteomic changes during these phases have been described, the temporal regulation of cell wall protein (CWP) expression remains insufficiently characterized.\n\nIn this study, the temporal remodeling of the cell wall proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c was examined during batch cultivation in rich medium over 24 hours. A classical proteomics workflow was applied to analyze CWPs from samples collected at multiple time points over the cultivation period. The analysis revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative changes in CWPs expression linked to metabolic shifts between growth phases. Proteins involved in cell wall remodeling and glycoprotein biosynthesis were particularly enriched at the initial sampling point (b-T0h), corresponding to the transition from flask cultivation to bioreactor conditions, and overall CWP abundance was highest during this early growth stage.\n\nTime-resolved quantitative, transcription factor, and functional enrichment analyses revealed coordinated regulation of cell wall adaptation. Stationary-phase specific protein markers linked to glucose depletion were identified, offering insight into nutrient-limited remodeling.

As collagen IV fibres form covalent cross-links, cells cannot freely cross it. Basement membrane breaching marks the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma, commonly attributed to protease activity. Yet, recent data show that tumour cells can cross basement membranes through protease-independent mechanisms. Experimental evidence suggests that filopodia can play an active role in pore enlargement in extracellular matrices by generating plastic mechanical deformation. Moreover, plasticity can be regulated by covalent cross-link concentration, which we hypothesise can be responsive to collagen IV turnover, thus generating transient weak spots. To test this, we developed a quantitative, biophysical mathematical model describing the interaction between a tumour-cell cluster and a basement membrane using relevant biological assumptions and parameters. The cluster is represented as an evolving, energetic surface and the basement membrane is described as a set of points representing active and inactive links. Simulations show that synchronisation of collagen IV turnover coupled with filopodium extension drives pore enlargement, providing a mechanistic basis for protease-independent invasion. Consistent with experiments, simulations identify two complementary filopodium groups: one driving global degradation and the other promoting local pore enlargement.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Their biological functions are intimately linked to their material properties including viscosity. Condensate viscosity is determined by the size, shape, concentration and molecular interactions between MLOs components. It impacts the diffusion of MLOs constituents and the selective permeability of the condensate, thereby regulating the rate of biochemical reactions. Viscosity modifications associated with liquid-to-gel transition of the condensates are related to pathologies. Current experimental approaches for characterizing the material properties of cellular condensates remain limited. In this study, we report the use of BODIPY-based molecular rotors, in combination with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), to monitor the microviscosity of cellular MLOs directly in living cells. The fluorescence lifetime of BODIPY derivatives increases with the viscosity of their microenvironment, enabling quantitative assessment of microviscosity within condensates. HaloTag technology was employed to specifically label MLO components. Our findings reveal that the nucleolus exhibits higher viscosity than the surrounding nucleoplasm and that microviscosity varies across nucleolar sub-compartments. Furthermore, nucleolar reorganization induced by inhibition of rRNA synthesis results in a measurable increase in microviscosity. Finally, we demonstrate that the microviscosity of stress granules is lower than that of the nucleolus. Overall, presented results demonstrate the strong potential of the BODIPY based molecular rotors as a versatile and powerful tools for probing the material properties of cellular MLOs.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Our prior work showed that this morphology-encoded signaling pathway is necessary to sustain anchorage-independent survival of BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro. However, whether bleb-induced signaling occurs in vivo and contributes to cancer progression is unclear. Here, we develop complementary in vivo and ex vivo assays spanning human patient samples and mouse xenograft models to mechanistically interrogate bleb signaling directly in physiologic contexts. We observe that bleb-associated septin hubs are exclusively formed in poorly adherent amoeboid tumor cells at the invasive margin, within malignant effusions, and at distant metastatic sites, while well-adhered cells in the tumor interior show no signs of septin hub formation. Accordingly, pharmacological pathway disruption specifically kills disseminated tumor cells within these low-adhesion microenvironments while having no appreciable effect on adhered cells in the tumor interior, resulting in reduced metastatic burden and delayed disease recurrence in vivo. This work confirms septin-mediated bleb signaling as a previously unrecognized vulnerability of disseminated cancer cells and demonstrates that this morphology-encoded pathway operates in vivo to support disease progression, preserving cancer cell viability under conditions in which cell survival signals from the environment are muted. These findings suggest novel opportunities to target survival signaling in micrometastatic disseminated cancer cells.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

L.; Kirschner, D. E.", "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects a quarter of the world's population. Though many TB patients sterilize infection with treatment regimens including the current standard, incomplete sterilization leads to post-treatment relapse and development of drug resistance. Two mechanisms have been hypothesized as driving relapse: persistence, where treatment kills all replicating Mtb, and relapse follows once non-replicating Mtb return to a replicative niche; and threshold, where replicating Mtb remain alive, yet below detectable levels. Relapse is often detected through a combination of clinical and bacteriological testing, often clinically described as recurrence of TB <2 years after a \"cure\" diagnosis, while many experimental studies examine relapse ~2-months after treatment completion. Our capacity to untangle these considerations and identify mechanisms driving relapse in vivo are limited. Here, we examine the impact of both threshold and persistence mechanisms on relapse post-treatment completion and post-cure diagnosis using our computational model capturing whole-host Mtb infection dynamics. Simulations show that erroneous TB-negative diagnosis post-treatment (false cure) rates are regimen-specific, specifically, the historic standard HRZE is more likely to result in false cure than the contemporary regimens RMZE or BPaL. We also identify how threshold-driven or persistence-driven relapse correlates with both pre-treatment bacterial burden and diagnostic tests used at treatment completion. Simulations show that post-cure relapse is almost exclusively persistence driven, while threshold-driven relapse is most common without a \"cured\" inclusion criterion. Thus, for patients with negative bacteriological diagnostic results at treatment completion, subsequent relapse may best be personalized by targeting non-replicating Mtb.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Methods: Twenty-four older adults (M=69, 14 male, 10 female), including 11 with MCI and 13 healthy controls (MMSE >22/30), performed a spatial navigation task under varying memory load. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to capture error-related potentials (ErrPs), which reflect cognitive load and processing errors. Results: Both groups showed a decline in working memory performance as cognitive load increased ({beta} = -41.39, SE = 10.73, t(90) = -3.86, p < .001). MCI participants, however, exhibited more efficient use of non-intrinsic (allocentric) reference frames under high cognitive load ({beta} = 2.47, SE = 0.95, t(82) = 2.61, p = .009). MCI individuals also displayed larger ErrPs in central brain regions, indicating greater neural resource allocation.

The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a key cortical region for orchestrating motor commands and regulating movement variability, yet its causal role in maintaining precision during high-speed tasks remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of modulating SMA excitability on throwing performance in fourteen healthy novices. Participants performed maximal and submaximal (50% effort) throwing tasks before and after receiving intermittent (facilitatory) or continuous (inhibitory) theta burst stimulation (TBS) over the SMA. Outcome measures included ball speed, variability of pitch location--quantified as variable error (95% confidence ellipse area) and absolute error (Euclidean distance from the ellipse center to the target)--and introspective ratings of performance via visual analog scales (VAS). Results showed that intermittent TBS (iTBS) significantly reduced the variable error of pitch location during maximal-effort throwing--where neural noise is theoretically elevated--without compromising ball speed. In contrast, no significant changes in performance were observed following continuous TBS or during the submaximal throwing task. Notably, objective precision gains under iTBS were dissociated from subjective ratings of accuracy, which increased globally over time independent of stimulation type. These findings demonstrate that the SMA plays a critical causal role in stabilizing motor output under high motor drive.

The only type of molecules consistently deployed during sexual differentiation are members of the Doublesex/Mab-3-related transcription factor (DMRT) family. Although each animal genome codes for a multitude of DMRT family members, in no species has the full array of DMRT genes been comprehensively analyzed across the entire animal, in all sexes and throughout development. Hence, the extent of deployment of DMRT genes in sexual differentiation remains unknown. We describe here the first genome- and nervous system-wide expression and functional analysis of all members of the DMRT gene family. Leveraging genome-engineered reporter alleles of all ten DMRT genes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that six DMRTs display sexually dimorphic expression in somatic and/or reproductive tissues, including in cell and tissue types not previously known to be sexually dimorphic. In the nervous system, DMRT protein expression covers many, though not all, known sexually dimorphic neuron types. Analyses of DMRT null mutant alleles reveal a suite of neuronal differentiation defects, ranging from altered neurotransmitter identities and switched neuropeptide signatures to impaired glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation. Several DMRT proteins do not exhibit sexually dimorphic expression, indicating roles beyond sexual differentiation.

P.", "abstract": "The concept of synaptation is introduced to explain how natural selection can generate complex, higher-level traits in collectives that lack a shared inheritance mechanism. The traditional approach, based on Lewontin's \"recipe\" for natural selection, excludes such emergent traits from the adaptation-exaptation taxonomy. Yet individual organism fitness is often mediated by collective, non-linear interactions within systems that cannot themselves sustain heredity. To address this, multilevel selection (MLS) theory is extended in the form of synaptive MLS, a process through which heterogeneous task groups evolve emergent traits, called synaptations, via irreducible, non-additive cross-level selective covariance. Synaptive MLS differs from trait-group selection because collective function depends on causal entanglement among heterogenous entities with diverse fates, rather than a common trait that links entities to a shared fate. This framework applies to conspecific divisions of labor, multi-species consortia and holobiont integration, where coordination of distinct roles yields emergent fitness effects. Synaptation recognizes how natural selection can contribute to emergent functions by coordinating adaptive, exaptive, and neutral organism-level traits whose lower-level roles scaffold higher-level selected effects. Synaptation and adaptation define the endpoints of a continuum of selected-effect complexity. Recognition of this continuum extends the Darwinian paradigm to adaptive complexity in systems that fail classical heredity requirements and offers an evolutionary lens for understanding relational phenomena such as eubiosis, dysbiosis, and rebiosis in holobionts.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, we profiled the spatial transcriptome of a cohort of healthy controls, MDA5+, and MDA5- muscles and found a distinct transcriptomic profile of the MDA5+ muscles with a low percentage of stressed myofibers but increased immune cell infiltration. Niche analysis revealed a distinct microenvironment in the MDA5+ muscles with the endothelial cell (EC) niche showing increased inflammation, dampened oxygen transport function, and a unique enrichment of the Type 1 interferon response. Cell-cell communication and pathway activity analysis uncovered that hypoxia, TGF-{beta}, NF-{kappa}B, and TNF- signaling were enriched in the MDA5+ EC niche. Altogether, our results support a vasculopathy model whereby blood vessels exhibit a strong inflammatory response and impaired oxygen transport function, leading to vasculopathy and perivascular immune cell infiltration in MDA5+ muscles.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Here we report the results from a systematic map of the academic and grey literature on monitoring and evaluation in rewilding case studies. We find that researchers and practitioners are focused on different aspects of rewilding, and that limited recording of case study details and lack of robust experimental design make it difficult to pool and compare data. We identify challenges facing researchers and rewilding practitioners seeking to build a robust evidence base from which to evaluate rewilding outcomes. These challenges include re-sources as well as spatial and time constraints, which all limit the consistency of data gathering among projects. More comparisons across rewilding projects, better standardisation of data collection and data recording methods, and increased collaboration between researchers and practitioners could go some way to remedy this. We provide recommendations for planning and implementing studies of re-wilded landscapes to aid monitoring and evaluation. These include the broad adoption of low-cost and scalable survey designs with greater focus on comparisons across sites, and continued effort towards open-source data storage.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Elements of Olfactory Intelligence in Drosophila", "doi": "10.64898/2026.01.05.697602", "authors": "Lazar, A. A.; Zhou, Y.", "abstract": "The ability to make the world of odorants intelligible is a key capability of the Drosophila olfactory system that we shall call olfactory intelligence. We argue that olfactory intelligence does not only arise in the form of associative learning in the Mushroom Body, but can be seen throughout the first three stages of the early olfactory system: the Antenna, the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body Calyx, where encoding and processing of odorants take places. Characterizing the structure and logic of the code underlying the spike trains accessing the memory in the Mushroom Body is a major challenge in neuroscience. To address this challenge and unveil the key elements of olfactory intelligence, we extensively model the function of the Drosophila early olfactory system from its intriguing connectome. We start by modeling the space of odorants using constructs of both semantic and syntactic information. Odorant semantics concerns the identity of odorants while odorant syntax pertains to their concentration amplitude. These odorant attributes are multiplicatively coupled in the process of olfactory transduction. To make the world of odorants intelligible, we establish that the Drosophila Antennal Lobe and Calyx largely reduce the concentration dependency of the odorant information from the confounding representation of the Antenna, and thereby disentangle the odorant semantic information from the odorant syntactic information. We also introduce a novel time and rank-based representation of Kenyon Cell (KC) outputs, called the marked first spike sequence code. We compare the cumulative inter-spike interval statistics of odorant semantics and introduce a novel distance measure for the accurate classification of odorant semantics. Computationally, these elements of olfactory intelligence are realized by a class of differential divisive normalization processors (DNPs) modeling the feedback circuits in the Antennal Lobe facilitated by Local Neurons and in the Calyx by the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. The marked first spike sequence code at the output of the DNP circuit of the Calyx provides a novel representation of the odorant semantics. The code reflects the amplitude ranking that drives the KCs in the time domain. Strikingly, the APL feedback not only removes the concentration dependency of the KC outputs, but also increases the ranking distance between the marked first spike sequence codes representing different odorant identities. Thus, the rank-based representation supports accurate classification of odorant semantics.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Laser-scanning microscopy is a promising technique for brain imaging; however, maintaining excitation focus integrity in scattering media while preserving axial confinement poses a persistent photonic challenge. Here we introduce the optical pin, an ultrashort excitation regime engineered at the angular-spectrum level to address this limitation. By broadening the transverse angular bandwidth of a Bessel-type field while preserving its conical momentum-space architecture, the optical pin introduces a controlled longitudinal wave-vector spread that compresses the axial interference length to the micrometer scale, restoring Gaussian-like sectioning without sacrificing multi-angle interference. This excitation design yields substantially enhanced imaging performance, including ~1.5-fold contrast improvement and ~2.6-fold increased robustness to scattering. We validate the approach across transparent, scattering, and biological specimens, including bead phantoms, C. elegans, and mouse brain tissue.

D.; Diehl, S. A.; Waickman, A.", "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that represents a significant and growing public health burden around the world. A unique pathophysiological feature of dengue is immune-mediated enhancement, wherein preexisting immunity elicited by a primary infection can enhance the severity of a subsequent infection by a heterologous DENV serotype. A leading mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), where sub-neutralizing concentrations of DENV-specific IgG antibodies facilitate entry of DENV into Fc{gamma}R expressing cells. Accordingly, this model posits that phagocytic mononuclear cells are the primary reservoir of DENV. However, multiple independent groups have shown that B cells are the largest reservoir of virally infected cells in circulation during acute dengue, representing a disconnect in our understanding of immune-mediated DENV tropism. In response to this persistent knowledge gap, our team has previously identified a novel mechanism of immune-mediated enhancement we have termed BCR-dependent enhancement (BDE) of DENV infection. In this study, we show that DENV infection of DENV-reactive B cells is highly sensitive to BCR/DENV envelope (E) protein interactions. DENV entry into this subset of B cells is dynamin-mediated and requires proximal BCR signaling. Finally, we show that DENV-reactive B cells are productively infected by live DENV, capable of supporting active viral replication and dissemination. We propose that BDE provides an additional layer of pathogen-specific immune-mediated infection risk that complements existing models of ADE and offers additional insight into potential mechanisms of DENV immunopathogenesis.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

However, most existing DTI models assume a static learning environment, whereas real-world biomedical data are dynamic, characterized by the continuous emergence of new protein families and interaction patterns. This poses major challenges for model generalization and continual adaptation, especially under privacy and data-access constraints. To address these issues, we introduce PRADA-DTI, a retrieval-augmented, parameter-efficient framework for domain-incremental DTI learning. Built on a shared physicochemical backbone, PRADADTI learns domain-specialized prompts for representation-level modulation, coupled with LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for parameter-space adaptation. At inference, protein embeddings query a compact prototype memory without storing raw molecular data, retrieving similar domains to dynamically compose the relevant prompts and LoRA parameters without requiring domain labels. This retrieval-guided composition enables continual learning from new protein domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting on previous ones. On BindingDB and BIOSNAP benchmarks, PRADA-DTI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning and parameter-efficient baselines in both predictive accuracy and forgetting mitigation with minimal parameter updates. Interpretability analysis through residue-level attribution visualization demonstrates that the model correctly attends to binding pocket regions across different protein domains, confirming that the retrieval-guided adaptation mechanism captures biologically relevant structural patterns.

There were no significant differences between the SCI and comparison groups on any of the CANTAB tests. After adjusting for SCI status, none of the CANTAB tests were significantly associated with RT.\n\nDiscussionSCI was associated with longer and more variable visuomotor RT, and greater odds of time-out failure, while not being associated with tests of memory and executive function. Cognitive test scores did not explain a significant amount of variance in visuomotor RT. Taken together, these results support a hypothesis that people with SCI may be experiencing earlier visuomotor deficits that are distinct from (or precede) decline in episodic memory and executive function.

While bile acids are increasingly recognized as endogenous immunomodulators, their therapeutic exploitation has been limited by modest potency and incomplete mechanistic understanding. Here, we report the rational engineering of a bile acid-derived scaffold that yields a potent small molecule immunomodulator with therapeutic efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis.\n\nMethodsA focused series of bile acid-based compounds was established, leading to the identification of an androstane-triol derivative, BA59. The immunomodulatory activity of BA59 was evaluated using in vitro T cell differentiation assays, antigen-presenting cell phenotyping, and ex vivo immune profiling. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in mice with established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Flow cytometry was used to characterize peripheral and central nervous system immune populations, including effector T cells, regulatory T cells, and antigen-presenting cells. Disease progression was monitored using clinical scoring and cumulative disease burden analyses.\n\nResultsBA59 treatment significantly attenuated disease severity and cumulative disease burden when administered therapeutically after disease onset.\n\nImmunophenotyping revealed a reduction in pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cells accompanied by an increase in regulatory T cells expressing the ectonucleotidase CD39. BA59 also reprogrammed antigen-presenting cells toward a tolerogenic phenotype, characterized by enhanced programmed death-ligand 1 expression.

Furthermore, EMPA reduced DOX-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and myocardial injury. Through functional analysis overlapping DIC- and EMPA-regulated genes, we identified the involvement of JNK signaling in addition to redox pathways. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that EMPA restored redox homeostasis by inhibiting JNK activation, reactivating NRF2 and its downstream antioxidant proteins HO-1, NQO1, GPX4, and SOD2 both in vivo and in vitro. These protective effects were abolished by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 or the JNK activator anisomycin.

While gene amplifications and regulatory mutations commonly drive this overexpression, these pumps remain transcriptionally inactive under normal cellular conditions due to their high energetic cost, making it challenging to assess their full impact on resistance evolution and the maximum attainable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To delineate the extent and spectrum of efflux-based resistance, we subjected Mycobacterium smegmatis mc{superscript 2}155(Msm) wild-type and efflux pump-deleted strains ({Delta}lfrA and {Delta}efpA) to adaptive laboratory evolution in the presence of a broad-spectrum efflux substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Despite prolonged selection, resistance plateaued at 8-16x MIC, revealing an intrinsic ceiling to efflux-based adaptation. Evolved populations integrated multiple layers of adaptation: enhanced efflux kinetics, reduced intracellular EtBr accumulation, and mutations spanning global regulators, ribosomal genes, and membrane components. Notably, deletion of specific pumps ({Delta}lfrA) triggered compensatory upregulation of alternative efflux systems, highlighting functional redundancy. Beyond efflux activation, evolved strains exhibited metabolic reprogramming, including downregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and upregulation of lipid biosynthesis and {beta}-oxidation, which altered NAD/NADH homeostasis and membrane potential. Extending this adaptive evolution approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb) demonstrated that these adaptive constraints and metabolic alterations are conserved across mycobacterial species. Together, these results uncover fundamental limits to efflux evolution and reveal how bacteria integrate regulatory and metabolic plasticity to maximize drug resistance. Targeting these interconnected networks may offer a powerful strategy to contain the rise of multidrug resistance.\n\nImportanceEfflux pumps are widely recognized as major contributors to antimicrobial resistance; however, the extent to which resistance can be driven solely by efflux remains unclear. Here, we define the limits of efflux-mediated resistance using adaptive laboratory evolution to ethidium bromide in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that resistance reproducibly plateaus despite continued selection and the presence of multiple efflux pumps in the genome, indicating a physiological ceiling to efflux-based adaptation. This limit is achieved through distinct evolutionary trajectories involving regulatory mutations that converge on enhanced efflux activity. Importantly, upregulation of efflux pumps is coupled to extensive cellular remodelling, including metabolic rewiring, and changes in membrane energetics, revealing system-wide trade-offs associated with resistance. Together, our findings demonstrate that efflux-driven resistance is constrained by cellular physiology and shaped by global adaptive costs, thereby refining current models of antimicrobial resistance and identifying vulnerabilities that may be exploited to limit the evolution of resistance.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 {+/-}3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 {+/-}1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening.

When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus.

Here we show that CO2 sensory information in Drosophila, intrinsically aversive but modified by attractive food signals, diverges from the canonical glomerular channel already in the antennal lobe via the polarized local interneuron LN23. LN23 relays sensory input via an extraglomerular CO2 pathway and manipulation of LN23 activity revealed a dominant role in CO2-induced avoidance behavior. The extraglomerular CO2 pathway projects to the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) adjacent to the canonical Lateral Horn (LH) olfactory processing center and segregates into anatomically distinct valence channels. Connectome data together with functional characterization showed the convergence of parallel CO2 channels onto two interconnected 3rd order neurons which integrate additional sensory modalities via distinct mechanisms: while the glomerular CO2 pathway converge with food relay neurons onto separated dendritic domains of the PD5 interneuron in the LH, the extraglomerular pathways integrating CO2 information with antennal humidity and temperature modalities establish antagonistic inputs onto the PLP interneuron PV9.

Consequently, a {Delta}divIVA mutant forms elongated chains of unseparated daughter cells, which may explain its attenuated virulence. To further explore the role of cell chaining for attenuation, we here investigated how different morphological aberrations affect the virulence of L. monocytogenes. To this end, we generated coccoid mreB and filamentous ezrA mutants, and compared them to the {Delta}divIVA mutant in different in vitro infection assays. Coccoid or filamentous morphologies did not impair host cell invasion or intracellular replication, unlike cell chaining of the {Delta}divIVA mutant. Introduction of a hyperactive allele of the PrfA virulence regulator, resulting in constitutive overexpression of virulence genes, was sufficient to restore the invasion defect of the {Delta}divIVA mutant, despite its pronounced cell chaining phenotype, but did not recover intracellular replication. We isolated suppressors of the {Delta}divIVA mutant carrying mutations in secA2, which likely enhance the SecA2 ATPase activity. In these suppressors, autolysin secretion, daughter cell separation, and invasion were fully restored, and intracellular replication was partially recovered. Thus, maintaining normal rod-shaped morphology plays a minor role in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis. Instead, virulence attenuation in the {Delta}divIVA mutant is better explained by distortions in PrfA- and SecA2-dependent processes.\n\nAuthor SummaryListeria monocytogenes infects humans by entering host cells, replicating intracellularly, and spreading from infected cells to neighboring cells. The bacterium is rod-shaped and normally occurs as single or double cells that can efficiently complete all stages of infection. However, a class of virulence-attenuated L. monocytogenes mutants forms long cell chains, suggesting a link between cell morphology and virulence. One such mutant lacks the cell division protein DivIVA and is severely impaired in infection, as it neither invades host cells, replicates in the cytoplasm nor spreads from cell to cell. To determine whether virulence attenuation is caused by cell chaining itself or by additional functional defects, we compared the virulence of the divIVA mutant with that of mutants exhibiting other morphological abnormalities. In addition, we isolated suppressor mutations that restore normal cell separation in the divIVA mutant and examined their effects on virulence. Our results show that cell morphology per se does not generally determine listerial virulence. Instead, they indicate that specific virulence-related functions are impaired in chain-forming L. monocytogenes mutants. These findings advance our understanding of the virulence defects associated with cell chaining and provide a basis for identifying their real underlying molecular causes.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

We discovered coronavirus N proteins initiate cAMP-ADCY10-PKA cascade. Cytoplasmic PKA activates STAT1 independently of canonical JAK/TYR2 signaling. Coronavirus N proteins, via a conserved arginine (e.g., PEDV R58, SARS-CoV-2 R92), directly bind and sequester PKA C into the nucleus to evade STAT1 activation. Using PEDV as a model, mutant viruses with NmutNLS and NR58A were generated. Wildtype PEDV infection suppressed STAT1 activation in cells expressing PKA C/PKA CS339A deficient in STAT1 phosphorylation. However, in rXS0101mutNLS- or rXS0101R58A-infected cells, only PKA CS339A expression inhibited STAT1 activation. Downregulation of STAT1 activation is accompanied with increased viral replication. This study first elaborates that PKA C activates STAT1 in the cytoplasm of infected cells distinctly from canonical JAK/STAT1 signaling, while coronaviruses evade this antiviral response by sequestering PKA C into the nucleus via direct N protein interaction.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

In many rod-shaped bacteria, synthesis of PG along the cell cylinder is organized by the elongasome, also called the Rod complex, which consists of six highly conserved proteins, including the actin-like MreB, the PG synthase complex RodA-PBP2 and three regulatory membrane proteins, MreC, MreD and RodZ. However, how these proteins interact with each other to form the elongasome and synthesize lateral PG remains elusive. In this study, by characterizing MreC mutations affecting elongasome activity in Escherichia coli, we provide evidence that MreC alternates between an active and an inactive state and these mutations affect MreC interaction with PBP2. We also find that RodZ interacts with MreC via a periplasmic region and disruption of this interaction compromises elongasome function. Additionally, we show that the cytoplasmic region of RodZ, which interacts with MreB, work synergistically with activating MreC mutations to promote rod shape formation. These results indicate that RodZ activates the elongasome by initiating two signaling cascades, one in the periplasm via MreCD, and another in the cytoplasm through MreB. This role of RodZ in regulating elongasome activity is analogous to that of FtsN in activating the divisome, suggesting that the mechanisms governing the activation of PG synthesis in cell elongation and division are similar in E. coli.\n\nImportanceThe elongasome, or Rod complex, mediates lateral peptidoglycan synthesis during cell elongation in many rod-shaped bacteria. It consists of the cytoskeletal protein MreB, the peptidoglycan synthase RodA-PBP2, and three regulatory proteins MreCD and RodZ. Although it has been extensively studied, how its activity is controlled remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal the roles of MreCD and RodZ in regulating elongasome activity in Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that RodZ triggers lateral peptidoglycan synthesis by interacting with MreB in the cytoplasm and MreCD in the periplasm. These interactions likely switch MreBCD to the active state such that they can stimulate the activity of the RodA-PBP2 complex. This regulatory mechanism resembles the activation mechanism of the divisome that mediates septal peptidoglycan synthesis.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Sampling designs revealed up to 27-fold, 6-fold and 15-fold differences in biodiversity estimates for animals, bacteria and fungi, respectively. Taxonomic coverage depended mostly on the number of subsamples but not sampling area within the 347-1790 m2, 428-1924 m2, 327-1790 m2 plot size range for animals, bacteria and fungi, respectively. Additional sampling of subsoil did not add significantly to diversity estimates of animals and fungi, although there was a slight positive effect on bacteria. Both soil pooling (compositing subsamples before DNA extraction) and DNA pooling (combining DNA extracts prior to PCR) reduced differences between sampling designs by decreasing diversity estimates in designs with many subsamples while increasing them in designs with fewer subsamples. However, pooling did not eliminate the influence of sampling factors (soil depth, sampling area and sample size). DNA pooling outperformed soil pooling in inventorying animals and fungi but not bacteria. Pooling had no effect on recovering rare biological species or sequencing artefacts. Soil pooling saved from 79.5% to 98.3% of labour and analytical costs compared with no pooling, depending on the number of pooled subsamples.

We identified two prefusion S2 conformations, compact and loose, that interconvert reversibly by temperature, revealing intrinsic S2 \"breathing\" on virions.

Here, we establish an in vivo CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) platform that leverages bacterial gene fitness profiles as a high-resolution functional reporter to define the molecular niche and selective forces encountered by E. coli within mice harboring a defined minimal microbial community (OligoMM12). Our investigation revealed that dietary regimens profoundly reshape E. colis metabolic landscape and that the profile of essential genes help identify cross-feeding interactions. Comparative screens across a laboratory strain (MG1655), a Uropathogenic, and Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC), identify distinct genetic requirements for intestinal colonization, highlighting divergent motility, stress response, and respiration strategies. In a host inflammatory environment, we find that the AIEC strain LF82 alters its colonization pattern, shifting towards the small intestine, and adapts to the inflammatory environment by remodeling its metabolism and stress responses. Notably, we uncover a critical role for mobile genetic elements, with the observation that inflammation triggers the induction of the Gally prophage which is beneficial for fitness in the healthy gut but becomes detrimental during inflammation.

These compartments are carved through subversion of host intracellular trafficking pathways to modulate the composition of the vacuolar membrane. Although recycling-associated small Rab GTPases are frequently observed at infection sites, their role in membrane remodeling and cargo sorting has remained poorly understood. Here, we leverage the extensive early membrane remodeling occurring during Salmonella infection to dissect this process. Using endogenously tagged cell lines, we characterize the dynamics of the recycling small GTPases Rab14 and Rab11 at Salmonella intracellular infection sites. We report that Rab14 recruits its effector Rufy1, which mediates sorting of CI-M6PR through recycling tubules. Subsequently, Rab11 disperses the newly formed recycling endosomes by interacting with its effector Fip3 for retrograde transport. This pathway is controlled by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP32, which targets both Rab14 and Rab11, enhancing their interactions with Rufy1 and Fip3, respectively. We further show that USP32 is recruited to the infection site via local enrichment of phosphatidylserine-positive membranes, a process triggered by the Salmonella effector proteins SopE/E2. Importantly, silencing USP32 significantly impairs intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings reveal a remarkable exploitation of host signaling and trafficking pathways by Salmonella to construct a replication-permissive niche.

Here, we show that iridosomes represent a previously unrecognized subtype of LROs. Using transcriptomic profiling of zebrafish iridophores, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we define the molecular program underlying iridosome biogenesis. Iridosomes have evolved unique adaptations for crystal growth while retaining core features of other LROs. Key regulators, including RAB32a, AP3M2, and HPS5, are essential for crystal formation, with gene knockouts causing reduced crystal number, altered morphology, and distinct maturation defects. We further identify hallmark LRO features in iridosomes, including intraluminal vesicles and pH-regulated developmental transitions. Cross-species transcriptomic analysis confirms that iridosomes share an LRO signature across vertebrates, including teleost fish and reptiles, suggesting ancient evolutionary origins.

This study analyses the spatiotemporal expansion and environmental drivers of four invasive freshwater molluscs (Physella acuta, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Corbicula fluminea and Dreissena polymorpha) across the Catalan River Basin District. Species occurrence data were compiled from regional and global biodiversity databases and long-term bio-monitoring programmes, harmonised and aggregated into a 10 x 10 km grid. Temporal trends in cumulative occupancy were used to quantify expansion rates, while Generalized Linear Models were applied to identify key environmental and anthropogenic correlates of species occurrence. Gastropods (P. acuta and P. antipodarum) exhibited rapid and extensive range expansion since the mid-2000s, whereas bivalves showed limited or negligible spread. Expansion patterns were partly influenced by increased sampling effort following the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. Species distributions were consistently associated with low-altitude, low-slope river reaches subject to high anthropogenic pressure. Physella acuta was strongly linked to degraded lowland habitats, C. fluminea to large, hydrologically stable river sections, and P. antipodarum was primarily constrained by channel slope.

Invertebrate phyla that receive the most attention are Mollusca, Cnidaria, and Arthropoda. The results demonstrate that invertebrate FAXC proteins have structural homology to vertebrate and invertebrate metaxin proteins. However, pairwise alignments of amino acid sequences revealed only low percentages of amino acid identities, indicating that FAXC and metaxin proteins are distinct categories of proteins. Among the important criteria in identifying invertebrate FAXC proteins as metaxin-like was the presence of conserved protein domains: GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37. Another metaxin-like feature found with invertebrate FAXC proteins is a characteristic pattern of -helical and {beta}-strand segments. The four {beta}-strand segments form, in three dimensions, a planar {beta}-sheet motif that is a distinguishing characteristic of FAXC and metaxin proteins. Evolutionary relationships between FAXCs and metaxins were uncovered by phylogenetic analysis. Distinct but related evolutionary groups were found for invertebrate FAXCs and metaxins, as well as vertebrate FAXCs and metaxins. Invertebrate species can have multiple FAXC genes, and more than ten FAXC genes is not uncommon. The genes that are adjacent to different FAXC genes in the same invertebrate are typically not the same. Therefore, the genomic regions are generally not highly conserved for multiple FAXC genes. But, for invertebrates with a single FAXC gene, the same neighboring genes may be found for the FAXC genes of different but taxonomically related invertebrates. Honey bees and bumblebees are examples.

Several lines of evidence implicate the acetyl-CoA pathway as the most ancient pathway of CO2 fixation, most notably recent findings that the overall reaction of the enzymatic pathway from H2 (E0' = -414 mV) and CO2 to pyruvate can be replaced by Ni0 alone in water as the lone catalyst. Here we studied the ability of Ni0 to serve as catalyst and reductant for nonenzymatic redox reactions that require only a mild reductant, as the midpoint potential of Ni0 oxidation to Ni2+ is E0' = -260 mV. We show that Ni0 in water can convert 2-oxo acids to 2-hydroxy acids and, in the presence of NH3, to amino acids at 25-100C without addition of H2, and that it will function as catalyst and reductant for the fumarate reductase reaction.

Thereby, they are responsible for CO2 fixation and dioxygen production, which are essential for living species on Earth. To ensure these processes, numerous proteins encoded from the nuclear DNA need to be imported inside the chloroplast, and eventually to the thylakoids. Whereas the translocation systems from both chloroplastic and thylakoids membranes have been studied in recent years, the stromal route between these two membranes is largely unknown. Notably, the chloroplastic HSP90 (HSP90C) is likely to play an important role in this process, but its structure and molecular mechanisms remain to be unveiled. In this study, we used a combination of structural and biophysical approaches to elucidate the features of Arabidopsis thalianas HSP90C. Principally, we found that HSP90C has a remarkably high ATPase activity among the HSP90 family proteins. Further investigation allowed us to pinpoint atypical mechanisms responsible for this high activity. First, the N-terminal cap is involved in a disulfide bond that accelerates the ATPase activity of HSP90C. Second, its C-terminal domain features an extension that is mandatory for its dimerization. Third, our crystal structures reveal a wide opening of the HSP90Cs dimer with reduced intermonomeric interfaces. Lastly, we identified a helical switch which is required for HSP90Cs high activity.

However, the mechanisms by which this opportunistic pathogen causes disseminated infections remain poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, 22 strain pairs of Klebsiella spp. were sequentially isolated from rectal swabs and blood samples of ICU patients. All strains adhered to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, but failed to invade or disrupt epithelial barrier integrity. Few phenotypic differences between strains of the same pair were observed regarding their biofilm-forming capacities and ampicillin resistance. Whole genome sequencing of five pairs showed diverse sequence types, the presence of numerous antibiotics resistance genes but few virulence genes. Pairwise comparison of genomic sequences of blood and fecal isolates evidenced a few single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions-deletions, mostly affecting genes involved in biosynthesis of surface structures (such as capsules, pili). Most genetic changes were driven by horizontal gene transfer events, with the notable acquisition of a plasmid that enhanced bacterial fitness by eliminating competitors. In addition, some blood isolates had reduced the number of antibiotic resistance genes, underscoring the high plasticity of the Klebsiella resistome. Finally, one bloodstream isolate carried a mutS mutation, conferring a hypermutator phenotype that could increase evolvability despite the fitness burden. Together, these findings indicate that within-host genetic adaptations, rather than the acquisition of virulence traits, can enhance the colonization, competitiveness and ultimately the ability of K. pneumoniae to cause invasive infections.\n\nImportanceKlebsiella commonly colonizes the human gut, and this carriage can progress to infections, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. To better understand the in vivo evolution, genetically associated Klebsiella strains isolated from the feces and blood of ICU patients were analyzed. Although strains were able to adhere to intestinal cells, none could invade or damage the intestinal barrier. Genomic comparisons of pairs strains showed limited genetic differences, mostly mutations affecting surface structures. Frequent horizontal gene transfer events were observed, which could improve bacterial competitiveness and permits a remarkably flexible resistome. Overall, this study shows that within-host evolution, rather than the gain of virulence traits, can enhance the ability of Klebsiella to persist, outcompete other bacteria, and ultimately cause infections.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The current panzootic with H5 clade 2.3.4.4b has caused numerous, widespread outbreaks in various domestic and wild avian species with high mortalities, massive losses and a high frequency of spillover events to unexpected novel mammalian hosts such as dairy cows. The global H5N1 situation raises serious concerns about zoonotic risks due to effective mammal-to-mammal transmission. Therefore, it is critical to increase surveillance intensity of a broadened species range, particularly at the human-animal interface. For this purpose, reliable and cost-effective serological tools that are easy to perform and suitable for high-throughput screenings are critically needed. The newly developed double antigen ELISA format employing a luminescence-based detection technology has demonstrated to comply with such prerequisites. The assay allowed the detection of H5-specific antibodies even early after infection or vaccination in a wide range of birds and mammals including humans. It further demonstrated superior analytical sensitivity and high specificity for antibodies directed against H5 hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4b as no cross-reactivity with other hemagglutinin subtypes was observed.

Despite some recent progress, the lack of well-established genetic manipulation methods for diverse research applications remains a challenge. We recently reported the establishment of targeted mutagenesis methods to disrupt genes in Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species. Many essential genes in Ehrlichia chaffeensis are likely refractory to targeted mutagenesis, thus we developed a novel targeted mutational approach leading to the expression of antisense RNA to facilitate the knockdown of p28-Omp19 protein expression from ECH_1143. This gene was selected as its encoded protein is among the highly immunogenic proteins of E. chaffeensis and is likely essential for the pathogen. This method involved introducing a mutation at a distal genomic location within the E. chaffeensis genome to allow for generation of a 209 nucleotide-long antisense RNA segment complementary to ECH_1143 coding mRNA from the same gene promoter which was duplicated as part of the mutagenesis. The mutational strategy was designed to retain the surrounding genomic regions unaltered. The antisense knockdown version of E. chaffeensis resulted in a reduction of p28-Omp19 expression when compared to wild-type E. chaffeensis during its replication in a macrophage cell line, where the gene expression is known to occur. We anticipate that the antisense mutational strategy will be broadly applicable to facilitate investigating essential genes of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

As land-use change accelerates habitat loss and fragmentation, there is an urgent need to identify priority areas for conserving habitat and maintaining connectivity.\n\nObjectivesWe develop a unified spatial prioritization framework for functional connectivity that is grounded in metapopulation theory, accommodates species-specific movement behavior, and captures the dual role of landscape units as both habitat providers and connectivity facilitators.\n\nMethodsWe formalize the landscape as a network in which nodes represent spatial units characterized by habitat quality and edges encode permeability for movement. Pairwise ecological proximities are defined from species-specific movement capacity and an ecological distance that integrates costs across paths, expressed as least-cost distance, effective resistance, expected cost, or survival probability depending on the movement ecology of the focal species. From these proximities and node qualities, we construct the landscape matrix. Based on the sensitivity of the landscape matrix to local perturbations in habitat quality or permeability, we develop a prioritization approach that identifies where local changes most strongly influence landscape-scale habitat connectivity.\n\nResultsOur framework unifies widely used landscape connectivity metrics across the full spectrum of movement models, including least-cost paths, circuit theory, spatial absorbing Markov chains, and randomized shortest paths. We show that summation-based metrics serve as computationally efficient approximations of metapopulation capacity, enabling evaluation of functional connectivity in large, high-resolution landscapes. We derive sensitivities for these metrics with respect to habitat quality and permeability and show that they correspond to two families of centrality measures: a closeness-like centrality reflecting the influence of habitat quality, and a betweenness-like centrality reflecting the influence of habitat permeability. Applying our prioritization approach based on these sensitivities to a case study involving wild reindeer in Norway, we identify high-value habitat and key movement corridors that closely align with a reference node-removal approach while reducing computation time by several orders of magnitude.\n\nConclusionsBy linking metapopulation theory with sensitivity analysis, our work provides a unified and scalable framework for spatial prioritization of functional connectivity.

Among the set of T2D SNPs, linking causal genome variants to disease risk experimentally has remained a challenge; however, advances in synthetic mammalian genome writing techniques now enable the delivery of multiple haplotypes to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to create a series of isogenic cell lines that can be differentiated and phenotyped in vitro. Here, to begin efforts in dissecting a T2D GWAS locus, we engineered an NKX6-3/ANK1 gene cluster knockout hiPSC line and introduced a landing pad facilitating the delivery of synthetic haplotype payloads. We built four haplotypes, including several that are not observed in nature, containing risk SNPs spanning the NKX6-3/ANK1 gene cluster using a method called variant Switching Auxotrophic markers for Integration (vSwAP-In), and integrated them precisely into hiPSCs. NKX6-3/ANK1 deletion blocked pancreatic progenitor and skeletal muscle differentiation, suggesting that NKX6-3 and ANK1 are required for early pancreatic and skeletal muscle development, and perhaps related to the existence of two nonoverlapping sets of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium that associate with the expression of the two adjacent genes. When NKX6-3/ANK1 T2D Risk haplotypes were reintroduced, skeletal muscle and pancreatic progenitor differentiation capabilities were restored. ANK1 expression was elevated in the ANK1 Risk and All-Risk haplotypes compared to the NKX6-3 Risk and Non-Risk haplotypes, establishing a functional experimental platform to examine risk SNP clusters in their native contexts.

Current approaches either assume missing populations have reference allele fixation (naive zero-imputation) or restrict analyses to observed populations (missingness-aware), but the clinical impact of these methodological choices remains unquantified.\n\nMethodsWe compared naive and missingness-aware differentiation metrics across 72,915 variants in 17 African-relevant disease genes with documented selection or clinical significance, using 10-population data from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. Genome-wide validation employed 1,102,375 chromosome 22 variants with complete 26-population coverage. Population differentiation was quantified as maximum absolute reference allele frequency difference (max--{Delta}p--). High-differentiation variants (max--{Delta}p-- [&ge;] 0.5) were compared between disease genes and chromosomal background using Fishers exact tests with bootstrap confidence intervals.\n\nResultsMethods showed high overall correlation (Spearman{rho} = 0.9969) with only 0.71% disagreement (518/72,915 variants), concentrated among variants with incomplete population coverage. However, 350 variants (0.48%) exceeded the high-differentiation threshold, including well-characterized ancestry-informative markers under documented selection. Disease genes showed 4.75- fold depletion of highly differentiated variants relative to genome-wide background (Fishers exact test OR = 0.210, 95% CI [0.188, 0.233], p < 10-316), indicating that functional constraint limits frequency divergence except at sites under positive selection.

A significant alteration in subchondral bone is the development of aberrant blood vessels, particularly H-type vessels. H-type arteries are essential for preserving subchondral bone homeostasis. They support nutrients and oxygen to bone tissue and eliminate waste, thereby supporting the metabolic activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

To determine whether HDF metrics derived from high-resolution murine echocardiography can sensitively track cardiac dysfunction and predict functional recovery, male mice (n = 8) underwent serial echocardiography at baseline, after transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and four weeks after aortic debanding (deTAC). Left ventricular function and interval-specific HDF components were quantified, including longitudinal and transverse forces over predefined systolic and diastolic windows.

Cytotoxic and helper lymphocyte populations, particularly naive, central memory, and effector memory CD8 T cells, showed extensive crosstalk with monocytes and NK cells, reflecting coordinated cytokine production and cytotoxic activation. Early B cell activation was evident through increased immunoglobulin gene expression. Innate sensing pathways, including RIG-I and Toll-like signaling, were activated across NK, T, and B cell subsets, while also demonstrating enrichment of antigen processing and apoptosis programs.

In low-prevalence and light-intensity STH settings, quantitative PCR (qPCR) has higher sensitivity and specificity for detection. For qPCR to accurately identify transmissible infections of public health significance, it is essential to interpret the qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) results. As part of the DeWorm3 community-based cluster randomized trial on interrupting STH transmission, we conducted population-based surveys using high-throughput qPCR and aimed to establish appropriate Ct cut-offs to detect transmissible infections. Experimental approaches including egg and genome-equivalent spiking experiments were hindered by inefficient fecal DNA extraction despite optimization efforts. The Ct results for 29,980 samples (pre-intervention, cross-sectional surveys) revealed a bimodal distribution for two of the four species tested, N. americanus and A. lumbricoides. The first peak was assumed to represent transmissible infections, and the second peak to represent indeterminate or non-transmissible infections. Using a finite mixture model, we defined true qPCR positivity as any Ct result with a [&ge;]5% chance of belonging to the first peak. This approach yielded Ct cut-offs of 34.4398 for N. americanus and 28.57587 for A. lumbricoides. For hookworms, sensitivity of qPCR was 96.7%, compared to 73.2% for Kato-Katz and moderate- to heavy-intensity infections (median Ct: 19.1, interquartile range [IQR]: 17.9-19.8) were differentiated from light-intensity infections and Kato-Katz negative samples (25.3, IQR: 22.5-27.9).

When qPCR is used to assess interventions, or, in the future, to potentially make programmatic decisions, it will be crucial to validate positivity criteria to avoid underestimation (false negatives) or overestimation (false positives) of results.\n\nAs part of the DeWorm3 trial, a community-based cluster randomized trial on interrupting transmission of STH, we developed and applied a validated STH qPCR to test 29,980 samples collected pre-intervention and explored experimental approaches to establish assay-specific Ct cut-offs. The Ct values from these samples showed a bimodal distribution for N. americanus and A. lumbricoides, suggesting the presence of two distinct groups. For this reason, a statistical approach with a finite mixture model was employed to determine Ct cut-offs that differentiated epidemiologically relevant, transmissible, egg-positive STH infections from those that are likely to represent detection of non-transmissible DNA or indeterminate results. While our data were applied in three different country settings, India, Benin and Malawi, it is important to note that no single Ct cut-off may be applicable across all epidemiological scenarios.

Here we examined the different fitness components of rhizobial symbionts of the legume plant Mimosa pudica across the multiple stages of their symbiotic life cycle. By comparing rhizobial symbiotic fitness in single and pairwise inoculations, we found that inter-bacterial interactions causing significant fitness effects are common, transitive and can have major consequences, sometimes leading to the extinction of a strain. These interactions predominantly occur at the root infection (nodulation) step, but smaller post-infection interaction effects, involving yet uncharacterized mechanisms, were also detected. Furthermore, considering pairwise interactions was sufficient to predict fitness ranks in more complex rhizobial communities consisting of 6 or 8 strains, indicating that higher-order interaction effects do not play a significant role in these communities.

Although macrofaunal communities in seagrass habitats are well studied, the structure and function of bacteria/archaea and microeukaryote assemblages remains underexplored. In this study, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding (16S and 18S rRNA genes) to analyze bacteria/archaea (16S), microeukaryotes (18S raw sediment), and meiofauna (18S Ludox) communities in seagrass and bare sediment habitats across three sites along an estuarine gradient in Bodega Harbor, California. We found that microbial and microeukaryote communities were primarily structured by site as a response to the environmental gradient (e.g., sediment properties), whereas meiofauna responded more strongly to the presence of seagrass. Beta diversity showed strong differentiation among estuarine sites, while alpha diversity varied within sites, with bare sediments often displaying higher diversity. Network analysis revealed significant co-occurrences between bacteria and nematodes, including chemosynthetic symbiont-bearing lineages in mudflats and stress-tolerant bioindicators. Our findings underscore the importance of environmental gradients and microhabitat features in shaping benthic biodiversity in temperate seagrass ecosystems. Furthermore, it highlights potential microbial-nematode associations, likely a response to environmental variation. By integrating multiple benthic components, our study advances understanding of biodiversity drivers in temperate estuarine seagrass habitats and provides new insights on microbial community structure in these ecosystems.\n\nImportanceSeagrass meadows, which sustain a wide variety of plant and animal life, are vital coastal habitats. These submerged ecosystems support biodiversity, protection of coasts, nitrogen cycling, and carbon storage. However, they are declining due to pressures from climate change and human activity. This study characterizes the microbial and microeukaryote communities, including meiofauna, that inhabit and surround temperate seagrass meadows. By analyzing these communities across different areas of Bodega Harbor, California, we demonstrate how seagrass and environmental factors affect the resilience and overall health of the ecosystem. Our findings highlight the importance of seagrass in maintaining biodiversity and suggest that microscale interactions and habitat variation are important factors shaping these temperate coastal ecosystems. A comprehensive understanding of the variation within benthic communities associated with seagrass habitats can significantly enhance conservation and restoration efforts for seagrass meadows..", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

However, this is usually implemented in a homogeneous population without stratifying by sex. Previous work indicates sex-based selection at numerous autosomal loci in cohorts with active recruitment. Sex chromosome sequences can also interfere with autosomal SNPs. We examined genome-wide sex-specific HWE deviations across populations in the telomere-to-telomere (T2Tv2)-aligned high-coverage whole genome sequence of the 1000 Genomes Project data of 2,490 individuals. Our analysis was restricted to bi-allelic SNPs with non-missing genotypes and MAF>=5% in both sexes of the five super-populations. We employed a robust allele-based approach for HWE testing, which enabled the quantification of directional deviations from HWE. A second-order omnibus meta-analysis combining results from the five super-populations and both sexes revealed that 0.9% autosomal SNPs exhibited a significant deviation from HWE at p<5e-8. Most of these deviations were found to be associated with genomic features relating to poor sequence quality. Filtering results to reliable genomic regions yielded 255 autosomal and 1 NPR X chromosomal SNPs, of which 140 autosomal SNPs also showed significant heterogeneity across populations but not across sexes. 8 SNPs in a 15-bp region on chr14 showed excess heterozygosity in both sexes of the AFR (African) super-population. We also generated a well-performing multivariate predictor of HWD (deviation from HWE) using multiple sequence features, which could be combined with HWD estimates in future studies to select SNPs that deviate from HWE due to technical rather than biological reasons.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe conducted a specific quality control test, which compares the observed and expected genotype counts, on an updated version of the 1000 Genomes Project whole genome sequence data generated on [~]2500 individuals. We first performed this analysis by grouping the data by ancestry and sex. We then combined and contrasted the group results. We found that most regions that differed between observed and expected counts overlapped regions of the genome which are difficult to sequence using current short read technology. In the remaining regions we found an interesting cluster of SNPs in a single ancestry, where there is a gross excess of heterozygous genotypes. GWASes typically use a standard strict threshold for this quality control test for genotyping arrays to remove SNPs. Here we suggest a more nuanced approach that is applicable to whole genome sequence data.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The ability to accurately measure TF activity is essential to understanding how TFs respond to signals and regulate target genes. In one commonly used approach, activities of TFs are computationally inferred from genome-wide chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq). However, it has remained unclear how well these inferences reflect actual regulatory activity of TFs. An alternative approach employs a collection of synthetic reporters that are designed to each probe the regulatory activity of a single TF. In this study, we systematically compared TF activities as inferred by ATAC-seq with those measured by multiplexed reporters, across diverse perturbations known to alter specific TF activities. We observed considerable overlap between the two methods, but also notable discrepancies.

However, in Oncology departments and low-resource settings, it is not routine to include a calibration phantom within the scanning protocol. Therefore, retrospective scan datasets are challenging to calibrate for biomechanical investigations, precluding detailed measurements of material and mechanical properties. In this study, we compared the results from a phantomless calibration technique, where the density within each scan was independently calibrated based on known tissue densities captured within each scan (e.g. air), with those from a traditional inline phantom calibration. To do so we used scans from a cohort of healthy volunteers from the control arm of a clinical trial dataset (ANTELOPE) in which inline calibration phantoms were included. We found that, when selecting air and the aorta as regions for calibration within individual CT scans, a strong individual-specific correlation existed between bone mineral density measured in the phantomless and phantom calibrations. This indicates that the phantomless calibration method can be a useful and reliable tool for quantifying the densitometric material properties of healthy human vertebrae, and provides the opportunity for further analysis of spinal CT scans in either retrospective datasets or in low-resource clinical settings.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Accurate prediction of TCR-pMHC interactions holds significant promise for advancing cancer immunotherapy, vaccine design, and autoimmune disease research. However, existing approaches often treat the sequences, structures, and functions of TCRs, peptides, and MHC molecules in isolation, neglecting their interdependencies and hence limiting the prediction accuracy. In this study, we present ProTCR, a novel approach that integrates sequence, structural, and functional information within a reinforcement learning framework, offering a new paradigm for predicting TCR-pMHC binding. The reinforcement learning optimization enables ProTCR to generate TCR-pMHC sequences with enhanced binding propensity, thereby improving prediction accuracy. On benchmark datasets such as IEDB and VDJdb, ProTCR achieves an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 32.7%, while offering interpretable insights into the structural and sequence determinants of binding. We further validate ProTCR using TCRs and neoantigens derived from a cervical cancer patient via proteogenomic profiling. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between T cell clonal expansion and ProTCR-predicted TCR-peptide binding scores, supporting the biological relevance of the model. Additionally, ProTCR demonstrates robust performance in predicting SARS-CoV-2 TCR-pMHC complexes and generating MHC-specific peptides with potential applications in peptide-based immunotherapies.

Here we used longitudinal one-photon calcium imaging in mice to compare dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) across repeated unsignaled foot-shocks and fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Both regions contained relatively stable ensembles that responded robustly to shocks, indicating shared encoding of acute nociceptive events. However, only the RSC flexibly re-organized its population activity when shocks were preceded by predictive cues. These anticipatory dynamics in the RSC predicted the rate of fear learning across individuals and subsequent extinction. By contrast, the ACC maintained shock-responsive ensembles with limited cue modulation. Instead, its dynamics encoded decisions to freeze, aligning with its role in encoding ongoing nociception and driving immediate defensive behavior. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which the ACC emphasizes ongoing nociceptive processing, while the RSC transforms sensory signals into predictive codes that shape learning and memory. This specialization highlights how distributed cortical computations cooperate to generate the adaptive value of aversion. More broadly, our findings suggest that these regions assume complementary roles to address immediate sensory-motivational responses while flexibly reconfiguring to support long-term behavioral adaptation.\n\nSignificance statementPain engages widespread cortical circuits, yet how distinct cingulate subregions collaborate to shape its experience and utility remains unknown.

Our previous work showed that persistent interaction between the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, KIBRA, and the autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is crucial for maintaining synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory for at least a month. This duration is longer than the lifespans of individual KIBRA and PKM{zeta} molecules. Biophysical modeling of the interaction suggests oligomers of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} dimers, but not individual dimers or monomers, can overcome molecular turnover by continually incorporating newly synthesized KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, replacing those that have degraded. Here we used AlphaFold 3 to predict the structures of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} heterodimers and heterohexamers and to examine the sites of action of two structurally distinct inhibitors of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interaction that disrupt established late-LTP and long-term memory. The structures predict that the peptide K-ZAP blocks formation of heterodimers, whereas the small molecule {zeta}-stat prevents PKM{zeta} of one heterodimer from binding a second KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, essential for forming larger oligomeric structures. We show that {zeta}-stat, like K-ZAP, disrupts 1-month-old spatial memory. Thus, continual formation of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} oligomers can be a core molecular mechanism driving the persistence of long-term memory in the face of molecular turnover.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

We find that Kcnb1, integrins, and the leptin receptor (LepR) co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in cortical neurons. Perinatal leptin supplementation in Null mice improves cognition, corrects cortical anatomy, and restores neuronal migration, dendritic arborization, and synaptic functionality. In primary Null cortical neurons, leptin normalizes dendritic growth and actin remodeling via integrin-dependent mechanisms.

Concurrently with a growth in studies on this topic, there has been a rise in interest on dynamics (approximately second-to-second changes) in brain networks within scan sessions. While analyses of traditional static networks have increasingly grown towards emphasizing the importance of individual differences in brain network topology, studies of dynamic networks typically follow methodology that require brain states to be considered at a group level. Recent studies have begun to assess the individuality of recurring dynamic brain \"states\". In this work, we extend this recent work by exploring the extent to which functional connectivity fingerprinting is feasible at single-frame temporal resolution. We estimate connectivity at individual volumes using phase coherence. We find that the identity of participants can be classified based on single volumes given sufficient database scan data and that having more highly parcellated atlases facilitates identification. Finally, we find that tasks can be identified more readily within subjects than between subjects. We conclude that participant identity may be an important driver of observed single-volume connectivity patterns. Further, the single-volume neural correlates of a task appear to be more consistent within subjects than between subjects.

SM06 exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity against plant and human pathogenic fungi, including Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum, and Candida albicans. In vitro assays and micromorphological analyses revealed that SM06, an indole dimer, disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity, while in planta experiments demonstrated significant suppression of brown leaf spot disease in tomato and rice.

A Tn5 mutant insertion in the pfsI and pfsR intergenic region was previously reported to trigger the PfsI/R system. This region contains coding sequences for RsaM, a putative protein that has since been hypothesized to play a central role in imposing repression on the PfsI/R system. Putative rsaM genes/RsaM proteins negatively controlling AHL QS systems have also been reported in several other bacterial species. In the present study, we report for the first time the endogenous expression of an RsaM family protein and determine its position within the PfsI/R regulatory circuit. We found that RsaM is not produced in the wild-type P. fuscovaginae and does not play a role in keeping the PfsI/R system in a quiescent state. The expression of RsaM is instead triggered upon targeted mutations in the pfsR-rsaM intergenic region, which concomitantly activate the transcription of both the pfsI and pfsR genes. Moreover, we demonstrated that RsaM attenuates the PfsI/R circuit upon its activation. Taken together, our results evidenced that RsaM does not function as a repressor switch of the PfsI/R system, but behaves as a built-in modulator that prevents overactivation of this circuit once it is triggered.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

These SNPs attenuate EmhRs DNA-binding ability, resulting in derepression of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump EmhABC.

We now report on significant differences in their response to C16 fatty acids during growth at pH 5.5. Unsaturated palmitoleic acid C16:1 was more toxic to S. aureus, but toxicity was mitigated by saturated C16:0. Consistent with a functional fad pathway, C16:0 conferred enhanced growth to S. aureus, but not S. epidermidis. Acidic pH and C16 fatty acids stimulated SspA serine protease production in S. aureus but repressed the orthologous Esp protease in S. epidermidis. Although S. aureus biofilm formation was stimulated by acidic pH and C16:0, this effect was abrogated by 25 {micro}M C16:1 which promotes protease production, whereas S. epidermidis maintained enhanced biofilm in presence of C16:1. Exogenous C16:0 was directly incorporated into phospholipid by S. epidermidis but was extended to C18:0 and C20:0 in S. aureus prior to incorporation. This may account for differential signaling through the GraSR two component sensor, which is required for SspA production in S. aureus at acidic pH. Notably, singular graSR dependent phenotypes in S. aureus graS/R deletions were restored by S. epidermidis graS/R at acidic pH alone, whereas growth at pH 5.5 with 25 {micro}M C16:1 could only be restored with S. aureus graS/R.

Understanding how closely related Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus navigate these conditions is critical for distinguishing commensal behavior from pathogenic potential. Our research reveals that S. aureus and S. epidermidis, though genetically similar, employ markedly distinct adaptive mechanisms in response to identical skin-derived cues. Specifically, each species remodels its membrane phospholipids in unique ways under acidic pH and C16 fatty acid exposure. These environmental factors also differentially modulate their biofilm formation and protease activity.

It has been demonstrated that TTP-mediated post-transcriptional mRNA decay regulation is crucial for modulating physiological control, particularly in response to inflammatory stimulation. TTP is associated with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex through the TTP C-terminus to promote mRNA decay. However, it is not fully understood whether there are additional sites within TTP that contribute to its function through interacting with other factors. We analyzed the functionality of the unique tryptophan residues located in the TTP N-terminus using a cell-based assay system that consists of a tetracycline-responsive CMV promoter-driven, intron-inserted luciferase (LUC). This system enabled us to analyze TTP activity during both the early phase and the steady-state phase of gene expression, as well as in the post-transcriptional mRNA decay following the treatment of tetracycline analogs. Meanwhile, we identified putative TTP associates using a proximity labeling method. We found that tryptophan residues in the TTP N-terminus together with CNOT10, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, were involved specifically in the reduction of the ARE-containing LUC mRNA level during the early phase of gene expression.

However, previous research has cast doubt on the suitability of traditional molecular markers (allozymes and microsatellites) for this purpose given their weak relationship with heritability - a common measure of additive genetic variance. Recent advances in sequencing technology have since shifted focus towards nucleotide diversity and variation in functional regions, but their practicality for predicting adaptive potential remains debated and untested. Furthermore, heritability itself is a poor proxy for adaptive potential because it depends on environmental variance. We collated 2,113 published estimates of evolvability - a measure of additive genetic variance that avoids environmental confounding - across 193 eukaryotic species, and evaluated how well evolvability is predicted by molecular diversity. We find that microsatellite and nucleotide diversity are not significantly correlated to each other, and neither predict evolvability (nucleotide diversity explains 0.7% of interspecific differences in evolvability and doubling nucleotide diversity only corresponds to a 9.2% increase in evolvability). With new theoretical work, we show that such weak associations are expected. Together, our results suggest that simple molecular measures of genetic variation are insufficient for predicting adaptive potential and continued reliance on these metrics risks misinforming conservation management.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The marine snail Littorina fabalis segregates locally into dwarf and large ecotypes over wave-exposure gradients on northwestern European shores. Previous work focusing on a hybrid zone in Sweden revealed strong genetic differentiation between the ecotypes, concentrated in 12 putative chromosomal inversions. Here we compare the Swedish hybrid zone with samples from France distributed across a similar wave-exposed gradient. Our aims were to test if similar exposure gradients promote parallel ecotype distributions and hybrid zones, and if similar genomic architectures contribute to divergence and adaptation across the gradients. Unpredictably, we found that the shell size cline was reversed in France compared to Sweden, with small individuals occupying the more-sheltered end of the environmental gradient in Sweden but the more-exposed end in France. We also observed a cline in shell colour in France, whereas nearly all Swedish snails were yellow. Using whole-genome sequencing, we found similar levels of genetic differentiation between ecotypes in both places. Most of the differences were accounted for by the same 15 inversions, and the arrangement clines showed similar associations to the wave-exposure gradient in both hybrid zones. These inversions were enriched in SNPs differentiating the ecotypes that were either specific to one hybrid zone or showed reversed cline patterns between zones. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) detected significant associations between genomic regions within inversions and shell size in Sweden, while one inversion was associated with colour in France. Our results show that the same inversions play a dual role: they support ecotype differences across similar environmental gradients in distant locations, while also contribute site-specific variation contributing to local adaptation.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

While aberrant BMP hypersensitivity has been studied, how this mutation enforces a persistent pro-osteogenic state remains unclear. Here, we combined super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-Seq), and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to investigate how Acvr1R206H remodels chromatin to promote osteogenic transcriptional programs. Mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited globally decondensed chromatin and increased accessibility at developmental and osteogenic loci enriched for HOX, TEAD, and RUNX motifs. Integration of ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq data identified transcriptional networks primed for osteochondrogenic gene expression, including ossification, extracellular matrix organization, and cell adhesion pathways, consistent with enhanced BMP-SMAD and mechanotransduction activity. Time-course experiments revealed heightened responses to BMP ligands in Acvr1R206H/+ MEFs compared to wild-type, highlighting ligand hypersensitivity. Importantly, pharmacological modulation showed that chromatin alterations were dynamic and reversible: activation of Rho/ROCK in wild-type cells reproduced the mutant chromatin state, while inhibition of Rho/ROCK or BMP-SMAD signaling restored condensation to wild-type levels in mutant cells. Together, these findings establish that Acvr1R206H enforces a pro-osteogenic chromatin landscape through convergent BMP-SMAD and Rho/ROCK signaling, predisposing progenitors to aberrant differentiation trajectories.

We aimed to develop a real-time digital heart twin that allows in real-time dynamic manipulation of reentrant pathways in vitro using physiologically relevant simulations. We designed a closed-feedback loop system that couples a cultured cardiac monolayer with a two-dimensional computational simulation of cardiac tissue. The simulation, based on GPU-accelerated models (e.g., cellular automata), predicts wave propagation in real-time using the Abubu.js library. Optical mapping captures monolayer activation patterns, and simulation outputs are converted into light-based stimulation via optogenetics, using LEDs and microcontrollers to depolarize cardiac tissue. Our platform is capable of accurately detecting and responding to electrical waves in real-time, enabling interactive control of reentrant circuits. The system replaces traditional fixed-delay stimulation protocols with computationally guided interventions, better mimicking physiological conduction dynamics. This digital twin provides a novel and responsive method to study reentrant arrhythmias. Its integration of optical stimulation, real-time modeling, and tissue feedback enables the construction of user-defined reentry pathways under dynamic control.

With global increases in lifespan, the prevalence of chronic and degenerative musculoskeletal disorders, including tendon degeneration, continues to rise; however, effective interventions to counteract age-related decline remain limited. Here, we investigate how a central age-associated stressor, inflammation, differentially modulates tendon cell behavior derived from young and mature-aged donors. Using super-resolution microscopy to resolve nanoscale chromatin organization in conjunction with epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling, we identify age-dependent regulatory mechanisms that govern inflammatory responsiveness. Mature-aged tendon cells exhibit exaggerated pro-inflammatory and catabolic responses across chromatin, gene expression, and protein signaling levels, characterized by enhanced TNF receptor organization, elevated accessibility at pro-inflammatory regulatory elements, and robust induction of matrix-degrading enzymes. Notably, the AP-1 transcription factor family emerges as a central age-dependent regulator, displaying distinct motif accessibility patterns that bias mature tenocytes toward inflammatory and degenerative transcriptional programs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that age-dependent epigenetic priming amplifies inflammatory sensitivity and constrains reparative gene regulation in mature tendon cells.

A key challenge in biologics manufacturing is linking bioreactor conditions, cell line characteristics and recombinant product production. A datahub for mammalian cell bioprocessing, integrated by semantic technologies, will serve as a tool to understand and query the connections between these complex datasets. While existing ontologies cover general biological and experimental concepts, they often lack the operational specificity required to harmonize bioreactor conditions, cell line engineering, and product quality metrics. To address this specific gap, we present the Mammalian Cell Bioprocessing Ontology (MCBO), a hub-and-spoke application ontology built on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) foundations and anchored to the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) Core. MCBO formalizes the process-participant-quality modeling pattern, enabling precise tracking of culture environmental conditions as qualities of the physical culture system. We demonstrate the utility of MCBO through a central datahub populated with 723 curated cell culture process instances and 325 unique bioprocess samples from published studies. The framework is validated against eight competency questions implemented via SPARQL, demonstrating efficient cross-study querying of culture optimization, cell line engineering, and multi-omics integration. By providing a stable, schema-independent substrate for data harmonization, MCBO enables AI agent-powered, human-in-the-loop workflows and facilitates LLM-assisted extraction of structured metadata from legacy records. MCBO is open-source and designed for deployment behind institutional firewalls to support interoperable biomanufacturing intelligence while maintaining intellectual property sensitivity.

However, direct proof-of-concept studies demonstrating their ability to model disease evolution, identify relevant biomarkers, and accurately predict treatment response in PCa patients, remain scarce. Here, we report the establishment of serially transplantable xenografts series derived from two advanced PCa PDO lines, which can be further re-cultured as organoids. Newly-generated model series maintain key phenotypic, genomic, and functional characteristics of the original patient tumors, and emulate relevant molecular subtypes of advanced PCa. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis uncovers transcriptomic differences between xenograft and organoid models, as well as signaling pathways which are largely preserved and can be targeted ex vivo. Functional drug profiles correlate with molecular and clinical attributes, as exemplified by response to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors and glucocorticoid-mediated AR signaling activation. Longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of perturbed PDOs identifies a rare PROX1+/ALDH1A1+ cell population, which pre-exist in the treatment-naive setting and is significantly enriched upon androgen deprivation. Notably, this cell population is similarly enriched in post-treatment samples of the original patient and is associated with aggressive AR-negative PCa molecular subtypes, suggesting a potential link with PCa progression.

Alpha oscillations have been proposed to define the temporal resolution of perception, yet empirical evidence remains inconsistent. Here we combined a sustained visual integration paradigm with resting-state EEG to investigate how oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly shape temporal perception. Participants (n=83) viewed alternating gratings that varied in alternation speed, producing the perception of either a fused plaid (integration) or two interchanging gratings (segregation). Faster individual alpha rhythms were associated with narrower temporal integration windows, and a steeper aperiodic spectrum predicted greater perceptual precision. Moreover, individuals with slower alpha frequencies and flatter spectra showed stronger reliance on prior judgments, suggesting reduced sensory precision and increased weighting of recent experience. Subjective confidence increased with faster alpha rhythms, reflecting the clarity of sensory evidence and its consistency with prior responses. Together, these findings show that the perceptual interpretation, confidence and previous experience effects in temporal integration reflect the joint influence of alpha rhythms and aperiodic neural activity.

However, the development of TRPV4-targeted therapeutics has been hindered by limited mechanistic understanding of its inhibition.

P.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form complexes that down-regulate target RNAs, including mRNAs from most human genes1-3. Within each complex, the miRNA pairs to target mRNAs to specify their repression, and AGO provides effector function while also protecting the miRNA from cellular nucleases2-5. Although much has been learned about this mode of posttranscriptional gene regulation, less is known about how the miRNAs themselves are regulated. In one such regulatory pathway, unusual miRNA targets called \"trigger\" RNAs reverse the canonical regulatory logic and instead down-regulate microRNAs6-21. This target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is thought to require a cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) because it depends on the cullin protein CUL3 and other ubiquitylation components, including the BC-box protein ZSWIM8 (ref. 22,23). ZSWIM8 is required for murine perinatal viability and for destabilization of most short-lived miRNAs, but is otherwise poorly understood23-25. Here, we demonstrate that a human AGO-miRNA- trigger complex selectively binds ZSWIM8 for CUL3-mediated polyubiquitylation of the AGO protein within this complex. Cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses show how ZSWIM8 recognizes the distinct AGO2 and miRNA-trigger conformations shaped by pairing of the miRNA to the trigger. For example, this pairing extracts the miRNA from a binding pocket within AGO2, allowing the pocket to be captured by ZSWIM8, and it directs the trigger RNA along a distinct trajectory to be also recognized by ZSWIM8. These results biochemically establish AGO binding and polyubiquitylation as the key regulatory step of TDMD, define a unique CRL class, and reveal generalizable RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions that specify the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AGO with exquisite selectivity. The substrate features recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase do not conform to a conventional degron26-28, but rather establish a two-RNA-factor authentication mechanism specifying a protein ubiquitylation substrate.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

While traditionally characterized as a sensor of foreign or mis-localized self dsDNA, recent evidence demonstrates that STING also integrates information about the homeostasis of cellular lipid biosynthesis into the innate inflammatory response. This integration occurs most notably through STINGs sensitivity to de novo cholesterol synthesis. However, given that mammalian cells undergo widespread lipid metabolic reprogramming, characterized by alterations in the synthesis of many lipid species in addition to cholesterol, during processes such as malignant transformation to cancer or during infection by intracellular pathogens, we hypothesized that STING function may be regulated by perturbations in other undescribed lipid pathways. To investigate potential other facets of the STING-lipid interface, we have performed a targeted small molecule screen across multiple lipid metabolic pathways, including the mevalonate, PPAR (fatty acid), and arachidonic acid pathways. Our findings reveal that positively and negatively perturbing enzymes within these diverse lipid paths including lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases can significantly modulate STING-dependent signal transduction and transcriptional programs identifying metabolic nodes that link lipid homeostasis with innate immune signaling.

In response, vaccine manufacturers have updated COVID-19 vaccines annually since 2022, though immune imprinting to the ancestral strain has blunted antibody responses to modern viral variants. In early 2025, the JN.1 subvariant LP.8.1 was dominant and manufacturers updated mRNA vaccine formulations to target LP.8.1 (LP.8.1 MV).

Loss of the core STRIPAK components via PPH22, FAR8, FAR9, or FAR11 mutations caused severe defects in growth, stress adaptation, cell-cycle progression, and morphogenesis, accompanied by widespread aneuploidy and genome instability. In murine infection models, far11{Delta} strains were avirulent, whereas far9{Delta} mutants caused delayed but ultimately fatal disease and underwent host-associated genome remodeling, with all recovered isolates acquiring chromosome 11 tetraploidy despite no consistent in vitro fitness advantage. In striking contrast, deletion of MOB3 produced a hypervirulent phenotype. mob3{Delta} cells exhibited enhanced transmigration across an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, increased survival in macrophages, and generated abundant small-cell morphotypes in vitro and in vivo, features associated with increased dissemination. Global phosphoproteomic profiling revealed extensive and overlapping phosphorylation changes among core STRIPAK mutants, affecting pathways involved in signaling, cytoskeletal and cell-cycle control, chromatin and transcriptional regulation, RNA metabolism, and stress responses.

In contrast, loss of the Mob3 subunit promotes hypervirulence by enhancing dissemination and persistence within the host.

Because of its restricted expression in sperm and crucial role in fertilization, CatSper represents a promising target for the development of non-hormonal male contraceptives. However, its structural complexity and the absence of functional heterologous expression systems have limited inhibitor discovery. Here, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay to identify compounds capable of blocking CatSper activity in mammalian sperm. The method relies on the stimulation of CatSper by exposing live mouse sperm to a high-K+/high-pH solution (K8.6), which induces membrane depolarization and intracellular alkalinization, triggering Ca2+ entry through CatSper. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored using the fluorescent indicator Fluo-4. To increase throughput and minimize variability, this assay was combined with fluorescent cell barcoding, which assigns each sperm sample a unique fluorescent signature, enabling the simultaneous acquisition of multiple conditions within a single tube. This integration greatly reduces acquisition time and reagent consumption, thereby facilitating large-scale screening experiments. Moreover, we implemented a compound pooling strategy to further improve assay efficiency, allowing the rapid identification of active compounds within a library. The assay was validated using CatSper1 knockout sperm and known pharmacological inhibitors, confirming that both genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of CatSper abolish the K8.6-induced Ca2+ response.

Many GTPase regulators remain to be identified despite extensive genetic and biochemical screens. Here we present the results of computational protein-protein interaction screens and functional experiments identifying the DENN domain protein Avl9 as a GTPase-activating protein for Arf1. Avl9 is involved in secretion and cell migration, but its molecular function has not been characterized. We determined that Avl9 possesses robust Arf-GAP activity and is recruited to secretory vesicles by Rab8. We find that Avl9 function is conserved in humans and enhances cell migration. We propose that several other DENN domain proteins are also candidate GAPs, and we demonstrate that one candidate previously characterized as a Rab-GEF, DENND6A, exhibits strong Arf-GAP activity towards ARL8B, explaining its role in lysosome positioning. Collectively, this work uncovers a family of monomeric  DENN GAP proteins that regulate diverse cell biological pathways.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

However, most published OS data is limited to primary tumor samples, limiting insight into patient-specific resistance mechanisms. To address this, we characterized the genomic landscape of paired primary and metastatic tumor samples from dogs with spontaneous OS. Whole-genome and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal mutation and gene expression profiles that are predominantly organized by patient identity. Mutational burden and pathway alterations such as those involving PI3K, NOTCH, TP53, MAPK, RAS and epigenetic regulation differ between primary and metastatic samples. Variants present in tumor tissue are readily detectable in paired cfDNA samples, demonstrating utility of this assay for identifying tumor-specific alterations associated with treatment resistance disease. Analysis of bulk RNA-seq data to estimate cell-type composition shows greater immune cell representation in metastases, underscoring the importance of immune signaling pathways in OS.

Biochemical and structural studies have identified LIRs in many LC3B interaction partners, but the sequence features that contribute to binding have not been systematically explored. To discover peptides that interact with LC3B and to deeply profile the key binding determinants, we screened a library of ~500,000 36-residue peptides derived from the human proteome using bacterial cell-surface display. Analysis of the screening data, coupled with structural studies and site-directed mutagenesis, revealed exceptions to the reported LIR motif and a strong preference for negatively charged residues adjacent to the LIR, which we visualized in a newly determined structure of LC3B bound to a peptide isolated in our screen. Guided by our screening data, we designed synthetic LIR-containing peptides that bind LC3B with affinities comparable to the tightest measured natural binder. Finally, we determined that mutations in LC3B commonly thought to abrogate binding of LIR-containing peptides instead alter LC3B binding specificity, leading to enhanced binding of some LIR-containing sequences. Taken together, our results refine the LIR motif definition, expand the network of candidate LC3B interaction partners, and highlight how mutations at the LC3B-LIR interface can modulate affinity and specificity.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

The phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger (P-Rex) subfamily of RhoGEFs includes P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 which, when misregulated, contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. P-Rex activity is controlled by accessory domains that maintain the protein in a cytosolic, autoinhibited state until activated by the lipid PIP3 and G protein {beta}{gamma} subunits. While P-Rex1 autoinhibition has been structurally and biochemically characterized, P-Rex2 has remained largely unexplored. Furthermore, despite high sequence similarity and domain conservation, P-Rex homologs differ in substrate specificity and regulatory interactions, and the molecular basis for these divergences is unknown. Here, we have taken an integrative structural biology approach to investigate these gaps. Using cryo-EM, we determined the first structure of full-length P-Rex2 to moderate resolution, revealing that, while the overall structure closely resembles that of P-Rex1, there is a substantial repositioning of the N-terminal module relative to the C-terminal core. This may play a key role in precluding the intramolecular interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains that are observed in autoinhibited P-Rex1. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that, unlike P-Rex1, P-Rex2 dynamics are unaffected by IP4, the headgroup of PIP3. SEC-SAXS data support that the N-terminal module itself is less dynamic, and biochemical assays show that P-Rex2 may be more tightly regulated by autoinhibition, likely through a mechanism different from P-Rex1.

Although the recently discovered KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 has shown promise for PDAC treatment in preclinical studies, its clinical efficacy as a single agent is expected to be limited, as is the case with KRAS G12C inhibitors. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated potential combination strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect of MRTX1133. We rationally combined MRTX1133 with the BCL-xL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) DT2216 and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which significantly potentiated the anti-tumor activity of MRTX1133 in multiple G12D-mutated PDAC cells in vitro by enhancing apoptosis induction.

In vivo, DT2216/everolimus combination significantly potentiated the anti-tumor activity of MRTX1133 in AsPC1 PDAC xenograft model. Furthermore, the triple combination of MRTX1133, DT2216, and everolimus effectively overcame acquired resistance to MRTX1133 in AsPC1 cells in vitro and in xenograft model.

Because the regenerative process is closely linked to the cumulative severity of muscle damage, which is variably distributed within and between muscle groups, accurately quantifying muscle regeneration has remained a significant challenge. Methods Myofibers are delineated by immunostaining for laminin, and subsequent image analysis employed to generate a masked outline precisely within each myofiber boundary. Morphometric parameters including minimal Feret's diameter, cross-sectional area, and circularity were measured for each myofiber. In addition, the number of Pax7-expressing satellite cells were quantified. To evaluate regenerative activity, newly formed myofibers were identified by immunostaining for expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMHC). Necrotic myofibers were enumerated by immunofluorescent detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) infiltration. The Regenerative Index (RI) was calculated as the number of regenerating (eMHC+) myofibers divided by the number of necrotic (IgG+) myofibers. Determination of RI was performed on muscle biopsies from 10 boys with DMD and 3 non-DMD controls of similar age Results A trend toward an increasing minimal Feret's diameter, cross-sectional area and circularity was observed with increasing age in DMD boys, with circularity showing the strongest trend. Furthermore, compared to DMD boys 7- to 8-years old, the boys 9- to 11-years old had significantly increased myofiber circularity. Pax7-expressing cells were significantly elevated in DMD boys compared to control boys of similar ages, without any observation of age-related changes. Notably, the Regenerative Index in DMD boys exhibited a pronounced decline between 7-11 years of age, and a significant inverse correlation between RI and age was observed. Conclusions Using eMHC and IgG immunostaining to calculate RI accurately assesses regeneration despite the variation in histopathologic severity between biopsies. This methodology demonstrated a significant negative correlation between RI and age of DMD boys from 7 to 11 years of age.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Instead, observers generate expectations about what is likely to occur next, using contextual information to guide decisions, particularly when sensory input is weak, ambiguous, or uncertain. These expectations can facilitate behaviour when they align with incoming evidence, but impose costs when they conflict, shaping how information from different senses contributes to behaviour. However, it remains unclear what kind of multisensory process is engaged when meaning guides decisions, and whether multisensory facilitation and non-independence reflect a single integrative mechanism or distinct routes shaped by context. Here, we examined how semantic context, visual clarity, and the relationship between auditory and visual signals jointly shape behaviour in a semantic correspondence task using dynamic, naturalistic events. Participants judged whether a target matched a preceding concept prime, establishing an expectation at the level of meaning. Targets were auditory-only, visual-only (clear or blurry), or audiovisual (AV), with AV components conveying either the same or different meanings across modalities. AV facilitation was not a general consequence of stimulus redundancy. When the prime accurately predicted the target and auditory and visual signals conveyed the same meaning, degrading visual input increased the contribution of auditory information, leading to faster responses and violations of the race-model inequality. By contrast, when the prime indicated the target but auditory and visual signals conveyed competing meanings, AV stimulation produced robust behavioural costs relative to vision. When the prime did not match the target, congruent and incongruent audiovisual events produced comparable effects, and race-model violations were observed even when auditory and visual signals encoded different concepts, indicating convergence at the level of the response rather than shared perceptual content. Finally, exploratory clustering revealed two participant subgroups with comparable overall response speed but systematically different multisensory profiles when semantic expectations did not allow reliable anticipation of the upcoming event. Together, these findings show that multisensory effects in semantic decisions are shaped by meaning and arise through two functionally distinct routes: one in which reduced sensory reliability promotes joint use of congruent audiovisual information, and another in which perceptually different signals converge on the same response when semantic expectations are not met.\n\nHighlightsO_LISemantic expectations shape how multisensory information is used to guide responses.\nC_LIO_LIReduced sensory reliability enables multisensory facilitation when signals convey the same meaning.\nC_LIO_LIMultisensory effects arise when sensory signals support the same response.\nC_LIO_LIIndividuals adopt distinct strategies for resolving uncertainty in multisensory decisions.\nC_LI", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Previously, it has been shown that atomic-layer deposition (ALD) of alumina (Al2O3) can be applied to spray dried, thermostabilized antigen-containing powders to produce alumina-coated vaccine particles that, when compared to a liquid control, elicit improved humoral immunity with response kinetics controlled by ALD-coat thickness.

Surprisingly, this detection occurs primarily through NAIP2, which normally detect rod proteins. However, we found that during infection with live S.

Host species identity emerged as the strongest predictor of microbiome composition, explaining 32.3% of bacterial community variation and substantially outweighing temporal and spatial effects. Core microbiome analysis revealed species-specific bacterial associations, with all four species harboring distinct Endozoicomonas variants as dominant symbionts. Encrusting species hosted taxonomically diverse microbiomes, while branching species maintained highly specialized communities dominated by Endozoicomonas and Mycoplasma.

Here, we profiled host innate immune cells, cecal microbial composition, and the host transcriptome of normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 male and female mice following experimental CDI during the acute and recovery phases. HFD-fed male mice exhibited delayed disease onset but increased mortality following CDI. During acute infection, HFD-fed males showed increased monocyte infiltration and expansion of CD103CD11b- and CD103-CD11b dendritic cell subsets; transcriptomic modules were enriched for antigen presentation and signatures consistent with T cell activation, coincident with enrichment of Escherichia and Lactococcus. In contrast, during recovery, HFD-fed males and females displayed sustained neutrophil and monocyte infiltration, depletion of eosinophils (prominent in males), tissue-resident Tim4/CD206 macrophage subsets and ILC3s, increased expression of Tlr4 and endothelial activation markers, downregulation of metabolic pathways, and failure to restore cecal microbial diversity.

Here, we present a framework to anticipate invasion potential for 184 mosquito species of medical importance based on their ecological, life-history, and macroecological traits. We first compiled a comprehensive dataset of 26 traits characterizing each species. We then used random forest models to relate these traits with the probability of species being introduced in new regions (before and after 1950, marking the onset of widespread trade globalization), and of establishment following introduction. Models achieved moderate to good predictive performance (AUC = 0.78-0.85) and revealed that species native to Asia and Australia, adapted to human-made breeding sites, and tolerant of climatic extremes are consistently more likely to be introduced and to establish in non-native regions. Among species with no known invasion history, we identified 24 with higher potential to become future spreaders, of which 17 also exhibit high establishment probabilities (high-risk species).

CP-binding domains can target CP to the membrane and activate CP by promoting dissociation of its stoichiometric inhibitor V-1. The capping protein binding region (CBR) of CARMIL includes a CPI motif and a CSI motif, followed by a membrane binding (MB) domain. The MB domain is necessary for the function of CARMIL in cells, and it is sufficient for targeting GFP to the plasma membrane of cells. Here, we investigated the mechanism and significance of the relationship of the MB domain to CP activity, including capping of actin filament barbed ends and promotion of Arp2/3-nucleated actin assembly. We found that the MB domain is able to bind to lipid-coated beads, bringing the CPI and CSI motifs to the bead, and thus activating CP to promote Arp2/3-based actin assembly. In addition, we discovered that the MB domain can dissociate from the lipid membrane once CP binds; this observation may help account for the long-standing quandary as to how activated CP is released from the membrane and how CP functions to activate Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly near the membrane. We also report that the MB domain released from the membrane enhances the ability of the CPI and CSI domains to activate CP. Thus, the CARMIL MB domain has multiple biochemical functions regulating actin assembly at a membrane. First, it can target CARMIL, CP, and barbed ends to the plasma membrane. Second, the MB domain can leave the membrane, and this promotes the uncapping of capped barbed ends and activates soluble CP, with greater ability than seen with the membrane-attached state.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Early electrophysiological studies, notably by Ernst Knobil, identified multiunit activity (MUA) volleys in the mediobasal hypothalamus that aligned with LH pulses, suggesting a neural basis for GnRH pulsatility. Although GnRH neurons exhibit some intrinsic secretory rhythmicity in vitro, their isolated electrophysiological signatures have proven inconsistent. Recent advances, including GCaMP fibre photometry in freely behaving mice, have revealed a precise correlation between episodic GnRH distal processes and LH pulses. However, it is now well established that a neural oscillator comprising hypothalamic kisspeptin neurones co-expressing neurokinin B and dynorphin, collectively termed the KNDy network, represents the core construct of the GnRH pulse generator. Understanding the dynamics of this network and its modulation by external inputs such as stress, metabolic cues, and circadian rhythms is essential. Computational modelling provides a systematic framework for integrating experimental data with mechanistic and predictive analyses to decode the GnRH pulse generator dynamics.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide a temporal study of changes in Purkinje cell function, cell vulnerability and innervation of cerebellar nuclei in a mouse model of Christianson syndrome. Purkinje cells express certain molecules in a patterned manner across the cerebellum, such as aldolase C/zebrin-II (zebrin). We show that zebrin patterning appears normal before disease onset in Christianson syndrome mice with no apparent cell death, similar to what has been reported in patients. We observe rapid Purkinje cell death in the anterior lobe of Christianson syndrome mice that is exclusive to zebrin-negative Purkinje cells, with zebrin-positive Purkinje cells showing resilience. Intrinsic firing deficits exclusively in the anterior cerebellum are observed at the same time as the first observed cell death in the anterior cerebellum. In contrast, posterior Purkinje cells degenerated later, but zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive cells were equally susceptible to degeneration. Purkinje cells innervation in the cerebellar nuclei was also lost in Christianson syndrome mice in a region-specific manner: neurons in the anterior cerebellar nuclei, with predominantly zebrin-negative Purkinje cells inputs, displayed dramatic loss of Purkinje cells innervation, while neurons in the posterior cerebellar nuclei, innervated by both zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive terminals, showed greater resiliency.

S.; Arab, F.; Nagarajan, S.; Raj, A.", "abstract": "Brain regions perform distinct computations, and their signals propagate through the whole-brain white matter network. Yet, mathematical models that describe this signal propagation via purely passive diffusion can predict a considerable amount of the observed functional connectivity between regions. This raises a critical question: if so much functional connectivity can be explained by a passive process, how can we isolate the active process? Here, we calculate in closed-form an estimate for such an active signal in functional MRI by spatially deconvolving the effect of passive signal spread over the brain's structural connectivity using a higher-order network diffusion (HONeD) model. Across 770 Human Connectome Project subjects, we show that the resulting HONeD-innovation (HONeD-in) signal 1) sparsifies functional connectivity while retaining a well-connected network, 2) remodels resting-state networks (RSNs), 3) mixes the unimodal--multimodal hierarchical organization of RSNs into a circle with no clear hierarchy, and 4) deblurs task-activation maps.

W.", "abstract": "AbstractCreating effective and thermostable vaccines is of significant relevance for public health. The Atomic Layering Thermostable Antigen and Adjuvant (ALTA(R)) platform combines spray drying to stabilize antigens in a sugar matrix followed by coating with atomic layer deposition (ALD) for temporal control over in vivo release. While these technologies have shown preliminary promise for different vaccine antigens, further characterizations of the immune response to ALTA(R) formulated antigens are still needed. Here, the immune response to ALTA(R) formulated antigens is described and compared to a set of adjuvanted liquid vaccine formulations that included Alhydrogel(R), AddaVax, and Alhydrogel(R)+CpG. The humoral and cell-mediated responses were measured by ELISA and flow cytometry. Increased and lasting antigen-specific antibody titers following administration of ALTA(R) containing ovalbumin (OVA) demonstrated robust and durable humoral response. Furthermore, ALTA(R) injected mice produced both IgG2c and IgG1 indicating a balanced Th1/Th2 response. Importantly, ALTA(R) OVA elicited robust humoral response at lower doses of aluminum than Alhydrogel(R). The most striking difference between ALTA(R) and the liquid vaccine formulations tested was a greater OVA-specific CD8+ T cell response observed at all antigen doses tested. Mechanistically, antigen encapsulation within ALTA(R) particles was critical for antibody production and CD8+ T cell responses as well as antigen capture by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the site of injection and draining lymph nodes. To test these concepts in a more physiological application, protein and polysaccharide vaccine antigens derived from a facultative intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, were formulated using the ALTA(R) platform. Compared to liquid vaccine formulations, ALTA(R) immunized mice showed enhanced antigen-specific antibody production and IFN-{gamma} secreting T cell responses using lower adjuvant doses of aluminum and CpG. Overall, ALTA(R) formulated protein and polysaccharide antigens elicited strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity suggesting potential broad applicability of the platform to vaccines against various diseases, including against cancer and infections from intracellular pathogens.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that LEN is an allosteric modulator of HIV-1 capsid structure that breaks the fullerene cone architecture in two steps: loss of high-curvature declinations occurs early, followed by failure of the capsid body. At the molecular level, LEN alters the non-covalent bonding interactions between capsid subunits and reduces local lattice curvature. LEN also alters the material properties of the capsid, by increasing brittleness. These results provide molecular rationales for how LEN remodels HIV-1 capsid structure and impairs the replication capacity of the virus.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Our neural posterior estimation matches the accuracy of leading Bayesian likelihood-based methods while running a thousand times faster and avoiding a phylogeny reconstruction step.

Here, we uncover formin-binding protein 4 (FNBP4) as a previously uncharacterized nuclear actin-binding protein that integrates dual regulatory functions. We identify a conserved basic KRRK motif within its C-terminal that directly interacts actin and coincides with a non-canonical nuclear localization signal. In parallel, FNBP4 interacts with the formin FMN1 via its N-terminal WW domains, potently suppressing FMN1-mediated actin nucleation. Strikingly, full-length FNBP4, which unites both the FMN1- and actin-binding modules, displays synergistic inhibition far exceeding that of truncated fragments. Furthermore, confocal imaging confirms nuclear colocalization of FNBP4 with actin, highlighting its role in shaping nuclear actin architecture. Our findings position FNBP4 as the first example of a nuclear-resident formin inhibitor that simultaneously binds actin and a formin. This dual functionality establishes a new regulatory paradigm in which a single protein integrates direct actin interaction with formin inhibition to fine-tune nuclear actin organization.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

Understanding the activation mechanism of these proteins at both a family and clade-specific level is particularly relevant for designing multi-target agonists, as exemplified by recently designed dual-agonists for GLP-1R and GIPR, for treating obesity. Here, we use 6 milliseconds of unbiased all-atom MD simulations of GCGR, GLP1R, PAC1R, SCTR, PTH1R and CALCR from the four different clades of Class B1 GPCRs to establish the universal mechanism of their activation. We show that the activation of Class B1 GPCRs involves a clade-independent intermediate state characterized by the outward movement of helix 6. We use a combination of Markov state models and transition path theory to show that the activation of these proteins occurs at a millisecond timescale. We identify characteristic molecular locks that are conserved at a clade-level, showcasing the uniqueness among the activation mechanisms of these proteins. We show that these proteins show similar inactive and active states, but show unique activation mechanisms at a residue level. These sites can be targeted directly or allosterically to design therapeutics targeting a specific clade of proteins. Thus, this study provides an integrated atomistic view of the activation for Class B1 GPCRs from a mechanistic, thermodynamic and kinetic perspective.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

However, mounting evidence suggests that other cells, especially astrocytes, also perform computation. Here we demonstrate that cerebellar astrocytes decompose norepinephrine input into slow and fast calcium activities through differential adrenergic receptor engagement. During reward learning in mice, slow and fast activities selectively target distinct synaptic pathways. Causal manipulations reveal that slow 1-adrenergic signals maintain behavioral states and coordinate transitions, while fast 2-adrenergic signals govern event-triggered responses and reinforcement learning. Remarkably, an actor-critic neural network trained on a similar sequence task spontaneously recapitulates these multitimescale dynamics, suggesting astrocytes implement critic-like computations that evaluate states and modulate neuronal learning. These findings establish astrocytes as multilevel processors that transform univariate neuromodulatory inputs into multivariate, pathway-specific circuit control operating in parallel with neuronal processing.", "date": "2026-01-05", "journal": ""}

We find connected sites are mesoscale (millimeter-scale) in size and arranged in patchy patterns across cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Non-overlapping connections evoked from three sequential stimulation sites in PM form clusters of multi-site integration, and appear related to known functional organization within these limbic regions. We suggest these mesoscale functional connections link the limbic axes of motor expression (cingulate), interoception (insula), and emotion-related processing (amygdala), and that, much like visual system, the limbic system is fundamentally quite orderly at mesoscale.

We investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers with intermediate English proficiency. By integrating behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how syntactic, semantic, and phonological information influenced sentence comprehension. Methods: Twenty-seven participants completed an auditory sentence judgment task involving English sentences with a syntactic, semantic, or phonological error. Results: Behavioral results revealed the highest accuracy in the control and semantic conditions, while syntactic and phonological violations led to significantly lower performance, indicating greater processing difficulty in these domains. Among the three linguistic violation types, phonological violations elicited the robust ERP negativities across both time 300-500 ms and 500-800 ms time windows, while syntactic and semantic violations evoked less consistent neural responses in this L2 auditory sentence judgment task. These results suggest that mismatches in expected phonological forms hinder lexical activation, triggering a negativity that resembles an N400 but reflects different underlying processes. Conclusion: We found non-canonical neural response patterns in L2 learners, characterized by sensitivity to phonological anomalies but minimal neural disruption for semantic or syntactic anomalies. The current study contributes to our understanding of L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers, particularly by aligning real-time neural responses with behavioral performance.
