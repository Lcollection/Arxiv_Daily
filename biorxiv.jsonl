Towards the goal of inferring causality from observational data, we developed u-Unwrap3D as a resource to map arbitrarily complex 3D cell surfaces to diverse representations, each designed to interrogate a different aspect of the dynamic interaction between cell surface geometry and molecular cues. Using u-Unwrap3D, we discover a retrograde protrusion flow on natural killer cells associated with immunological synapse formation with cancer; establish a causal association of K14+ cells with breast tumor organoid invasion; measure the speed of ruffles; and quantify bleb-mediated assembly of septin polymers at the membrane.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Selfishly replicating transposable elements (TEs) are thought to follow similar dynamics, but strong evidence is missing. We tested this in termites, social insects in which TEs have been linked to ageing. Sequencing genomes and profiling DNA methylation across the termite phylogeny revealed corresponding phylogenetic signals in TEs and TE methylation, indicative of selection. TE methylation reduces TE success, as both TE abundance and spreading efficiency decrease with increasing methylation. TEs also become less harmful with TE age: evolutionarily older TEs spread less, insert less into exons, and erode into short remnants. Correspondingly, defence through methylation is strongest against young TEs. Yet, as in typical host parasite arms races, some TEs persist, implying resistance or recurrent invasions. Our results reveal arms races between TEs and DNA methylation, positioning TEs as drivers of genome evolution similar to symbionts in organismic evolution.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

These constraints have made it difficult for fMRI researchers to take advantage of modern deep-learning tools that have revolutionized other fields such as NLP, speech transcription, and image recognition. To address these issues, we scaled up functional connectome fingerprinting as a neural network pre-training task, drawing inspiration from speaker recognition research, to learn a generalizable representation of brain function. This approach sets a new high-water mark for neural fingerprinting on a previously unseen scale, across many popular public fMRI datasets (individual recognition over held out scan sessions: 94% on MPI-Leipzig, 94% on NKI-Rockland, 73% on OASIS-3, and 99% on HCP). Near-ceiling performance is maintained even when the duration of the evaluation scan is truncated to less than two minutes. We show that this representation can also generalize to support accurate neural fingerprinting for completely new datasets and participants not used in training. Finally, we demonstrate that the representation learned by the network encodes features related to individual variability that supports some transfer learning to new tasks. These results open the door for a new generation of clinical applications based on functional imaging data.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We further incorporated key protein-DNA hydrogen bond interactions derived from fully atomistic simulations. Extensive simulations of the SMC complex with 800 base pairs of duplex DNA over the ATP cycle observed unidirectional DNA translocation by the SMC complex. The process exhibited a step size of ~200 base pairs, wherein the SMC complex captured a DNA segment of about the same size within the SMC ring in the engaged state, followed by its pumping into the kleisin ring as ATP was hydrolyzed.

Additionally, CD5hiCD8+ T cells exhibited gene expression landscape similar to effector T cells and exacerbated disease in transfer model. Interestingly, the protective effects of transgenic phosphatase Pep expression, which lowers TCR signaling and diabetes incidence, were abolished in NOD strain 8.3 with high CD5 expression linked to increased thymic positive selection.

Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner. However, a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results provide pharmacological proof of concept that Mac1 is a valid therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle.

BMP4 has been shown to drive differentiation of GSCs, increase sensitivity to radiotherapy, slow growth and increase survival times in animal models. To assess the potential of BMP4 as a differentiation therapy, we develop a mathematical model that describes the growth of a GBM tumor via a hierarchy of GSCs, progenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells. We parametrize our model using experimental data from twelve patient-derived GSC lines, on which we measured response to radiotherapy and population growth with and without exposure to BMP4. Cell lines were typically more sensitive to radiotherapy after two days of BMP4 treatment but population growth can either increase or decrease after seven days of exposure to BMP4. To identify key parameters that drive successful treatment we perform global sensitivity analysis which identifies key parameters for BMP4 efficacy including proliferation rate and self-renewal sensitivity of GSCs. We then compare two treatment schedules: a single dose of BMP4 at resection and continuous delivery of BMP4 from resection till the end of radiotherapy. Due to the short half-life of BMP4 and its synergy with radiotherapy, continuous delivery of BMP4 during radiotherapy is more effective than a single dose prior to radiotherapy. We then perform a series of virtual clinical trials, stratified by tumor proliferation rate and GSC self-renewal sensitivity, which allows us to estimate the probability of observing a successful early-phase clinical trial for various virtual patient cohorts. We find that trials that selected the subset of patients with more proliferative GBMs were more likely to lead to significant improvements in survival.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

CNVs can be detected using different data sources, including genome sequencing, genotyping arrays and quantitative PCR experiments, but in most large cohorts, genotyping arrays remain the most prevalent source. Current methods to call CNVs from genotyping array data suffer from high false positive rates and while multiple approaches, including QC filtering, visual inspection of intensity tracks, and wet-lab validation are commonly applied to counter this problem, such methods are often non-specific (QC filtering) or inefficient (visual and wet-lab validations) at a genome-wide scale. Results: We have assembled the largest collection of human-verified CNV calls using visual validation, totaling almost 60,000 calls from 22,500 samples from three cohorts genotyped on several different arrays. Across all cohorts our visual validation found the majority of CNV calls to be false positive (53.7%) or unclear (9.7%). The false positive fraction varied substantially across datasets and genomic regions, and we show that existing filtering methods based on QC metrics are inefficient in removing false calls. Given the supremacy of visual validation over existing filtering methods in controlling the false positive fraction, we used a subset of our visual validation dataset to train a convolutional neural network to automate the validation of CNVs through machine vision. We tested the efficacy of the model using the remainder of the dataset and found the performance exceeded 90% in most measures, approximating that of a human analyst. Cross-validation with genome sequencing data found our visual validation to be highly accurate, with only 1.7% of calls supported by the sequencing dataset deemed as false by the human analyst, and a further 7.5% deemed as unclear. Conclusions: Visual inspection is the only effective validation approach for CNV calls. Our model is capable of automating this task at scale with very high accuracy, as shown by testing both within-sample and out-of-sample.

We inferred the ancestry of 49 individuals with genome-wide coverages >0.001x and found evidence for both Vicugna and Lama. Investigations into 26 individuals of >0.01x showed that all individuals, except one male llama, represented ancestry not found in modern individuals. Similar male-to-female sex ratios suggest hunting rather than herding. Moreover, while intergeneric admixture is widespread in modern domesticated individuals, we find limited evidence of this in our dataset.

Clinical management is challenging due to a high mortality rate, rapidly increasing antifungal resistance, and frequent nosocomial outbreaks. A critical bottleneck in understanding virulence is the lack of gene expression profiling models during infection.

This enabled interrogation of infection dynamics via dual host-pathogen RNA-seq across five major clades of C. auris (I-V). Host responses included heat shock, complement activation, and nutritional immunity, notably haem oxygenase (HMOX) expression during clade IV infection.

We describe this novel family and a sub-clade of five putative haem transport-related (HTR) genes.

Doublecortin proteins bind to microtubules and are thought to stabilise or rigidify microtubules. Upon targeting zyg-8, we observed altered spindle-pole oscillations and perturbations in microtubule cortical-contact behaviour. They were not accounted for solely by the previously reported changes in microtubule dynamics. Instead, the phenotypes were consistent with ZYG-8 increasing microtubule rigidity. ZYG-8 depletion or mutation led to more frequent microtubule bending, and higher curvature and tortuosity. Microtubule softening in zyg-8 mutants likely reduced the efficiency of centring forces, causing exaggerated spindle oscillations and subsequent mispositioning during late anaphase. We propose that sufficient microtubule rigidity is essential for generating effective cortical pushing forces, which act as centring mechanisms to ensure accurate spindle orientation in late mitosis.

Hybrid E/M phenotypes are conducive to cancer metastasis, as they are associated with metastatic initiation, cancer stemness, drug resistance, and collective migration. Boolean models of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying EMP have yielded valuable insights into the dynamics of E and M phenotypes. However, these models are limited in their ability to capture hybrid phenotypes effectively, as they restrict gene expression to binary states. In contrast, hybrid E/M cells often exhibit partial expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. To overcome this limitation, we modified a threshold-based Boolean formalism to incorporate intermediate gene expression levels. The resulting multilevel model reveals novel hybrid steady-states characterized by partial expression of both E and M genes, thereby expanding the phenotypic landscape beyond that represented by traditional Boolean approaches. Notably, these hybrid states exhibit lower frustration compared to their counterparts in classical Boolean models. Furthermore, by resolving dynamical degeneracy, we demonstrate that the hybrid states identified by the multilevel model are more stable. These findings suggest that introducing minimal additional complexity into Boolean models can uncover previously hidden qualitative features of phenotypic landscapes governed by GRNs.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Thus, warranting further studies in experimental animal models to understand how modulation of Cx43 expression can influence MS pathology. Intracranial infection with murine {beta}-coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) in mice results in acute pathology characterized by high viral titers, glial activation in the brain and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, effectively mimicking key pathological hallmarks of MS and serving as a robust model to investigate its viral etiology. MHV-A59 infection leads to a pronounced downregulation of Cx43 during the acute phase, emphasizing its critical role in virus-induced CNS pathology. In this study, we investigated the potential of in vivo 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration in modulating Cx43 expression in this MHV-induced model and its consequence on chronic virus-induced demyelination. Our results reveal that 4-PBA treatment reduced acute MHV-A59 infectivity and viral spread in the brain while modulating the glial cell response, mounting host immunity. Treatment with 4-PBA effectively preserved the expression of both Cx43 and Cx47 in infected CNS cells, counteracting their infection-induced downregulation. Furthermore, MHV-A59 infection downregulated the expression of ER-resident thioredoxin family protein (ERp29), a well-known molecular chaperone of Cx43, which was rescued by 4-PBA treatment. We further validated if such downregulation of ERp29 is also evident in MS demyelinating plaques. In human MS patient-derived brain tissue, reduced Cx43 and ERp29 staining was observed in demyelinating plaques. Our studies revealed that 4-PBA treatment not only limits viral replication and spread throughout the brain but also protects the mice against severe chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination.

Density dependence suppressed population size and increased extinction risk, whereas density independence enabled rapid growth, especially in genetically diverse populations where evolution was possible. Although density dependence raises extinction risk, it does not prevent populations from responding to selection, since surviving density-dependent populations still exhibited increased intrinsic and realized fitness.

Differential expression analysis defined unique circuitries enriched within each cell type between females and males and their impact on cell-cell communication and response to external signals, including enrichment of cholesterol/lipid metabolism, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, and fibronectin (FN1) production in female cells and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling in male cells.

SEVI is known to enhance HIV-1 infection by promoting virion attachment to cells, potentially facilitating sexual spread. Beyond its role in HIV transmission, findings highlight a physiological function for SEVI in innate immunity. As many amyloids display antimicrobial effects, we tested SEVI fibrils for antibacterial activity against microbial ESKAPE pathogens and urogenital bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. SEVI exhibited direct dose-dependent antibacterial effects in radial diffusion and survival assays, with activity observed at physiologically relevant concentrations. Bacterial surface molecules such as lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acid induced the formation of SEVI fibrils, as confirmed by kinetic assays. Preincubation with epigallocatechin gallate, a fibril disruptor, abolished SEVI's antibacterial activity, pointing to the importance of its fibrillar structure. Mechanistic studies and electron microscopy revealed limited bacterial membrane disruption and the intracellular accumulation of polyphosphate granules in P. aeruginosa, indicating a stress response. In conclusion, SEVI exerts a potent antibacterial activity against pathogens found in the urogenital tract indicating a potential physiological role in vaginal mucosal immunity.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

While motor symptoms have been linked with subcortical tau deposits, network mechanisms underlying the frontal cognitive symptoms remain unclear because pathological tau accumulation is quite limited within the frontal cortex and heterogeneously distributed primarily in the subcortical regions. Here, we combined tau-PET using a high-contrast probe we have recently developed with normative connectome to resolve this issue. Tau-deposition sites were connected to a common cortical network that could not be identified through similar analyses based on atrophy detected by structural MRI. This network was predominantly overlapped with canonical action-mode and frontoparietal networks, which jointly support adaptive and goal-directed behavior. Critically, while the degree of subcortical primary tau deposition correlated with motor symptoms, only the degree of connectivity from tau-deposition sites to the derived cortical network explained the frontal cognitive deficits of individual patients. These findings suggest a novel mechanism that frontal cognitive impairments, but not motor deficits, in PSP are derived from remote effects of tau deposits, independent of atrophy, through the convergent connectivity to the identified common cortical network.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we introduce the range-resident logistic model, an easy-to-simulate and mathematically tractable extension of the spatial logistic model that incorporates empirically supported range-resident movement. Our framework unifies non-spatial and (sessile) spatial formulations of the logistic model as limiting cases. Between these regimes, the long-term population size depends nonlinearly on home-range size and spatial distribution. Neglecting range residency can hence lead to under- or overestimating population carrying capacity. To better understand these results, we also introduce a novel crowding index that depends on movement parameters and can be estimated from tracking data. This index captures the influence of spatial structure on population size, and serves as a robust predictor of abundance. The range-resident logistic model is thus a unifying framework bridging movement and population ecology.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

It remains, however, poorly understood compared with single cell migration. The polymerization of branched actin by the RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway is established to power membrane protrusions at the front of migrating cells, but also to maintain cell junctions in epithelial monolayers. Here we have identified novel regulators of collective cell migration using a two-pronged approach: candidates were extracted from publicly available RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 dependency maps and screened in a second step using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic inactivation. In a wound healing assay, PKN2 knockout (KO) MCF10A cells display decreased collective migration due to destabilization of adherens junctions, whereas MOB4 KO cells display increased collective migration with a loss of migration orientation. Upon wound healing, PKN2 relocalizes to lateral junctions and maintains coordinated migration in the monolayer, whereas MOB4 relocalizes to the front edge of leader and follower cells collectively migrating towards the wound. The role of MOB4 in controlling collective migration requires YAP1, since MOB4 KO cells fail to activate YAP1 and their phenotype is rescued by constitutively active YAP1. Together, these findings reveal two complementary activities required for coordinating cells in collective migration.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

The C-LRE mediates control of Lte1 cortical recruitment by the p21-activated kinase, Cla4. The N-LRE modulates Lte1 binding to Ras more directly and is phosphorylated by the yeast MARK/PAR-1 protein kinases, Kin1/2. Along with previously described CDK phosphorylation sites, the N- and C-LREs are required for Lte1 localization and timely mitotic exit.

V.", "abstract": "Background Spaceflight presents unique environmental stressors, such as microgravity and radiation, that significantly affect biological systems at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Astronauts face an increased risk of developing cancer due to exposure to ionizing radiation and other spaceflight-related factors. Age plays a crucial role in the body's response to the cellular stresses that lead to cancer, with younger organisms generally exhibiting more efficient response mechanisms than older ones. The vast majority of research investigating breast cancer risk from spaceflight is done in vitro, using cell lines exposed to simulated radiation and microgravity. Objectives The primary objective of this observational study is to characterize the response to spaceflight of in vivo murine mammary tissue and identify the molecular biomarkers enriched in this response using mice flown on the International Space Station. The secondary objective is to determine if age plays a role in this response. Methods The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) has curated transcriptomic data obtained from murine mammary tissue in a controlled experiment (OSD-511) which includes 43 young and old female mice. In this study, we utilized an ensemble of four machine learning binary classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and single-layer perceptron) to analyze gene expression profiles to predict age (old vs young) and condition (spaceflight vs ground control). Using the genes our ensemble identified as most predictive, we performed pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the molecular pathways involved in spaceflight-related health risks, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Results All space-flown mice responded to spaceflight with evidence of systemic metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial adaptation to microgravity and radiation as compared to their 33 ground control counterparts. For the 10 mice flown in space, older mice exhibited chronic, significantly enriched pathways related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, while younger mice showed acute activation of pathways involved in cortisol synthesis and adrenergic stress response (with false discovery rate adjusted q-values < .001). These results provide putative biomarkers for monitoring and treating breast cancer. Conclusions These findings highlight the critical role of age in modulating the response to spaceflight-induced stress and suggest that these molecular pathways may contribute to differential outcomes in tissue homeostasis, metabolic disorders, and breast cancer tumorigenesis. Moreover, our computational methodology may be applied to several unexplored datasets in OSDR and beyond.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we demonstrate that modifying structural design parameters, such as the arm geometry, length, valency, and linker design, allows fine control of the elastic modulus and viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels. We also show that functionalization can be performed without compromising the hydrogels' physical properties and exhibit enhanced mechanical strength and tunable properties, compared to simple duplex-based DNA hydrogels.

We found that parallel transmit and multi-echo increased the magnitude of the BOLD signal change, but only multi-echo increased BOLD magnitude in areas prone to susceptibility artefacts. Multiband and denoising of multi-echo data with independent components analysis (ICA) both improved precision of GLM fit.

Furthermore, we reveal a moderate genetic correlation of .58 between aesthetic and music chills, pointing to shared genetic variation affecting susceptibility to strong emotional responses across different art forms. Finally, we find that a polygenic index (PGI) capturing openness to experiences, including propensities towards art (N = 234,880), is associated with susceptibilities both to aesthetic and music chills. Our results show that additive genetic variation, but also familial relatedness beyond shared common SNPs, contributes to proneness to chills from artistic, poetic, and musical expressions.

The subunit KdpA belongs to the Superfamily of K+ Transporters and adopts a pseudo-tetrameric architecture with a membrane embedded selectivity filter as seen in K+ channels. KdpB belongs to the superfamily of P-type ATPases with a conserved binding site for ions within the membrane domain and three cytoplasmic domains that orchestrate ATP hydrolysis via an aspartyl phosphate intermediate. Previous work has hypothesized that K+ moves parallel to the membrane plane through a 40-[A] long tunnel that connects the selectivity filter of KdpA with a canonical binding site in KdpB. In the current work, we have reconstituted KdpFABC into lipid nanodiscs and used cryo-EM to image the wild-type pump under turnover conditions. We present a 2.1 [A] structure of the E1~P{middle dot}ADP conformation, which reveals new features of the conduction pathway. This map shows strong densities within the selectivity filter and at the canonical binding site, consistent with K+ bound at each of these sites in this conformation. Many water molecules occupy a vestibule and the proximal end of the tunnel, which becomes markedly hydrophobic and dewetted at the subunit interface. We go on to use ATPase and ion transport assays to assess effects of numerous mutations along this proposed conduction pathway. The results confirm that K+ ions pass through the tunnel and support the existence of a low affinity site in KdpB for releasing these ions to the cytoplasm.

Here, we show that residue-level fluctuations encode \"geometric bits\" that are communicated within a sparse 3D network of shared entropy. We demonstrate this by developing an open-source framework that discovers shared entropy networks by inferring discrete residue conformations from molecular dynamics simulations of protein structure and finding maximum-likelihood tree distributions with minimal assumptions, enabling multiscale conformational entropy calculation without exhaustive enumeration. We validate our approach against an array of experimental data modalities probing sequence and ligand-dependent functions of PDZ and estrogen receptor ligand-binding domains, accurately predicting allosteric hotspots in saturation mutagenesis with residue-scale resolution, local entropies correlated with NMR and HDX dynamics, and global entropies in agreement with calorimetry without fitting. Comparing networks of the six human steroid receptors recovers phylogenetic history, providing evidence that evolution achieves functional diversity by reprogramming entropy within a fixed protein fold.

To investigate this, we injected 10 {nu}g of murine pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of a-syn (or monomeric and PBS as controls) into the striatum of wild-type (WT) and STINGgt/gt mice, which lack functional STING. We examined motor behavior and brain pathology at 1- and 6-months post-injection. STINGgt/gt mice showed more motor changes associated with PFF injection than WT mice. STINGgt/gt mice had a differential immune response to PFF with early and sustained increased microglia numbers and higher macrophagic CD68 response, but milder changes in the expression of immune-relevant markers such as TLR2, TLR4, IL1b, and TREM2. However, the lack of STING did not induce changes in the extent of a-syn pathology nor the p62 accumulation seen in the model. Altogether, this resulted in a faster but similar degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration after 6 months. Therefore, the data do not support a necessary role for STING in the a-syn induced nigral neuronal loss in the PFF-PD mouse model used here.

GATA4 regulates cardiogenesis through the expression of its target genes, only some of which have been identified. We have used a gain of function model based on pluripotent embryonic ectoderm explants from Xenopus embryos expressing GATA4, to identify a set of downstream targets of GATA4 which are also regulated by Nodal, a known cardiogenic signal. GATA4 was shown to be required for the expression of target genes tbx2 and prdm1 in vivo, likely acting in a direct fashion by interacting with their regulatory regions. In addition, tbx2 and prdm1 are shown to have roles of their own in vivo, as downregulation of tbx2, a positive target, and overexpression of prdm1, a negative target, interferes with cardiac development in Xenopus embryos. The conservation of the GATA4-TBX2-PRDM1 regulatory relationship was shown in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Loss of function of GATA4 lead to downregulation of TBX2, upregulation of PRDM1 expression and failure of cardiogenesis. GATA4-deficient cells failed to form normal cardiomyocytes, with most cells adopting alternative fates and only a small minority expressing an aberrant cardiomyocyte phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis documented severe reduction of cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell transcriptomes and upregulation of transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Disruption of TBX2 function did not alter cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency but led to the formation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes characterised by defective sarcomeres and deficient calcium signalling. In addition, we show that whilst PRDM1 is not essential for formation of cardiomyocytes it is implicated in suppression of alternative cell fates. The results presented establish a conserved regulatory relationship between GATA4 and its target genes TBX2 and PRDM1 and roles for these genes in the modulation of cardiomyocyte development, expanding the cardiac gene regulatory network and providing further insight into how cardiogenesis proceeds.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, the anti-cancer properties of the supercritical CO2 extract of Vernolac remain unexplored against cancer stem-like cell populations. The current study is focused on the anti-cancer potential of Vernolac extract on cancer stem-like (CSCL) NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells, a human embryonal carcinoma-derived pluripotent cell line. Several in vitro assays evaluated the anti-cancer properties of the Vernolac extract. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the Sulforhodamine B assay, and apoptosis induction was determined by Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide staining and the caspase 3/7 activity assay. Scratch assay was used to evaluate cell migration and quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to analyze the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (TP53, Survivin) and the autophagy-related gene mTOR. Further, the free-radical scavenging activity of Vernolac extract was assessed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells were quantified using the nitroblue tetrazolium assay. Results demonstrated that Vernolac extract exhibits significant anti-proliferative activity in NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells, with an IC50 of 41.12 g/mL at 48 h, while exerting minimal effects on non-cancerous MCF-10A cells (IC50 > 1000 g/mL). Fluorescence microscopy and caspase 3/7 assay showed that Vernolac extract leads to early apoptosis in NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed the upregulation of tumor suppressor protein TP53 while downregulating Survivin and mTOR genes. Additionally, Vernolac extract inhibited the migration rate of NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells and elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These findings suggest that the supercritical CO2 extract of Vernolac exerts potent anticancer properties against NTERA-2 cl.D1 cancer stem-like cells, highlighting its therapeutic potential for targeting cancer stem cells.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Loss-of-function mutations in the XPC gene lead to a photosensitive phenotype, with marked accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage and a dramatically elevated risk (10,000-fold) of skin cancer. However, understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms associated with XP-C has been hindered by the lack of reproducible disease models. Here, we overcome this challenge using our genetically engineered human XPC knockout (KO) keratinocytes, the predominant cell type affected by UV radiation. To uncover upstream signaling changes associated with the absence of XPC expression, we quantified protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity one-hour post-UVB exposure. XPC KO keratinocytes showed significant dysregulation of PTK activity on ~100 phosphosites compared to controls. Complementary mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomic analysis performed 24 hours post-UVB exposure identified a downstream signature comprising 791 differentially expressed proteins in XPC KO cells irradiated compared to non-irradiated counterparts. An integrative bioinformatic assessment of the kinase activity and proteomic data revealed a significant perturbation in type I interferon signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway in XPC-deficient keratinocytes, which is further exacerbated by UVB exposure. These findings were validated by western blot analysis, establishing a novel disease-associated molecular signature. Given the central role played by JAK/STAT signaling in inflammatory processes, our results implicate this pathway as a key mediator of XP-C hypersensitivity, thereby highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to alleviate the disease pathology.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Background: Conventional approaches for studying feeding and reward-driven behaviours require frequent animal handling or relocation of animals to specialized chambers, inducing stress, confounding behavioural outcomes, and limiting continuous (24/7) data collection. In recent years, the Feeding Experimentation Device (FED3) has emerged as a major advance, offering programmable modes of operation, affordable costs, and flexibility for investigating a range of feeding and operant behaviours. However, certain limitations prevent researchers from fully harnessing the FED3's capabilities in a user-friendly manner. New method: Here, we present the Realtime and Remote FED3 (RTFED) developed for continuous and online home-cage monitoring of mice, video recording behaviours and fibre photometry recording. Results: Validation experiments confirm RTFED integrates well with FED3 to log and transmit behavioural events in real-time. It also incorporates event-triggered video capture through USB cameras, providing additional observational depth. Moreover, RTFED handles TTL signals to the fibre photometry system allowing precise behaviour-neural synchronization. Comparison with existing methods: A key strength of RTFED is its easily customizable architecture, enabling researchers to tailor both software and hardware configurations to meet specific experimental objectives. This flexibility, together with features such as remote data logging and email notifications that allow timely adjustments and animal welfare monitoring based on behavioural observations, substantially reduces animal disturbance and researcher intervention and labour. Conclusions: By offering a cost-effective and modifiable alternative to proprietary commercial solutions, RTFED broadens accessibility, heightens reproducibility, and deepens investigations into feeding and reward-driven behaviours in home-cage settings, ultimately improving the quality and translational relevance of behavioural research.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, whether these processes rely on common or distinct internal representations remains unclear. We conducted an fMRI visual working memory experiment in individuals with (visualizers) and without (aphantasics) visual imagery, combined with support vector machine decoding to identify regions that contained shared neural representations across the presence and absence of visual input. Critically, we applied representational similarity analysis using a multimodal deep neural network (DNN) model comprising text and image encoders to dissociate language-structured and visual-structured knowledge representations. Comparisons between visualizers and aphantasics allowed us to test the relevance of voluntary imagery experience to these representations. We found that while both the ventral and dorsal pathways contained shared representations across conditions with and without visual presentation of meaningful objects, anatomically distinct regions supported different representational structures with varying links to imagery experience: (1) the left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) encoded visual-structured knowledge representations, linked to imagery experience; (2) the bilateral fusiform gyrus, left dorsal LOTC, and right inferior frontal gyrus encoded language-structured knowledge representations, unrelated to imagery experience; and (3) the left superior parietal lobule encoded prior-knowledge-absent visual maintenance representation that were also unrelated to imagery experience. Together, these findings suggest that shared neural representations between the presence and absence of sensory input arise from multiple, functionally and computationally distinct mechanisms, which vary in their reliance on prior knowledge and imagery experience.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

CCIs are more co-expressed than any other type of intracellular interactions and, likewise, they are the protein-protein interaction (PPI) class that is more co-evolved in sequenced genomes. Similar trends of stricter regulation and evolutionary pressure are observed when comparing extracellular vs intracellular interactions mediated by G protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), whose ligand interactions are also characterized by a higher mutational burden in later tumor stages when considering somatic mutations associated with tumor clonal evolution. CCIs undergo the most extensive rewiring of their tumor co-expression networks relative to healthy tissues, more so than any other PPI type, with a set of CCI hubs highly conserved across multiple tumor tissues, and a higher diversity on healthy ones. Cancer rewiring is also associated with the formation of recurrent circuits of co-expressed CCI pairs, represented by enriched network motifs such as triad or tetrad cliques. These act as integrative hotspots to facilitate the crosstalk of distinct processes and the interaction of the cancer cell with its tumor microenvironment (TME). Remarkably, many CCI circuits are significantly associated with patient survival and are predictive of patient response to immunotherapy. CCI circuits mapping to Allograft rejection and Inflammatory response inform immunotherapy response prediction, while those related to Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition are associated with poorer prognosis. Overall, we show that CCIs expression signatures could be effectively exploited to stratify patients and, at the same time, they highlight new combination therapeutic opportunities in personalized medicine settings.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we study the progression of fold shape and the underlying mechanics in the development of the Drosophila wing disc. We present a 3D segmentation of the apical surface of the wing disc proper from larval stages, when folds grow, to early pupariation, when the tissue unfolds and remodels into a bilayer. We establish morphological metrics to quantify and resolve fold shape, introducing a definition of fold depth and width that can be used to characterize folds on a curved surface. Furthermore, we identify fibrous extracellular matrix on the apical side (aECM) that physically connects the two opposing sides of the folds. By modeling a tissue fold with a lateral vertex model endowed by an adhesive layer representing the aECM, we predict that unfolding in the wing disc is preceded by the removal of aECM. Using genetic perturbations, we confirm that aECM adhesion affects fold stability and mechanics: loss of aECM leads to abnormal fold shape and unfolding dynamics, whereas failure to remove aECM at pupariation inhibits unfolding. Finally, we show that these aECM perturbations in larval stages cause morphological phenotypes in the adult wing, demonstrating that the morphology of the wing disc folds and their dynamics help to define adult wing shape. In total, our work establishes a key mechanical role for aECM in wing disc growth and morphogenesis and advances our understanding of how epithelial tissue folds can be mechanically stabilized during development.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Many seabirds exhibit delayed plumage maturation, in which young birds spend years in visually distinct predefinitive plumages before attaining the definitive plumage of adults. Previous work hypothesized that predefinitive plumages may function to reduce aggression towards young, predefinitive seabirds at breeding colonies, an idea known from other lineages of birds as the status signaling hypothesis. We tested this hypothesis with visual stimulus experiments at a breeding colony of American Herring Gulls (Larus smithsonianus). We presented painted models of four different plumage classes (first-cycle predefinitive gull plumage, third-cycle predefinitive gull plumage, definitive gull plumage, and a Canada Goose as a control) and measured the aggressive responses of breeding adults at their nests. Breeding gulls responded with significantly less frequent, lower, and slower aggression toward the first-cycle and control plumages compared to the definitive plumage. There were no significant differences in response towards the third-cycle plumage. These results offer support for a status signaling hypothesis, indicating that substantial, mottled brown plumage --as worn by first-cycle gulls -- reduces aggression from breeding adults in colonies or foraging flocks. Future research can investigate how immature seabirds -- including third-cycle gulls -- may combine plumage, posture, and behavior to shift the dynamics of social behavior at breeding colonies.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

It has been shown to improve for example simulations of unstructured biomolecules such as RNA tetranucleotides or intrinsically disordered proteins. However, the performance for folded RNA structures was not specifically explored. In this study, we present extensive testing of the OPC water model on three different RNAs with highly intricate tertiary structures - the ribosomal L1 stalk RNA-protein protuberance, the mini tetraloop-tetraloop receptor (miniTTR-6) folded RNA, and the GAAA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor homodimer. The OPC performance is directly compared against SPC/E, TIP3P, OPC3, and TIP4P-EW water models along with the common OL3 AMBER RNA force field (FF). We found substantial effect of the water model on simulation behavior. For all three systems, we observe large-scale unfolding of the RNA, and even loss of the L1 stalk protein-RNA interface, when simulated with the OPC. In contrast, the simulations are entirely stable with the three-point water models. The underlying cause seems to be the higher affinity of the OPC waters to H-bond donor and acceptor groups of the RNA, disrupting the native solute-solute interactions. An identical issue can be observed also for the similar and widely used TIP4PD water model combined with the DES-Amber RNA FF. Our findings suggest that caution is warranted when using the four-point OPC and TIP4PD water models for simulations of structured RNAs. In combination with the current AMBER RNA FFs, the three-point water models may provide more realistic alternatives.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

K.; Yue, Z.; Ball, G.; Booth, A. J.; Tanaka, T. U.", "abstract": "For correct segregation of chromosomes in mitosis, they must efficiently and properly interact with the mitotic spindle during prometaphase. For this, the locations of chromosomes in the nucleus or relative to spindle poles are crucial: chromosomes at the nuclear periphery or behind spindle poles (polar regions) interact less efficiently with the mitotic spindle and show higher risks of missegregation in the subsequent anaphase. Nonetheless, the missegregation rate of such chromosomes is still relatively low in unperturbed normal cells. Thus, unknown mechanisms may mitigate the risks of their missegregation. We previously found that the actomyosin network (PANEM) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope during prophase, and its myosin-II-dependent contraction facilitates chromosome interaction with the mitotic spindle, shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). However, it remains unclear which chromosome interaction steps are facilitated or which chromosomes specifically benefit from it. Here, we show that the PANEM contraction directly pushes chromosomes located at the nuclear periphery inward immediately after NEBD. Tracking motions of individual kinetochores reveals that the PANEM contraction facilitates the initial interaction of kinetochores with spindle microtubules, but does not affect their subsequent poleward motion. The PANEM contraction also promotes the onset of their congression towards the spindle mid-plane, but does not affect congression itself once it starts. Furthermore, the PANEM contraction reduces the volume of polar regions, and helps reposition chromosomes from these regions and initiate their congression. Impaired PANEM contraction results in defective chromosome congression and frequent chromosome missegregation. In conclusion, shortly after NEBD, the PANEM contraction repositions chromosomes from unfavorable locations, i.e. the nuclear periphery and polar regions, to facilitate productive kinetochore-microtubule interaction and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

This opal stop codon mediates a temperature-dependent balance between viral polymerase production and proteolytic processing in vertebrate hosts. Yet, why this opal codon is maintained in insect hosts is unknown. Here, we show that the nsP3 opal stop codon confers a replicative advantage to Sindbis virus (SINV) in RNAi-competent mosquito cells, but not in cells lacking RNAi. Through delays in nsP processing, the lack of opal stop codon disrupts viral replication spherule integrity and increases Dicer 2-dependent cleavage of viral RNA, resulting in higher antiviral siRNA responses to the virus. Moreover, in mammalian cells, the opal codon-mediated spherule integrity also blocks MDA5-dependent viral RNA detection and interferon signaling. Thus, the highly conserved alphavirus opal codon mediates a multipotent viral defensive strategy.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Despite decades of research, the 5-year survival rate is 50%, and strikingly, the overall incidence rate is projected to increase by 30% in the next ten years, which will result in a sharp increase in mortality. Two fundamental aspects of OSCC are that it progresses via the inactivation and mutation of tumor suppressor (TS) genes and has a cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). A major barrier in the treatment of OSCC is the lack of novel therapies clinicians have at their disposal that are designed to disrupt tumor progression by reshaping the cold tumors into inflammatory or hot tumors. To overcome these obstacles, we employed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that co-encapsulates p53 mRNA and the small molecule ciclopirox (CPX). We demonstrate that both drugs have innate chemotherapeutic properties by facilitating caspase activation. Moreover, these therapies can create a less immunosuppressive TIME in part by repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to M1-like phenotypes. When formulated together, our platform provides an all-in-one approach for OSCC, effective in both p53-therapy-susceptible and p53-therapy-resistant models. Additionally, this work provides a template for a delivery platform capable of tackling multiple mechanisms of OSCC progression and survival.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens (\"quality\") and the abundance (\"quantity\") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells.

Recent advantages in transcriptomics have enabled genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns under various environmental conditions and genetic perturbations, interpreting such data, however, remains challenging. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has emerged as a powerful method to decompose bacterial transcriptomes into sets of co-regulated genes - so-called iModulons. In this study, we present an updated iModulon decomposition of Bacillus subtilis transcriptomes, generated from a compendium of 782 high-quality RNAseq samples. This dataset includes a wide range of environmental and genetic conditions. ICA decomposition revealed 142 iModulons, that captured 80% of the expression variance.

Biophysical models have partitioned this power budget across distinct cellular processes, but these theoretical estimates have yet to be empirically constrained using whole-brain electrophysiological data. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging of resting-state human brain activity to derive empirical lower-bound estimates of electrical power dissipation in cortical gray matter. We found that the total power dissipated by currents, primarily associated with post-synaptic potentials, ranges between 10-9 and 10-10 W, several orders of magnitude lower than prevailing metabolic estimates. Using finite element modeling (FEM), we observed that electrophysiological power dissipation is predominantly confined to gray matter. Additionally, spatial variations in MEG-derived power dissipation partially correlated with regional oxygen metabolism measured by PET, yet notable discrepancies emerged across large-scale functional brain networks. These results underscore a critical divergence between electrophysiological and metabolic indices of brain energy use, and highlight the need for more integrated biophysical models to bridge this gap and better characterize the physiological underpinnings of regional brain energetics.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Yet how tissue structure changes with aging remains largely unknown. Current aging research primarily focuses on molecular changes, missing this structural dimension. Here, we present PathStAR, Pathology based Structural Aging Rate, the first computational framework that captures when and how tissue structure changes during aging from histopathology images. We applied it to 25,306 postmortem tissues covering 40 tissue types from individuals aged 21 - 70, connecting structural aging to molecular data, health records and genotype data. Without any training on chronological age, PathStAR captured non-linear functional decline of ovary, undetectable by bulk-molecular profiling. Applying it across 40 tissues, it revealed that structural aging occurs through discrete phases of rapid change (accelerated periods), with tissue-specific trajectories following three patterns: Early Aging Tissues (vascular system with major changes during the 30s), Late Aging Tissues (uterus and vagina with major changes during menopause (50s)) and Biphasic Aging Tissues (digestive, male reproductive tissues, and ovary with two periods of major changes). During these accelerated phases, most tissues exhibited shared aging hallmarks of inflammation and energy production decline, coupled with disruption of pathways governing their specialized functions. Cross-organ analysis revealed coordinated aging within organ systems and an unexpected link between digestive and male reproductive tissues. We next identified 123 germline variants associated with organ-specific accelerated structural aging, including SIRT6 variants linked to accelerated vascular decline. Finally, individuals with systemic autoimmune disease, as well as tissues with classical aging pathologies (atrophy, calcification, fibrosis), showed elevated structural aging scores.

To investigate the effect of conscious state across nuclei, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across multiple thalamic nuclei in awake and anesthetized mice during sensory stimulation. The effect of voluntary locomotion was also studied in the awake state. Surprisingly, we found that LFP traces were strongly correlated across HO nuclei in both states, which cannot be explained by volume conduction alone, suggesting the existence of shared synaptic inputs. Anesthesia significantly reduced MUA across HO nuclei, while in the awake state locomotion and sensory stimuli activated many nuclei, including those that have not classically been regarded as sensory or motor.

W.; Vaidya, A. B.", "abstract": "Complex III of the malaria parasite mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) has been validated as an attractive target for currently used antimalarials. We previously showed that the main function of mtETC in blood stage Plasmodium falciparum is to regenerate ubiquinone, which serves as an obligatory co-substrate of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), an essential mitochondrial enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis. P. falciparum can be rendered resistant to all mtETC inhibitors by provision of a bypass mediated by cytosolic yeast DHOD, a fumarate-reducing enzyme. Malaria parasite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes only 3 proteins, each a component of mtETC. However, attempts to eliminate mtDNA in transgenic parasites expressing yDHOD have been unsuccessful, suggesting the possibility that essential function(s) other than the canonical redox reactions of the mtETC also require mtDNA maintenance. Here we have tested the hypothesis that Complex III serves the dual functions of processing imported mitochondrial proteins, as well as ubiquinone regeneration. We have generated transgenic lines that conditionally express mitochondrial processing peptidase a (MPP), which is also a component of Complex III. Using these parasites, we have determined that MPP is essential even when the need for mitochondrial electron transport is bypassed. MPP knockdown also resulted in hypersensitivity of the parasites to proguanil, a drug that synergizes with mtETC inhibitors such as atovaquone. Pulldown with MPP followed by proteomics revealed the association of multiple mitochondrially targeted proteins, in addition to all components of Complex III. These results are consistent with the suggestion that Complex III in P. falciparum serves both mtETC and protein processing functions in mitochondrial physiology.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

The aim of our study was to investigate effects of PM2.5 on viability, epithelial integrity, and cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 into airway epithelial cells, and the mechanisms involved. Methods: We exposed Calu-3 airway epithelial cell cultures to PM2.5 (10, 50, and100 m/ml) and SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01) for 24 h. The viability of Calu-3 cells and epithelial barrier integrity were determined using MTT assay and immunofluorescence staining for Zonula Occludens-1, respectively. mRNA expression for inflammatory and inflammasomal genes including interleukin (IL)-8, nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65 (RelA), JNK, c-JUN, Caspase-1 and NLRP3, and viral entry-related genes such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Intracellular viral spike protein intensity and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) expression were determined using immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR, respectively. Inflammatory cytokine release was analyzed by ELISA. Results: Higher concentrations of 100g/ml PM2.5 decreased Calu-3 cell viability (p=0.02) and deteriorated epithelial barrier integrity, and 50 g/ml of PM2.5 (p<0.01) induced mRNA expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Although PM2.5 alone did not alter the expression of mRNA for JNK and RelA, a combination of SARS-CoV-2 and 50-100g/ml PM2.5 led to a significant increase in mRNA for both genes (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Moreover, our results indicated an increasing expression of IL-6 and GM-CSF by PM2.5 and PM2.5 + SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereas IL-8 was induced by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that PM2.5 impaired epithelial integrity and viability, whereas increased the mRNA expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and induced inflammatory changes in Calu-3 cells incubated with SARS-CoV-2.

The selective costs imposed by drivers on their hosts may trigger intragenomic conflict, promoting the evolution of suppressors and fueling an ongoing arms race between drivers and suppressors. Stellate (Ste) is an X-linked tandemly arrayed multicopy gene. Its copy number ranges from 3 to more than 300 among Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Global Diversity Lines. In wild-type animals, Ste expression is usually suppressed by homologous piRNAs produced from the Suppressor of Stellate (Su(Ste)) array on the Y chromosome. Derepression of Ste in the absence Su(Ste) results in the formation of proteinaceous crystals in spermatocytes, chromatin compaction defects, reductions in fertility, and female-biased sex ratios arising from under-recovery of Y-bearing sperm. Despite extensive study, the function of the Stellate array and evolutionary significance of its persistence in the genome have remained elusive. It has been suggested to be a now-inactive relic of an ancient meiotic drive system, as perturbations in lab stocks can produce Ste-mediated meiotic distortions. Meiotic drive occurring among natural variants, however, has not been reported. We established crosses between females with high Ste copy number X chromosomes and males carrying low Su(Ste) copy number Y chromosomes and found that the male progeny displayed non-Mendelian sex chromosome transmission. Importantly, deletion of the euSte array in an otherwise matched genetic background rescues this phenotype, demonstrating that Stellate is an active driver in contemporary populations.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

This process requires the segregase VCP, which mediates ubiquitinated substrate flux and couples nucleolar PQC with nuclear and ER stress responses. Functional genomics identify NOL6 and WDR55 as intrinsic gatekeepers with opposing effects on sequestration.

However, the assumption that SD directly causes neuronal injury has been challenged by recent findings with experimentally-induced SD in stroke models. The current study addressed this controversy by examining whether stroke consequences are confounded by the precise location of experimental SD initiation. Focal ischemic lesions were generated by transient distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in male mice. Clusters of SDs (6 at 10-min intervals) were induced by either focal KCl application or optogenetic stimulation during occlusion. SDs were initiated either in regions close to the infarct core (penumbral-SD; <50% perfusion) or in less compromised tissue in the same hemisphere (remote-SD; >70% perfusion). Despite the fact that all SDs fully invaded stroke expansion areas, the location of experimental SD induction had significant effects on stroke outcomes measured 48 hours after reperfusion. Penumbral-SDs resulted in larger infarct expansion than seen in control stroke mice lacking experimentally-imposed SD. Conversely, remote-SDs led to significantly smaller infarcts than stroke alone. Laser speckle contrast imaging of blood flow in injury expansion areas showed enhanced hypoperfusion responses after penumbral-SDs and larger hyperemic responses after remote-SDs, suggesting that differential vascular responses could contribute to stroke outcomes. Overall, this study helps to reconcile different prior reports by showing that experimentally-induced SDs can either exacerbate or reduce stroke-induced injury depending on the SD initiation site and further strengthens evidence for injurious roles of SDs initiating in vulnerable brain tissue.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, 134 older adults (33 with depression and history of suicide attempts, 29 with depression and suicidal ideation but no past attempts, 32 with depression and no suicidal ideation/past attempts, and 40 psychiatrically healthy controls) completed an explore-exploit decision-making task during functional MRI (fMRI). Multilevel models of deconvolved fMRI time series, time-locked to trial events, interrogated whether temporal patterns of reward value encoding was associated with suicidal behavior. Results: Suicidal behavior in general was associated with blunted ventral PFC (vPFC) value signals, but profiles varied as a function of attempt lethality. Specifically, low-lethality suicide attempts and excessive behavioral shifts were associated with abolished phasic responses to value updates in the default network vPFC and its connected regions, including the striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus. Additionally, an unexpected pattern of sustained negative value responses was observed in vPFC and striatal control subregions, and hippocampus of high-lethality suicide attempters. Conclusions: Diverging patterns of decision-related responses may reflect different paths toward suicidal behavior. Impaired value updating in individuals with low-lethality suicide attempts suggests a failure to integrate recent outcomes alongside prior experience, potentially relating to over-reactivity to stressors and a lower threshold for suicide attempts. In contrast, increased control network responses to difficult choices in high-lethality attempters may underlie cognitive constriction and consideration of a narrow set of potential solutions.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

While complement system dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, its causal relationship and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In mice, complement receptor 1-related protein y (Crry) functions as a critical complement regulator at the fetal-maternal interface, essential for early embryonic survival. Complete Crry deficiency is embryonically lethal, complicating in vivo studies of complement activation in pregnancy. Using an alternative strategy, we developed a placenta-specific, doxycycline-inducible shRNA mouse model utilizing Cyp19-driven Cre recombinase and a Tet-On system to downregulate Crry in a dose-dependent manner 9.5 days post coitus, effectively restricting complement activation to the placenta. Using this model, we demonstrate that early gestation but sustained placental complement activation impairs maternal heart and liver adaptation, reduces placental efficiency, and causes fetal growth restriction, mimicking early-onset preeclampsia. Conversely, delayed complement activation induces a phenotype more consistent with late-onset preeclampsia features without placental pathology. In early-onset preeclampsia-like phenotype, the fetal growth restriction is accompanied by placental glycogen storage deficiency, and impaired hormonal function. Maternal glucose metabolism is not affected but compensatory adaptations in lipid metabolism occur although insufficient to offset fetal growth restriction. This novel model reveals that the timing of placental complement activation dictates the spectrum of preeclampsia-like pathology, providing mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In the colon, this barrier is repeatedly challenged by mechanical distension from faeces and it is unknown whether and how the colon adapts to such stress, which could otherwise compromise barrier integrity. Here, we show that faeces-mediated mechanical distension triggers coordinated remodelling at cell- and tissue-scale, suggestive of mechanoadaptation. This response includes recruitment of junctional proteins at all three types of adhesive cell-cell junctions (tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes). We identified two modes of recruitment: stable responders (ZO-1, E-cad, plakoglobin) with sustained junctional enrichment, and adaptive responders (desmoplakin, keratin 8) with progressive accumulation during distension. Distension was also accompanied by perijunctional recruitment and activation of non-muscle myosin II (NMMII). Through genetic, pharmacological, and mechanical perturbations, we demonstrated that NMMII activation is an early and critical step for mechanoadaptation. This process requires extracellular calcium influx, and Piezo1 activation is sufficient to trigger NMMII activation and junctional recruitment. Loss of NMMII function abrogated the junctional response to distension across all three junctional complexes, including desmosomes, resulting in disorganised junctions and barrier breach. Together, our findings uncover a robust physiological mechano-adaptive response of the adult colonic epithelium to an extrinsic mechanical stress, whereby coordinated reinforcement of all junctional complexes, controlled by myosin II and mechanosensitive calcium influx, plays an essential role in preserving intestinal barrier integrity.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

I.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are highly adaptable organelles that change their shape, distribution, and movement to meet cellular needs. We investigate how EGF stimulation remodels mitochondrial behavior in human A431 carcinoma cells, where EGF suppresses proliferation but enhances calcium signaling and cell motility. EGF triggers mitochondrial fission, resulting in smaller, more mobile mitochondria that relocate to the tips of newly formed filopodia. Mitochondrial transport involves Kif5B (microtubule-based) and Myo19 (actin-based) motor proteins, which are regulated differently by calcium. EGF stimulation increases cytosolic calcium, weakening Kif5B-mediated transport and making Myo19 the primary transporter. Mitochondrial calcium uptake through the MCU channel is essential for redistribution, shape changes, and filopodia extension. Disrupting mitochondrial fission or calcium buffering impairs mitochondrial motility and the formation of filopodia. High-resolution imaging reveals the coordinated transport of mitochondria, involving fission, motor switching, and localized calcium signaling. We provide insights into how mitochondrial transport supports actin remodeling and protrusive activity, with implications for cell migration and therapies targeting mitochondrial-cytoskeletal interactions.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

The discovery and development of alternative anti-schistosomal small molecules most often relies on phenotypic (whole-organism) screening, whereas target- or protein-first-based discovery options are hampered by a paucity of genetic interrogation strategies and a complex biology. Here, we demonstrate the application of photoaffinity labeling (PAL) as a chemical biology strategy to probe protein target-ligand interactions in the schistosome. Using a triazolopyrimidine (TPD) probe that binds tubulin, we established a PAL workflow with living Schistosoma mansoni worms. The probe elicited deleterious phenotypic responses consistent with the TPD series and, upon UV light activation, covalently labeled tubulin as identified by proteomics. Specific concentration-dependent engagement of tubulin was confirmed using a photostable competitor TPD. When applied directly to worm lysates, the PAL workflow produced non-specific labeling, suggesting that the conformation of the protein target is important for ligand binding. The successful application of PAL for a metazoan is, to our knowledge, novel, and the platform should prove generally applicable to identifying potential drug targets, and exploring protein-ligand interactions, in schistosomes and other organisms.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Using in-vivo transplantation assays, single-cell transcriptomics, and chromatin accessibility profiling, we show that SCI suppresses canonical stress-induced transcriptional programs in HSCs, including those governing cell cycle progression and DNA repair. These transcriptional changes are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling, with reduced chromatin accessibility at key genomic loci required for genome maintenance. Functionally, SCI HSCs exhibit impaired proliferation, persistent DNA damage, and an inability to resolve oxidative stress, even in the absence of ongoing injury.

Although gene expression-based stratification has advanced our understanding of molecular subtypes, it often overlooks the regulatory mechanisms driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms are governed by gene regulatory networks - complex systems of transcription factors and other regulators that control gene expression. To investigate regulatory heterogeneity at the patient level, we inferred individual gene regulatory networks for over 9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas enabling a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of inter-patient regulatory variation. Our analysis uncovered novel regulatory subtypes and revealed recurrent dysregulation of the PD-1 signaling pathway in 23 cancer types. This dysregulation was associated with patient outcomes in 12 cancers and appeared largely independent of established molecular subtypes and immune cell composition, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms. We identified both well-characterized (FOS, JUNB, ATF3) and previously unrecognized (RFX7, ELF1, NFYA, NFYC) transcriptional regulators of PD-L1 (CD274), highlighting new candidate targets for modulating immune checkpoint activity across tumor types.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), widely used as delivery vehicles in biomedical science, are emerging as a promising tool to supplement coral nutrition. However, physiological impacts of LNPs on cnidarians, including uptake, nutritional value, and holobiont response, remain largely unexplored. Here, we delivered empty, phosphatidylcholine LNPs to both symbiotic and aposymbiotic Exaiptasia diaphana, an anemone model for corals, and analyzed the host proteomic response via mass spectrometry. LNP supplementation elicited broad proteome shifts, with notable overlap between symbiosis- and LNP-induced protein expression. Proteins involved in lipid catabolism, lipid transport, {beta}-oxidation, lysosomal function, and protein translation were significantly more abundant, consistent with enhanced lipid processing and metabolic activity. LNP supplementation, like symbiosis, suppressed both asexual reproduction and the expression of a suite of predation- and digestion-associated venom proteins and proteases, suggesting a conserved sated phenotype in response to lipid supply. Variations in feeding frequency with Artemia had minimal impact, indicating that LNPs can be a robust supplement irrespective of primary feeding regime. These data demonstrate that adult Exaiptasia are capable of direct uptake of LNPs, offering a tool for probing lipid metabolism, signaling and symbiotic function in cnidarians.

In this study, we reveal that the CENP-A chaperone HJURP directly binds to the C-terminal domain of chicken CENP-C in vitro and that this interaction is essential for new CENP-A incorporation in chicken DT40 cells. While existing models have suggested that HJURP is recruited by the Mis18 complex (Mis18C), here, we propose that CENP-C and Mis18C provide dual recruitment pathways for HJURP localization to centromeres in DT40 cells. We demonstrate that both HJURP localization and new CENP-A incorporation are completely abolished in Mis18C knockout cells expressing an HJURP mutant lacking CENP-C binding ability.

This approach enables precise quantification of TE transcripts at the locus level. By integrating p53 ChIP peaks with differentially expressed TE transcripts, we identified retroelements directly regulated by p53. Applying this framework to lung fibroblast IMR90 and colon cancer HCT116 cells treated with p53 activators, we observed a striking pattern: TEs were predominantly activated in normal IMR90 cells but repressed in HCT116 cancer cells. Analysis of 24 transcriptomes and 10 cistromes further confirmed this trend, distinguishing normal from cancer cell regulation. At the family level, normal cells showed broad TE upregulation, whereas cancer cells exhibited selective repression of Alu and LINE elements, with weaker effects on endogenous retroviruses.

These results provide novel insight into immune exclusion and tumor-immune interactions that drive tumor progression, highlighting potential avenues for therapeutic development. Thus, SpaGene extends the power of spatial transcriptomics by delivering spatially resolved, enhanced transcriptome data that enable deeper biological understanding.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

They incorporate metal ions as vital cofactors to catalyze biochemical reactions, stabilize protein structures, and mediate electron transfer. Given their prevalence and importance, identifying metal-binding sites within proteins remains a challenging task, due to the intricate complexity of the protein environments and the promiscuous binding behavior of metal ions. Although computational approaches for predicting metal-binding sites have been developed for decades, their performance often suffers from limited accuracy due to constrained methodologies and data scarcity. Here, we introduce PRIME, a hybrid deep learning framework that harnesses both evolutionary and structural signals to predict metal-binding sites with high accuracy and efficiency. PRIME employs protein language models (PLMs) and pre-trained structure models (PSMs), following the paradigm of deep representation learning, to extract essential information of protein sequences and structures. PRIME integrates a novel probe generation algorithm that bridges sequence- and structure-based predictions by efficiently scanning candidate binding sites. The resulting framework achieves superior accuracy across a wide range of metal ions, including both abundant ions such as Zn2+ and Ca2+ and less abundant ions such as K+ and Na+, surpassing the performance of existing methods. In addition, ablation analysis shows that PSMs significantly enhance the accuracy of metal-binding site prediction. Case studies on AlphaFold2 models, along with the high prediction speed of PRIME, further demonstrate its potential for high-throughput applications in metalloproteomics.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Images were curated, preprocessed, and augmented to ensure consistency and generalization. Seven pre-trained CNNs and a lightweight custom architecture, Repro Cycle Net (RCN), were evaluated. All models achieved accuracies above 75%, with RCN exceeding 83% and showing the lowest test loss, highlighting its efficiency despite a simple four-layer design. Saliency map analyses revealed that classification relied on perivaginal features, while irrelevant regions such as the fur area were largely ignored. Importantly, binary classification of estrus versus non-estrus directly informs mating feasibility, underscoring the immediate utility of this method for reproductive studies and colony management.

In the experiments, we measured the horizontal expansion over time, the proportion of living cells, and the colony biofilm aspect ratio, to quantify the colony biofilm size, composition, and shape, respectively. We modelled colony biofilm expansion using a thin-film extensional flow mathematical model. Fitting five unknown model parameters to mean experimental data revealed that nutrient uptake decreases and biofilm--substratum adhesion strength increases on harder agar. Sensitivity analysis, fitting to individual replicates, and synthetic data analysis confirmed that increased biofilm--substratum adhesion is the most consistent effect of harder agar.

Here, we evaluated tumor Q subpopulations in patient-derived GBM xenograft tumors using live cell reporters, DNA label retention assays, and single cell genomics. Compared to adult neural stems cells (NSCs), GBM Q populations contain hybrid transcriptional states composed of networks found in both dormant and activated adult NSCs, resulting in constitutive expression of key Q egress transcription factors and their targets (e.g., AP-1 and CCND1/2). As a result, even the longest Q-residing cells (~12 days) in xenograft tumors continuously cycle and fail to enter dormant Q states.

The aims of the study were to test this hypothesis and to determine whether IL-17A was involved. Mature Sprague-Dawley male rats (n=36) were randomized into 4 groups. Three groups received BTX injections in right masseter and temporalis muscle. One BTX group was treated with an anti-IL17A antibody for 31 days (BTX31+antiIL17A).

However, the impact of autoregulation mechanisms on local vascular responses and microcirculatory perfusion remains poorly understood. Given that impaired autoregulation is common in pathologies such as ischemic stroke, quantifying vessel-level responses can help to inform clinical strategies. Here, we present a novel in silico model that incorporates static myogenic and endothelial regulatory mechanisms to simulate CBF in large microvascular networks derived from realistic surface vasculatures of mice with and without leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs). We assessed the role of autoregulation mechanisms under three conditions: i) healthy autoregulation, ii) ischaemic stroke and reperfusion with altered vascular reactivity, and iii) chronic autoregulation dysfunction after stroke. For healthy autoregulation, our model reproduced the classic static autoregulation curve and identified the dominant contribution of surface arteries in buffering pressure changes. Networks with lower descending arteriole density exhibited more extensive arterial dilations, reflecting the topological influence on vessel diameter changes. During reperfusion after stroke, we investigated the interplay between LMCs and parameters governing the vasoreactive response. While LMCs play a crucial role in maintaining residual perfusion in adjacent regions during MCA occlusion, our results suggest that their extent alone does not substantially influence perfusion after recanalization. Instead, alterations in myogenic reactivity emerged as the key contributor to hyperperfusion, underscoring the importance of regulatory mechanisms in determining reperfusion outcomes. To mimic chronic autoregulatory dysfunction, we progressively impaired regulatory capacity in arteries on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) side, reflecting the territory previously affected by stroke. The loss of autoregulation in proximal vessels significantly disrupts capillary perfusion and alters the autoregulation curve. To our knowledge, this is the first in silico study to explore cerebral autoregulation at the microvascular level under both physiological and pathological conditions. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how individual vessel behavior shapes global flow regulation and highlight myogenic tone as a potential therapeutic target to reduce reperfusion-related complications in stroke.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Since nearly 1 in 4 adults aged 65 years or older are socially isolated, there is a strong need to understand how repeated social stress negatively impacts health outcomes. Using a nonhuman primate model of social aging (i.e., marmosets), we examined whether individuals transitioning into old age (peri-geri) or individuals who were already geriatric (very-geri) showed differences in measures of hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) activity, markers of metabolic and immune function, and reunion social behavior in response to repeated social separation challenges (SSC). We found female marmosets, especially peri-geri females, had higher HPA reactivity and better HPA recovery than male marmosets, but this difference diminished in older, very-geri marmosets. HPA activity was correlated with multiple outcomes including locomotive behavior and grooming, changes in blood glucose levels, and neutrophil counts. Moreover, marmosets who approached their partner more and were groomed less during reunions had higher cortisol levels the following day. Interestingly, we found two distinct HPA profiles among our marmosets with half showing strong HPA responses (reactors) and the other half showing little or no HPA response (non-reactors). Non-reactors had less weight gain/more weight loss; elevated levels of calcium, phosphorus, and white blood cells; and received less grooming and social contact time during reunion. Overall, old-aged marmosets who show attenuated HPA responses may have different vulnerabilities to negative health and behavioral outcomes during social stress, and male marmosets appear more likely to present with this HPA non-reactor phenotype earlier in aging.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

I assessed microclimate and examined its effects on leaf morphological traits and plant productivity of A. crustacea ssp. crustacea across two sites in Alameda County, California. At the site of higher sunlight and less soil moisture (VWC), leaves had a greater mass per area (LMA) and were more steeply angled, and photosynthesis was significantly higher (11.14 {micro}molCO2/m2s) than leaves at the site of less sunlight and more VWC (7.94 {micro}molCO2/m2s). Results from linear mixed models showed that light level was the overall strongest predictor variable for plant traits, with vapor pressure deficit and VWC also contributing to LMA, and leaf temperature and leaf angle distribution also influencing photosynthesis. Overall, no individual microclimatic variable was the sole contributing predictor of a leaf morphological trait or photosynthesis. Rather a combination and interaction of microclimatic conditions influenced plant functional traits, though some conditions had greater influence than others. The functional traits of A. crustacea ssp. crustacea adjusted in response to microclimatic factors, showing intraspecific trait variation (ITV) of this species.

An ordinary differential equation model is developed to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection, incorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity, humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis reveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and intrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up to five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease states may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation mainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the complexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure demonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6 levels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression show delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period and disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute response to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role, while immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune self-activation. Subsystem analysis identifies the three-component subsystem of viral load, innate immunity, and cellular immunity as core drivers of bistability and oscillations, while humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 primarily modulate response amplitude and timing.

Using self-administration, noncontingent methods, and pose-estimation, we demonstrate that incentive salience, not psychomotor sensitization or tolerance, drives the escalation of cocaine self-administration in heterogenous stock rats. Individual differences in psychomotor sensitization or tolerance were found to have no effect on cocaine intake. Incentive salience as measured by locomotion and active lever entrances per meter occurring before the self-administration session began (pre-lever) during Short Access was found to predict intake during Long Access. Both pre-lever locomotion and active lever entrances per meter were found to increase during Long Access and after two-to-three days of abstinence. Critically, rats with low pre-lever activity during Short Access escalated both their intake and pre-lever measures by the end of Long Access to levels comparable with high pre-lever activity rats who maintained their elevated responding. These findings support the notion that incentive salience during Short Access is a catalyst to escalated use and an early marker of addiction vulnerability. Moreover, they suggest that individuals initially resistant to incentive salience can, with sufficient exposure, become sensitized and escalate cocaine use to the same level as more susceptible individuals. Analysis of pre-lever activity offers a novel longitudinal behavioral marker to predict vulnerability and provides a framework for understanding individual trajectories of addiction.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

To address the above question, we locally induced alternating ON/OFF periods during wakefulness using optogenetics in mice. This led to a local, ipsilateral reduction of slow-wave activity and synchrony during subsequent sleep and to reduced markers of synaptic strength.

For multimodal datasets, BrAVe establishes spatially resolved correspondence across modalities within a common reference space, allowing the identification of molecularly defined neurons and the discovery of functionally associated circuits. BrAVe further bridges scales by matching neuronal reconstructions from light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM), enabling assignment of LM neuronal types for EM datasets, and leveraging EM synaptic connectivity to refine mesoscale wiring.

Here, we use high-content screening (HCS) for morphologic and pseudotemporal profiling of single-cell EBV reactivation and DDR dynamics spanning seven lytic induction treatments in nine B cell lymphoma models. We generated an atlas (>750,000 cells) of spatiotemporally distinct phenotypes of immediate-early (IE) and late lytic proteins, viral and cellular DNA replication, and double-stranded break (DSB) DDR factors. Single-cell segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering identify treatment- and model-dependent cell responses and lytic induction. Notably, genotoxin-induced DDR profiles differ in lytic versus latent cells, and lytic protein localization varies across pharmacologic and physiologic stimuli. Pseudotime trajectories of physiologic reactivation reveal viral replication compartment (VRC) nucleation and expansion alongside concomitant host DDR localization. The early DDR marker {gamma}H2AX is depleted from VRCs but widespread across host chromatin throughout reactivation. Surprisingly, the lytic-essential late DDR protein 53BP1 is present in lytic cells prior to viral genome replication but subsequently absent from VRCs and host chromatin, indicating spatial and kinetic DDR dysregulation during EBV reactivation. Collectively, these data support a model wherein EBV transiently employs host DSB DDR mediators to initiate genome replication while a host-targeted DDR is initiated but impaired. We further demonstrate biological generalizability and utility of the method across confocal and epifluorescence systems.

Isolates from diarrheic (n=24) and non-diarrheic (n=16) calves were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, but susceptible to gentamicin, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and streptomycin. Multidrug resistance was found in 54.2% of diarrheic isolates and 50% of non-diarrheic isolates. E. coli may cause calf diarrhea, influenced by season, age, health, and timing of colostrum feeding. The effective antibiotics identified were gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, and streptomycin. Further characterization of E. coli in calves is needed to enhance calf health and antibiotic stewardship.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

The present study investigated the development of infants' emotional vocalizations across the first year of life, with a specific focus on their acoustic properties. Analyses revealed systematic age-related changes in acoustic features, with pronounced shifts in pitch height, spectral clarity, and formant stability occurring between 3-6 and 6-9 months. These findings mark the second half of the first year as a key milestone in the development of vocal communication. Linear discriminant analysis confirmed improved age classification beyond this stage. Emotional valence was encoded in distinct acoustic profiles, particularly involving spectral energy, pitch, vocal intensity, and resonance. Negative vocalizations, especially in younger infants, exhibited consistently higher pitch and intensity, along with stable acoustic signatures over time, suggesting their function as early, distinct affective signals. Valence-specific developmental trajectories were also identified. While formant frequency changes typically clustered around the 6-month age, an earlier shift was evident in positive vocalizations, adding nuance to general developmental trends. Taken together, these findings challenge the notion of full emotional neutrality in preverbal vocalizations and suggest that emotional valence is partially encoded in stable acoustic parameters. Such cues may complement contextual information in supporting caregivers' interpretation of infants' emotional states. This work contributes to understanding how functional flexibility emerges through the developmental tuning of prosody and further calls for research into whether adults can reliably decode emotion from vocal signals alone, shedding light on the perceptual foundations of early social communication.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

It is characterized by developmental regression during infancy, including loss of speech, gait abnormalities, intellectual disability, seizures, respiratory issues, and stereotypic hand movements. RTT is mainly caused by spontaneous, non-inherited mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene located on the X chromosome. Despite considerable scientific progress, no effective treatments currently exist for MECP2-related pathology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which selectively bind and inhibit specific RNA targets, have recently emerged as promising therapeutic agents. This study investigated the effects of ASO-mediated inhibition of miR132-3p on MECP2 mRNA expression in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to evaluate its therapeutic potential in RTT. Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in miR132-3p expression 6 hours after transfection with Mixmer and 2'OMe-modified ASOs. Correspondingly, MECP2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in all ASO-treated groups, with the most prominent increase observed at 12 hours post-transfection in the 2'OMe group. This time-dependent inverse relationship between miR132-3p and MECP2 expression supports the regulatory interaction between them. These findings suggest that 2'OMe-modified ASOs targeting miR132-3p may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for RTT and warrant further in vivo investigation.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. While accurate, these models are computationally intensive and often require high-end GPUs to process the vast volume of raw signal data. This presents a significant challenge for real-time processing, particularly on edge devices with limited computational resources, ultimately restricting the scalability and deployment of nanopore sequencing in resource-constrained settings. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Despite this, few studies have incorporated these large molecules in speciation calculations, probably due to a lack of experimental measurements. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that metal complexes of small molecules are bioavailable. Due to the limitations posed by analytical techniques, thermodynamic models can serve as an excellent alternative to experimental measurements of metal speciation. In this work, we predict metal speciation for several biologically relevant metals incorporating complexes with proteins, peptides and small molecules. We supplemented experimental measurements from the literature with linear free energy estimates to fulfill the inventory of stability constants required to perform these calculations. In addition to evaluating the speciation of naturally present metals, we also predict the speciation of metals used for therapeutic applications like anticancer drugs, antidiabetics and antacids. Our results indicate that metal speciation is heavily dependent on pH and chelator concentration and can change drastically as metals move from blood plasma to inside cells. Additionally, metal speciation can be dominated by proteins like transferrin and is subject to change as metals cross the blood-brain barrier. Our results corroborate many experimental measurements and can help design future experiments investigating the biological impact of metal-based drugs and metal-toxicity.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In this paper, we develop RamanBot, a low-cost, easy-to-assemble, and automated Raman spectroscopy system designed for efficient signal collection from samples stored in different types of containers. For the first time, the proposed device introduces the Cartesian motion system, commonly used in 3D printers, to Raman spectroscopy automation. This is achieved by replacing the extrusion head of a commercially available 3D printer with a novel designed \"Raman Head\". The Raman head integrates all the necessary optical components required for in-place sample excitation and signal collection. A multimode fiber is used to deliver the excitation laser to the Raman head, whereas the collected Raman signal is delivered to the spectrometer via a fiber bundle. The motion system is programmed to scan predefined sample arrangements using the standard programming language for computer numerical control (G-code). The effect of movement precision on the Raman signal is studied. The introduced device is used in the quantitative analysis of ethanol and methanol. In addition, RamanBot is used to screen six eggs in their commercial packaging with minimal human intervention.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) is particularly attractive for load-bearing applications but does not degrade at the same rate as new tissue formation, which may compromise functional regeneration. This study presents a strategy for cell-mediated scaffold remodeling by incorporating a protease-cleavable peptide directly into the PCL backbone. Linear peptide-PCL conjugates were synthesized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacers flanking the peptide to enhance protease access. A functional proteomics approach was used to identify a fast-degrading peptide sequence (Fast) selectively cleaved by multiple cell types. Conjugates containing Fast or its scrambled control (ScrFast) were combined with an RGDS-PCL conjugate and fabricated into scaffolds. Including Fast and ScrFast peptides did not impair cell adhesion to the scaffolds. Cy3 labeling enabled real-time quantification of scaffold degradation in the presence of collagenase or human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Fast-PCL scaffolds degraded significantly faster than ScrFast-PCL in both conditions, demonstrating sequence-dependent and cell-directed resorption. Integrating protease-sensitive peptides into the polymer backbone is therefore an effective approach to fabricate solid scaffolds that degrade in response to cells. This platform can be adapted to couple cellular processes to scaffold remodeling to enhance tissue regeneration.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we leverage matched transcriptomic and epigenomic data from the ENCODE EN-TEx project, spanning ~30 human tissues, to comprehensively profile pseudogenes and compare them to protein-coding transcripts and lncRNAs. Our analyses reveal epigenetic differences among pseudogene biotypes. Even when transcribed, processed pseudogene--unlike protein-coding transcripts and unprocessed pseudogenes--lack canonically active histone marks and open chromatin signatures at their promoters. Instead, these regions are frequently associated with retrotransposon sequences, enriched for YY1-binding sites, and often engage distal enhancer-like elements through long-range genomic contacts. These findings suggest that processed pseudogenes may adopt regulatory mechanisms akin to transposable elements such as LINEs, relying on YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter looping or other distal interactions to facilitate transcription. By publicly releasing our catalog of pseudogene promoter regions, we provide a comprehensive resource for investigating the epigenetic and functional roles of pseudogenes in the human genome.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Methods: We developed VirTrack, a computational framework that integrates experimentally validated EBV-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with clinical type-specific peripheral blood transcriptomes from Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS), Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS), and Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) (GSE136411). VirTrack (i) anchors viral interactions in differentially expressed genes (DEGs), (ii) ranks EBV targeting of DEGs and host hubs, and (iii) applies machine learning-based clustering to identify clinical type-specific functional pathways influenced by EBV. Results: EBV engagement was clinical type-dependent. In early MS (CIS and RRMS), EBV targeted approximately 13--18% of dysregulated genes, enriching for B-cell-related processes, Toll-like receptor signaling, and infection-like inflammatory pathways, while suppressing antiviral and NF-{kappa}B responses. Progressive clinical types exhibited fewer viral connections but distinct mechanistic shifts: SPMS was characterized by suppression of vascular and cardiac repair-associated pathways, whereas PPMS was dominated by upregulation of vacuolar and lysosomal remodeling processes. Hub analyses revealed a stable core of influential EBV proteins, EBNA-LP (consistently top-ranked), BZLF1, BVLF1, LMP2, and BDLF4, while BNLF2A showed broad but less hub-focused targeting and LMP1 ranked low across types. Conclusion: EBV shapes MS through dynamic, clinical type-specific perturbations, driving strong immunomodulation in early disease and selective cellular remodeling during progressive types. VirTrack identifies key viral proteins and host pathways for stage-tailored therapeutic targeting, supporting early EBV-directed interventions and revealing potential links to vascular comorbidity in progressive MS types. More broadly, VirTrack offers a generalizable, systems-level framework for elucidating viral contributions across complex human diseases.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a potential mechanism for affinity enhancement.

To date, strategies targeting cancer plasticity have not advanced to the clinic due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have suggested that plasticity in solid tumors is concentrated in a minority subset of cancer cells, yet functional studies interrogating this high plasticity cell state (HPCS) in situ are lacking. Here, we developed mouse models enabling detection, longitudinal lineage tracing, and ablation of the HPCS in autochthonous lung tumors in vivo. Using lineage tracing, we uncover the HPCS cells are dedifferentiated but possess high capacity for cell state transitions, giving rise to both early neoplastic (differentiated) and advanced lung cancer cell states in situ. Longitudinal lineage tracing using secreted luciferases reveals HPCS-derived cells harbor high capacity for growth when compared to bulk cancer cells or another defined cancer cell state with features of differentiated lung epithelium. Suicide gene-mediated ablation of the HPCS in early neoplasias abrogates tumor progression. Ablating HPCS cells in established tumors by suicide gene or HPCS-directed CAR T cells robustly reduces tumor burden, whereas ablation of a differentiated lung cancer cell state had no effect. We further demonstrate that the HPCS gives rise to therapy-resistant cell states, whereas ablation of the HPCS abrogates resistance to chemotherapy and oncoprotein-targeted therapy. Interestingly, an HPCS-like state is ubiquitous in regenerating epithelia and in carcinomas of multiple other tissues, revealing a convergence of plasticity programs. Our work establishes the HPCS as a critical hub enabling reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states, including acquisition of states adapted to cancer therapies.

Another archetype, termed \"normal-like\", was associated with similar features to normal tissue, an anti-tumor immune response, and lacked enrichment for driver mutations compared to other archetypes. We projected the PML archetypes into independent gene expression datasets profiling LUAD and found that tumors closest to the proliferation archetype were enriched for multiple features of aggressive LUAD, including high tumor grade and lymph node invasion, and had significantly lower disease-free survival.

In this study, we investigated the effects of paternal nicotine exposure on glucose metabolism, and adipose tissue and liver transcriptomic profiles in male and female offspring. Despite no differences in body weight during early postnatal life, female offspring displayed lower fasting glucose and reduced glucose levels during glucose tolerance tests, without alterations in insulin sensitivity. These effects were accompanied by decreased circulating insulin and upregulation of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT), consistent with enhanced glucose uptake capacity. In contrast, male offspring showed no overt changes in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity, despite reduced plasma insulin and glucagon levels. In male offspring, liver transcriptomic analyses revealed downregulation of glucagon signaling, insulin resistance, and PPAR pathways, suggesting impaired fasting adaptation and reduced hepatic catabolic capacity.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of 11-OH-JA in Arabidopsis thaliana, encompassing its chemical synthesis, accumulation patterns, biological activity, and biosynthetic pathways. Using chemically synthesized 11-OH-JA of naturally occurring (3R,7S)-stereochemistry, we identified 11-OH-JA as the predominant hydroxylated JA derivative that accumulates following wounding. Enzymatic assays and in silico docking studies revealed that JOX1/2/3/4 exclusively catalyze the conversion of JA to 11-OH-JA, whereas 12-OH-JA is produced by distinct pathways.

This study uncovers the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in driving female-specific AD pathology. Analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD cortical tissues and in vitro AD models reveal a notable increase and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of XIST, a phenomenon not previously observed in neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, altered EZH2 levels dampen the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the inactive X chromosome, disrupting epigenetic silencing. This dysregulation impacts the RNA export factor subunit THOC2, whose levels are also elevated in AD. Cytoplasmic XIST acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-186-5p, rescuing EZH2 and THOC2 transcripts. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains both nuclear epigenetic machinery and cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation by XIST. The miR-186/EZH2/THOC2/XIST axis offers a molecular framework for understanding the female-biased vulnerability in AD, linking XIST-driven epigenetic changes with nuclear RNA export pathways via cytoplasmic XIST. Disrupted EZH2-XIST interaction reduces H3K27me3 marks on the inactive X chromosome, while increased THOC2 promotes THOC2 (TREX) binding to XIST, maintaining the harmful feedback.

G.; Filipchuk, A.; Destexhe, A.", "abstract": "Cortical population events, short-lived patterns of neuronal activity that recur with some consistency, are central to sensorimotor coordination. These reproducible firing patterns are often attributed to attractor dynamics, supported by strong mutual connectivity. However, using multi-modal datasets - including 2-photon imaging, electrophysiology, and electron microscopy - we show that these reproducible patterns do not involve strongly interconnected neurons. Instead, we show that cortical networks exhibit hierarchical modularity, with core neurons acting as high-information-flow nodes positioned at module interfaces. These cores funnel activity but lack structural signatures of pattern completion units expected in an attractor network. Using computational models, we find that distance-dependent connectivity is necessary and sufficient to generate the modularity and transient reproducible events observed in cortex. Our findings suggest that cortical networks are instead pre-configured to support sensorimotor coordination. This work redefines the structural and dynamical basis of cortical activity, highlighting the link between modular structure and function.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In the primary visual cortex (V1), such interocular conflict induces modest suppression of single neuron spiking, but the accompanying population-level dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we examined laminar multi-unit activity and interlaminar local field potential (LFP) coherence in macaque V1 during dichoptic stimulation and binocular rivalry flash suppression (BRFS). From laminar microelectrode recordings, we found that interocular conflict reliably reduces interlaminar coherence, particularly between granular and infragranular layers, suggesting altered temporal coordination across the cortical column. Strikingly, during BRFS, coherence remained reduced even when firing rates were unchanged. Moreover, interlaminar coherence is higher for perceptually dominant BRFS stimuli, indicating that coherence across V1 layers covaries with perceptual outcome in the absence of significant firing-rate differences. These findings show that the temporal dynamics of population coherence are a more stable signal of interocular conflict than spike rate modulation.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Yet, their effectiveness varies and much of their foraging can be outside of the focal crop. Bee foraging behavior is highly sensitive to the availability of alternative floral resources which depend on the composition of the surrounding landscape. To understand how foraging and crop pollination dynamics of the managed common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) are influenced by landscape composition, we assessed their visitation and pollination in cultivated strawberry fields along a landscape gradient. We also used pollen extracted from bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colony wax to understand whole-colony foraging over the blooming period. Bumble bee visits to strawberry crop flowers were very low and did not improve pollination; however, colonies in fields with higher visitation rates had more pollen from the Rosaceae family (including strawberry). We found that landscape composition affected foraging effort on strawberry at the colony level, as a lower proportion of rosaceous pollen was collected in landscapes with more surrounding pasture, while a greater proportion of rosaceous pollen was collected at sites with larger strawberry fields. Overall, our results suggest that managed bumble bees do forage on strawberry crop flowers, but they predominantly forage elsewhere, especially in surrounding pastures when strawberry fields are small. Therefore, addition of bumble bee colonies may not be economically beneficial for strawberry growers at least in diverse agricultural landscapes similar to that of our study region.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Such transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is repeatedly considered to be adaptive although experimental support for this claim is often missing. We study the adaptive consequences of TEI in the facultative predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which can form two alternative mouth forms dependent on environmental conditions. The choice of feeding structure in P. pacificus can be manipulated through dietary switching and food reversal. Recent studies showed that certain diets cause the induction of the predatory mouth form, which can result in TEI after food reversal. This memory requires the ubiquitin ligase EBAX-1/ZSWIM8 and the destabilization of clustered microRNAs. To study the adaptive potential of transgenerational memory of the predatory morph, we measured brood size as proxy for fitness. We compared naive worms, with those under dietary induction and food reversal, and found a fitness advantage for animals exhibiting TEI of the predatory morph. Specifically, after food reversal worms had higher lifetime reproductive success for up to three generations when compared to diet-induced or naive worms.

Animals with active sensory systems that emit their own signals often optimize the design and use of these signals according to context and purpose. In this study, we reveal a previously unrecognized function of Doppler shift compensation (DSC) in bats. During flight, bats actively lower the frequency of their echolocation calls so that echoes remain stable at a reference frequency (fref) despite Doppler shifts caused by movement. We demonstrate that DSC does not simply serve, as previously thought, to align echoes with the acoustic fovea, a narrow band of maximal auditory sensitivity, but in addition, suppresses background noise for detecting prey-derived signals. Using phantom echo playbacks and on-board microphone recordings, we show that bats selectively compensate for the highest-frequency echoes rather than the most intense ones. This process shifts all clutter echoes below fref, leaving the spectral band above fref free of stationary-object echoes and secures a quiet frequency band. Recordings during prey capture and noise playback experiments revealed that spectral glints from fluttering moth wings appear in this quiet frequency band and are exploited for prey detection. This mechanism enhances the high-fidelity detection of prey echoes even in cluttered environments. Such findings reveal a sensory strategy in which animals actively create silence in a critical frequency range. It represents a conceptual advance in active sensing and auditory scene analysis, highlighting how evolution shapes sensory systems to extract reliable information under noisy natural conditions.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Among various signaling pathways which are activated during tumor development, hyperactivation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) is responsible for high grade angiogenesis, polarization of Tumor Associated Macrophages, unfolded protein responses and exhaustion of T cells, which together contributes towards this therapeutic resistance. We therefore believe that MAPK targeting is expected to enhance sensitivity of highly resistant PDAC cells toward various cancer directed interventions. In this context, we investigated the impact of modulating p38MAPK on the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells towards gemcitabine. Supporting our hypothesis, our results convincely, demonstrated that indeed, p38 inhibition sensitizes both KRAS positive Panc-1 and MiaPaCa2 pancreatic carcinoma cells towards gemcitabine induced death.

Our in-silico studies, supporting our in vitro data, potentially correlated that that high expression of p38 MAPK14 in PDAC patients is associated with poor prognosis and disease free survival. Deep miming of in silico data further demonstrated that MAPK14, in association with, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways promote angiogenic programming of PDAC which render these tumors refractory for cancer directed interventions.

A.", "abstract": "The mammalian brain processes experience-dependent spatial information through poorly-understood network mechanisms thought to depend on particular network connectivity patterns and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, dedicated input connections that learn to shape information about place cannot easily explain many rodent hippocampal place cell phenomena. For example, representational drift notwithstanding, the discharge of each place cell maps to specific locations in a fixed environment, but the discharge of most cells remap to distinct independent locations across environments, despite the fact that most sub-second cofiring relationships amongst hippocampal neuron pairs persist across environments. Whereas some models of hippocampal spatial information processing rely on the dedicated input connections of a for-purpose connectome (ignoring remapping, representational drift, and maintained cofiring), other models use synaptic plasticity implemented by learning rules to alter random input connections, but struggle with either limited capacity, representational drift, and/or biological implausibility. Here, using a randomly tuned network with feedback inhibition, we examine whether the assumptions of a specific connectome and learning-implemented synaptic plasticity are necessary for diverse place cell phenomena. We find that the random network with non-plastic connections accounts for positional tuning, single place fields in small spaces and multiple place fields in large spaces, mixed selectivity, and remapping, amongst other place cell phenomena. This requires excitatory activity to be sparse and organized across stimuli by divisive normalization. Enabling synaptic plasticity only at the network connections (not at network inputs) accounts for additional place cell phenomena including overdispersion, representational drift, and memory tagging. We show by simulations and analytically that DivSparse, a random network with sparsifying inhibition can explain many features of place cell network activity, suggesting that simple biologically-plausible architectures can realize representations of spatial experience that are robust, flexible, and spontaneous.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Chronic neuroinflammation and disruption of the gut-brain axis are implicated as shared pathological drivers, but the precise molecular mechanisms connecting these conditions remain elusive. We hypothesized that a common microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inflammatory profile underlies this clinical triad, representing a point of pathological convergence. Methods: We analyzed the expression of a panel of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated miRNAs, key inflammatory markers, and glial response in postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) from patients with PD, DD, and matched healthy controls. To investigate causality and gut-brain axis involvement, two mouse models were used: (i) PD-associated -synucleinopathy was induced in dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons; and (ii) DD-like based on corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress. Mice were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and GI dysmotility, and their brain (medial prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen) and ileum tissues were analyzed for the same molecular markers. Results: We identified a conserved miRNA pattern in the brains of both PD and DD patients, characterized by the significant downregulation of miR-199a-5p and miR-219a-5p and the upregulation of miR-200a-3p. This dysregulation was strongly associated with a pro-inflammatory state, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and NF{kappa}B1, as well as changes in the glial response. Mice with -synucleinopathy in the 5-HT system exhibited a depression-like phenotype and reduced intestinal motility, accompanied by increased Iba1 and GFAP signal. Comparable effects were observed in mice subjected to CORT-induced stress. Notably, the same pattern of miRNAs and inflammatory cytokines observed in the human brain was replicated in the brain and ileum of DD-PD-like mice, providing direct evidence of a parallel pathological process spanning the gut-brain axis. Conclusion: This study identifies a specific miRNA-inflammatory axis as a common molecular mechanism connecting the pathophysiology of PD, DD, and gut dysfunction. This pattern represents a critical point of convergence that drives a shared, bidirectional inflammatory cascade along the gut-brain axis. Targeting this miRNA triad could provide a new therapeutic approach for addressing the motor, psychiatric, and GI symptoms of these interconnected disorders simultaneously.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Additionally, we perform metal speciation analyses for a bacterial growth medium to illustrate how speciation can clarify distinctions between \"stimulatory\" and \"non-essential\" metals. Further simulations were conducted for six DSMZ-listed microbial media and six chemical variants of a representative medium, using estimated stability constants where experimental data were unavailable. Collectively, this work underscores the value of integrating metal speciation calculations into microbial research to improve the accuracy of conclusions regarding metal bioavailability and toxicity.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first large-scale enamel proteomic study focused on the cave bear, spanning specimens from the Early to Late Pleistocene. A primary objective was to determine whether the ursid population from level TD4 of Gran Dolina (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) belongs to the cave or the brown bear lineage, a long-standing taxonomic debate. We analyzed specimens from the Atapuerca sites, alongside comparative material from other southwestern European localities. Using LC-MS/MS and an acid demineralization protocol without enzymatic digestion, we successfully recovered enamel proteomes from all fossil samples, including the oldest specimens. Protein profiles were obtained for each extinct ursid, enabling the identification of taxonomically informative peptides across multiple individuals per taxon. Notably, two novel single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), found in ameloblastin (AMBN) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (SERPINA1), were restricted to Middle and Late Pleistocene cave bears and may represent new phylogenetic markers for this clade. This study provides the first molecular phylogenetic placement of Ursus dolinensis, supporting its basal position within the speloid lineage and suggesting its role as an ancestral form. Our results highlight the strong phylogenetic signal preserved in dental enamel and the exceptional biomolecular preservation at Atapuerca, providing a robust framework for reconstructing the evolutionary history of Ursidae. Moreover, the consistent recovery of systemic proteins, such as serpins, underscores the potential of enamel proteomes to capture not only evolutionary relationships but also physiological signals relevant to extinct ursids.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We took the opportunity of the important plant material produced during the INRAE-ResDur program over twenty years to dissect the genetic basis of key agronomic traits using a comprehensive approach. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) modeling both additive and non-additive genetic effects, alongside classical QTL mapping and a meta-GWAS that integrates data across multiple environments and pleiotropic effects. These analyses identified numerous loci associated with important traits related to yield, phenology, and stress tolerance. Notably, several loci showed significant genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, while others showed pleiotropic effects influencing multiple traits. Overall, 39 genomic regions were detected in QTL analysis in biparental populations, GWAS with additive and non-additive effects, and meta-GWAs analysis, accounting for the 13 agronomic traits. These results provide valuable molecular markers that can be applied in marker-assisted selection or knowledge-assisted genomic selection. This study highlights a complex polygenic architecture underlying agronomic traits in grapevine, involving multiple loci with both additive and interaction effects and underscores the need for integrative breeding strategies to achieve sustainable improvements in future viticulture.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We have recently developed a large family of highly modular synthetic cytokine receptors termed velocity receptors (VRs), capable of binding key inflammatory cytokines, such as IL5, IL8, and TNF, which drive CAR T cells into an elevated motility state. These new CAR T cells sense and amplify these autocrine secreted cytokines, thereby maintaining a self-propelled, high migratory state, facilitating penetration into dense tumor cores. In this study, we systematically evaluated key factors influencing VR transduction in order to improve their stable integration and expression. We established a dual-fluorescence reporter system to allow simultaneous monitoring of both VR and CAR constructs, and while evaluating modifications to the vector construct and generating standardized infectious unit (IFU) curves under various conditions. Our results demonstrate that the attempt to reduce overall lentiviral vector size by eliminating non coding sections upstream of the central polypurine tract (cPPT) do not yield better transduction efficiency, though it is unclear if the effect is due to viral production or integration impairment. We also observed a log-linear relationship between viral dose and transduction efficiency for a subset of VRs previously tested in various mouse models of human cancer, with VR5IL8 and VR5TNF VRs consistently outperforming VR5IL5 and V5 (full length native IL5 receptor). Overall, these findings establish an optimized and reproducible framework that offers valuable guidance for the future development and functional study of VR-CAR T cells in cellular therapies for solid tumors.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how increased mechanical stress from extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening shapes endothelial cell (EC) senescence. We developed a 3D human in vitro model that decouples mechanical stress from inflammatory or biochemical inputs, enabling the study of senescence responses to tissue stiffening alone. We found that matrix stiffening induces an EC senescence phenotype with elevated p16/p21 and an immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), in the absence of inflammatory signals. This mechano-induced senescence state engaged a Notch-JNK-FOS signaling axis, and pharmacologic inhibition of Notch attenuated stiffness-induced senescence. Supporting the translational relevance of this mechanism, analysis of fibrotic capsule tissue from patients with synthetic breast implants, a model of localized, mechanically driven fibrosis, revealed increased p16+Notch1+ endothelial populations. Complementary single-cell RNA sequencing data confirmed their enrichment in Notch/JNK- and SASP-related gene programs.

Most existing models fit these data empirically without mechanistic grounding. We introduce a \\emph{quantum--mechanochemical model} in which an initial \\emph{proton--coupled electron transfer} (PCET) step, governed by quantum tunneling, primes the vesicle for fusion, while a subsequent \\emph{time-dependent mechanical barrier softening} drives the final membrane merger. The scheme consists of three states: a closed SNARE complex ($C$) that activates through PCET ($k_{1}^{\\mathrm{H/D}}$), a primed intermediate ($P$) that undergoes mechanical gating with an aging rate $\\eta$ and forward rate $k_{2}(t)$, and a reversible slip-back process ($k_{-1}(t)$) that sustains long-latency events. The PCET step is described by a Marcus-type tunneling expression with isotope-dependent mass terms, enabling direct prediction of the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) between protiated and deuterated conditions. Structural heterogeneity is included via a distribution of donor--acceptor distances. By calibrating the mechanochemical attempt frequency $\\gamma$ to reproduce the typical early fusion probability ($P[0\\!-\\!5~\\mathrm{ms}]^{\\mathrm H} \\approx 0.20$), the model generates latency probability density functions (PDFs), cumulative distributions (CDFs), and hazard rates consistent with experimental observations. Parameter sweeps show how tunneling decay ($\\beta_\\mathrm{tun}$) controls the KIE magnitude, while mechanical aging and back reaction redistribute early versus late events.

H.; Griffin, L.; Beck, O. N.", "abstract": "Older adults walk with reduced ankle and greater hip mechanical output compared to young adults. This distal-to-proximal redistribution likely contributes to the greater metabolic energy expenditure during walking in older versus young adults. Due to the inverse relationship between ankle and hip use, functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the ankle extensors may increase ankle mechanical work and indirectly decrease hip mechanical work. Although FES increases stimulated muscle metabolism, bilateral soleus stimulation may restore more youthful walking kinetics without a detectable change in whole-body metabolism because ankle extension requires less metabolic energy than hip extension. Ten young adults and 10 older adults walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s with and without FES bilaterally applied over the respective leg ' s soleus when the anterior-posterior ground reaction force exceeded 10% body weight. FES use altered walking mechanics and metabolic power similarly across age groups (all FES condition and age-group interactions p[&ge;]0.214). Across age groups, FES increased ankle mechanical power (p=0.041) and redistributed mechanical work production to occur relatively more at the ankle and less at the hip (p=0.010). The lower-limb joint redistribution ratio of older adults walking with FES was not different to that of young adults during baseline (p=0.785). Moreover, walking with FES increased metabolic power by 2% (p=0.037). FES attenuated older adult distal-to-proximal redistribution and modestly increased whole-body metabolic rate. FES applied to soleus muscles during the late stance of walking affects users similarly across the lifespan, indicating that FES interventions ought to consider a person ' s functional needs, regardless of age.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Preselection DP thymocytes were thought to be relatively homogeneous and TCR modulation during this stage had not been previously described.

To identify traits and loci associated with adaptation to these distinct host microenvironments, we conducted tissue-specific experimental evolution. Twenty independent Cm lineages were repeatedly passaged in either tomato stems or leaves to promote adaptation to vascular or apoplastic lifestyles, respectively. After fifteen passages, adapted clones were characterized for virulence and virulence-related traits. These characterizations demonstrated clear differential associations of virulence-associated traits with the adapted tissue. The majority of vascular-adapted clones displayed enhanced surface attachment, reduced cellulase activity, reduced exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, and attenuated virulence on tomato compared to the parent clone. On the other hand, apoplast-adapted clones displayed reduced biofilm formation and enhanced EPS production while maintaining their virulence on tomato. Whole-genome sequencing of all adapted clones revealed candidate loci linked to tissue adaptation. Notably, six of ten vascular-adapted clones carried two independent mutations in CMM_1284, a putative HipB/XRE-type transcriptional regulator. A CMM_1284 marker exchange mutant displayed phenotypes similar to vascular-adapted clones, suggesting a role for this regulator in vascular colonization. Together, these findings highlight the role of phenotypic plasticity in tissue adaptation of plant pathogens, showing that tissue-specific adaptation involves modulation of surface attachment, EPS production, and cell wall-degrading enzymes. They further reveal a regulated trade-off between vascular persistence, supported by strong surface attachment, and systemic virulence, which depends on bacterial dispersal and migration.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, effective strategies to directly engineer RBCs in vivo still do not exist. Here, for the first time, we report successful metabolic glycan labeling of RBCs in vivo. We demonstrate that systemically administered azido-sugars can metabolically label circulating RBCs with azido groups in the form of glycoproteins and glycolipids, with contributions from the labeling of both mature RBCs in the bloodstream and RBC precursor cells in the bone marrow. The RBC labeling efficiency can be improved by optimizing the choice and dose and dosing frequency of azido-sugars. The surface azido tags on RBCs can persist for >42 days in mice (nearly the lifespan of mouse RBCs), in sharp contrast to azido tags on leukocytes in the blood and cells in healthy tissues that decay to undetectable levels within 3 days. This in vivo RBC labeling technology does not induce any noticeable toxicity to RBCs, leukocytes, and healthy tissues. We further demonstrate that azido-labeled RBCs can covalently capture dibenzocyclooctyne-bearing cargos in vivo via click chemistry, prolonging the blood circulation of cargos from typical hours to >35 days.

However, due to the limitation of current technology, the quantitative ability of existing PEE evaluation methods in HIE situations is still insufficient. Based on the existing physiological coupling mechanism between cardiovascular parameters and energy metabolism, this study analyzed the dynamic changes of high-resolution blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during incremental load exercise and high-intensity interval training. The results show that although HR has a nonlinear response to the increase of exercise intensity, its time pattern-when analyzed synergistically with BP fluctuation-can provide reliable metabolic indicators. We used Double Labeled Water (DLW) as the gold standard for PEE determination and measured the total energy expenditure (TEE) in three consecutive days. During the monitoring period, high frequency non-invasive BP and HR monitoring was performed simultaneously, and the time integral value of SBP x HR and its ratio to TEE (i.e. Quotient value) were calculated. By dividing the corresponding SBP x HR integral value during HIE by the above quotient value, the PEE of this exercise can be estimated. Specifically, TEE can be accurately estimated by time integration of the product of SBP and HR, showing that basal metabolism accounts for about 67% of TEE. The short-term PEE rate can be solved by the differential equation constructed by the systolic blood pressure(SBP) trend function in this period, and can also be obtained by dividing the PEE in this period by the duration of this period. In this study, a new method based on non-invasive cardiovascular parameters to monitor PEE during HIE in real time is proposed, which provides new ideas and methodological support for the application of related fields.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

By directly attaching to host crops to acquire resources, they can severely decrease yields. At the same time, their underground location hides them from sight for much of their life and protects them from typical weed control methods. New strategies for parasitic weed control are needed, with host resistance among the most attractive, but the mechanisms by which hosts respond to parasitic plant attacks are still unclear. In plants, the phytohormone ethylene is a crucial modulator responding to various stresses such as flooding and pathogen attack, and our data suggest that ethylene signaling may be important in host response to P. aegyptiaca. Here, we demonstrated that ethylene plays a role against P. aegyptiaca using two host plants, Arabidopsis and tomato. Arabidopsis plants with the ethylene reporter construct (EBS::GUS) were analyzed and revealed that stress from excess water and P. aegyptiaca parasitism both induced ethylene responses in the host Arabidopsis roots. We also observed that applying an ethylene precursor (ACC) to host roots inhibits the attachment of P. aegyptiaca. Lines of Arabidopsis and tomato with mutations in Ethylene-Resistant 1 (ETR1) and Constitutive Triple-Response 1 (CTR1) have altered tolerance to P. aegyptiaca, suggesting that the ethylene signaling pathway is associated with enhanced resistance to parasitism.

Recently, we identified differential intrinsic properties be-tween thalamocortical M and L neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). L neurons projecting to mPFC showed increased hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channel activity compared with M neurons, which caused L neurons to have lower cellular resistance and shorter time windows for integration of inputs. In addition to their role in synaptic integration, HCN channels are critical for thalamic rhythm generation.

Clustering neurons based on HCN properties was sufficient to classify subnuclei with >95% accuracy, highlighting the differences in HCN function between sub-nuclei.

We propose that the brain, which is resistant to these challenges, can also learn by modulating the excitability of each neuron in a network rather than changing synaptic strengths. We show here that learning a task-specific set of bias currents enables a feedforward or recurrent network with fixed and randomly assigned connections to perform well on and switch between dozens of tasks, including regression, classification, autonomous time series generation, a game and robotic control. Bias-only learning also provides a novel mechanistic explanation for representational drift. It directly links the noise robustness of neuronal representations on short and long time scales to the ability of neural circuits to preserve learned information while remaining adaptable.

Methods: We investigated associations between perinatal factors (birth weight [BW], gestational age [GA], and head circumference [HC]) and white matter microstructure in 117 children aged 8-10 years from the UNC Early Brain Development Study cohort. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed using a fiber tract-based framework examining 54 major white matter tracts. Statistical analysis was performed using a functional analysis of fiber tract profiles. Results: GA and BW showed widespread significant associations with white matter microstructure (38 and 36 out of 54 tracts, respectively), while HC showed limited associations (3 out of 54 tracts). Post-hoc univariate analysis revealed stronger associations with axial diffusivity (AD) compared to radial diffusivity (RD) or fractional anisotropy (FA). AD associations with BW, GA, and HC were found in 30, 31, and 8 tracts, respectively. Conclusions: Using a fiber tract-based analysis approach, we demonstrated that GA and BW are strongly predictive of white matter organization at school age, while HC showed limited predictive power. The predominant associations with AD suggest these perinatal factors primarily influence axonal organization rather than myelination.

Methodology/Principal findings: Sampling was conducted in six villages of the Ankazobe district, both inside houses and outside villages. A total of 480 individuals, captured in March - May 2019 and 2020, were genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci. Our results show that genetic diversity levels were relatively homogeneous among villages and years. However, subpopulations living outside villages displayed significantly higher genetic diversity and lower genetic differentiation levels than those from inside houses, indicating larger effective population sizes outside villages in the cultivated habitats. These findings suggest more restricted movement among rat subpopulations from the houses, and greater connectivity among subpopulations living outside villages. However, overall genetic differentiation was rather low, suggesting extensive dispersal of rats at the scale of the district, facilitating rapid recolonization after local control efforts. Conclusion: An integrated approach combining flea control within houses together with measures to reduce human-rodent contact would thus appear more appropriate than rodent control only to limit plague transmission.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Cold, hot, and variable temperatures may impede nestling songbird growth due to increased thermoregulatory costs and reduced food delivery by parents. At a broad scale, temperature effects on nestling growth vary across climatic zones, but how temperature effects vary with early-life developmental constraints imposed by the timing of thermoregulatory development, competition with siblings, and the amount of parental care has received less attention. We investigated whether the effect of temperature on the mass of wild barn swallow (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) nestlings (n = 113 nestlings, 31 nests) in Boulder County, CO depends on timing of exposure during development, relative size within the brood, or level of parental feeding. We found that the effect of minimum temperature differed in early and late development (before versus after putative development of thermoregulatory independence) and may be less pronounced for nestlings that received more parental feeding. We did not find evidence that the smallest nestling in the brood differs from other nestlings in vulnerability to temperature. These findings indicate the existence of fine-scale heterogeneity in which the effects of temperature on nestling development are sensitive to metabolic constraints and early-life social environment, providing key insight into the factors that may ameliorate or exacerbate climate impacts on individual birds.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, the rAAV capsids contain heterogeneous mixtures of full-length and truncated genomes and, depending on the manufacturing process, residual host cell and plasmid DNA. Therefore, a method is needed to characterize the encapsidated DNA of rAAV in order to support process development and batch release. The emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) has achieved AAV single-genome resolution. Here we propose a Python-based LRS profiling framework to classify and quantitate residual DNA species in rAAV products. We designed a reference that contains universal genetic components that are commonly used in rAAV production, including AmpR, KanR, Rep and Cap genes along with HPV18, Ad5 and hg38 genomes. We accessed the impurities of rAAV production from public and in-house LRS datasets. Analyzing the lambda fragments supplemented in these datasets showed that sequencing introduced size biases, which couldn't be fully corrected by regression but is improvable within library preparation. Functional potential of impurities were assessed through indicators derived from long-read alignments, which enabled us to quantitatively compare impurities between manufacturing batches. We demonstrated that LRS provides informative metrics for rAAV production and can facilitate process development to ensure therapeutic product safety and quality.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Although it was hypothesized that the timing of twining is overall associated with fetal membrane configuration of twins, i.e., chorionicity and amnionicity, our understanding of early embryonic clonal dynamics underlying human twinning is limited. Here we explored the segregations of early embryonic lineages in 7 dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), 7 monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), 8 monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) monozygotic twins, and 1 dichorionic triamniotic (DCTA) monozygotic triplets, using post-zygotic early embryonic mutations (EEMs) as endogenous lineage barcodes. Patterns of the early lineage distributions among monozygotic twins revealed three apparent clonal categories, referred to as para-identical, sub-identical, and full-identical twins, which largely correlated with the amnionicity of the twins. Rather, despite conventional wisdom, chorionicity was not substantially associated with early clonal compositions, but with blood exchanges in utero. In sub-identical twins, where one co-twin was clonally a part of the other, our data suggested that the foundation of the latter co-twin was established after acquisition of a median of 6 additional post-zygotic mutations (range: 2 -13), corresponding to ~5 early cell divisions. Additional in-depth analysis on the matched placenta from an MCDA twin suggested that separation of two co-twins can precede the separation of the placenta and embryonic proper, and a single chorion can be formed even with multiclonal origin.

Yet the role of such remodeling processes in rigidity homeostasis remains essentially unexplored in computational models. As a result, we still lack proper understanding of the biological rationale for remodeling, which is energetically expensive, or of the microscopic mechanisms through which collective rigidity is maintained. To address this, we develop two complementary elastic network models in which rigidity homeostasis with complete turnover emerges as a result of mechanosensitive dynamics of filaments (edges) and crosslinkers (nodes), respectively. Both models require the following minimal ingredients: (1) preferential disassembly of edges or nodes under small tension or force, (2) a small but nonzero rate of random disassembly, and (3) energy injection upon assembly. Our models are robust to variations in random disassembly rates and can recover from drastic structural disruption. Remarkably, nodes and edges undergo diffusion even while elastic moduli and structural correlations reach steady states, showing that the models display representational drift similar to that found in neuronal activities and physical learning circuits. We propose that the cortex is an example of \"tunable matter,\" i.e., its mechanosensitive remodeling dynamics tune its edges and nodes so that the cortex as a whole can maintain robust but flexible rigidity in fluctuating mechanical environments, creating survival advantages that justify its energy consumption.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We overturn the fundamental assumption that APC-mutant tumors exist at maximal WNT activation, revealing instead that cancer cells occupy a precarious \"WNT-just-right\" zone along a signaling continuum. This discovery exposes an unprecedented therapeutic vulnerability: while normal intestinal epithelium thrives with enhanced WNT signaling, APC-mutant tumor cells undergo apoptosis when pushed beyond their oncogenic setpoint, a phenomenon we term \"over-WNTing.\" Through systematic organoid-based screening, we identified that WNT hyperactivation through multiple approaches: GSK3 inhibition, concentrated WNT proteins, or APC knockdown in GSK3-null backgrounds, selectively kills tumor cells by hyperactivating the driving pathway of CRC. Mechanistically, over-WNTing in APC-mutant cells triggers spillover into non-canonical planar cell polarity signaling, where RHOC upregulation induces ROCK1/2-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrate therapeutic efficacy across the neoplastic continuum, from adenomas to metastatic CRC, including patient-derived tumors, validating GSK3 inhibition with a novel nanoparticle formulation. This discovery enables the first cancer therapy that simultaneously enhances normal tissue function while eliminating tumors. \"Over-WNTing\" effectively treats adenomas and both mouse and patient-derived CRC, establishing a therapeutic paradigm that exploits fundamental differences in cellular WNT biology to achieve the dual benefit of eliminating cancer while promoting healthy tissue regeneration.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear how its effects vary with Fe nutritional status in pea plants. In this study, we investigated the impact of T22 on pea grown under Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions by integrating physiological measurements with transcriptomic and microbiome analyses. Our results reveal that the benefits of T22 are highly context dependent, providing significant improvements in photosynthesis and Fe/N accumulation under Fe deficiency but minimal effects under sufficiency, consistent with conditional mutualism theory. RNA-seq analysis revealed that T22 inoculation induced 262 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under Fe deficiency, whereas under Fe sufficiency, 555 DEGs were identified, largely linked to basal metabolic functions, suggesting colonization costs rather than adaptive responses. Particularly, T22 inoculation upregulated symbiosis-related genes (Nodule-specific GRPs, Major facilitator, sugar transporter-like), Fe transporters (NRAMPs, HMAs), and redox-associated genes (Glutathione S-transferase, Glutathione peroxidase) in the roots under Fe shortage, reflecting a coordinated response to enhance nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. Microbiome profiling showed that under Fe deficiency, T22 reshaped the root-associated community by enriching Pseudomonas, Variovorax, Mitsuaria, and Acidovorax, along with increased fungal richness and diversity, whereas under Fe sufficiency, restructuring was minimal and largely limited to the enrichment of Pararhizobium. These enriched bacterial taxa may act as helper to T22 by providing complementary thereby amplifying its beneficial effects under Fe deficiency. These findings demonstrate that T22 acts in a context-dependent manner, exerting strong beneficial effects under Fe deficiency while having little influence when Fe is sufficient.

Rats performed a goal-directed spatial navigation task in 2D VR to find an unmarked goal zone, and we discovered robust directional tuning of single neurons in both regions. Neural manifold analysis further confirmed population-level directional tuning in both regions, with manifolds having ring-like geometry. We found that this ring-like structure evolved after learning, in a way that the hippocampal-prefrontal manifolds converged to a shared geometry. Furthermore, this evolution of ring-like structure was preceded by the hippocampus at the trial level. It was further verified that the evolution of the ring-like structure is linked to phase locking to the hippocampal theta rhythm, particularly in the prefrontal manifolds. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spatial representations of the hippocampal-prefrontal network become aligned after learning, and also highlight the information flow from the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex during this geometry synchronization.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Using cell type-specific optogenetic input mapping and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mice, we dissect inhibitory connectivity in TRN from two major GABAergic sources: the TRN itself and the external globus pallidus (GPe). All recorded TRN neurons received inhibition from the GPe, whereas a subset also received intra-TRN inhibition. Intra-TRN inhibition arose predominantly from somatostatin-expressing onto parvalbumin-expressing TRN neurons (SOM[-&gt;]PV), revealing subtype-specific connectivity recruited by thalamic excitation to form a feedforward motif. These findings delineate a dual inhibitory architecture: local intra-TRN circuits provide spatially selective inhibition, whereas pallidal inputs deliver diffuse inhibition.

However, this high unitary conductance is not consistent across all species with invertebrates demonstrating a much lower unitary conductance. We explored the calcium activation properties of BK channels of different unitary conductance in computational models and found that mammalian channels are more efficiently activated by calcium and produce a stronger potassium current compared to the channels of lower unitary conductance found in invertebrates. The lower unitary conductance channels display fierce competition for the available calcium, which results in low activation and weaker current. Due to these properties, mammalian BK channels are more suitable to repolarize sodium action potentials, which enables more precise spike timing, and may explain why evolution appears to have favored a trend towards very high unitary conductance in mammalian BK channels. This may be an essential component of the more advanced brain functions achieved by these species compared to invertebrates.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Epidermal LCs were recruited to the injection site and took up the vectors. Moreover, we show that the presence of lactoferrin (Lf), an antimicrobial protein, enhances HAdV uptake.

We show that UBA1 mutated monocytes exhibit TNF induced cell death, characterized by RIPK1 phosphorylation, and MLKL- and caspase-8 mediated cell death. This is associated with defective transcriptional induction of NF{kappa}B target genes and reduced cFLIP(L) expression in response to TNF. Monocytes also display blunted cytokine responses to multiple Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists despite preserved TLR expression, linked to an impaired NF{kappa}B response. UBA1M41V derived macrophages exhibit an inflammatory transcriptional profile and increased secretion of chemokines that promote monocyte recruitment. We demonstrate that these UBA1M41V macrophages display impaired clearance of apoptotic bodies due to lysosomal dysfunction. Together, these findings reveal a pathogenic axis in VEXAS syndrome linking UBA1 loss of function and defective ubiquitination to RIPK1 mediated inflammatory cell death, impaired antimicrobial signaling, and defective resolution mechanisms.

Vir cells migrate while attached to the rectal primordium to create an essential connection with the intestinal primordium and complete the digestive tract. Vir contact with the intestine, through E-cadherin signaling, is required for the intestinal apical surface to undergo a transition from a cyst with an inaccessible apical surface to an open tube competent to connect with neighboring tissues. Ablation of vir cell progenitors results in a lethal disconnection between the intestinal and rectal apical surfaces due to failure of this first step in apical accessibility. To resolve the final gap in apical continuity between the intestine and rectum, vir cells develop bipolar apical surfaces, each facing the neighboring tissue. The intestine-facing apical puncta in vir require intestinal E-cadherin signaling to form and accumulate as well as to correctly partition apical proteins within vir cells.

A spectral database of kava varieties from four (4) countries in the Pacific Island region, namely Vanuatu, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Hawaii, was used for regional authentication. For samples collected within Vanuatu, spectral data were obtained from the acetone extract of both fresh and dried kava. The ANN predictive model was trained on geographical origin (countries or islands of origin), quality (noble vs tudei), and between different cultivars. ANN achieved near-perfect performance, with generalized R-Square of 0.99 (training), 0.84 (validation), and 0.95 (test) for geographical origin prediction. Class-specific accuracy was 100% for Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and Hawaii. Although Fiji exhibited lower validation accuracy (33.3%), the ANN model of a single hidden layer with five TanH neurons and 5-fold cross validation achieved near-perfect classification prediction accuracy (R2 of 0.99), demonstrating the method's robustness for geographical authentication. Notably, the model achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy) for Malo and Santo Island kava samples, demonstrating its ability to authenticate micro-regional origins within Vanuatu. For variety differentiation, ANN achieved 100% accuracy for noble versus tudei cultivars, ensuring compliance with Vanuatu's noble-only export policy. ATR-FTIR spectra of fresh and dried kava acetone extracts exhibited visually distinct patterns among kava cultivars at spectral regions of 1750 cm-1 to 1525 cm-1 and 1124 cm-1 to 900 cm-1, indicating potential for direct differentiation and fraud detection without the need for advanced machine learning algorithms or specialized expertise. These findings position ANN-FTIR as a rapid, non-destructive, and cost-effective solution for food authentication, geographical indication labeling, and export certification, supporting international standards such as Codex Alimentarius and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Background and Aims: Plants display enormous variation in the phenological traits that make up their life cycle both within and between populations. Facultative winter annual species are particularly interesting because they can adopt either a fall-emerging/spring-flowering or spring-emerging/summer-flowering life cycle at the population level via evolution or at the individual level via within-generation and transgenerational plasticity. We hypothesized that the growth hormone gibberellic acid (GA) may be a mechanism by which these plants adjust their life cycle in response to cold temperatures. Methods: We conducted growth chamber and greenhouse experiments using the facultative winter annual agricultural weed Erigeron canadensis (horseweed) to investigate the interactive effects of genetic variation; transgenerational responses to parent plant life cycle; and plastic responses to temperature, light, and GA treatments. Key Results: We found that contrary to a prior report, exposing imbibed seeds to 3-4 weeks of cold (i.e., seed vernalization) does not always result in summer annual type growth, with considerable variation found among field-collected seeds from 10 populations. Further, we found that seed vernalization and exogenous application of GA both tended to increase summer annual characteristics, interacting in ways that were largely consistent with the hypothesis that GA is a mechanism for cold-induced life cycle differentiation. Light treatment did not significantly affect life cycle traits, while parent life cycle type had marginal effects on offspring life cycle type. Finally, genetic variation among and within sites explained far less of the variation in life cycle traits than the plastic responses to seed vernalization and GA treatments. Conclusions: Our study proposes that the seasonality of this harmful agricultural weed is influenced by a GA-mediated response to vernalization of seeds during winter, yet highlights the need for further study, given the variability in this response.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

However, potato dry rot, a major potato disease caused by Fusarium species, seriously threatens potato production and quality worldwide. Chemical pesticides are widely used in agricultural practices for disease prevention and control, but their long-term use is harmful to human physical health and the environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop environmentally friendly, antifungal, bio-based fungicides. Limonene, as a main component of plant essential oils, has strong antibacterial activity and is harmless to the human body. Limonene is easily degraded in the natural environment, making it a highly promising bio-based fungicide. However, the use of limonene to control potato dry rot has not yet been reported. This study determines the inhibitory mechanism of limonene on potato dry rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum. Limonene effectively suppressed colony growth of Fusarium oxysporum (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 8.32L/mL), changed its hyphal morphology, reduced its pathogenicity, decreased its spore germination rate, viability, toxicity, cell membrane integrity, and stability, and caused abnormalities during transcription and translation processes and an imbalance in the plant-fungus interaction and its intracellular ion homeostasis of transition metals. In addition, limonene affected its stress resistance. The combined antibacterial activity of limonene and chemical fungicides showed that limonene and mancozeb had an additive effect, whereas its combination with hymexazol had a synergistic effect. At the phenotypic, cytological, and transcriptomic levels, this study elucidated the mechanism underlying the antifungal activity of limonene against Fusarium oxysporum. By integrating mechanistic insights with application prospects, this study offers new avenues for developing bio-based, environmentally friendly pesticides and a theoretical foundation for potato dry rot management.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Fluorescent microscopic analysis with a chitin-specific dye, Calcofluor white, demonstrated reduced A. solani colonization in PKM-1 pretreated with LaM (0.1%), followed by A. solani infection on par with Arka Rakshak. A significant increase in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide was observed in LaM-pretreated leaves (0.050%, 0.075% and 0.1%) at 24- and 48-hours post-infection in both cultivars. A quantitative increase in guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity was recorded in LaM (0.025%), followed by A. solani infection leaves at 36 hrs in Arka Rakshak, whereas LaM (0.010%) followed by A. solani infection recorded maximum GPX activity at 24 hrs in PKM-1. Induction of new GPX isoform was evident in LaM (0.075% and 0.1%) pretreated, and LaM pretreated, followed by A. solani infected leaves of both cultivars at 24 hrs. There was a significant reduction in disease severity in tomato leaves pretreated with LaM (0.1%) and infected with A. solani.

TCF1 is highly expressed in naive CD8 T cells but must be downregulated as T cells proliferate to become effectors. If and how TCF1 plays a role during T cell priming prior to cell cycle entry is unknown. Surprisingly, we found that TCF1 expression is rapidly downregulated within hours after antigen encounter in both murine and human CD8 T cells, even before T cells enter cell cycle. TCF1 then rebounds to high levels upon cell cycle entry, ultimately declining again with proliferation and effector differentiation. This rapid pre-division drop and rebound occurs in diverse settings, including infection and cancer. The magnitude of the pre-division TCF1 drop is modulated by TCR signal strength and inflammatory cytokines and strikingly, regulates long-term effector and memory fates. Paired transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed that TCF1-regulated chromatin regions were remodeled within hours following antigen encounter, activating effector and inflammatory cytokine signaling modules and poising T cells for effector differentiation. Remarkably, transient siRNA-mediated TCF1 downmodulation during the pre-division priming phase was sufficient to induce long-term population effector skewing. We have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby pre-division dynamic TCF1 regulation determines long-term CD8 T cell fate commitment, potentially serving as a critical checkpoint regulating T cell responses in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Understanding their metabolic behaviour in diverse food matrices is essential for improving risk assessment, spoilage prediction, and fermentation control. This study integrates isothermal microcalorimetry and targeted metabolomics to characterize the metabolic activity of B. cereus and B. subtilis in five nutrient sources: Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium, oat drink, milk, pea hydrolysate, and a combined oat-pea matrix. Metabolic heat production was monitored for 24 hours at 30 {degrees}C. In BHI, B. cereus exhibited a shorter lag phase (mean {+/-} sd: 4.3 hours {+/-} 0.8) than B. subtilis (7.9hours {+/-}1.0) but produced less total heat. Across all food matrices, B. subtilis consistently generated more heat. The oat-pea matrix supported the highest growth rates, surpassing oat or pea alone, and showed sugar depletion and accumulation of organic acids, indicating enhanced carbohydrate metabolism. Free amino acid release was matrix- and species-specific: B. subtilis had increased levels in oat, while B. cereus did so in pea. While B. cereus was metabolically active in all matrices, cereulide levels were matrix-dependent: 47.3 {+/-}1.7ng/mL in oat, 3.0 {+/-}0.1ng/mL in oat-pea, and undetectable in pea.

J.; Greer, B.; Williams, P. N.; Chin, J. P.; Hall, R. L.; McGrath, J. W.; Huws, S. A.", "abstract": "Background. The reserves of rock phosphate, used to produce fertilisers, are being exhausted by the ever-increasing pressure to meet the food demands of a growing world population. Sustainable alternatives are urgently needed, and struvite, a renewable phosphorus fertiliser recovered from waste streams such as animal manure, offers a promising solution. However, other manure-derived fertilisers have been associated with the promotion of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in soil, raising concerns about whether struvite might pose similar risks. Despite this, the impact of struvite on the soil resistome remains poorly understood. Methods. This study assesses the AMR risk associated with Xiamen struvite (XIA), produced from piggery wastewater, compared with two commercial fertilisers: Crystal Green (CG) and Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), and an untreated control soil. Following a three-month fertilisation period, rhizospheric soils were analysed using mass spectrometry to investigate antimicrobial residues in the soil, and shotgun metagenomics and culture-based assays, and bacterial isolate characterisation to identify bacterial AMR linked to the treatments. Notably, this is the first study to apply culturing methods to investigate struvite's impact on AMR. Results and conclusions. While XIA struvite soil fertilisation led to an increase in total culturable bacterial load, (CFU/g), there was no evidence of antimicrobial residues detected in soil, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. Metagenomic profiling further revealed no significant alterations to antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) across all treatments, including CG, TSP, and untreated controls. Culture-based analysis supported these findings, with tetracycline-resistant bacteria undetected and only minimal resistance observed to erythromycin, florfenicol, and neomycin. Although resistance levels to amoxicillin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim were higher in XIA-treated soils, this appeared to reflect a broader increase in microbial load rather than selective enrichment of resistant strains. These data suggest that piggery-derived struvite does not impose a clear AMR risk in soil and performs similarly to conventional fertilisers. While it appears to increase total bacterial load, there is no evidence of selective enrichment for AMR bacteria. However, variability in antimicrobial and ARG content across studies highlights the need for standardised production specifications for struvites to ensure safety and consistency. This study provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of struvite's AMR implications, supporting its potential as a safe, sustainable fertiliser and contributing valuable insights to inform regulatory guidance.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

These conserved proteins are also found in many phages, including marine cyanophages that infect the ecologically important marine cyanobacteria. However, their role in phage infection is not known. Cyanophages also carry many small genes lacking homology to known functional domains. Whether these have a functional role or not remains unknown. Here, we explore the distribution and role of a cyanophage thioredoxin (trxA), and that of a small gene directly downstream of it (g26), in phage infection. For this we used the T7-like cyanophage, Syn5, which infects an open-ocean marine Synechococcus strain, WH8109. We found that thioredoxin genes are common in phage genomes, including in cyanophages. The g26 gene, however, is restricted in it distribution to the cyanophages. The cyanophage thioredoxin is catalytically active and it increases phage DNA replication, progeny production and competitive fitness. It also negatively impacts host growth. The g26 gene product is translationally coupled to, and thus dependent on, translation of the thioredoxin gene. This gene itself significantly increases phage virulence and fitness, yet reduces burst size. Our findings demonstrate that cyanophage thioredoxins impact phage fitness and infection physiology and that small viral genes with no homology to known genes can play an important role in the infection process. These findings provide insights into the importance of unusual genes in phage genomes and show that they are likely to play an important role in the interactions between abundant cyanobacteria and cyanophages in ocean ecosystems.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

How proliferative growth of the fungus is regulated at the same time as programmed cell death, however, is unknown.

Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored trafficking of ten organelle types during appressorium morphogenesis in a wild-type M. oryzae strain and isogenic{triangleup} atg8 autophagic mutant. High-resolution microscopy using a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein revealed that organelle trafficking occurs from a single conidium cell into the appressorium, while the remaining two cells undergo autophagy. Organelle inheritance operates independently of cell cycle checkpoints but is always associated with spore germination. We furthermore defined the temporal sequence of organelle movement and de novo organelle biogenesis in the incipient appressorium using photoconvertible fluorescent localisation microscopy.

We tested the hypothesis that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induces cardiorenal dysfunction via sex-specific dysregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductases and unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. Methods: Adult female and male C57BL/6J mice [10-12 weeks] and IRE1 C148S knock-in mice underwent non-pertussis toxin EAE (nPTX-EAE) induced with 100g MOG35-55 in CFA and 200g heat-inactivated MTB with a booster at 7 days. Controls received all components except MOG. Motor scoring was done daily and EN460 (ERO1 inhibitor, 10 mg/kg IP) was given twice weekly beginning at 10DPI. Echocardiography and renal Doppler (Vevo 2100) were performed at 36-38DPI with primary outcomes of LV systolic/diastolic function and renal perfusion with tissue collected at 40DPI. LV and kidney were analyzed via western blot for ERO1, PDIA1, Prdx4, 4HNE, and BiP. Data are expressed as mean {+/-} SEM with two-way ANOVA/Tukey's post hoc or Mann Whitney test performed and outliers identified by ROUT (Q=1%). Results: Sixty-seven percent of immunized mice developed motor deficits. At 36-38DPI, EAE reduced ejection fraction and fractional shortening while increasing IVCT, IVRT, and myocardial performance index without hypertrophy. Renal resistive index increased and end-diastolic velocity decreased in addition to reduced Bowman's space at 40DPI.

Compared to spruce, lime and beech supported a higher ECM fungal richness and diversity in lime and beech compared to spruce. The ECM fungal community composition differed significantly between broadleaved species and spruce, with Russula dominating in lime and beech. Regarding fungal traits, in addition to the direct observations of hyphae and rhizomorphs, species were also scored based on literature for exploration types and hyphae hydrophobicity. Tree species had a specific association with ECM fungal exploration types, with broadleaved species favoring contact and short-distance types and spruce associating with long-distance types. The results suggest that tree species via foliar litter quality have a direct impact on soil properties and indirect to the ECM fungal community, where broadleaved tree species with nutrient-rich and rapid decomposing litter support a more diverse ECM community with limited soil exploration capabilities, while spruce supports an ECM fungal community more adapted to soil exploration.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Using simulated data, we compare rate estimates from Spinney with those using the species-tree alone, test Spinney's ability to distinguish true rate variation from spurious signals caused by gene tree discordance, and evaluate ancestral state reconstruction. Spinney consistently produced more accurate rate estimates and reduced incorrect inferences of rate variation. This method therefore provides a flexible framework to integrate gene tree heterogeneity into comparative methods and to produce reliable inferences of quantitative trait evolution, regardless of the source of discordance.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Accurate annotation of TP53 mutations based on their survival effects is critical for informed LFS patient management. Motivated by this need, we develop a new approach for Survival-based Clustering of Predictors (SCP) by identifying homogeneous coefficients in Cox regression. We formulate this task as a fusion-penalized Cox regression problem and provide an efficient computational algorithm. A nonconvex distance-to-set penalty is adopted to facilitate parameter tuning and improve estimation accuracy. To overcome data limitations, we further develop TLSCP, a transfer learning extension that borrows coefficient ranking information from a source dataset under the assumption of similar ranking patterns between source and target. TL-SCP integrates ranking information through weighted rank averaging, allowing flexibility in accommodating cohort heterogeneity while maintaining model simplicity. Simulation studies demonstrate TL-SCP's superior performance over SCP in clustering recovery and coefficient estimation. In the application of TP53 mutation annotation where we utilize non-LFS germline TP53 mutation carriers as a source cohort for the target LFS cohort, TL-SCP identifies biologically meaningful TP53 mutation clusters and offers improved clinical interpretability compared to experiment-based annotations.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In Thailand, the Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) is subject to illegal hunting and has a fragmented distribution among protected areas; however, relatively little is known about its genetic variation, due in part to the elusive nature of the species, which presents significant challenges for sampling and population genetic research. This study analyses whole genome sequences from 30 georeferenced samples across Thailand to examine population structure and genetic diversity, in order to inform conservation management and underpin the development of wildlife forensic tools. We identified four distinct genetic populations within Thailand, corresponding to the Western, Khao Yai, Mid-south, and Southernmost regions, with moderate genetic differentiation (FST = 0.06-0.14) between populations. The Western population showed elevated inbreeding levels (FROH = 18.50%) compared to other populations (FROH < 12.5%), while the Southernmost population maintained the highest genetic diversity. Geographic barriers, including the Chao Phraya River and Nakhon Si Thammarat Mountain range, coincided with strong population structure. Our findings establish a foundational genomic baseline for Sunda pangolin conservation in Thailand, identifying distinct genetic management units. The population-specific genetic signatures provide a framework for developing wildlife forensic tools to trace the geographic origin of confiscated pangolins within Thailand. These insights are crucial for implementing targeted conservation strategies and combating illegal wildlife trade of this Critically Endangered species.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

QDs, which possess both a broad excitation range and a narrow emission bandwidth, are inherently suited for multicolor imaging at various wavelengths. However, applying multicolor QD-SPT with multiple biomolecular targets has been challenging due to the limited methods for specifically conjugating QDs to biomolecules. Here, we propose a DNA hybridization-based QD labeling method that generates several specific interactions based on sequence. QD fused with 20-mer oligo DNA specifically labeled membrane lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) covalently bound to complementary oligo DNA, forming a stable label that is suitable for SPT. The combination of polyA-polyT sequence as the linker oligo caused more QDs to fuse to DPPE compared with a random sequence linker. Oligo DNA-based QD-SPT accurately reflected the diffusion dynamics of DPPE measured using the single-fluorescence tracking technique and was compatible with conventional QD-SPT utilizing secondary antibody Fab. Using different pairs of oligo DNA sequences, we successfully achieved multicolor QD-SPT that distinguishes a lateral diffusion of DPPE and a membrane protein, GABAA receptor, within the same cell. The oligo DNA-based QD labeling method developed in this study is anticipated to substantially advance simultaneous multicolor QD-SPT of different living cell membrane molecules specific to DNA sequences.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

To investigate the range of possible phenotypic changes that result from point mutations, we analyse the structure of the well-established RNA genotype-phenotype (GP) map for sequences of length 12 by developing a general phenotypic distance framework. Our analysis reveals that phenotypes are more likely to be surrounded by similar phenotypes than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, we see that generalised versions of the GP map metrics of frequency, robustness, and evolvability that take phenotypic distance into account still exhibit the same fundamental structural relationships that are observed in many GP maps. We also develop site-specific quantities for robustness, evolvability, and accessible phenotypic distance, which reveal a key insight: RNA secondary structure (SS) sites that are more likely to be neutral and access fewer new phenotypes tend to produce larger changes in phenotype when a change does occur. Robust sites therefore produce cliffs in the landscape (flat in some directions, steep in others) whereas non-robust sites give rise to more gently undulating landscapes.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Studies identified hemagglutinin (HA) acid stability and receptor preference as essential traits that shape host tropism. Mutations that increase HA stability and affinity for -2,6-linked sialic acids have been shown to confer airborne transmissibility in a ferret model, however mechanisms of activation of H5 subtype HA have not been probed and the effect of adaptive mutations on HA function has been largely inferred from static structures. Here, we use hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry to dissect activation dynamics for two ancestral HPAI H5 HA, their matched HA with adaptive mutations, and a contemporary H5 HA. By measuring dynamics, we identify variation in active site flexibility among the HA and demonstrate that adaptive mutations result in suppression of fusion peptide dynamics and stabilization of a key subunit interface involved in activation. The contemporary H5 isolated from a recent human spillover case exhibits a relatively protected fusion peptide and moderately depressed pH of activation compared to the HAs examined in this study. Our studies of activation dynamics in the H5 HAs in conjunction with prior analysis of H1 and H3 HA reveal subtype-specific patterns that correlate with adaptive mutation sites and indicate underlying physical constraints on influenza HA adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We discover - across thousands of cancer and normal tissue genomes - that mutations that most strongly increase cancer risk are enriched in younger patients' cancers, whereas mutations that are positively selected in normal tissue without causing cancer are enriched in older patients. Focusing on a particularly data-rich cancer type, acute myeloid leukemia, we show that genetic differences between young- and adult-onset cancers can largely be explained by the cumulative effects of normal tissue evolution, contradicting the long-standing notion that childhood cancers require a distinct set of causal mutations.

However, recent studies have identified Trichoderma afroharzianum as a pathogenic species, capable of infecting maize, wheat, and barley under greenhouse conditions. Its pathogenic potential in small-grain cereals under field conditions, however, has been so far unexplored. To evaluate its pathogenic potential, two-year field trials (2023 and 2024) were conducted using ten wheat, five barley, two rye, and one triticale cultivar. Artificial inoculation was carried out at full flowering using a spray inoculation with pathogenic T. afroharzianum isolates obtained from maize and water as control. Three fungicides were applied: untreated control, foliar treatment before inoculation, and ear application after inoculation. Disease development was assessed based on colonization rate of harvested kernels, and thousand kernel weight (TKW). The results showed significant differences in susceptibility between and within cereal species. T. afroharzianum was able to colonize wheat and barley ears under field conditions, with some cultivars showing significant reduction in TKW and high colonization rate. In contrast, rye and triticale exhibited much lower infection rates. Fungicide treatments had varying levels of efficacy. Ear application after flowering was most effective in reducing colonization and preventing yield loss, whereas early foliar treatment showed limited effect. These findings indicate that T. afroharzianum may represent a relevant pathogen in cereal production adding a new ear disease in cereals and requiring monitoring and enhanced fungicide applications in the future, unless less susceptible cultivars are identified and utilized in practice.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Among other factors, pulmonary inflammation and hypoxia contribute to the COPD-associated muscle defects. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms and their effects across muscles with distinct metabolic profiles remain elusive. This study investigated the independent and combined effects of chronic pulmonary inflammation and chronic hypoxia on mitochondrial function, metabolic enzyme activity and fibre type composition in oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic (plantaris) muscles. Methods Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to chronic hypoxia (FiO2=10%) and/or chronic pulmonary inflammation (induced by bi-weekly intratracheal instillations of lipopolysaccharides). After 4 weeks of exposure, mitochondria from both soleus and plantaris were isolated to measure oxygen consumption rates, reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission, calcium retention capacity (CRC), respiratory complex activities and fatty acid oxidation capacity. Cross-sections from both muscles were analysed for fibre typology, fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA) as well as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activities. Results Chronic hypoxia led to a decline in adenosine diphosphate-stimulated complex I (CI) respiration (p<0.01), Hydroxyacyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity (p<0.01), weight (p<0.05) and fCSA of type IIb fibres (p < 0.05) in plantaris. In contrast, chronic hypoxia increased CI-derived ROS emission (p<0.01) without changes in mitochondrial respiration or mass of soleus. No alterations in fibre typology were noticed in either muscle following the hypoxic exposure. Chronic pulmonary inflammation caused a reduction in mitochondrial CRC and an increase in GPDH activity in type IIa fibres of soleus (p<0.001) without any changes in fibre type distribution. Conversely, chronic pulmonary inflammation induced a downregulation of GPDH activity in plantaris type I and type IIa fibres, in parallel with an elevation in the SDH/GPDH ratio across all fibre types and a rise in the proportion of type IIx fibres. Conclusions Our results demonstrate fundamental differences in the responses to chronic hypoxia and chronic pulmonary inflammation between soleus and plantaris. While hypoxia affects predominantly the mitochondrial function and mass of plantaris, pulmonary inflammation drives metabolic reprogramming in both muscles that opposes their intrinsic functional specialisation. Additionally, soleus appears more vulnerable to permeability transition pore opening following pulmonary inflammation. Notably, these mitochondrial alterations seem to occur independently of fibre type shifts highlighting the central role of intrinsic mitochondrial maladaptations in the COPD-associated muscle dysfunction.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we elucidate the mechanism by which Arabidopsis CRY1 forms signalling-active tetramers in response to blue light using time-resolved native mass spectrometry combined with kinetic modelling. We found that oligomerization proceeds via a defined, reversible pathway in which monomers rapidly form dimers that then assemble into tetramers. A quantitative two-step model captures the dynamic interplay between light-driven assembly and thermal disassembly. Strikingly, ATP amplifies this response, accelerating tetramer formation, stabilising oligomers and tuning the underlying photochemistry of the FAD chromophore. In contrast, the Blue-light Inhibitor of Cryptochromes 1 (BIC1) binds to CRY1 with nanomolar affinity under blue light conditions, acting as a potent antagonist by not only blocking oligomerization, but also actively dismantling pre-assembled tetramers. This process is light-independent and occurs regardless of CRY1s redox state. Together, these findings reveal a finely balanced regulatory system in which ATP and BIC1 act as opposing regulators to control CRY1 activation.

The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus.

To what extent genetic changes in carotenoid-metabolism enzymes like Bco2 drive natural variation in vitamin A homeostasis remains unclear.

We compared the genetic diversity of the Narcondam Hornbill with the Wreathed Hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus) distributed from the Eastern Himalaya to Bali. We generated DNA sequences for four mitochondrial markers ; Cytochrome B (Cytb), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and displacement loop (D-loop) regions) from 14 Narcondam Hornbill faecal samples and for three markers (Cytb, COI and ND2) from 19 Wreathed Hornbill tissue samples from north-east India. Our results suggest markedly lower genetic diversity in the island endemic Narcondam Hornbill compared to the Wreathed Hornbill. Specifically, Cytb and COI showed no genetic variation in the island endemic, compared to three to five haplotypes in the Wreathed Hornbills. In the ND2 region, Narcondam Hornbills showed seven haplotypes among 13 samples compared to the Wreathed Hornbills six haplotypes among eight samples. The observed genetic diversity in the D-loop in the Narcondam Hornbill was lower than other island-endemic hornbill species in the Philippines. The extremely low genetic diversity in the Narcondam Hornbill likely stems from a small founder population and/or past hunting pressures that reduced its numbers to approximately 30% of its current population of 1000 birds, rendering the Narcondam Hornbill susceptible to environmental and human-driven changes.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

A validated FE model of the human knee joint simulating the stance phase of gait was used to characterize physiological mechanical conditions, including maximum principal stress, maximum shear strain, pore pressure, and fluid velocity. These outputs were compared with those generated by representative bioreactor setups: dynamic unconfined compression (10-30%) and combined compression (10%) with ball rotation ({+/-}25{degrees}), which were applied to both OC plugs and TE constructs, and hydrostatic pressure (0.5-50 MPa), which was applied only to TE constructs. FE simulations evaluated spatial and magnitude-based agreement with native cartilage mechanics. In OC plugs, 10% unconfined compression generated maximum principal stresses ({approx}7.5 MPa) and pore pressures ({approx}4 MPa) closely matching native tissue ({approx}4.5 MPa and {approx}5 MPa, respectively). In TE constructs, even at 30% unconfined strain, maximum principal stresses and pore pressures remained around 100 times lower than physiological values, while fluid velocities were 10 times higher.

These findings suggest that a focus on individuals with diverse and repeated antigen exposure could lead to identification of antibodies with therapeutic utility not just towards current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also distant sarbecoviruses in the event of a future spillover.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CoV polymerase template switching remains unclear. Using magnetic tweezers, we show that the CoV non-structural protein (nsp) 13-helicase drives polymerase template switching, followed by copy-back RNA synthesis. This activity requires nsp13-helicase ATPase activity and a duplex RNA downstream of the CoV polymerase. This novel function of nsp13-helicase is targeted by the nucleotide analogs remdesivir and molnupiravir, whose incorporation in the nascent strand increases CoV polymerase template switching probability, leading to defective RNA production. We propose a novel mechanism of action where incorporation of these analogs dramatically reduces full length genome copy number by stimulating polymerase template switching. Our study further demonstrates nsp13-helicase's central role in CoV replication and how this enzyme function can be indirectly targeted by analogs.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We explored the potential of a lytic phage, {varphi}HP3, as well as a phage cocktail to decolonize UPEC from the urogenital tract using in vitro and in vivo models. Phage significantly inhibited UPEC growth in both bacteriologic medium and simulated vaginal fluid. Pretreatment of human vaginal epithelial cells (VK2/E6E7) and bladder carcinoma cells (HTB-9) with phage reduced adhesion and invasion of UPEC compared with controls. Phage treatment was further able to reduce intracellular UPEC in VK2 cells. Notably, phage pretreatment did not impact phage resistant UPEC strains, indicating that phage lysis was the primary driver of phenotypes. Live confocal microscopy confirmed interaction of phage particles with UPEC and with both epithelial cell lines. In vivo, daily intravaginal {varphi}HP3 administration in humanized microbiota mice significantly reduced vaginal UPEC burden after 4 days. Treatment with a phage cocktail also reduced vaginal and cervical tissue burdens by day 7 post-treatment. UPEC dissemination was observed to uterine and kidney tissues, but burdens were not different between phage and mock-treated groups. In conclusion, we demonstrate that phage and phage cocktails can modestly reduce UPEC urogenital colonization, highlighting the potential of phage therapy as a viable treatment option for UTI prevention.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Both localize to adherens junctions; E-cadherin additionally localizes to lateral membranes and the cleavage furrow during cell division, where it promotes BC elongation and new cell-cell contact formation by controlling spindle orientation and RhoA activation via NuMA and ARHGEF17. N-cadherin maintains hepatic polarity by facilitating RhoA inactivation through the p120-catenin family member ARVCF and its partner p190B/ARHGAP5.

This study investigated the effects of sampled substrate, sampling season, and metabarcoding primer pair on species richness and taxonomic group detection in terrestrial vertebrates, with a focus on mammals, using eDNA samples from waterholes in Botsalano Game Reserve, South Africa. A total of 725 eDNA samples were collected from 94 sampling events across wet and dry seasons, detecting 95 species (45 birds, 42 mammals, 4 amphibians, 3 reptiles, and 1 fish). Sediment samples provided more reliable detection of abundant taxa, whereas water samples had higher detection frequencies of rare taxa. A mixed sampling approach yielded the highest species richness. Sampling during the wet season yielded higher species richness overall, while more mammal species were detected from dry season sampling. Overlap in species detection between the two metabarcoding primers tested was low (47%). We formulate recommendations for future eDNA metabarcoding study designs in similar systems, including remote sampling logistics and discuss potential sources of false positives in eDNA metabarcoding, including (1) secondary eDNA input, (2) incomplete genetic reference databases, and (3) the low genetic resolution of metabarcoding markers.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here we present EscaPRRS (Escape scoring for PRRS virus), a Bayesian variational autoencoder trained on ESM-2 protein language model embeddings to predict the fitness landscape and escape propensities of 52,622 mutants (recorded over 10 years) of the immunodominant GP5 glycoprotein encoded by PRRSV ORF5 gene. Unlike conventional models that estimate escape propensity only from sequence information, EscaPRRS circumvents the need for extensive alignments, integrating contributions from surface accessibility and biochemical dissimilarity at the binding interface. Our escape propensity scores demonstrate reliable structural and biological fidelity, with EscaPRRS scores correlating with binding affinities on seven different porcine receptor proteins (Pearson r = 0.74).

The need for pre-clinical models of patient-derived endometriosis lesions motivates development of a vascularizable completely synthetic extracellular matrix (v-CS-ECM) that supports morphogenesis of perfusable microvasculature in a microfluidic device, in the context of relevant lesion cells. This paper describes v-CS-ECM, a peptide-modified polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel crosslinked with a cell-degradable peptide that achieves these dual goals. Vessels form by morphogenesis after the liquid v-CS-ECM precursor, containing endothelial cells and fibroblasts, is injected into the tissue compartment to encapsulate cells. Vessel formation is influenced by ECM biochemical and biophysical properties, source of vascular cells, and microphysiological system (MPS) operating conditions. The v-CS-ECM also supports co-culture of endometrial epithelial organoids (EEOs) and fibroblasts, and formation of microvascularized endometriosis lesion-like structures when all cell types are co-encapsulated in a microfluidic device with constant flow. Hence, v-CS-ECM overcomes limitations of reproducibility and biological function inherent in the fibrin-based ECM typically employed for microvascular morphogenesis, as well as Matrigel for organoid culture, thus offering promise for NAMs evaluating endometriosis drugs in the preclinical setting.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Millions of significant eQTLs have been reported by both individual studies and coordinated large consortiums such as Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). A significant eQTL association does not establish a causal relationship or provide any underlying mechanism so further investigation is needed to understand how a SNP impacts gene expression. One of the plausible explanations for eQTL is that a genomic variant affects transcription factor (TF) binding and thus impacts its regulation on its target genes (TGs). However, data-driven or formal statistical methods to prove that hypothesis are still lacking. To address the gap, we propose a new method called differential co-expression QTL (ceQTL) among different alleles using Chow statistics to specifically detect eQTLs that are modulated by a particular TF. We start with building a trio of TF, its TG, and related SNP and then test the significant coefficient difference among different levels of SNP in terms of TF and TG correlation. We applied this ceQTL model to simulated data and the lung tissue datasets from the GTEx project. The simulated data results showed that the model was robust to detect true ceQTLs at variable sample sizes and different minor allele frequencies as measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC). In normal lung tissue, a small fraction of eQTLs were found to have strong ceQTLs, i.e., eQTLs where SNP affects gene expression though TF binding. Some ceQTLs may not be detected by traditional eQTL analysis. Our tool also performed a TF binding affinity analysis to add another layer of evidence for functional interpretation. Comparisons with other similar tools were also presented. In summary, ceQTL analysis provides a more interpretable and biological insight into the mechanism of eQTL, which would help us better understand how genomic variants affect phenotypes and diseases.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Using the tryptophan biosynthesis operon as a model, we show that transcription attenuation, acting post-initiation and alongside transcriptional repression, simultaneously modulates both burst size and frequency from a {sigma}70 promoter. This challenges the view that frequency modulation requires distal enhancer input and reveals that post-initiation mechanisms can shape divergent transcriptional bursting.

A total of 41 putative novel viruses were identified and classified into 16 families and 1 genus. In addition, 13 known viruses were detected, including aphid and phytopathogenic viruses, and a virus from the invasive harlequin ladybird. The Aphid lethal paralysis virus was detected in several species at different trophic levels, including plants, aphid vectors, predatory insects, and insectivorous vertebrates. Thus, an ecosystem perspective on viruses across trophic levels is proposed because feeding may facilitate the spread of viruses between distant taxonomic species, such as invertebrate and vertebrate insectivorous predators. In conclusion, a simple assessment of the viral diversity in eight predatory insects of agricultural relevance, using a bioinformatics approach, has revealed a potential interspecies viral flux that deserves research attention.

Intracellular pathogens such as Brucella spp., the Gram-negative causative agents of Brucellosis, must subvert diverse host functions to ensure survival and replication. One of the key adaptations to achieve this is the translocation of effector proteins into host cells via its type 4 secretion system (T4SS), a key virulence factor. But effector identification in Brucella is particularly challenging, as previously identified effectors lack a conserved translocation signal, exhibit variable requirements for translocation, and in some cases appear to be translocated in a T4SS-independent manner. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of previously described T4SS effector proteins associates with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in different Brucella species. Most of these effector proteins encode predicted signal peptides for periplasmic export or transmembrane domains. Among them, BspC and VceA carry functional signal peptides that direct their export into the periplasm in a Sec-dependent manner. From the periplasm these proteins are subsequently secreted into the extracellular milieu, likely via the formation and release of OMVs. Our findings provide new insights into protein secretion by Brucella, suggesting that OMVs may represent an alternative secretion pathway to the T4SS.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In eukaryotes, the processing of protein-encoding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) includes 5' end capping, editing, splicing, RNA modification, poly-adenylation cleavage, and polyadenylation. Short-read sequencing of total or messenger RNA largely reveals the final output of transcription and processing because it utilizes 1) steady-state, mature RNA that is mostly processed and 2) sequencing reads that are too short to detect adjacent processing events (e.g. two adjacent introns). In contrast, long-read sequencing of nascent RNA allows the detection of rarer, full-length transcripts that are in the process of being transcribed and processed. The 3' end of each nascent RNA establishes the position of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) along the gene at the time of cell lysis, providing a 'timeline' for RNA processing events. In addition, the density of 3' ends along genes or at gene landmarks reflects Pol II density, which is related to changes in transcription elongation rate.

C.", "abstract": "Climate change poses a pervasive threat to many aspects of natural systems, and while impacts of changes in average conditions have been extensively studied, the effects of increased climate variability, and extreme events, on natural populations are less understood due to the challenges of studying these rare occurrences. Using 60 years of life-history data from over 83,000 individuals, and historical daily climate records, we show that developmental stages in wild great tits (Parus major) differ in their sensitivity to extreme climatic events (ECEs). Exposure to extreme cold events during the first week of development is particularly detrimental to fledging mass, while extreme rain events have a stronger negative impact as chicks grow older and their energetic requirements increase. Synergistic effects of ECEs and average climatic conditions can be particularly severe, exacerbating the challenges faced by these birds. Our findings indicate that combined exposure to extreme heat and heavy rainfall during early development is associated with a predicted reduction in fledging mass by up to 27%. Additionally, birth timing may further modulate these effects, since late-season broods exposed to frequent hot ECEs during early development are predicted to fledge nestlings up to 4.27 standard deviations (35%) lighter than broods laid earlier in the season. Moreover, phenotypic plasticity has enabled many similar populations to shift towards an overall earlier laying date, which may have increased susceptibility to cold extremes during development. However, our analyses suggest that the benefits of being part of an early-laid clutch within a season may, to some extent, offset the negative effects of extreme climate on fledging mass and apparent survival. In climate scenarios where ECEs are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity, these developmental stage-specific insights are crucial for understanding how climate change may be influencing wild avian populations.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Any method's ability to detect and correctly identify plant taxa may vary with DNA preservation, DNA reference library and the size of the local flora, making it difficult to compare results from different environments. Here we compare these methods using lake surface-sediments from Northern Fennoscandia with the PhyloNorway genome skim reference library (1500 taxa) that includes almost all species of the regional flora. We also undertook vegetation surveys from around the lakes to estimate the true positive detection rate, identify false positive detections, and provide optimal filtering cut-off thresholds for the three methods. Optimal filter cutoffs were one PCR replicate and 3 reads for metabarcoding, and 3.2x10e-6 and 5.6x10e-6 of queried reads, respectively, for the shotgun and capture probe data. Applying these thresholds, the rate of false positives was too high for reliable identification at species level based on shotgun (49%) and capture probes (62%), whereas it was low for metabarcoding (5-12%). All methods were reliable at genus and family levels after applying the optimal filtering thresholds (<4% false positives). Our results show that metabarcoding on average detects 2.1 times as many true positive taxa as shotgun sequencing, and 6.4 times as many taxa as capture probes. Proportions of filtered metabarcoding and shotgun reads were significantly related to abundance categories from vegetation surveys, but this was not the case for capture probe data. We expect the false positive rate of shotgun sequencing to decrease with increasing genome completeness in the reference libraries, and be advantageous for highly degraded DNA with fragments too short for metabarcoding.

This heterogeneity results from (spatial and phylogenetic) variation in the interactions between species fitness-relevant traits and environmental threats that trigger the pathway to extinction. Existing evidence reveals that factors including life histories, ecophysiology, and resource-use generalism influence variation in species declines under rapidly changing environments. An emerging hypothesis predicts that species spread across different 'locations' of the 24h diel spectrum are exposed to different anthropogenic pressures on demographic stability (e.g. daytime contact with humans), which can trigger differential extinction risk among diurnal, nocturnal and cathemeral (day-night actives) species. However, this prediction remains largely neglected. Only a single large-scale test of this hypothesis, on mammals, exists, which documented higher declines in diurnal species, driven by primates. Here, we address this hypothesis across the world's tetrapods, spanning >23,000 species across both endotherms and ectotherms for the first time. Our results reveal that extinction risk is higher across diurnal species from tropical regions with greater human footprint. Collectively, extinction risk is the synergistic outcome of the interplay between extrinsic human-induced pressures and species traits.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

D.; Davies, R. M.; Marshall, J.; Park, S.-H.; Wagner, A. H.; Love, M. I.; Thomas, R.; Hofmann, O.; Sheffield, N. C.", "abstract": "Reference genomes are foundational to genomics but suffer from widespread ambiguity and incompatibility due to inconsistent naming, undocumented differences, and lack of formal mechanisms for comparison. To address this, we introduce the GA4GH refget Sequence Collections (seqcol) standard. Refget seqcol is a framework for unambiguous representation, retrieval, and comparison of sequence collections such as reference genomes and transcriptomes. The seqcol standard comprises four components: a structured data schema, a canonical encoding algorithm that produces content-based, globally unique identifiers, a retrieval API, and a comparison protocol. This standard enables precise identification of sequence collections, even across decentralized or private systems, and allows compatibility assessments beyond exact identity, such as order-relaxed matches or shared coordinate systems. We applied the refget seqcol standard to 60 human and 36 mouse reference genomes sourced from major providers. Using digest-based comparisons, we quantified levels of similarity across attributes including sequence names, lengths, coordinate systems, and actual sequence content. Our analysis revealed some consistent subsets of sequences or coordinate systems, as well as substantial incompatibility among references and duplicate references under different names. To support adoption of refget seqcol, we provide a Python package implementing the full standard, a web API, and a comparison interface allowing users to assess local references against a curated database. This work offers a scalable, reproducible solution to the reference genome compatibility crisis, enabling improved transparency, reuse, and integration in genomic analyses. Refget seqcol enhances interoperability across tools and datasets, making genomic research more robust and reproducible.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

We applied deep mutational scanning (DMS) to the endosialidase TSP of Escherichia coli K1 phage K1F, generating 22,365 single-amino-acid variants using an enhanced ORACLE phage engineering platform. Functional scores revealed the TSP is structurally fragile yet harbors pockets of adaptive flexibility. Mutations within the {beta}-propeller active site uncovered residues accommodating longer sialic acid chains than captured by structural studies, while the {beta}-helix stalk emerged as an adaptive \"tuning knob\" modulating processivity and specificity. Comparative selections across K1 strains identified discrimination hotspots in {beta}-barrel loops and distal residues outside canonical binding sites, implicating capsule modifications and O-antigen presence as key modulators of host range. By resolving how specific mutations modulate function and host range, this study offers a roadmap for designing phages that overcome capsule-based defenses in pathogenic bacteria.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

A library of approximately 200,000 peptides was efficiently produced in E. coli with sufficient library diversity to identify cleavage efficiency of thousands of substrates for most proteases in a single assay.

We apply this method to two different proteases, GluC commonly used as a proteomics tool, and Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha that is overexpressed in activated fibroblasts of epithelial cancers and fibrotic diseases. This research quantitatively maps substrate specificity for GluC and FAP in a single assay and can be applied to map substrate specificity for most proteases.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the explainability of a network trained to virtually stain osteoclast cultures, using intensity-based label-free input images. The model enables analysis of cell cultures without immunostaining. Explainability assessments, including receptive field and feature map analyses, show that the background in input images significantly influences staining predictions within cellular regions and the trained network performs an internal segmentation during the image transformation process. This suggests that contextual cues beyond cell boundaries are implicitly learned and integrated during training. By eliminating repetitive staining procedures, virtual staining enables longitudinal studies, allows multiplexing of individual samples, and reduces reagents and laboratory waste.

Arboviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are particularly threatening due to the lack of specific antiviral treatments, the continual emergence of new variants, and their mosquito vectors. These challenges underscore the urgent need for novel antiviral strategies. Here, we apply computational methods to design miniprotein binders targeting critical viral entry components: the CHIKV envelope, and DENV fusion loop. Our protocol integrates classical and deep learning-based approaches and can be generalizable to other protein targets. Promising binder candidates were further evaluated through all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations to assess structural stability and binding interactions. We provide complete transparency and a detailed rationale for each design step to facilitate adaptation of these protocols to other neglected disease targets.

Using a combination of whole-brain functional imaging, quantification of cardiovascular performance, and behaviour, we explore the efficacy and tolerability of six widely used fish anaesthetics (2-phenoxyethanol, benzocaine, etomidate, MS222, isoeugenol and quinaldine sulfate) in larval zebrafish. We show that MS222 and quinaldine sulfate are the most suitable for achieving deep anaesthesia, while etomidate is better suited for studies focused on the cardiovascular system.

B.", "abstract": "Background: Strain diversity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) underlies distinct clinical presentations and outcomes, but the range of drug susceptibility phenotypes among clinical isolates is poorly understood. We aimed to identify drug response patterns in phylogenetically diverse clinical isolates to combination treatment. Methods: Out of 641 drug-sensitive clinical isolates, we selected 13 strains that capture local and global phylogenetic diversity and included Erdman ATCC-35801 as a reference. We selected ten antibiotics with diverse mechanisms of action to study phenotypic responses to combination therapy. We treated each strain with 10 single drugs, 45 drug pairs, and 20 three-way combinations in standard and cholesterol-rich media. To compare combination treatment responses across strains and conditions that have varying doubling times, we computed normalized growth rate inhibition metrics (GRmax). Findings: Mtb clinical strains displayed a broad range of drug response phenotypes across the 65 drug combinations and two metabolic conditions tested. The most effective drug pairs (based on potency and synergy) varied both by strain and metabolic condition. Within our 14-strain panel, strains that were less sensitive to single drugs were also less sensitive to combination treatment, with very few exceptions. For all drug combinations tested, the magnitude of GRmax variation across all strains was driven primarily by variation among genetically related strains, rather than between genetically distant strain groups. Interpretation: Preclinical studies should reflect the diversity of Mtb clinical strains; our data suggest that selecting strains based on the range of drug response phenotypes displayed, rather than by genetic diversity alone, may better account for the effects of strain variation. Our findings also support the understanding that constituent drug pairs of high-order combinations target metabolically heterogeneous Mtb. Selection of these pairs should likely involve multiple factors including the infecting strain, metabolic niche, and drug response metrics.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

R.; Kominoski, J. S.; Simonsen, A. K.", "abstract": "Nutrient availability regulates ecosystem processes, and plant roots strongly influence nutrient cycling through microbial interaction in the rhizosphere. In the extremely phosphorus-limited Florida Everglades, Cladium jamaicense (sawgrass) develops specialized roots, called dauciform roots, which release carboxylates that mobilize soil-bound nutrients. Although methanogenesis is a well-documented process in wetlands, the composition of methanogenic communities across separate root-associated compartments is not as well characterized. We investigated microbial community composition and predicted functional pathways across bulk soil, the general rhizosphere soil, and the rhizosphere of dauciform roots in calcareous (marl) soils near Everglades National Park. Functional predictions were inferred from 16SrRNA gene data using PICRUSt2 with taxonomic assignments referenced against SILVA v138.2 using rANOMALY. Alpha and beta community analyses revealed significant differences among compartments. Dauciform roots harbored the lowest Shannon diversity, whereas bulk soils supported the most distinct assemblages. Microbial communities clustered strongly by compartments, with compartment identity explaining 66% of the variation (p = 0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed the strongest separation between bulk and dauciform soils. Furthermore, functional predictions showed enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sequences in dauciform roots, while acetoclastic methanogenesis was most abundant in rhizosphere soils further emphasizing their distinct communities. Our preliminary results demonstrate that root-associated compartments foster distinct microbial assemblages with implications for key ecosystem processes, including methanogenesis. These findings highlight how root traits in oligotrophic systems influence carbon cycling and potential methane pathways, contributing to broader insights into microbial community assembly and ecosystem processes in nutrient-limited wetlands.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

E.; Ho, P.; Galanis, A.; Welch, M.", "abstract": "The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often co-infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a variety of other co-habiting microbes; the infections are polymicrobial. P. aeruginosa isolates from the CF airways are also known to commonly acquire mutations in the quorum sensing regulator, lasR. The appearance of these lasR mutants is associated with a worsening clinical prognosis. In this work, we show that loss of lasR function has a significant impact on the stability of inter-species interactions in a polymicrobial ecosystem, and in particular on the dynamics of a common CF-associated fungus, Candida albicans. Titres of C. albicans were stable in the presence of wild type P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. However, when wild type P. aeruginosa was replaced by a {delta}lasR mutant, C. albicans titres progressively declined over time. This instability could be reversed by ectopic expression of a Type VI Secretion System effector cluster (tsi) in the %[delta]lasR mutant. We also noted that challenge of the polymicrobial cultures with a clinically-relevant combination of antibiotics (colistin and ciprofloxacin) led to a hyphal bloom of the fungus. This bloom was abolished in the %[delta]lasR mutant, but again, was restored by ectopic expression of the tsi cluster. Finally, we show that whereas wild type P. aeruginosa is relatively agnostic to the presence of other microbes, the %[delta]lasR mutant is not and undergoes substantial transcriptional reprogramming. Our data indicate that lasR has a large and previously unrecognised impact on inter-species interactions. We therefore propose that lasR is an ecological keystone gene.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here, for the first time, we introduce a group II intron reverse transcriptase, UltraMarathonRT (uMRT), to perform scRNA-seq. We demonstrate that this enzyme reveals an unexpected transcriptomics landscape by capturing additional genes and other genomic features that conventional RTs miss.

While their biomechanics and transcriptional regulation have been studied extensively, little is known about their epigenetic regulation. Here, we combined epigenetic profiling with RNA sequencing in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore regulatory programs underlying cnidocyte diversity. We identified cell-type-specific regulatory elements in promoter and enhancer regions and linked them to distinct gene expression programs.

Most protein language models pair a sequence with a single structural snapshot, which can miss state-dependent features central to interaction, localization, and enzyme activity. Studies also indicate that many proteins assume multiple, functionally relevant shapes, motivating approaches that learn from this variability. Here we present DynamicsPLM, a protein language model conditioned on ensembles of computationally generated conformations to derive state-aware representations. DynamicsPLM improves predictive performance across protein-protein interaction, subcellular localization, enzyme classification, and metal-ion binding. On a widely used protein-protein interaction benchmark, it achieves a four-point accuracy gain over the strongest baseline. On a curated test set enriched for proteins with multiple conformational states, the margin increases to eleven points. These findings argue for a shift from static to dynamics-aware modeling, in which conformational variability is treated as informative. By elevating conformational state to a central element of machine learning in protein biology, this work advances modeling toward mechanisms that better reflect how proteins operate in cells and provides a route to actionable hypotheses about when and how binding, signaling, and catalysis occur.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": ""}

Here we address the question of whether the intriguing mechanical behavior of vimentin IFs translates to the network scale. We apply high strains to in vitro reconstituted networks using optical tweezers and find contrastive behavior for the two cytoskeletal networks: vimentin networks show strain stiffening behavior and respond in an elastic, solid-like manner with high forces opposing the active movement of the beads, whereas actin networks strain soften and fluidize at low forces.

Although the structural mechanism of lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS)-activated GPR174 in the Gs pathway has been characterized, how hydration-mediated interactions influence GPR174 activation and signaling selectivity remains unclear. Here, we determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of LysoPS-activated GPR174 bound to Gs (2.0 [A]) and Gi (3.4 [A]), revealing a continuous hydration-mediated signaling transduction network that bridges the sodium-binding pocket, NPxxY and DRY motifs, and the G protein-binding interface. This network stabilizes the active-state conformation of GPR174 and dynamically reshapes the intracellular cavity, thereby enabling differential engagement of Gs and Gi. Molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays demonstrated that the hydration network is essential for receptor activation and selectively modulates G protein coupling. To evaluate its conservation, we performed sequence alignment and structural analysis across class A GPCRs, defining three hydration cavities: the conserved water cavity (CWC), the junction water cavity (JWC), and the extended water cavity (EWC), whose hydration is determined by residue properties at position 5.58. Together, our study reveals a hydration-driven molecular mechanism that underlies the activation of GPR174 and its dual G protein selectivity.
