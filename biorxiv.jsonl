W.", "abstract": "Neural activity encoding recent experiences is replayed during sleep and rest to promote consolidation of memories. However, precisely which features of experience influence replay prioritisation to optimise adaptive behaviour remains unclear. Here, we trained adult male rats on a novel maze-based reinforcement learning task designed to dissociate reward outcomes from reward-prediction errors. Four variations of a reinforcement learning model were fitted to the rats' behaviour over multiple days. Behaviour was best predicted by a model incorporating replay biased by reward-prediction error, compared to the same model with no replay, random replay or reward-biased replay. Neural population recordings from the hippocampus and ventral striatum of rats trained in the task evidenced preferential reactivation of reward-prediction and reward-prediction error signals during post-task rest. These insights disentangle the influences of salience on replay, suggesting that reinforcement learning is tuned by post-learning replay biased by reward-prediction error, not by reward per se. This work therefore provides a behavioural and theoretical toolkit with which to measure and interpret the neural mechanisms linking replay and reinforcement learning.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

W.; Carlson, J.; Smith, O.; Shaw, R.; Harpak, A.", "abstract": "The scientific literature has seen a resurgence of interest in genetic influences on human behavior and socioeconomic outcomes. Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by one's DNA. We show that the paper's conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission (for example, of wealth) within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Freitag, F.; McClary, T.; Wernet, M. F.; Linneweber, G. A.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain consistent over long time periods. The consistency of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animal's individuality, or if consisting of multiple traits personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The 'person-situation debate' in humans and decades of observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether and to what extent animal behavior remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here, we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under tightly controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The consistency of three individual traits (termed exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, consistency of behavioral individuality always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. We confirmed this hierarchy using a generalized linear model and a hierarchical linear mixed model. In summary, our work demonstrates that, similar to humans, fly individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments, thereby making the underlying developmental and functional mechanisms amenable to genetic dissection.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Previous studies further highlight the increased vulnerability of specific regions, particularly the thalamus, to disease-related damage. This study investigates whether MS affects the controllability of specific brain regions in driving network activity transitions across the brain and examines the relationship between these changes and cognitive impairment in patients. Resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological data were collected from 102 MS and 27 healthy controls. Functional network controllability analysis was performed to quantify how specific regions influence transitions between brain activity patterns or states. Disease alterations in controllability were assessed in the main dataset and then replicated in an independent dataset of 95 MS and 45 healthy controls. Controllability metrics were then used to distinguish MS from healthy controls and predict cognitive status. MS-specific controllability changes were observed in the subcortical network, particularly the thalamus, which were further confirmed in the replication dataset. Cognitively impaired patients showed significantly greater difficulty in the thalamus steering brain transitions towards difficult-to-reach states, which are typically associated with high-energy-cost cognitive functions. Thalamic network controllability proved more effective than thalamic volume in distinguishing MS from healthy controls (AUC = 88.3%), and in predicting cognitive status in MS (AUC = 80.7%). This study builds on previous research highlighting early thalamic damage in MS, aiming to demonstrate how this damage disrupts activity transitions across the cerebrum and may predict cognitive deficits. Our findings suggest that the thalamus in MS becomes less capable of facilitating broader brain activity transitions essential for high-energy-cost cognitive functions, implying a potential pathological mechanism that links thalamic functional changes to cognitive impairment in MS.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Whether morphological and kinematic traits always jointly respond to size variation is however poorly known. Here, we examine the relative importance of morphological and kinematic changes in mitigating the consequence of size reduction on aerodynamic force production for weight support in flying insects, focusing on hovering flight of hoverflies (Syrphidae). We compared the morphology of 28 hoverfly species, and the flight biomechanics and aerodynamics of eight species with body masses ranging from 5 to 100 mg. Our study reveals no significant effect of body mass on wingbeat kinematics among species, suggesting that morphological rather than kinematic changes may compensate for the reduction in weight support associated with an isometric reduction in wing size. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations confirmed that adaptations in wing morphology drive the ability of small hoverfly species to generate weight support, although variations in wingbeat kinematics between species cannot be completely neglected. We specifically show that smaller hoverflies have evolved relatively larger wings, and aerodynamically more effective wing shapes, to mitigate the reduction in aerodynamic weight support with isometric size reduction. Altogether, these results suggest that hoverfly flight underpins highly specialised wingbeat kinematics, which have been largely conserved throughout evolution; instead, evolutionary adaptations in wing morphology enabled flight of small hoverflies.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that blood flow promotes the migration of new olfactory-bulb neurons in the adult brain. Neuronal migration is facilitated by blood flow, leading to accumulation of new neurons near blood vessels with abundant blood flow. Blood flow inhibition attenuates blood vessel-guided neuronal migration, suggesting that blood contains factors beneficial to neuronal migration. We found that ghrelin, which is increased in blood by hunger, directly influences neuronal migration. Ghrelin signaling promotes somal translocation by activating actin cytoskeleton contraction at the rear of the cell soma. New neurons mature in the olfactory bulb and contribute to the olfactory function for sensing odorants from food. Finally, we show that neuronal migration is increased by calorie restriction, and that ghrelin signaling is involved in the process. This study suggests that blood flow promotes neuronal migration through blood-derived ghrelin signaling in the adult brain, which could be one of the mechanisms that improve the olfactory function for food-seeking behavior during starvation.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The human amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC) are known to play crucial roles in WM processing. Although electrophysiological studies have revealed that the HPC supports multi-item maintenance in a load-dependent manner, the characteristics of the AMY and the circuit-level mechanisms underlying AMY-HPC interactions remain largely unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, intracranial EEG recordings from the AMY and HPC in nine epileptic patients were employed to evaluate intraregional neural representations and interregional communications during maintenance under different non-emotional WM loads. High load enhanced low-frequency power and intraregional theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the AMY and HPC. At the network level, a high load elicited an increase in the strength of the HPC theta phase modulation, which entrains the AMY gamma amplitude. Furthermore, a high load increased AMY-anterior HPC (aHPC) theta phase synchrony and directional connectivity strength from the aHPC to the AMY. Conversely, posterior HPC (pHPC)-AMY synchrony was not affected by load variations.

The PC rapidly acquired multiple marker genes and genomic islands, subsequently diverging into successive sublineages mediating independent waves of cross-country transmission, as also observed in V. cholerae. Wave succession in the last two decades was driven by loss of putrescine utilization (Puu) genes, conferring phenotypic advantages for environmental adaptation (enhanced biofilm formation) and human transmission (increased cell adhesion/intestinal colonization, reduced virulence), consistent with the virulence trade-off hypothesis.

Temporal adaptation in the form of reduced responses to repeated external stimuli is ubiquitously observed in the brain, yet it remains unclear how repetition suppression aids recognition of novel inputs. To clarify this, we collected behavioural and electrocorticography (EEG) measurements while human participants categorized objects embedded in visual noise patterns after first viewing these patterns in isolation, inducing adaptation to the noise stimulus. We furthermore manipulated the availability of object information in the visual input by varying the contrast of the noise-embedded objects. Our results provide convergent behavioral, neural and computational evidence of a benefit of temporal adaptation on sensory representations. Adapting to a noise pattern resulted in overall faster object recognition and better recognition of objects as object contrast increased. These adaptation-induced behavioral improvements were accompanied by more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of object-evoked EEG responses, and better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To identify potential neural computations mediating the benefits of temporal adaptation on object recognition, we equipped task-optimized deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with different candidate mechanisms to adjust network activations over time. DCNNs with intrinsic adaptation mechanisms, such as additive suppression, best matched contrast-dependent human performance benefits due to adaptation, whilst also showing improved object decoding as a result of adaptation. Networks that use temporal divisive normalization, a biologically-plausible canonical neural computation, additionally showed robustness to shifting objects, suggesting that temporal adaptation via divisive normalization aids stable representations of time-varying visual inputs.

Here, we adapted and optimised ribosome complex profiling (RCP-seq) for brain tissue, capturing SSUs and analysis of translation initiation dynamics in mouse dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. In both tissues, SSUs accumulate upstream of the start codon on synaptically localised RNAs and this poised SSU configuration is associated with enhanced translational efficiency. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are extensively translated and associated with less SSU poising downstream, suggesting that uORFs may have a buffering effect on poised SSUs. Ribosome occupancy analysis suggests that neuron-specific transcripts recruit more ribosomes and are more translated than glia-specific transcripts.

The companion dog shares many morbidities with humans. Thus, a better understanding of canine comorbidity relationships could benefit both humans and dogs. We present an analysis of canine comorbidity networks from the Dog Aging Project, a large epidemiological cohort study of companion dogs in the United States. We included owner-reported health conditions that occurred in at least 60 dogs (n=160) and included only dogs that had at least one of those health conditions (n=26,614). We constructed an undirected comorbidity network using a Poisson binomial test, adjusting for age, sex, sterilization status, breed background (i.e., purebred vs. mixed-breed), and weight. The comorbidity network reveals well-documented comorbidities, such as diabetes with cataracts and blindness, and hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, this network also supports less well-studied comorbidity relationships, such as proteinuria with anemia. A directed comorbidity network accounting for time of reported condition onset suggests that diabetes precedes cataracts, elbow/hip dysplasia before osteoarthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca before corneal ulcer, which are consistent with the canine literature. Analysis of age-stratified networks reveals that global centrality measures increase with age and are the highest in the Senior group compared to the Young Adult and Mature Adult groups.

Current immunosuppressants effectively suppress adaptive and innate immune responses, but their broad, antigen-non-specific effects often result in severe off-target complications. It remains a significant unmet medical need in transplant medicine. Results: In this study we investigated immunosuppressant effects of four major immunosuppressant classes, including tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and fingolimod (FTY), on the gut microbiome, metabolic pathways, lymphoid architecture and lymphocyte trafficking after up to 30-day chronic exposure. Despite their distinct mechanisms of action and not designed to target the gut, all immunosuppressive drugs induced profound and time-dependent alterations in both intestine gene expression and gut microbiome composition. Progressive alterations from moderate early, drug-specific changes to a strikingly convergent microbial dysbiosis, marked by significant expansion of pathobionts of Muribaculaceae, occurred across all drug classes. Concurrently, all drugs uniformly induced significant suppression of mucosal immunity including B cell, immunoglobulin, and antigen recognition. Time-dependent changes in lymph node (LN) reorganization and cellular composition were also observed, marked by a progressive shift toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes in gut-draining mesenteric LNs and a gradual loss of tolerogenic architecture in peripheral LNs. Drug-specific metabolic alterations and distinct phases of intestinal transcriptional responses were also characterized. Notably, MMF and FTY demonstrated the most robust immunomodulatory properties, and were able to suppress alloantigen-induced inflammation through mediating regulatory T cell distribution and LN remodeling. Conclusions: Together, these findings highlight the underappreciated complexity and temporal dynamics immunosuppressants effects, particularly their impact on the gut and compartmentalized regulation of alloimmune in lymphoid tissues. Understanding these relationships offers new opportunities for refining immunosuppressive strategies to reduce treatment-related off-target complications and improve long-term organ transplant outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

To address these needs, we propose a non-invasive restraint to scan mice in the awake state. The restraint was designed to be compatible with brain stimulation and recording approaches often combined with fMRI. It was evaluated on the basis of motion, fMRI data quality, and animal stress levels, and compared to a conventional headpost restraint. We found the proposed approach was effective at restraining mice across a broad range of weights without the need for any anesthesia for setup. The non-invasive restraint led to higher data attrition after censoring high motion volumes, but by acquiring roughly 25% more data we could obtain comparable network spatial specificity to the headpost approach. Our results demonstrate a simple open-source head restraint that can be used for awake mouse fMRI for certain cohorts, and we establish suitable acclimation and scanning protocols for use with this restraint.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e. the pocketomes, of eleven species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The intermediates, 2-chloroaniline (2-CA) and 3-chloroaniline, were transiently formed in a ratio of 8:1. The growth yields of Dehalobacter on 2,3-DCA and 2-CA were 1.2 {+/-} 0.1 x 108 and 1.3 {+/-} 0.1 x 108 16S rRNA gene copies/mol chloride, respectively. The maximum specific growth rate for 2,3-DCA, max, was 0.18 {+/-} 0.03 day-1 with a half-saturation constant, Ks, at 45 {+/-} 16 mg /L. The first-order decay constant for Dehalobacter when starved of chlorinated electron acceptors was estimated at 0.017 {+/-} 0.001 day-1. Lactate fermentation, acetogenesis from ethanol, syntrophic propionate oxidation, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were observed during dechlorination. This work provides insights into the organohalide respiration of 2,3-DCA to aniline and advances the understanding of microbial interactions during anaerobic dechlorination.

In this study, we designed the GrooveNeuroTube, composed of a hyaluronic acid methacrylate and gelatin methacrylate (HAMA-GelMA) hydrogel, incorporating active agents (growth factors and antibacterial agent) encapsulated within an NGC conduit made of 3D-printed PCL grid fibers. This bioengineered conduit demonstrated high cytocompatibility (>90%) and extended degradability (over 60 days). In vitro studies showed that GrooveNeuroTube significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cells, 3D bioprinted at the far ends of the conduit to imitate a proximal nerve injury as a novel ex vivo model. A long-term culture of up to 60 days was employed to better mimic in vivo conditions. We then used this model to test the effects of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation on neural tissue development and integration. Analysis revealed that neurite length was significantly greater in cells exposed to PEMF stimulation, with more elongated neurites (38%). After 60 days in culture, GrooveNeuroTube showed cell migration reaching 7.2 mm, representing a 32% increase compared to the GF-only group and a 105% increase compared to the no-growth-factor condition.

In mice, gonadogenesis initiates around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), when coelomic epithelial (CE) cells overlaying the mesonephric ducts proliferate and acquire competence to differentiate into the somatic cell types of the embryonic gonad, the pre-supporting cell (Sertoli cells in the testis and granulosa cells in the ovary) and the interstitial cell lineages. While some transcription factors that drive gonadal cell fate are known, we found that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) binding sites are highly represented upstream of granulosa and interstitial genes. We investigated the bHLH Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4), which is expressed in GATA4+ somatic cells in both sexes prior to sex determination, maintained in ovarian pre-supporting cells and interstitial cells of both sexes, but silenced specifically in male pre-supporting cells. In a Tcf4STOP/STOP mutant mouse model that lacks the TCF4 DNA-binding domain, we found that the marker of Sertoli fate, SOX9, was higher in Sertoli cells, while markers of granulosa and interstitial fate (FOXL2 and NR2F2) were reduced and the supporting to interstitial cell ratio was altered in XX Tcf4STOP/STOP ovaries. We found that TCF4 binds the Mediator complex and chromatin remodelers to regulate expression of Jun and other genes in early somatic cells. Collectively, these results support the working hypothesis that TCF4 regulates a gonadal program that primes the gonad towards a female fate but is specifically silenced in male supporting cells as the testis pathway diverges.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

D.; Rideaux, R.", "abstract": "Predictive coding theories posit a reduction in error-signalling neural activity when incoming sensory input matches existing expectations, a phenomenon termed expectation suppression. However, the empirical evidence for expectation suppression, as well as its underlying neural mechanism, is contentious. A further aspect of predictive coding that remains untested is how predictions are integrated across sensorimotor domains. To investigate these two questions, we employed a novel cross-domain probabilistic cueing paradigm, where participants were presented with both visual and motor cues within a single trial. These cues manipulated the orientation and temporal expectancy of target stimuli with 75% validity. Participants completed a reproduction task where they rotated a bar to match the orientation of the target stimulus while their neural and pupil responses were respectively measured via electroencephalography and eye tracking. Our results showed a consistent, feature-unspecific effect of motor expectancy across multiple measures, while evidence for visual expectancy was limited. However, neither motor nor visual expectancy modulated the fidelity of sensory representations. These results indicate that violations of temporal expectancy in the current study may reveal the brain's intrinsic sensitivity to temporal regularities in the natural settings, rather than feature-specific predictions. In contrast, the absence of visual expectancy effects in both neural and pupillometry results adds to a growing body of evidence questioning the effectiveness of probabilistic cueing paradigms for establishing expectations capable of altering sensory representations.

W. Y.; Kucyi, A.", "abstract": "Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 male, 20 female) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudo-random intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340 to 356 millisecond window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal, a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, the link between connectivity structure and emergent activity remains incompletely understood. We investigate this relationship in recurrent neural networks with additive stochastic inputs. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity remains low-dimensional, and recurrent dynamics influence it within a subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to the rank of the connectivity matrix. In contrast, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity also becomes potentially high-dimensional. The contribution of recurrent dynamics is apparent within a subspace spanned by the totality of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory networks, we discuss how the input configuration also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of amplification generated by non-normal dynamics.

We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires \"gauge-fixing,\" i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to$L_2-regularized regression in an overparameterized \"weight space'\" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in \"function space,'' i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers.

CSA requires a thorough evaluation of each step using appropriate experimental animal models, with pigs being particularly suitable due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. The critical challenge in HT is spinal cord fusion, which current research suggests can be facilitated using fusogens. To refine the technical aspects of the procedure, we conducted head replantation in a pig model using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-chitosan conjugate (Neuro-PEG). In this article, we evaluate the technical aspects of this procedure, the rate of recovery of ventilation after spinal cord fusion, and phrenic sparing in a model of autologous decapitation-reanastomosis in a single swine. Methods: A Hungarian Mangalica pig was submitted to surgical separation of the head while maintaining blood flow to the brain through cannulation of the primary cervical vessels. After cephalic separation, the head was reconnected, and the cervical spinal cord fused. Results: The animal was weaned from ventilation after 5 h and kept on spontaneous breathing. The animal regained full consciousness, demonstrated early signs of sensory recovery, and restored brain functions. Conclusion: Pending further confirmatory studies, a phrenic-sparing cephalic reanastomosis with spinal cord fusion using fusogens has clarified the technical aspects of the procedure. A head replantation model with complete vascular cannulation was developed, resulting in the recovery of spontaneous breathing and brain functions.

The numerical solution of the field equations in the human head using the boundary element method (BEM) is a powerful tool for achieving this. We hypothesized that the spatial resolution of the BEM is crucial for the achievable accuracy. However, in classical BEM (as implemented, e.g., in MNE-Python), very high resolutions are impractical due to the associated prohibitive computational effort. In contrast, our recently introduced reciprocal boundary element fast multipole method (reciprocal BEM-FMM) allows for hitherto unprecedented spatial resolution. In this work, we apply our reciprocal BEM-FMM technique for source estimation to localize AEFs, and we compare our results with the source estimates produced using a 3-layer BEM model (standard BEM) via MNE-Python. We first validate our methodology through comparison of source estimates of simulated N1m components of AEFs using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) measure. While we obtain ROC measures of about 80% for the standard BEM, reciprocal BEM-FMM reaches about 90%, a significant statistical improvement. We then apply this methodology to analyze the source estimates of experimental data obtained from a cohort of 7 participants subjected to binaural auditory stimulation. Using a dispersion measurement to quantify the focality of localized sources, we find improvements upwards of 30% using reciprocal BEM-FMM over the standard BEM. Analyses from both simulated and experimental data show localization of AEFs using high-resolution reciprocal BEM-FMM is significantly better in terms of accuracy and focality than those estimates of the low-resolution standard BEM. We therefore recommend using the high-resolution reciprocal BEM-FMM to utilize high spatial anatomical precision for the modeling of neural activity.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

While its prognostic significance remains debated, we demonstrate that HDAC6 loss significantly impairs myeloid leukemia progression in vivo, despite having no functional impact on leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Global proteome and secretome profiling of HDAC6-knockout (KO) cells revealed upregulation of several immune-related modulators, including RNase T2, a tumor suppressor known to modulate the tumor microenvironment. Notably, RNase T2 upregulation upon HDAC6 loss was restricted to myeloid but not B-ALL cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 recapitulated this phenotype, leading to RNase T2 upregulation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATAC-seq revealed increased chromatin accessibility of RNase T2 following HDAC6 loss, highlighting a functionally epigenetic regulatory contribution. Further functional assays conducted in an immunocompetent setting both ex vivo and in vivo demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition sensitized murine myeloid leukemia cells to broad CD8+ T cell activation as evidenced by increased TNF and CD107a expression. Consistently, in a syngeneic model, HDAC6 inhibition restricted growth myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, an extended drug screening analysis identified Cytarabine and Clofarabine as significantly synergizing with HDAC6 inhibitor (Ricolinostat) in myeloid lineage derived cell lines and in patient derived xenograft cells, while showing limited synergy in lymphoid lineage derived cell lines, PDX or healthy control cells.

Using quadruple-guide RNAs (qgRNAs) and Cas9, or an inactive Cas9 version fused to a synthetic transactivator, we ablated 2304 and activated 2428 human genes related to mitochondrial, trafficking and motility function in HEK293 cells. After exposure of cells to -Syn fibrils, pSyn129 signals were recorded by high-throughput fluorescence microscopy and aggregates were identified by image analysis. We found that pSyn129 was increased by activating the mitochondrial protein OXR1, which decreased ATP levels and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Instead, pSyn129 was reduced by ablation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein EMC4, which enhanced ER-driven autophagic flux and lysosomal clearance. OXR1 activation preferentially modulated cellular reactions to fibrils derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, whereas EMC4 ablation broadly reduced pSyn129 across diverse -Syn polymorphs.

This diversity is often referred to as intratumoral heterogeneity and is known to complicate the interpretation of single-test biomarkers. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one such biomarker, which is used to guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment through the classification of samples as either having high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or as being microsatellite stable (MSS). Although established as a therapeutic biomarker, it remains unclear whether MSI itself is a heterogeneous phenomenon. To investigate heterogeneity in MSI status, we integrated single-cell sequencing data from 134 samples across 49 individuals and developed a computational pipeline to infer MSI-H cells and quantify heterogeneity in MSI status. We found evidence of intratumoral heterogeneity in MSI both in individuals originally classified as MSI-H and MSS. Approximately a third of individuals showed evidence of divergence in MSI status between distinct clusters of cancer cells and most individuals had distinct MSI-H and MSS subclones. These results challenge the assumption that MSI should be treated as a binary biomarker and suggest the single-biopsy tests in current use could overlook a salient feature of this important molecular phenotype. Accounting for heterogeneity may lead to improved biomarker performance and, potentially, help explain reports of intrinsic treatment resistance and low overall response rate in MSI-H cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine the frequency of heterogeneity in MSI at the population level, and whether the presence of both MSI-H and MSS subclones can have clinical implications.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Approximately ~50% of FK506-resistant isolates acquire resistance via RNAi-dependent epimutation, where small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence fkbA transcription. The remaining isolates undergo heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 methylation and siRNAs spreading, repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. One isolate retained only heterochromatin marks without detectable siRNAs. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance is mediated by ectopic heterochromatin associated with siRNA.

Furthermore, the new automated Mass2Motif Annotation Guidance (MAG) aids in structurally identifying Mass2Motifs. Using three chemically diverse curated MotifDB-MotifSets for benchmarking, MAG achieved median substructure overlap scores of 0.75 up to 0.93, demonstrating robust substructural annotations. We further validated MS2LDA 2.0 in experimental data by identifying substructures of pesticides spiked into a biological matrix and demonstrated its discovery potential by annotating previously uncharacterized fungal natural products. Together with the new visualization app and MassQL-searchable MotifDB, we anticipate that MS2LDA 2.0 will boost the identification of novel chemistry and hidden patterns in mass spectrometry profiles.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses.

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered sensory processing may contribute to increased vulnerability to such conditions. To better understand this relationship, we evaluated autonomic and behavioral responses to tactile, nociceptive, and social stressors in juvenile Wistar rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a widely used animal model of ASD. VPA-treated and saline-treated control (CTL) rats underwent a battery of stress-related behavioral tests. Defecation, freezing and vocalization behaviors were analyzed in response to handling, electro-tactile stimulation, nociceptive foot shock (fear conditioning) and social stress stimuli (emotional contagion). VPA-treated rats maintained increased defecation during handling and a higher prevalence of defecation during electro-tactile stimulation, without corresponding changes in freezing. During fear conditioning, these animals showed delayed onset and heightened freezing responses. Furthermore, unlike CTL rats, VPA-treated rats lacked correlations among freezing, defecation, and vocalization. In the emotional contagion paradigm, observation of shock in the partner increased the prevalence of animals freezing and reduced the prevalence of animals vocalizing in both VPA and CTL groups (oV+ and oC+) compared to their respective controls (oV- and oC-). However, these effects were more sustained in oV+ rats, which also exhibited prolonged freezing behavior and an earlier reduction in vocalization rate. These findings indicate that VPA-treated rats display heightened stress reactivity, habituation deficit and disrupted coordination of fear responses, supporting the VPA model as a relevant tool for investigating the neurobiological basis of stress vulnerability and social dysfunction in ASD.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain region involved in both emotion regulation and higher cognitive functions. Astrocytes have emerged as active modulators of synaptic activity, capable of sensing, integrating, and responding to neuronal signals. At glutamatergic synapses, astrocytes detect glutamate through the activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). However, most existing research has focused on the role of mGluR5 in developing rodents or in pathological contexts, likely because of the reported lower astrocytic mGluR5 expression levels in adulthood compared to postnatal stages. Importantly, prior studies and our preliminary data have demonstrated mGluR5-mediated signaling in astrocytes of adult mice, supporting a role for this receptor. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether these lower levels of mGluR5 are sufficient to activate astrocytes in the adult brain and (2) to investigate whether this activation is involved in regulating circuit function and behavior. To address these objectives, we evaluated adult mice employing a combination of calcium-imaging in astrocytes, and loss- and gain-of-function manipulations to assess synaptic plasticity and behavior in adult mice. First, we found that astrocytes of adult mice display fully functional mGluR5-dependent calcium activity. To examine the role of this activity, we induced the deletion of mGluR5 in astrocytes across the entire brain of adult mice. These mice developed anxious- and depression-like behaviors, along with reduced sociability and recognition memory, but showed increased behavioral flexibility. These results highlighted the hippocampus as a key region for mGluR5-mediated astrocytic influence on behavior, leading us to specifically target hippocampal astrocytes. A viral-driven ablation in this area demonstrated that astrocytic mGluR5 plays a role in both basal transmission and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Behaviorally, the deletion of astrocytic mGluR5 in the hippocampus recapitulated anxious-like behaviors, social deficits, and impaired long-term recognition memory. Surprisingly, it improved place recognition memory but reduced behavioral flexibility. Lastly, overexpressing this receptor to enhance mGluR5 signaling specifically in hippocampal astrocytes impaired place recognition memory but improved behavioral flexibility, revealing a role for astrocytic mGluR5 in regulating these behaviors. Overall, our results confirmed the biological relevance of astrocytic mGluR5 during adulthood, specifically in modulating hippocampal function.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

T4P are necessary for the bacteria to engage in surface-associated behaviors, including establishing acute infections. Pilus extension is driven by the hexameric ATPase, PilB, at the base of the T4P nanomachine in coordination with various protein regulatory effectors. The cyclic-di-GMP binding protein, FimX, works with PilB to mediate normal extension processes, though how this effector controls pilus assembly remains unclear. To explore the role of FimX in T4P function, we leveraged the significant {Delta}fimX twitching motility deficit to screen for mutants capable of overcoming this phenotype. We identified suppressor mutations that increase twitching in {Delta}fimX background, mapping primarily to cyclic-AMP homeostatic machinery or to PilB, the FimX target. Distinct suppressor mutations in PilB increased ATP hydrolysis in vitro and this activity was subject to modulation by FimX. Using microscopy to monitor the extension dynamics of fluorescently labelled T4P, we showed that {Delta}fimX mutants produce slow-to-extend, short pili, a phenotype that is rescued by mutations enhancing PilB ATP hydrolysis and/or re-introduction of FimX. Together, these data implicate FimX as a regulator of PilB enzymatic function, potentially enabling P. aeruginosa to fine-tune pilus extension dynamics in response to environmental cues.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, although several molecular targets for remyelination have been tested preclinically and in clinical trials, an efficacious and safe myelin repair treatment is yet to be developed. One promising molecular target to enhance myelin repair is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR17, which has been proposed to play a central role in the transition from early oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) into pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings are largely supported by studies using transgenic mice where GPR17 deletion results in developmental hypermyelination. Additionally, pharmacological modulation of GPR17 activity has been reported to enhance oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation and myelination. In our studies aimed to characterize and pharmacologically validate GPR17 as a viable target for drug development, we established by means of transcriptional profiling of GPR17 knockout versus wild type OPCs, that absence of this GPCR results in a gene signature revealing minor changes in myelin protein gene expression. Furthermore, blocking GPR17 receptor activity in OPC cultures using selective and potent antagonists or inverse agonists, results in limited enhancement of maturation and myelination in vitro. Importantly, remyelination in both the cuprizone and lysolecithin-induced demyelination models was not enhanced in the absence of GPR17.

We screened a panel of nuclear mtDNA maintenance genes in cells with heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. This revealed both common and perturbation-specific aspects of the integrated stress-response to mtDNA depletion, that were only partially mediated by Atf4, and caused cell-cycle stage-independent slowing of cell proliferation.

Using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), we tested the regulatory potential of a set of previously identified highly conserved craniofacial enhancers that showed convergent sequence acceleration in thylacine and wolf (TWARs). We compared orthologous sequences from six different taxa, including outgroup taxa with non-convergent craniofacial phenotypes (Tasmanian devil and giant panda) and ancestral reconstructions for marsupial and placental carnivores (Dasyuromorphia and Carnivora). Dense 10bp tiling allowed us to thoroughly examine features associated with activity, including percentage GC content and transcription factor binding motifs turnover. We identified marked conservation of levels and patterns of regulatory activity across all six taxa, as well as multiple cases of differentially active TWARs within each clade, with both thylacine and wolf driving functional divergence. However, evidence of convergent divergence was limited to a set of neighbouring TWARs near the neural crest gene Phox2b -- one of which exhibited reduced activity in the wolf, and the other in the thylacine.

The ER plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, folding, and quality control, with BiP being a key player in maintaining protein homeostasis. CDNF is protective against ER stress and involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and interaction with BiP. Recent studies have shown that CDNF interacts with UPR sensor proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, suggesting an overlap in CDNF binding with UPR sensors and BiP. In rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD), CDNF protects and restores the function of brain dopamine neurons and was successful in PD phase 1 clinical studies.

Results show CDNF's role as an antagonist of BiP nucleotide exchange, and thus in its chaperone function, binding to the ADP-bound state. Finally, we show its effect on neuroprotection with stem cell-derived human dopamine neurons, highlighting its potential in neurodegenerative disease treatment.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

While existing deep learning approaches such as Graph Neural Networks and Transformers have shown promise, they often overlook the rich semantic information embedded in textual descriptions of drugs and targets. These descriptions encode critical biomedical knowledge, including mechanisms of action, biological pathways involved, and therapeutic effects of drugs, which can enhance DTI prediction performance. Results: We introduce DrugLM, a unified framework that integrates embeddings derived from large language models (LLMs) into DTI-specific model architectures. DrugLM leverages textual descriptions of drugs and targets to generate semantic embeddings using a range of pretrained LLMs. These embeddings can be seamlessly incorporated into existing DTI models. We systematically evaluate multiple LLMs on benchmark DTI datasets and demonstrate strong performance even without fine-tuning. Moreover, supervised parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the LLMs further improves embedding quality, leading to enhanced prediction accuracy. Notably, a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) using only LLM-derived embeddings surpasses several established DTI methods, underscoring the power of semantic features. Our findings highlight the practical value of integrating LLMs into DTI pipelines and offer a straightforward recipe for improved drug discovery: LLM embeddings of drugs and targets are both effective and easy to use.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Our results show that mutant hybrid seedlings exhibit improved physiology under normal watering conditions as well as in drought conditions, exhibiting an increase in epicuticular wax content, unaltered membrane damage in drought and lower ROS production, supporting higher survival after severe drought for double mutant hybrid seedlings. We also established that the hybrid mutants grown in typical agricultural conditions do not show differences in flowering time or in physiological and nutritional aspects, but they present a higher yield in comparison to wild-type W22/B73 hybrids, as determined by higher ear weight and number of kernels per ear in mutant hybrids, when grown in field rainfed conditions.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on V. macrocarpon and F1 hybrids between V. macrocarpon and V. oxycoccos subjected to acute heat and cold stress, capturing early transcriptional responses up to 30 minutes (heat) and 95 minutes (cold) after treatment onset. We then evaluated differences in responses across genotypes and stress conditions. Differential expression analysis and functional profiling revealed cold-induced differences in pathways related to photosynthesis, ribosomes, defense, and hormone signaling. No subgenome-specific functional specialization was observed. Two F1 hybrids exhibited suggestive cold resilience, with expression changes elevated at 60 minutes but declining by 95 minutes. Hybrids also displayed substantial regulatory variation under stress and transgressive downregulation of photosynthesis genes under ambient conditions. These findings suggest that V. oxycoccos introgression could be utilized in breeding cold-tolerant cranberry cultivars. Variation observed between F1 hybrids reflects the diversity introduced through CWR germplasm and provides opportunities for selection.

Thus, there is a need to more fully understand the function of Tim-3 in vivo. Here we have studied the function of Tim-3 early during a T cell response to LCMV Armstrong, which causes an acute viral infection in mice. We show that Tim-3 is rapidly expressed after infection and that the expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of a type I effector phenotype, including expression of T-bet and downregulation of Tcf-1, by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that knockout or cytoplasmic truncation of Tim-3 attenuates the acquisition of the effector program by T cells after LCMV Armstrong infection.

SMCHD1 is a non-canonical SMC protein important for X-inactivation, imprinting and the silencing of specific autosomal genes. While it is known to be a repressor, little is known about its structure or mechanism of action. Here, we show that the SMCHD1 homodimer is flexible and dynamic in solution. This flexibility is conferred by its yet uncharacterized linker domain, which can alter its length by dynamically switching between compact and extended conformations. Interestingly, we observed that SMCHD1 can directly bridge and compact DNA, independently of other proteins, forming large protein-DNA clusters. SMCHD1 contains a GHKL ATPase domain and SMC hinge domain, however each domain alone is insufficient for DNA compaction. DNA compaction rate decreases when the linker domain is removed. The coiled-coil domain does not affect compaction rate but facilitates interaction with a partner protein LRIF1. Surprisingly, DNA compaction by SMCHD1 does not require ATP and paradoxically, compaction rate is reduced with the addition of ATP. Similarly, SMCHD1 forms clusters with reconstituted nucleosome arrays in the absence of ATP, and the addition of ATP results in a reduction in cluster sizes. Our data provides biophysical and mechanistic insights into the role of SMCHD1 in gene silencing and genome organization.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Within the Neotropical butterfly tribe, Heliconiini, the genus Heliconius possess 4-fold larger mushroom bodies, an insect learning and memory centre, than closely related outgroup Heliconiini. Mushroom body expansion in Heliconius co-occurred with a dietary innovation, and is associated with systematic spatial foraging and extended lifespans. Heliconiini therefore offer an attractive system for studying how the evolution of behaviour is facilitated by changes in neural systems. Heliconius' foraging likely relies on visual scene memories. Indeed, Heliconius have more stable visual long-term memory, and evidence of visual specialisation in the mushroom bodies. Here, we explore how vision-specific neuroanatomical and behavioural enhancement in Heliconius impacts sensory pathways upstream of the mushroom bodies by assessing the degree of investment across the eyes, sensory structures and projection pathways. Despite evidence of refinement in visual-based behaviour, we found no increased investment in visual structures, brain areas and pathways. This suggests that the rapid expansion of the Heliconius mushroom body occurred in a context of conserved detection and processing of visual cues, and a largely localised shift within integrative brain centres facilitated the evolution of Heliconius' novel behaviours.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying heterochromatin formation and maintenance remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we discovered that the critical mitotic regulator NuMA, as a nucleoskeleton protein, is required for constitutive heterochromatin organization at the level of nucleosomes in the interphase. Depletion of NuMA results in shortened nucleosome repeat length (NRL), dispersed nucleosome clutches and increased chromatin accessibility in heterochromatin regions. Afterwards, epigenetic maintenance and transcription repression in constitutive heterochromatin are disrupted upon NuMA-depletion, particularly the up-regulated transcription level of the non-coding long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, indicating the crucial roles of NuMA in cell differentiation and senescence. We revealed that such functions of NuMA rely on its interaction with linker histone H1, which stabilizes H1's binding to chromatin and facilitates nucleosome stacking. We provided direct structural evidence of NuMA's stabilization effect at the highest spatial resolution of nucleosomes through in situ cryo-ET. Notably, we found that NuMA oligomerizes into quasi-meshwork in nucleoplasm and highly co-localizes with H1 on the chromatin, providing the organization basis for NuMA as a nucleoskeleton protein in chromatin architecture regulation.

M.; Kim, J.; Kong, L.; Cook, P.", "abstract": "Solid tumors can evolve mechanisms that facilitate evasion of anti-tumor immune responses. Recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the tumor microenvironment, which can inhibit cell-mediated immunity, represents one such strategy. A well-described mechanism of Treg recruitment occurs via the chemokine CCL22. Our lab and others have shown that CCL22 is upregulated in cancer cells via activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING). STING triggers robust immune responses against cytoplasmic DNA, which can accumulate in cancer cells due to chromosomal instability, damaged mitochondria, and increased expression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. LINE-1 is highly upregulated in many cancer types, and LINE-1 activation of STING in cancer cells may have clinically relevant outcomes on anti-tumor immunity. STING has been associated with both anti- and pro-tumor immune responses, and a potential mechanism of STING-mediated immune evasion is through CCL22 upregulation. CCL22 was first characterized in macrophages, and here we investigate the effects of STING activation on CCL22 expression in macrophages and monocytes. We find that human macrophages and monocytes are resistant to CCL22 upregulation by STING, but that STING-activated macrophages and monocytes release unidentified paracrine factor(s) that dramatically increase CCL22 upregulation in cancer cells. This increase exceeds upregulation induced by direct, pharmacological activation of STING. Moreover, we found that the activity of the paracrine factors on CCL22 requires intact STING in cancer cells, as evidenced by the inability of STING knockout cells to upregulate CCL22 in response to these factors.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying swimming-induced improvement of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Results showed that swimming training significantly altered the level of isoliensinine in animals. Further studies demonstrated that isoliensinine exerts cardioprotective effects by regulating the expression of Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 6A2 (COX6A2), establishing for the first time the critical role of the Isoliensinine-COX6A2 signaling axis in cardiac function regulation. To validate this axis, a pathological cardiac hypertrophy model was constructed in mice through transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Both swimming training and isoliensinine intervention significantly improved cardiac structure and function. In vitro experiments using isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophy in H9C2 cells further confirmed the essential role of this signaling axis in suppressing pathological hypertrophy and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that swimming mitigates pathological cardiac hypertrophy by enhancing COX6A2 expression by isoliensinine, thereby improving mitochondrial function.

We find that heteromerization via lipid binding domains is a prerequisite for tricalbin accumulation at contact sites, membrane curvature sensing and restrained mobility in the ER.

In this study, we introduce a non-invasive 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology designed to directly quantify the transport rate of sodium ions in living cells. Our technique integrates relaxation exchange spectroscopy (REXSY) with a multi-site exchange model, enabling the investigation of Na transport dynamics on a timescale of sub-seconds. A key advantage is its ability to differentiate between intracellular and extracellular Na pools based on the endogenous NMR relaxation difference, thereby avoiding the need for potentially disruptive exogenous reagents. Experiments conducted on human cell lines successfully demonstrated the technique's capacity to distinguish between various physiological states, such as when ion channels are pharmacologically blocked or activated.

Mitophagy can occur through two pathways: ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent. Recently, we and others have shown that, upon mitochondrial stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to Parkin-mediated, ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy. The ubiquitin-independent pathway involves multiple outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) mitophagy receptors that contain LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, including BNIP3, NIX/ BNIP3L, FUNDC1, and BCL2L13. LIR motifs bind Atg8/LC3 family proteins, facilitating the recruitment of the autophagosome membrane to target damaged mitochondria for degradation. The kinase Unc-51 Like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) phosphorylates the serine preceding the LIR motif in BNIP3, NIX, and FUNDC1, enhancing their binding to LC3 and promoting mitophagy. However, while BCL2L13 has been identified as a ULK1 binding partner, its regulation by phosphorylation remains unclear. We utilized mass spectrometry (MS) to map phosphorylation sites in BCL2L13 following mitochondrial stress and developed phospho-specific antibodies against two sites, Ser261 and Ser275, which were induced after exposure to the mitochondrial uncoupler, CCCP. Endogenous BCL2L13 Ser261 and Ser275 were both phosphorylated in an AMPK-dependent manner in cells and tissues. As neither site matches the established AMPK substrate consensus motif, we sought to identify which kinases directly mediate their phosphorylation downstream of AMPK. Surprisingly, genetic studies revealed that ULK1 is not regulating either site, but instead, TBK1 is controlling Ser275. This work reveals that BCL2L13 is unique amongst mitophagy receptors in being activated by mitochondrial stress and innate immune stimuli in an AMPK- and TBK1-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We constructed a dosimetry curve for the lifespan response of males and females to irradiation and found dose-dependent and sex-specific effects on lifespan. We also determined that the sex-specific response to irradiation correlated with nuclear morphology defects in the gut, with the more radiosensitive males displaying increased midgut cellular holes and aberrant nuclear morphology. To determine if feeding Aureobasidium pullulans and Rhodotorula taiwanensis before irradiation could improve survival and gut morphology, we first exclusively fed males and females each fungus and observed that they tolerated the diet well. Using these methods, we found that only two days of prefeeding Aureobasidium pullulans increased male lifespan, but not female, after irradiation, and improved nuclear morphology in the gut. However, dietary Rhodotorula taiwanensis was not protective. Overall, this study identified a highly radioresistant dietary fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans, as effective for extending male Drosophila lifespan and improving gut morphology following irradiation.

When expressed in the subperineurial glia that form the blood-brain barrier, miR-184 resulted in the loss of targeted septate junction proteins, a compromised blood-brain barrier, decreased locomotion, and lethality. Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that miR-184 expression did not alter mRNA levels of targeted genes.

Here, we developed a reliable pipeline of single EV analysis using a nanoparticle-dedicated flow cytometer, which detects particles and measures their size down to 55 nm in diameter, without the need for vesicle pre-immobilization or fluorescent label. We show that titrating each antibody, eliminating un-bound antibodies and using EVs devoid of the analyzed markers as negative controls are required to reliably quantify the proportion of EVs bearing none or any combination of two markers, as well as to measure their sizes. We thus observed, depending on the cell source (human cell lines MDA-MB-231, HeLa, A549), variable proportions of EVs bearing none of the CD9, CD81 and CD63 tetraspanins often used to define EVs, and of single- and double-positive EVs for each of these markers.

An important aspect of this endeavor is understanding how an organism adapts to stress-inducing environmental conditions on Mars, such as radiation, shock waves, extreme temperatures, and chaotropic stress due to higher levels of perchlorates. A conserved approach used by organisms across evolutionary scales to adapt and overcome stress conditions is the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. In this study, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to understand yeast survivability and adaptation under Mars-like stress conditions, specifically shock waves and perchlorate, by focusing on RNP condensates. Our study reveals that yeast survives 5.6 M intensity shock waves. Exposure to either shock waves or sodium perchlorate induces the formation of P-bodies, a conserved stress-induced condensate. Yeast mutants defective in P-body assembly show defective growth in response to perchlorate stress. Transcriptome analysis, followed by validation, identified several relevant transcripts whose levels are perturbed in response to Mars-like conditions. Finally, identification of several transcripts whose abundance is altered in the P-body assembly mutant upon stress highlights a new connection between response to Martian stress conditions and RNP condensates. This study, a first of its kind, highlights the importance of RNP condensates in understanding the impact of Martian conditions on life in general. This study paves the way for using RNP condensates as a biomarker for assessing the health of life forms during space explorations.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The dataset comprises 31 human Xenium FFPE sections across 16 tissue types, for 22 cancerous and 9 non-cancerous patients. It contains over 11 million cells, each assigned to one of ten curated cell-type categories designed to accommodate a pan-cancer setting. Annotations were derived through Tangram-based alignment to single-cell reference atlases, followed by slide-specific clustering and differential expression analysis. Co-registered H&E images enabled extraction of over 500,000 patches with segmentation and classification masks. Quality control steps assessed segmentation accuracy, filtered out low-confidence regions, and verified annotation integrity.

Basal SMAD nuclear import mechanisms remain to be fully understood and could benefit from advances in our understanding of nuclear transport machinery. To assess the molecular determinants of SMAD nuclear transport, we take advantage of the unicellular S. cerevisiae model that lacks the TGF-{beta} signaling complexity of vertebrates but has conserved nuclear transport machinery. In this minimal system, we find that the steady-state distribution of SMAD2/3, SMAD4, and SMAD1/5 are Ran-dependent and either accumulate in, or are depleted from the nucleus. Conditionally inhibiting each of the karyopherin/importins demonstrates that SMAD3 is imported by orthologues of importin-{beta}, importin-7 and importin-8. The previously defined nuclear localization signal is insufficient to confer nuclear import. Instead, our data suggest the entire MH1 domain may act as an importin binding surface. Deleting a portion of this domain impairs SMAD3 function in Xenopus and SMAD3 nuclear enrichment in HEK293T cells. Thus, the yeast platform provides an efficient strategy to illuminate the nuclear transport mechanisms of embryonic signaling effectors.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

D.; Kille, P.; Gilchrist, M.; Owens, N. D. L.; Latinkic, B.", "abstract": "The transcription factor (TF) GATA4 is a key mediator of cardiogenesis. GATA4 regulates cardiogenesis through the expression of its target genes, only some of which have been identified. We have used a gain of function model based on pluripotent embryonic ectoderm explants from Xenopus embryos expressing GATA4, to identify a set of downstream targets of GATA4 which are also regulated by Nodal, a known cardiogenic signal. GATA4 was shown to be required for the expression of target genes tbx2 and prdm1 in vivo, likely acting in a direct fashion by interacting with their regulatory regions. In addition, tbx2 and prdm1 are shown to have roles of their own in vivo, as downregulation of tbx2, a positive target, and overexpression of prdm1, a negative target, interferes with cardiac development in Xenopus embryos. The conservation of the GATA4-TBX2-PRDM1 regulatory relationship was shown in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Loss of function of GATA4 lead to downregulation of TBX2, upregulation of PRDM1 expression and failure of cardiogenesis. GATA4-deficient cells failed to form normal cardiomyocytes, with most cells adopting alternative fates and only a small minority expressing an aberrant cardiomyocyte phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis documented severe reduction of cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell transcriptomes and upregulation of transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Disruption of TBX2 function did not alter cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency but led to the formation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes characterised by defective sarcomeres and deficient calcium signalling. In addition, we show that whilst PRDM1 is not essential for formation of cardiomyocytes it is implicated in suppression of alternative cell fates. The results presented establish a conserved regulatory relationship between GATA4 and its target genes TBX2 and PRDM1 and roles for these genes in the modulation of cardiomyocyte development, expanding the cardiac gene regulatory network and providing further insight into how cardiogenesis proceeds.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Gordon, K. L.", "abstract": "Development must be coordinated across body systems but must also accommodate cell-type-specific processes. We discovered that the gene regulatory circuit controlling developmental timing in the Caenorhabditis elegans larval skin exhibits both points of convergence and divergence with the regulatory program governing the migration of the leader cell in gonad development, the distal tip cell (DTC). As a point of convergence, the conserved regulator of developmental timing, LIN-42/Period, peaks synchronously across cell types both during the L3 stage, when the DTC makes a turn in its normal migratory path, and the L4 stage in which the DTC normally continues straight ahead. We report that lin-42, like its ortholog period, autorepresses its own transcription. lin-42 is required cell-autonomously for proper pathfinding of the DTC; DTC-specific lin-42 RNAi causes the DTC to turn in the mid-L4 instead of continuing straight ahead. We identified the FLYWCH transcription factor FLH-1 as able to directly bind the lin-42a promoter. Using live-cell imaging, we show that flh-1;flh-2 double mutant DTCs have an aberrant turn in the mid-L4. These mutants derepress the L4 peak of lin-42 expression in a stage- and DTC-specific manner, and this derepression is itself lin-42- dependent. During the aberrant mid-L4 turn in flh-1; flh-2 mutants, the focal adhesion factor TLN-1 is repolarized in the direction of turning.

Although the molecular basis of cellular heat shock responses is well understood, how thermosensory neurons contribute to systemic stress adaptation remains unclear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we examine whether thermosensory receptor guanylyl cyclases (rGCs) in AFD neurons regulate organism-wide stress responses under noxious temperatures and how individual rGCs contribute to this coordination. Among the AFD-expressed rGCs, we identify gcy-18 and gcy-23 as key regulators of the physiological response to thermal stress, acting through modulation of canonical heat shock response (HSR) genes. Our findings indicate that rGC signaling is crucial for activation of heat shock chaperones and maintenance of proteostasis under high temperatures (35{degrees}C). Supporting this, quantitative analysis of HSP-16.2 revealed that rGC activity in AFD neurons modulates the HSR magnitude in distal tissues, such as the intestine.

Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

By integrating Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) biosensors with photoactivation-based single-cell tagging and pooled CRISPR screening technology, we establish a scalable system to identify genes that regulate the timing, amplitude, and duration of signaling responses. As proof of principle, we applied this approach to the cAMP signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular physiology. Using a custom guide RNA (gRNA) library, we tracked real-time cAMP dynamics in response to agonist stimulation and identified genes that modulate its basal levels and response kinetics. Cells with aberrant signaling were selectively photoactivated, isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and subjected to next-generation sequencing to pinpoint causal genetic perturbations. This strategy successfully uncovered known and novel regulators of cAMP dynamics.

Cell surface protein CD32 has been proposed to pinpoint cells with a very high proviral enrichment, potentially providing a tool for selective therapeutic targeting of the reservoir. However, this finding has been challenged by subsequent reports. In order to clarify the nature of CD32 expression on CD4+ T cells, here we designed a purification strategy allowing single-cell analysis using state-of-the-art technologies. The established multilevel sorting strategy allowed to characterize a rare (median 0.06% of CD4+ T cells) but bona fide CD32+ CD4+ T-cell population. In vitro cell stimulation could not lead to CD32 upregulation. Detailed phenotyping revealed that CD32+ T cells reside mostly in the memory T-cell compartment with heightened levels of acute and chronic activation markers. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified that CD32+ CD4+ T cells are mostly highly cytotoxic CD4+ cells. Importantly. in HIV-1 infected donors under suppressive antiretroviral therapy, we found that these cells are highly enriched for HIV-1 provirus, harbor a clear cytotoxic memory T-cell transcriptome, as well as TCR clonal enrichment.

Although there are so many advances in cancer diagnosis, previous methods such as imaging and serum biomarkers more often lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity, particularly for early-stage detection. However, most of the studies depend on internal validation that increases concerns about the generalizability of these findings. To improve the dependability of SVM applications in clinical fields, the review emphasizes the necessity of external validation and established techniques. Due to all the things mixing AI with omics technology suggests a hopeful way to improve cancer detection, that could end up in better results and more affordable medical treatments. Method: This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA2020 principles and registered on The Open Science Framework. A comprehensive search of several databases was conducted, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web Of Science. Data was screened using RAYYAN.ai, which uses artificial intelligence methods to help with decision-making and screening. All original English-language studies that employed SVM to build a model for diagnosing a type human malignancy were included. The full text of the articles was extracted, and the quality of the articles and risk of bias were assessed using the PROBAST tool. Result: A total of 104 studies were identified, of which 99 articles have been included after 5 were excluded because full text was unavailable. The studies covered various types of omics, such as proteomics (41 studies), transcriptomics (30 studies), genomics (19 studies), metabolomics (11 studies), epigenomics (4 studies), radiomics (2 studies), immunomics (1 study), and multi-omics (8 studies). 63 studies were internally validated, and 29 were externally validated; however, 2 studies were both internally and externally validated.

In humans and several other mammalian species, OCA2 is transcribed into two coding mRNAs, a major transcript that encodes the full-length protein and a minor transcript that skips in-frame exon 10 and has no identified function. By contrast, rodents and non-mammalian vertebrates only express the major transcript. Several rare variants of human OCA2 have been reported to be pathogenic due to increased exon 10 skipping. To understand the vulnerability of human OCA2 to exon 10 skipping and its impact on pigmentation, we first functionally tested a series of rare missense variants spread across exon 10. We found that each variant significantly influences the skipping ratio either positively or negatively. By combining human and murine sequences in functional assays, we found that the skipping ratio depends on particular exonic and intronic combinations. Next, we focused on the most frequent exonic single nucleotide variant of human OCA2, rs1800404-T (c.1065G>A/p.Ala355=), located in exon 10. We show that this variant significantly promotes exon 10 skipping on its own and exhibits an additive effect in cis to previously identified splicing variants likely contributing to their pathogenicity. Association studies reveal that rs1800404-T is tightly associated with lighter skin and hair pigmentation in a representative European population, as has been observed in other populations around the world. Our structural models of the skipped transcript-derived protein support causality by predicting that it could exert a dominant-negative effect, which is consistent with a dose-dependent hypopigmentation response in both pathological and physiological contexts. Overall, the modulation of OCA2 exon 10 skipping by both benign and pathogenic variants provides a basis for improving the genetic diagnosis of albinism, and paves the way for research into the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms behind human pigmentation diversity.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

This therapy has been shown to be more effective than traditional chemotherapy, with improved tolerance in patients. However, resistance to crizotinib can develop, limiting its long-term efficacy. The aim of this study is to identify deregulated genes in crizotinib-resistant ALK-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. This will allow us to select patients who are more likely to benefit from crizotinib and help design new therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes. Methods: An in silico study using genomic data from crizotinib-sensitive and crizotinib-resistant LUAD cells was conducted. Through statistical analysis, genes with differential expression in crizotinib resistant cells were identified. These genes were classified by their biological function using Enrichr, and those with the highest amplification frequency according to cBIOPORTAL were selected. Next, gene expression association with prognosis and with immune cell infiltration were investigated using Kaplan-Meier plotter and TIMER databases, respectively. Gene expression analysis in normal and tumoral tissues was explored using TNM plot and potential therapeutic agents against the identified targets were identified from several databases. Results: We found 9 genes overexpressed in resistant LUAD cells, with statistically significant cell function, to be amplified and associated with poor prognosis. Among them, SIRT2, TFEB, TMPSF4, CINH3 and ADRM1 display an immunosuppressed TME and TMPSF4, CINH3 and ADRM1 are overexpressed in tumoral tissue. Some of them, such as SIRT2, have therapeutic agents already approved in other context (gefitinib in EFGR mutated lung cancer). We identified nine genes that are overexpressed in crizotinib-resistant cell lines and are associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, we observed differences in immune infiltration patterns based on the specific overexpressed gene. These findings suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention, such as the use of combination therapies with crizotinib, including immunotherapy or targeted therapies aimed at resistance pathways. These strategies could enhance treatment efficacy in tumors expressing these genes. Conclusions: SIRT2, TFEB, TM9SF4, CINH3, and ADRM1 are potential biomarkers for crizotinib-resistant and worse prognosis in LUAD.

R.", "abstract": "Noncoding genetic variants underlie many complex diseases, yet identifying and interpreting their functional impacts remains challenging. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), a polygenic neurodegenerative disorder, exemplifies this challenge. The disease is strongly associated with noncoding variation, including common variants enriched in microglial enhancers and rare variants that are hypothesized to influence neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. These variants often perturb regulatory sequences by disrupting transcription factor (TF) motifs or altering local TF interactions, thereby reshaping gene expression and chromatin accessibility. However, assessing their impact is complicated by the context-dependent functions of regulatory sequences, underscoring the need to systematically examine variant effects across diverse tissues, cell types, and cellular states. Here, we combined in vitro and in vivo massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) with interpretable machine-learning models to systematically characterize common and rare variants across myeloid and neural contexts. Parallel profiling of variants in four immune states in vitro and three mouse brain regions in vivo revealed that individual variants can differentially and even oppositely modulate regulatory function depending on cell-type and cell-state contexts. Common variants associated with LOAD tended to exert stronger effects in immune contexts, whereas rare variants showed more pronounced impacts in brain contexts. Interpretable sequence-to-function deep-learning models elucidated how genetic variation leads to cell-type-specific differences in regulatory activity, pinpointing both direct transcription-factor motif disruptions and subtler tuning of motif context. To probe the broader functional consequences of a locus prioritized by our reporter assays and models, we used CRISPR interference to silence an enhancer within the SEC63-OSTM1 locus that harbors four functional rare variants, revealing its gatekeeper role in inflammation and amyloidogenesis. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of noncoding variant effects in LOAD and provide a generalizable framework for the mechanistic interpretation of risk alleles in complex diseases.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We achieved successfully seeding of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in flexible patterns and examine their neural induction in circular geometries of varying diameters. Size-dependent and cell-autonomous neural structures are formed on this substrate when hiPSCs differentiate into neural lineages in circles of different diameters. This self-organized pattern results from the mitotic orientation and localization of differentiating cells. Furthermore, teratogenic substances can modulate these patterns.

Improving our understanding of transcriptional regulation is especially important in T cells, given the enormous potential of genetically engineered T cells as an emerging class of therapeutics. Here, we report results from a comprehensive and unbiased survey investigating whether there are novel motifs enriched in regulatory regions of genes with the highest constitutive and selective expression across diverse T-cell subsets. Using computational and experimental methods, we identified 2,036 novel motifs and 629 previously curated TFBS that are enriched, both individually and in specific combinations, in the regulatory regions of genes exhibiting T-cell-specific gene expression. We then used the self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) assay to evaluate all possible three-way combinations of a subset of 18 candidate motifs to test their ability to modulate transcription in immortalized lymphoblastic cell lines of T-cell origin (Jurkat E6) versus myeloid origin (K562). Our results revealed novel motifs that modulate gene transcription in T cells, with some exhibiting stronger regulatory effects than TFBS for TFs with established roles in T cells. The regulatory activity of these novel motifs was influenced by the motif's orientation, position, and copy number. Overall, these results highlight our incomplete understanding of the relationship between sequence composition and T-cell gene regulation and indicate that previously annotated TFBS represent only a subset of motifs capable of modulating gene transcription in T cells.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Class 4 antibodies represent an intriguing case: they target a deeply conserved, cryptic epitope on the receptor-binding domain yet exhibit variable neutralization potency across subgroups F1 (CR3022, EY6A, COVA1-16), F2 (DH1047), and F3 (S2X259). In this study, we employed a multi-modal computational approach combining atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, mutational scanning of binding interfaces, binding free energy calculations, and allosteric modeling using dynamic network analysis to map the allosteric landscapes and binding hotspots of these antibodies. Through this approach, our data revealed that distal binding can influence ACE2 engagement and immune escape traits through the confluence of direct interfacial interactions and allosteric effects. We found that group F1 antibodies can operate via classic allostery by modulating flexibility in the receptor binding domain loop regions and indirectly interfering with ACE2 binding using long-range effects. Group F2 antibody DH1047 represents an intermediate mechanism, engaging residues T376, R408, V503, and Y508 hotspots which are both critical for ACE2 binding and under immune pressure. Mutational scanning and rigorous binding free energy calculations highlight the synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, while dynamic network modeling reveals a shift toward localized communication pathways connecting the cryptic site to the ACE2 interface. Our results demonstrate how group F3 antibody S2X259 achieves efficient synergistic mechanism through confluence of direct competition with ACE2 and localized allosteric effects leading to stabilization of the spike protein at the cost of increased escape vulnerability. Dynamic network analysis identifies a shared \"allosteric ring\" embedded in the core of the receptor binding domain and serving a conserved structural scaffold mediating long-range signal propagation with antibody-specific extensions propagating toward the ACE2 interface. The findings of this study support a modular model of antibody-induced allostery where neutralization strategies evolve via refinement of peripheral network connections, rather than complete redesign of the epitope itself. Taken together, this study establishes a robust computational framework for atomistic understanding of mechanisms underlying neutralization activity and immune escape for class 4 antibodies which harness conformational dynamics, binding energetics, and allosteric modulation to influence viral entry. The findings highlight the modular evolution of neutralization strategies, where progressive refinement of peripheral interactions enhances potency but increases susceptibility to immune pressure.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Whereas immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR-T) therapy have been adopted as a first line treatments in different malignancies, such as melanoma, these approaches do not work for all patients. T cells require proper antigen presentation on tumor cells for recognition and to carry out their corresponding cytotoxic functions. Deficiency of tumor antigens, or high variability in those present, make T cell-based CAR-T and ICB ineffective. By contrast, NK cells are not limited by antigen presentation deficiencies, offering a potential alternative approach, yet their efficacy can suffer from immunosuppressive signals. Herein, we sought to develop in vitro and on-chip platforms to identify strategies for enhance, rather than suppress, NK cell homing to tumor cells. We explored the use of inhibition of kinases such as CK4/6 and AURKA to induce tumor cell production of chemokines that NK cells migrate towards in aggressive melanoma models. We evaluated chemokine-aided NK cell migration-homing capabilities and their therapeutic efficacy and found that treatment of both melanoma cell line and patient-tumor constructs (PTCs) with CDK4/6 and AURKA generally resulted in improved NK cell homing to tumor cells and accompanying tumor cell killing. Interestingly, this chemokine-guided NK cell migration did not generate as effective outcomes in models using a mildly aggressive melanoma cell line.

We demonstrate that injury-associated TGF-{beta} signaling creates a fibroblast state dependent upon HSP47 upregulation. These fibroblasts accumulated collagen, thus elevating tissue stiffness and activating mechanosignaling that sustained YAP-dependent embryonic-like, pro-malignant activities in adjacent hBECs. This Stress/Tension-Instructive Fibroblast (STIF) state, exhibited by stressed fibroblasts in premalignant and malignant lesions across multiple cancer types, was sufficient to reprogram disease-free hBECs to metaplasia and to drive hBECs with compromised tumor suppressor function to dysplasia, yet could be inhibited and reversed.

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) add and remove, respectively, O-GlcNAc on protein serines and threonines. O-GlcNAcylation is thought to be primarily regulated by the availability of its substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, produced by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). We observed a body-wide loss of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in Bcs1l mutant mice, a model of mitochondrial complex III deficiency. UDP-GlcNAc precursors glutamine, UTP and acetyl-CoA were decreased in the mutant liver but, surprisingly, UDP-GlcNAc was not consistently decreased in the organs that showed low O-GlcNAc. Neither N-acetylglucosamine supplementation nor overexpression of the HBP rate-limiting enzyme GFPT1 restored the protein O-GlcNAc levels. The Bcs1l mutant mice become hypothermic and, interestingly, earlier evidence suggest that O-GlcNAcylation depends on ambient temperature in Drosophila embryos. We found that temperature determined O-GlcNAc abundance also in adult flies of tropical and boreal Drosophila species, in the poikilothermic vertebrate zebrafish, and in cultured mammalian cells. In cultured cells, the OGT-OGA protein ratio coincided with temperature and O-GlcNAc level, providing a regulatory mechanism. Pharmacological OGA inhibition decoupled the O-GlcNAc temperature dependency in cultured cells, as did an OGA null allele in Drosophila. In Bcs1l mutant mice, O-GlcNAc levels strongly correlated with body temperature. Increasing the mouse body temperature through transgenic expression of the heat-generating mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) or housing at 35oC prevented the loss of O-GlcNAc. Pharmacological restoration of O-GlcNAc in the Bcs1l mutant mice produced minimal effects, suggesting that the bulk of O-GlcNAc is dispensable in mild hypothermia. Our findings imply an evolutionarily ancient role of protein O-GlcNAcylation in temperature adaptation and, instead of protein function-specific roles, argue for a global role of O-GlcNAc in temperature control of proteostasis.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

While increased cell size in polyploids is known to enhance plant biomass and vigor, its impact on soil exploration remains poorly understood. Using wheat as a model, we identify a ploidy-induced belowground domestication syndrome, characterized by (a) increased root cortical cell size reducing root respiration, nitrogen content, and phosphorus content; (b) enlarged metaxylem vessels, increasing axial hydraulic conductance; and (c) blunter root tips, limiting penetration ability in compacted soils. Our empirical and in silico experiments show that reduced root respiration and reduced cellular nutrient content in wheat polyploids improved nutrient use and acquisition efficiency under suboptimal nitrogen and phosphorus availability. These adaptations would have been advantageous in nutrient-depleted agroecosystems of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) Fertile Crescent, where continuous cultivation depleted soil fertility over time. Functional-structural modeling indicates that larger cortical cells in wheat polyploids increase vacuolar occupancy, reducing root metabolic costs. Enhanced axial hydraulic conducta nce may have improved water transport, an advantage in irrigated PPNB agroecosystems. However, polyploids have blunter root tips, which reduces their penetration ability in compacted soils, making them less suited for native soils with greater mechanical impedance. We propose that root anatomical changes driven by ploidy played an important role in adaptations of wheat domesticates to PPNB agriculture.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, while the electrodes and acquisition systems for non-human electrophysiology have been enhanced over the past decades to enable higher-yield single-neuron detections, those advances have not been translated into human electrophysiology. Single-wire electrodes are still ubiquitously used, and although acquisition systems have augmented their signal-to-noise ratio over the last 15 years, we are still limited by their low electrode count. Moreover, unlike non-human recordings, human recordings often take place in hospitals where different noise sources and subject breaks can compromise the recording quality during experimental sessions. To bridge this gap, this work presents an automatic, open-source spike sorting pipeline that leverages contemporary computational capabilities and is tailored to single-neuron recordings from humans acquired via microwires. The pipeline is implemented in both MATLAB and Python, ensuring accessibility and compatibility across computational environments. Its modular and comprehensive structure supports customization and even opportunities for new developments as per the requirements of the user and the application. One feature is a data-driven automatic module to remove narrow-band interference, besides electrical line noise, which can be an essential tool while recording in clinical settings, particularly for online processing implementations. Following spike detection, the pipeline implements an artifact rejection module that separates waveforms that are unlikely to be associated with actual spikes. Additionally, we introduce a configurable feature-extraction, clustering, and benchmarking framework that not only allows flexibility in employing user-defined or conventional algorithms, such as wavelet transform with superparamagnetic clustering, but can also evaluate multi-method agreement among the different sorters. The pipeline also utilizes established and novel quality metrics to support semiautomatic curation of isolated clusters. Furthermore, we can integrate the customized pipeline with experimental tasks by removing task-unrelated waveforms (e.g., during a break in a task), and prevent over-clustering with the aid of metrics for comparing response profiles. Thus, the presented pipeline addresses the three-pronged objectives of algorithm-adaptability, rigorous validation, and human single-neuron recording optimization to support clinical and cognitive neuroscience applications.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We trained subjects to decouple spiking from HGA on a single electrode using a brain-machine interface. Their ability to decouple them indicated that HGA is not primarily generated by summed local spiking. Instead, HGA correlated with neuronal population co-firing of neurons that were widely distributed across millimeters. The neuronal spikes that contributed more to this co-firing also contributed more to, and preceded, spike-triggered HGA.

In the present study, we utilized DYT1 patient fibroblast cells and induced human neurons to investigate the molecular basis and consequences of Lamin B1 dysregulation.

Proteomic analysis of human iPSC-derived neurons revealed that mislocalized Lamin B1 disrupts essential signaling pathways involved in neuronal function. Notably, 14-3-3 proteins, abundant brain molecular chaperones critical for neuronal development and homeostasis, were the most strongly associated with mislocalized Lamin B1. Functional studies showed that downregulation of 14-3-3 proteins impairs neurodevelopment in healthy neurons, while their upregulation rescues DYT1 neuronal defects by reducing Lamin B1 mislocalization.

In clinical applications, where decisions have significant consequences, understanding the confidence behind each prediction is as critical as the prediction itself. Uncertainty modelling plays a key role in improving trust, guiding decision-making, and identifying unreliable outputs, particularly under dataset shift or in out-of-distribution settings. The primary aim of uncertainty metrics is to align model confidence closely with actual predictive performance, ensuring confidence estimates dynamically adjust to reflect increasing errors or decreasing reliability of predictions. This study investigates how different ensemble learning strategies affect both performance and uncertainty estimation in a clinically relevant task: classifying Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach: We evaluated the performance and uncertainty of ensemble methods and Monte Carlo dropout on a large EEG dataset. Models are assessed in three settings: (1) in-distribution performance on a held-out test set, (2) generalisation to three out-of-distribution datasets, and (3) performance under gradual, EEG-specific dataset shifts simulating noise, drift, and frequency perturbation. Main results: Ensembles consisting of multiple independently trained models, such as deep ensembles, consistently achieved higher performance in both the in-distribution test set and the out-of-distribution datasets. These models also produced more informative and responsive uncertainty estimates under various types of EEG dataset shift. Significance: These results highlight the benefits of ensemble diversity and independent training to build robust and uncertainty-aware EEG classification models.

Th1/Th17-skewed responses (TNBS and DSS) were associated with microbiota-dependent upregulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), RORgt-positive CD4-positive T cell expansion, and elevated expression of Nod2, which was not observed under Th2-dominant (oxazolone) conditions. Inhibition of MLCK restored barrier function and suppressed inflammation in a CD4-positive; T cell-dependent manner. Using Nod2-deficient and 2939insC mutant mice, we showed Nod2 as a critical regulator of small intestinal permeability during colitis. Bone marrow chimeras revealed compartment-specific roles of Nod2, with non-hematopoietic Nod2 sufficient to preserve epithelial integrity, while hematopoietic Nod2 expression is required to limit cytokine-mediated inflammation. Moreover, MLCK inhibition ameliorated intestinal lesions only in mice with Nod2 deficiency in the hematopoietic compartment. Finally, microbiota transfer experiments ruled out a causal role for dysbiosis in driving small intestinal permeability defects in Nod2-deficient mice.

In the current study, we demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells treated with photothermolysis mediated by near-infrared-absorbing CuS nanoparticles and 15-ns laser pulses were ingested by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) more efficiently than were ovarian cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation. Moreover, ingestion of ovarian cancer cells treated with CuS NP-mediated photothermolysis promoted MoDC activation. Immature MoDCs that had been exposed to photothermolysis-treated cancer cells caused greater clonal expansion of co-cultured human CD4 and CD8 T cells than did immature MoDCs that had been exposed to ionizing radiation-treated tumor cells. These data indicate that photothermolysis may be used to selectively target and destroy tumor cells and cause them to release antigens and danger signals, which can be recognized by DCs to activate T cells.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

These modifications can trigger adaptive responses that impact protein expression and various cellular processes, including differentiation and growth. The primary epigenetic mechanisms identified to date include DNA and RNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. The intricate crosstalk among these mechanisms makes epigenetics a compelling field for the development of novel control strategies, particularly through the use of epigenetic drugs targeting arthropod vectors such as ticks. In this study, we identified the Rhipicephalus microplus orthologs of canonical histone-modifying enzymes, along with components of the machinery responsible for m5C and 6mA-DNA, and m6A-RNA methylations. We further characterized their transcriptional profiles and enzymatic activities during embryonic development. To explore the functional consequences of epigenetic regulation in R. microplus, we evaluated the effects of various epigenetic inhibitors on the BME26 tick embryonic cell line. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding mode of these inhibitors to tick enzymes, followed by in vitro assessment of their effects on cell viability and morphology. Tick cells exposed to these inhibitors exhibited phenotypic and molecular alterations. Notably, we observed higher levels of DNA methylation in the mitochondrial genome compared to nuclear DNA. Inhibition of DNA methylation using 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) was associated with increased activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and ATP synthesis, but reduced cellular proliferation. Our findings highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation during tick embryogenesis and suggest that targeting these pathways may offer a novel and promising strategy for tick control.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The analysis reveals interactions and modifications among sets of proteins, read out by recording the identity and location of the resulting localized DNA amplification products. We applied misPLA to both primary and cultured cells and to formalin-fixated paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, to map dynamic changes in protein localizations, phosphorylations and interactions across surface markers, MAPK, immune-checkpoints, T- and B-cell receptors, and adhesion panels. Comparisons of single-plex versus nineplex assays confirmed that misPLA maintains sensitivity and specificity while increasing throughput and spatial context. Across breast cancer, lymphomas and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) misPLA uncovered shared and disease-specific signaling patterns, underscoring convergence of oncogenic networks.

Aminoglycosides kill bacteria by disrupting translation fidelity, leading to the synthesis of aberrant proteins. Surprisingly, mutations in fusA, a gene encoding translation elongation factor G (EF-G), frequently confer resistance, even though EF-G neither participates in mRNA decoding nor blocks aminoglycoside binding. Here, we show that EF-G resistance variants selectively slow ribosome movement along mRNA when aminoglycosides are bound. This delay increases the chance that the drug dissociates before misreading occurs. Over several elongation cycles, this selective silencing of drug-bound ribosomes prevents error cluster formation, preserving proteome and membrane integrity. As a result, fusA mutations confer resistance early in treatment by preventing self-promoted aminoglycoside uptake. Translation on drug-free ribosomes remains sufficiently rapid to sustain near-normal bacterial growth. This previously unrecognized resistance mechanism, namely the selective silencing of corrupted targets, reveals a novel antibiotic resistance strategy with potential therapeutic implications.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

By contrast, Plasmodium falciparum parasites use multiple RBC receptors for invasion. Whether DARC is one of these receptors has never been systematically explored. We used flow cytometry and microscopy-based approaches to investigate whether P. falciparum parasites preferentially invade specific Duffy RBC phenotypes and explored two potential explanations for invasion preference - differences in RBC biophysical properties and surface protein composition. P. falciparum parasites showed a consistent preference for Duffy-positive RBCs, and some biophysical properties and surface protein expression varied between Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative RBCs. We then used our in vitro invasion data to parametrise an evolutionary-epidemiological model of the relationship between P. falciparum and the FYBES allele. Our model accounts for immunity against P. falciparum virulence, gained through exposure, and thus mutations that impede infection are not always advantageous. The inhibition of P. falciparum invasion that we observed in vitro leads to FYBES frequencies increasing at low levels of P. falciparum transmission but decreasing at high levels of transmission. The impact of P. falciparum on the prevalence of Duffy negativity may therefore be most apparent in lower transmission settings. Our findings are the first to show a link between Duffy negativity and P. falciparum and suggest that DARC may direct or indirectly be involved in P. falciparum invasion of human RBCs which could, together with P. vivax, explain the distribution of Duffy negativity in sub-Saharan Africa.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

To address this, we performed a pangenome analysis on 55 B. subtilis strains, including isolates from Japanese natto and Indian bekang. Our analysis revealed a striking evolutionary paradox: a bekang-producing strain, while phylogenetically distant from the homogeneous B. subtilis var. natto clade, shares a highly conserved accessory gene repertoire with it. This accessory genome profile defines a \"natto-type\" adaptive strategy, clustering the bekang isolate with the natto strains (Group A) and separating them from other successful soybean-fermenting strains, such as those from Korean cheonggukjang (Group B), which possess a different set of adaptive genes. Analysis of the Group A-specific repertoire revealed an enrichment of transcriptional regulators and metabolic enzymes, representing one successful evolutionary solution for soybean fermentation. The presence of this adaptive module in phylogenetically disparate lineages is consistent with an evolutionary history shaped by events such as horizontal gene transfer.

UVA radiation is the primary factor for photoaging due to its deep penetration into the dermis, and UV-induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations, including deletions, contribute to photoaging and cellular dysfunction. The most frequent mtDNA rearrangement is the common deletion (CD), characterized by the loss of nearly one-third of the genome, 4,977 base pairs. UV radiation exposure leads to the formation of the CD, however, a distinct characterization of UV-induced CD and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving its initiation remains unexplored. In this study, we showed that increasing doses of UV radiation led to an increase in the CD in human skin fibroblasts. We found that UVA induce the formation of the CD by increasing the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized bases content in the mtDNA. Preconditioning cells with antioxidants prevented the accumulation of the UVA-induced CD, suggesting that this mutational mechanism is ROS-dependent. In stark contrast, UVB did not alter cellular ROS levels but increased the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), leading to CD generation though a ROS-independent mechanism. We corroborated our findings by using a 3D human full-thickness skin equivalent model, where we detected UVA-dependent CD formation in both the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. By analyzing bulk RNA from UVA-exposed human skin fibroblasts by RNA-Seq, we found that UVA led to the upregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial DNA replication proteins and to the downregulation of genes involved genes encoding mtDNA repair factors. Taken together, our findings provide insight into how UVA and UVB differ in their detrimental effects on mtDNA, with UVA impacting mtDNA maintenance and transcription via a ROS-dependent mechanism. Our findings also established the mtDNA CD as a novel potential biomarker for monitoring UVA-induced oxidative stress and photoaging in skin cells in vitro and in vivo.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The ability to simply and efficiently produce new chip molds from computer aided design (CAD) models would significantly transform the development process and expand its accessibility by removing the need for more complex and expensive lithography methods. However, with standard processing strategies, the use of 3D printed molds for casting functioning chips is limited by the poor quality of prints achievable with widely available 3D printers. To mitigate this issue and facilitate rapid microfluidic device prototyping, we have developed a simple procedure to print microfluidic molds using a stereolithographic (SLA) printer and produce functional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chips with height and width feature dimensions as low as 75 m. Molds printed using a commercially available liquid photopolymer-based resin and processed using our strategy exhibited high dimensional fidelity to intended designs and significantly reduced average surface roughness (< 3 m).

A human economon often consists of a buyer providing money to a supplier, while the supplier reciprocally provides some commodity to the buyer. Here, we develop the Quantitative Economon Model (QEM) by reviewing basic principles of behavioral economics and translating those principles into a quantitative model characterizing transactional behavior between buyers and suppliers that would be applicable to transactions involving drugs specifically, as well as other commodities. According to the model, transactions between a buyer and supplier depend on their respective economic demand for the commodities exchanged. Additionally, the model assumes that demand for commodities fluctuates across sequential transactions due to satiation and deprivation associated with consumption of those commodities, of particular relevance to addictive drugs. Methods: We used a computational approach to simulate data from the QEM according to four conditions representing parametric manipulations of high or low levels of deprivation crossed with high or low levels of satiation (i.e., a 2x2 matrix of conditions). Results: Simulations revealed patterns of transactional behavior that may be characteristic of a range of commodities. In particular, when deprivation-effects were high and satiation-effects were low, simulated transaction rates were characteristic of the high consumption rates observed with addictive drugs. In other conditions, transaction rates varied along patterns characteristic of consumption for other commodities like food.

BRG1 (gene name SMARCA4), the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, has been extensively studied in solid tumors, where inactivating mutations are linked to aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Although BRG1 is known to be essential for early B cell development, its role in B-ALL remains poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic relevance of BRG1 in high-risk B-ALL. Meta-analysis of gene expression data revealed that BRG1-inactivating mutations are exceedingly rare (0.35%) in B-ALL, suggesting that intact BRG1 function may be critical for leukemogenesis. Subtype-specific analyses revealed that elevated BRG1 expression is associated with significantly shorter overall survival in children with Ph-like B-ALL, while the opposite trend was observed in KMT2A-R B-ALL. We confirmed higher BRG1 expressions in Ph-like compared to KMT2A-R B-ALL via gene expression analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. The pharmacologic inhibition of BRG1 using two selective inhibitors, BRM014 and FHD-286, revealed marked sensitivity in Ph-like B-ALL cell lines, whereas KMT2A-R B-ALL was resistant. Mechanistically, we found that BRG1 inhibition results in cell cycle arrest via downregulation of cell cycle regulators (CCND3, CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, and MYC) and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (p27). Importantly, treatment with FHD-286 significantly prolonged the survival of NSG mice engrafted with Ph-like B-ALL cells. Taken together, these findings establish BRG1 as a critical, subtype-specific dependency in Ph-like B-ALL and demonstrate that its pharmacologic inhibition effectively suppresses leukemic cell proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest. The pronounced in vitro sensitivity and improved in vivo survival upon BRG1 inhibition provide compelling preclinical evidence for its therapeutic targeting. These results support the advancement of BRG1-directed strategies as a viable treatment approach for patients with Ph-like B-ALL, with the potential to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Among its subtypes, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is one of the most frequent. Identifying biomarkers for LUSC represents a significant challenge due to its high molecular heterogeneity. However, this promising search may elucidate biological mechanisms and reveal potential therapeutic targets. In this context, the present study used gene expression data from TCGA-LUSC, combined with feature selection, data balancing, machine learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify possible biomarkers related to staging. The employed methods demonstrated robust classification metrics and highlighting random forest, which achieved an accuracy of 0.91. The use of data balancing and feature selection techniques proved to be crucial in the classification process. In addition, it was possible to identify the 16 most relevant genes selected by random forest using the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method. Among them, three genes (MYOSLID, IMPDH1P8, and COL9A3) were chosen by all successful classifiers, positioning themselves as potential staging biomarkers and possible molecular therapeutic targets for LUSC.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

BoDV-1 causes encephalitis with a fatality rate of more than 90% in domestic mammals and humans. Currently, the bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) is the only known reservoir host. As hedgehogs are distant relatives of shrews and often cared for by humans, the cases raise concern regarding a potential zoonotic risk. All of the hedgehogs that tested positive for BoDV-1 had succumbed to neurological disease and exhibited severe polio-predominant lymphoplasmohistiocytic meningoencephalitis. However, due to the detection of viral antigens in non-neural cells in one animal, it cannot be completely excluded that some infected hedgehogs shed the virus.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move toward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability.

Methyl gallate (MET) exhibits neuroprotective properties. However, the effect of MET in improving brain functional recovery in the post-stroke depression (PSD) model and its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Single-cell data analysis showed that the cell types and molecular characteristics of PSD are similar to those of primary depression but exhibit weaker synaptic plasticity and stronger inflammatory signals. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed that MET exhibits a significant binding capacity with AMPK/GSK3, suggesting that MET mediates the neuroprotective effects of both. In this study, we created a post-stroke depression (PSD) model by performing physical restraint after ischemia and tested the treatment effects of MET. We observed that MET significantly attenuated PSD-induced depressive-/anxiety- behaviors associated with a reduction of stress hormone corticosterone and ACTH levels. Morris water maze and recognition task results indicate that MET can also alleviate cognitive impairments in the PSD model. In the hippocampus of the PSD model, MET improved the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). MET treatment significantly enhanced the activity of AMPK and decreased the activity of GSK3{beta}. Furthermore, in primary neural progenitors under hypoxia, both the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the AMPK inhibitor compound C blocked the effects of MET to promote neural development. Animal experiments also confirmed that LY294002/compound C treatment could reduce the effects of MET in antidepressant behaviours. Taken together, our results indicate that PI3K, as well as AMPK-mediated adult neurogenesis, is restored by MET to improve brain functions in the PSD model.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Compared to other organs, fibrosis in the liver readily resolves when the source of injury is extinguished. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie spontaneous fibrosis resolution in the liver may lead to novel antifibrotic strategies for all organs. In this study we established a robust mouse model of fibrosis regression in MASH (Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis), one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide, and performed single cell and in situ molecular profiling of the liver to define the molecular drivers of fibrosis regression. As fibrosis regressed, we detected a reduction of inflammatory cells and an expansion of endothelial cells. Prediction of cell-cell communication using the Calligraphy pipeline identified a Wnt9b-Sfrp2 crosstalk that emerges as fibrosis resolved in our model. To establish the Wnt9b-Sfrp2 crosstalk as a driver of fibrosis resolution we treated mice with recombinant Sfrp2 and found that slowed spontaneous fibrosis regression compared to vehicle treated mice. Mining our single cell datasets, we identified a subset of endothelial cells, Endo4, as the source of Wnt9b. Immunostaining of the Endo4 marker VWF using tissue clearing and 3D imaging identified VWF+ vasculature surrounded by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that penetrated deep into the fibrotic septa, establishing them as de facto scar-associated endothelial cells. Finally, in situ protease activity screen revealed prominent serine protease activity associated with both scar-associated endothelial and HSCs. This study establishes a novel murine model of MASH fibrosis regression that is extensively characterized both histologically and transcriptomically, and supports targeting the endo-stellate crosstalk within the fibrotic niche via WNTs or their inhibitors as a novel antifibrotic strategy.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Dormancy strategies enable persistence, allow recolonization following disruptions, and facilitate transmission between individuals. In this study, we explored the composition, characteristics, and longitudinal dynamics of the dormant community in the gut as determined by ethanol resistance. We conducted a six-month longitudinal study on nine healthy male adults, who were sampled every two weeks. Gut microbiota composition was determined with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in untreated (bulk microbiota) and ethanol treated samples. A rigorous algorithm was implemented to determine the ethanol-resistant and non-resistant community within the gut microbiota. We detected ethanol-resistant gut bacteria in eight distinct phyla, with the highest number of OTUs observed in the phylum Bacillota, and substantial representation in Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota. In general, ethanol-resistant taxa exhibited higher relative abundance and longer within-individual persistence compared to non-resistant taxa. Ethanol resistance indicated a higher rate of sharing between individuals, independent of phylum. Ethanol-resistant Bacillota also exhibited longer persistence within the gut over the six-months period in comparison to ethanol non-resistant Bacillota and other ethanol-resistant or ethanol non-resistant phyla. Finally, the analysis of sporulation frequency of highly prevalent ethanol-resistant Bacillota members revealed that sporulation occurred in each individual synchronously among different community members but varied significantly between individuals. Major shifts in sporulation frequency were associated with well-known disturbances such as antibiotic therapy and travel. Our findings highlight that sporulation of Bacillota members and alternative dormancy strategies employed by non-Bacillota members contribute to bacterial persistence in the human gut and facilitate transmission between unrelated individuals. Moreover, we show that sporulation frequency (specific to Bacillota) is a dynamic, community-level process shaped by host- and time-specific environmental factors rather than intrinsic, species-specific traits.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

E.; Sork, V. L.; Wright, J. W.", "abstract": "Adaptation and maladaptation are two fundamental evolutionary processes shaping the success of tree populations. Local adaptation has been studied extensively, but maladaptation, which not simply be the inverse, is particularly important for long-lived species since human impact is changing the environment on a very short time scale. Because maladaptation may be observed at different stages of an organism's life cycle, temporal variation may reduce or enhance the vulnerability of a species to a new climate environment. In this paper, we use findings from an ongoing range-wide provenance study comprising two common gardens of 3,674 half-sib juvenile valley oaks (Quercus lobata) from 658 maternal families to address two objectives. First, we test whether maladaptation (a) persists as trees age and/or (b) varies in magnitude over time. We model growth rates and performance measures (height * survival; \"performance\") across families sourced from sites with differing climates. Second, we assess the extent to which evidence-based seed transfer can mitigate the impact of maladaptation. We find that the twelve-year-old trees are currently adapted to temperatures not only cooler than their home site, but also beyond the coolest limit of the current species range. Moreover, this maladaptive pattern is exacerbated in hotter years of our study. Despite a general pattern of maladaptation, we demonstrate the feasibility of using phenotype-informed seed transfer guidelines for replanting trees in current populations by identified high-performing individuals from varied environmental origins. Overall, our results indicate that valley oak is imperiled by current and future climate conditions, but high-performing trees well suited to sites across the species range can be identified as seed donors. We conclude that current maladaptation in a long-lived tree species is a major threat that is first apparent within a few years and worsens as trees age, but careful management of vulnerable oak populations can improve their resiliency.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

S.; Faux, P.; Gautier, M.; Druet, T.", "abstract": "The RZooRoH R package was implemented to characterize individual inbreeding levels. It identifies DNA segments inherited twice from a common ancestor through different paths, which are known as homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments. The package accepts different data formats and provides multiple outputs: HBD segments, inbreeding rates and genome-wide and locus-specific HBD probabilities. In addition, it partitions HBD levels into multiple HBD classes. The length distribution varies between these classes, which therefore correspond to distinct groups of ancestors that can be traced back to different generations in the past. This provides information about mating structure and recent demographic history. The computational performance of the package has been substantially improved, enabling, for example, computing times to be reduced when working with whole-genome sequence data and more HBD classes to be fitted. It is now possible to fit one class per past generation, which facilitates interpretation of the results. New options allow models to be refined, for instance by defining HBD classes as intervals or constant inbreeding rates for neighboring classes. Finally, since we have previously demonstrated that the ZooRoH model can be used to characterize identity-by-descent (IBD) between haploid individuals or phased haplotypes, this option has been included in the new package version. Estimating kinship by characterizing IBD levels between the four possible pairs of haplotypes from two individuals is another feature we added to the package. Overall, the new version of the package offers improved computational efficiency and interpretability when characterizing inbreeding, IBD and relatedness levels.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Their genes are organized in long transcriptional units that give rise to polycistronic transcripts which maturate into mRNA by a process known as trans-splicing. Among those genes, an important subset is composed of multicopy genes, which play crucial roles in host invasion and immune evasion. Here, we predicted the most likely trans-splicing acceptor sites (TASs) for TriTryps and found that the average chromatin organization is very similar among them with a mild nucleosome depletion at the TASs, and the same layout is observed in most of the genome. A detailed examination of the nucleosome landscapes resulting from different levels of chromatin digestion in T. brucei shows that an MNase-sensitive complex is protecting the TASs, and it is at least partly composed of histones. Additionally, comparative analysis for single and multi-copy genes in T. cruzi revealed a differential chromatin structure at the TASs suggesting a novel mechanism to guarantee the fidelity of trans-splicing in trypanosomatids.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We show that late-born penguins display different gene expression patterns in pathways linked to stress responses, but also in homeostasis maintenance. We detected 35 DEGs related to stress, development, cell growth, and homeostasis. Five over-expressed genes in late-born chicks involved in stress response and homeostasis were also hub genes in a gene co-expression module related with late phenology, supporting our hypothesis that late-born individuals are under higher stress levels. Likely as a consequence of early-life stress and energy allocation to homeostasis regulation, late-born chicks also fledge smaller and with lower body condition, and display under-expression of genes related to proper development (notably RPL22L1, HIBCH, and CALM2). Despite these differences, the return rate of late-borns was not significantly different from early-borns in early adult life, suggesting that, when surviving to fledging, early-life stress was successfully curbed, showing no carryover effects in the first years post-fledging.

Applying our theory to single-cell RNA sequencing data, we show that cells operate close to a dynamical transition separating strongly correlated fluctuations, reminiscent of glassy dynamics, from weakly correlated, disordered regimes. Drawing on these experiments, we adapt Restricted Boltzmann Machines to infer cell states by the structure of their collective gene expression fluctuations. This shows that strongly correlated fluctuations characterize cells with the ability to differentiate into more specialised cell types.

Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) has emerged as a powerful technique for post-mortem imaging, achieving high SNR-efficiency and strong diffusion weighting in the challenging imaging environment of fixed tissue. However, the sophisticated signal forming mechanisms of DW-SSFP limit the integration of advanced microstructural models (e.g. incorporating time-dependence; Monte-Carlo simulations) with parameter estimation routines. Here, I investigate the integration of DW-SSFP with neural posterior estimation (NPE), a parameter inference technique leveraging concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning to directly estimate P({theta} | S) (i.e. the posterior distribution of parameters {theta} given signal S). A key challenge is that diffusion attenuation in DW-SSFP is dependent on tissue relaxation properties (T1/T2) and transmit inhomogeneity (B1), which must be incorporated into the NPE network for accurate modelling. By using NPE to estimate P({theta} | S,T1,T2,B1) (i.e. conditioning on S and known T1/T2/B1), using a Tensor representation, I demonstrate that NPE achieves accurate parameter estimation even in the presence of non-Gaussian (Rician) noise in low-SNR regimes. Comparisons with conventional non-linear least-squares (NLLS) using both synthetic and experimental DW-SSFP data (whole human post-mortem brain) give excellent agreement, with NPE providing 1000s of posterior samples in a matched evaluation time.

However, the contribution of ipsilateral motor cortical outputs on motor control remains unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a distinct population of cortico-cerebellar (C-C) neurons in the motor cortex that form monosynaptic projections to the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei. The C-C neurons receive preferential local motor cortical inputs and exhibit projection patterns distinct from cortico-pontine projecting neurons. Using in vivo imaging and optogenetic perturbations, we show that these neurons are active during locomotion and transitions of volitional movements. Disruption of the C-C projection severely affects the locomotion and balancing. Interestingly, the C-C pathway is selectively involved in the initiation and coordination of ipsilateral forelimb movements, without affecting contralateral movement kinematics. These findings shed light on a non-canonical cortico-cerebellar pathway that supports ipsilateral motor control, complementing the traditional control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex over the contralateral motor domains.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The pathological entities associated with ALS are known as ''MetaAggregates'': heterogeneous coaggregates composed of amyloids, RBPs, and RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s). In this study, to explore the molecular constituents of ALS-associated MetaAggregates, we developed a proteomic approach using a psoralen-conjugated RBP and crosslinked it with a biotinylated rG4 to enable the isolation of MetaAggregates from ALS brain extracts. Single-cell RNA-seq using in vitro ALS models identified ELAVL4 as a cytoplasmic RBP and revealed the enrichment of an IGFBP2-derived rG4 structure in ALS-specific neurons. Mass spectrometry and amyloidogenicity-based principal component analysis revealed 79 candidate proteins with roles in RNA processing, metabolism, trafficking, and stress responses. Docking simulations highlighted a subset of proteins with potential pro-aggregation characteristics, diverse cytosolic associations and functional links to RNA processing relevant to ALS.

Chemokine receptor CXCR4, a GPCR, plays versatile roles in normal and abnormal physiological processes. Synthetic CXCR4 antagonists have been extensively studied and approved for the clinical treatment of cancer and other diseases. We recently elucidated the structural mechanisms underlying CXCR4 antagonism using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). CXCR4 agonism by synthetic molecules is an unanticipated therapeutic intervention we recently unveiled. The structural mechanisms underlying those actions remain poorly understood yet could help elucidate a new class of drugs. Here we demonstrate a synthetic dual-moiety strategy that combines simplified agonistic and antagonistic moieties taken from natural agonistic and antagonistic chemokines, respectively, to design de novo peptide mimics of biological function of natural CXCR4 agonist SDF-1. Two peptides so generated, SDV1a and SDVX1 were shown to mimic the action of SDF-1 in activating CXCR4 signaling pathways and cell migration. The structural mechanism of these peptides in the mimicry of CXCR4 agonism was illustrated by cryo-EM structures of CXCR4 bound and activated by the peptides in the presence of G protein, revealing common interactions with the receptor by these peptides in comparison with SDF-1 that explain their close mimicry and conformational changes leading to CXCR4 signal activation. The therapeutic benefit of one of these peptides, SDV1a, was demonstrated in the SOD1G93A mouse model of the spinal motor neuron degenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) wherein the success of neuroprotective actions of transplanted human neural stem cells (hNSCs) is directly correlated with the expanse of diseased neuroaxis traversed by the donor cells; SDV1a enabled broader neuroprotective coverage while also permitting a much less invasive route of cell administration for extending life.

Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 exemplifies this ability by temporally separating photosynthesis and diazotrophy to sustain metabolism. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process, we employed LC/MS-MS proteomics in a diel culturing experiment, revealing tightly coordinated protein abundance patterns. Our findings showed a sophisticated temporal regulation of metabolic processes categorized within six distinct protein abundance clusters: (1) nitrogen fixation and amino acid biosynthesis proteins peaked during the night, while (2) glycogen metabolism and dark reactions of photosynthesis were most abundant during the night and day-night transition, likely supporting carbon consumption and energy production. Midday (3 and 4) was dominated by proteins related to photosynthesis, cellular division, and lipid synthesis, whereas late-day peaks (5) in peptide biosynthesis may facilitate nitrogenase complex formation. Notably, the day-night transition (6) exhibited fine-tuned coordination of nitrogenase assembly, with FeS cluster proteins preceding peak nitrogenase iron protein abundance, implying a temporally ordered sequence for functional enzyme formation. Within these categories, sharp temporal patterns emerged in iron trafficking to heme and iron cluster biosynthetic systems, consistent with the need to maintain tight control of iron distribution to metalloproteins at each temporal transition. These results highlight the intricate diel regulation that enables Crocosphaera to balance nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis within a single cell. The observed coordination supports the existence of a complex regulatory system ensuring optimal metabolic performance, reinforcing the critical role of temporal control in sustaining these globally significant biological processes.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

This ignorance is further compounded when applied to life in multi-extreme environments where low temperatures combine with factors such as high salt concentrations, or high environmental pressures. It has been proposed that the onset of intracellular vitrification enforces a biophysical low temperature limit for unicellular life at ~ -23 {degrees}C. However, it has not been demonstrated how high-pressures affect intracellular vitrification, which is vital for understanding the habitability of low temperature, subsurface environments, both on Earth and on other planetary bodies. Here, we used high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry to measure the intracellular vitrification of Bacillus subtilis across pressures ranging from 1 to 1000 bar. We find that high pressures depress the onset of intracellular vitrification in a pressure dependent manner, which is tightly correlated with the ability of pressure to depress the freezing point of water. Additionally, we show that sub-molar concentrations of NaCl can act in combination with high pressures to further depress intracellular vitrification, highlighting the interplay between temperature, pressure, and ions in influencing the physical state of cells in natural environments. These results show that cells in subzero high-pressure environments would be liquidous, and potentially metabolically active, and not merely vitrified and preserved.

S.", "abstract": "The Mesorhizobium nre (nickel resistance) operon has previously been shown to mediate Ni tolerance in serpentine soils with naturally high concentrations of this transition metal. In most serpentine-derived strains evaluated, the putative efflux genes nreX and nreY are conserved, along with a small gene (nreA) encoding a CsoR/RcnR-family transcriptional regulator. CsoR/RcnR-family regulators are small (around 100 amino acids in length), they bind transition metals, and they use an unconventional and poorly understood DNA-binding mechanism. NreA is 93 amino acids in length and belongs to a poorly characterized clade within the CsoR/RcnR family. This investigation is focused on regulatory DNA elements that functionally interact with Mesorhizobium NreA, as well as amino acid residues in NreA that influence its regulatory activity. We show that NreA is a transcriptional repressor that is responsive to exogenous Ni. The Ni-responsive promoter is immediately upstream of the nreAXY operon, resulting in a leaderless transcript. A partially palindromic operator sequence occupies the spacer region between the -35 and -10 promoter elements. Mutational analysis of the operator highlights functionally crucial base pairs occupying opposite ends of the palindromic operator. Changes to conserved residues in the NreA polypeptide result in varying effects, with changes predicted to prevent Ni binding leading to super-repressor phenotypes. Structural modeling of the NreA-operator complex provides a plausible mechanism for DNA binding by a tetrameric form of NreA, with DNA contact sites along a positively charged surface, and the modeled contact sites agree well with the mutational analysis.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The frlBONMD-frlP operon mediates this process and is subjected to specific and global regulation. Although the degradation pathway favoring -glycated amino acids is known, the mechanisms of substrate uptake have remained unclear. In this study, mutagenic and functional analyses revealed that FrlONM, a type I ABC importer, along with the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) FrlP, is required for the uptake of fructosevaline. Transcriptional and translation frlP-lacZ fusions indicated that frlP is induced by fructosevaline and negatively regulated by the FrlR repressor. Furthermore, by targeting an RNA molecule (S1254) encoded upstream from frlP and overlapping the repressor flrR gene transcribed in the opposite direction, we provide evidence for the dual regulation of frlP by this anti-sense RNA and FrlR. This result adds a posttranscriptional layer to the intricate regulation of the fructosamines operon. In addition, we show that MsmX, a multitask NBD of B. subtilis, is also able to serve as energy motor of this type I ABC importer, and that its presence alongside FrlP is vital for optimal growth on fructosevaline. To address the physiological significance of this functional redundancy we assessed the distribution of ABC type I NBDs FrlP and MsmX across the Bacillaceae family. MsmX is homogeneously distributed in Bacillaceae family tree, while FrlP is restricted to the Bacillus subtilis group, suggesting that the presence of FrlP together with other components of the fructosamines operon is important for bacteria fitness in plant-associated ecological niches.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

For chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the cellular metabolites required for a successful infection are largely unknown. We show that CHIKV reprograms sulfur-dependent pathways. To maintain the resupply of thiols, the methionine (Met) salvage players, 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and methionine adenosyltransferase-2a (Mat2a) are co-induced specifically. Under sulfur-depleted conditions, exogenously added MTA restores CHIKV replication more efficiently than its precursor S-adenosylmethionine, while inhibitions of Mat2a or de novo cysteine (Cys) biosynthesis reduce viral infectivity. Upon sulfur insufficiency CHIKV upregulates the U34-tRNA methyltransferase ALKBH8, and when ALKBH8 is deleted, virus replication is reduced by impairing sulfur relay, recapitulating Met-Cys deprivation effects. We found that MTA-mediated CHIKV replication occurs via m6A-independent priming, and that the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitors DzNep and Adox, inhibited CHIKV replication with nanomolar potency.

SE population is composed of two clonal lineages, A/C and B, with distinct pathogenic potential. Although pH is known to change during infection when SE crosses the host skin to access the bloodstream, the impact of this pH alteration on SE pathogenicity is poorly understood. Recognizing how SE deals with pH increments will help designing effective prevention and treatment strategies against SE infections. To investigate the metabolic adaptations of representative A/C and B strains to different pH, we mimicked skin and blood pH conditions (5.5 and 7.4) and followed biomass formation, growth media pH and exometabolites over time. Although both strains share some metabolic patterns, specificities were identified for each strain and pH condition. The B strain was better adapted to use diverse carbon sources and at blood pH has a more active TCA cycle and amino acid catabolism. At blood pH, the B strain depletes formate from the extracellular media, while its extracellular accumulation by the A/C strain could work as a host invasion strategy. For both SE strains, TCA cycle regulation, purine biosynthesis and glutamate uptake could be associated with virulence, particularly biofilm production, especially relevant for ICE25 which is able to produce high adherence biofilm. The uptake and consumption of saccharides follow similar profiles and seem to be pH-regulated by both strains.

Peptidomimetic derivatization with a bromoacetamide group alkylated a NEDD9 cysteine positioned uniquely among SH3 domains (Cys18), which stabilized the RT loop, prevented FAK binding, and inhibited human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) migration. When linked to a thalidomide moiety, the peptide showed degrader activity of NEDD9 protein and, therefore, we next investigated therapeutic application of NEDD9 inhibition. In HPAECs, si-NEDD9 downregulated sulfatase-1, which increased podosome rosette formation and cell migration via 6-O-desulfation of glycocalyx-forming heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and reversed vascular remodeling and PAH in vivo. Whereas sulfatase-1 overexpression decreased pulmonary endothelial podosome formation, cell migration, and tube formation and increased collagen III synthesis, sulfatase-1 knockdown prevented fibroproliferative remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in PAH in vivo. These data leverage cysteinyl thiol reactivity to establish an SH3 domain-targeting structure-validated covalent peptide and identify two convergent mechanisms through NEDD9 that control endothelial phenotype, including reverse remodeling via sulfatase-1 transcriptional control.

Dedicated cleaners exhibited greater variability in both the amount of time spent interacting with clients and in cheating behaviour, with some species cheating consistently regardless of client type, while others adopted more selective strategies. This was particularly evident in Labroides dimidiatus, which reduced cheating with socially valuable clients, suggesting behavioural flexibility shaped by local competition and interaction frequency.

However, the osteoanabolic therapeutic potential of NGF-TrkA signaling to repair bone is limited due to the long-lasting thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by administration of NGF in mice and humans. Here, we investigated whether 1) mature osteoblasts are the primary source of NGF required for bone accrual following loading, and 2) a small molecule TrkA receptor agonist - gambogic amide - can harness the downstream osteoanabolic potential of NGF-TrkA signaling in the absence of endogenous NGF.

Thus, we developed a method to estimate body segment inertial parameters based on smartphone pictures. From the pictures, we reconstruct the body hull, estimate the skeletal shape and pose, and then estimate the distribution of bone, lean, and fatty tissues. We then segment the body hull and assign each tissue type a density, which is used to calculate the body segment inertial parameters. These personalizated models were validated with an experiment including gait and magnetic resonance imaging measurements. We found that our method leads to a reduction of residual forces of up to 14.9 % and a reduction of metabolic cost of up to 12.8 % when compared to generic musculoskeletal models. Furthermore, the shape-based inertial parameter personalization method creates participant-specific musculoskeletal models that are closer to the MRI-derived ground truth than generic models.

Amphipathic peptides, characterized by alternating polar and hydrophobic residues, are especially effective in forming supramolecular nanofibers stabilized by pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds. Chemical modifications, particularly on aromatic side chains, have proven to be a promising approach for controlling assembly morphology, stability, and biological activity. In organic chemistry, the use of chemical substituents, such as halogens, alkyl groups, or electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, has been widely employed to alter reactivity, stability, and molecular interactions for diverse applications, including catalysts, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

However, many existing models fail to account for the unique characteristics of MMs in double-stranded DNA binding proteins (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). To address this, we constructed a comprehensive dataset from diverse sources, clearly distinguishing between DSBs and SSBs. Using sequence-based embeddings from pre-trained protein language models, including ESM2, ProtTrans, and ESM1v, we developed EPEPDI, a deep learning framework that integrates these embeddings through a multi-channel architecture. To refine predictive accuracy, we introduced an information entropy-based algorithm, determining 181 residues as the optimal sequence length where amino acid contributions and entropy dynamics balance. This approach boosts both precision and computational efficiency, enabling scalable analysis of mutation impacts on DNA-binding proteins. Ablation studies validated optimal feature combinations, demonstrating that EPEPDI outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.755 on the MPD276 dataset via ten-fold cross-validation and 0.632 on independent tests for both DSBs and SSBs. This work highlights the importance of distinguishing DSBs and SSBs in PDIs and shows the potential of advanced machine learning in biological research.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The primer pairs must amplify markers with high sensitivity and specificity for a particular microbiota source, while factors such as melting temperature, secondary structure formation, and amplicon length must be carefully considered to ensure efficient amplification. To accomplish this, previous MST studies relied on complex, multi-step analysis, which was labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present MicrobiomePrime, a tool for identifying primer pairs for amplification of source-associated markers by analyzing amplicon sequences. Our approach is based on splitting amplicon sequences from target sources into K-mers, which are treated as potential primers in an in silico PCR. As proof of concept, we applied the tool to identify markers associated with pig feces, generating thousands of primer pairs. Among nine primer pairs selected for laboratory validation, six primer pairs exhibited in vitro specificity higher than 93 %. Among them, four were 100 % specific. While originally developed for MST, MicrobiomePrime has broader applicability, enabling the design of primers targeting any molecular marker based on amplicon sequencing data.

B.; Pates, S.", "abstract": "Trilobite cephala show high disparity owing to their supporting of key functional ecological structures, such as sensory and feeding structures, and those enabling important behaviours like enrollment and exoskeleton moulting. Previous studies analysed associations between cephalic morphometry, trends through time and with diversity, and these behaviours. However, no studies have yet quantitatively compared the importance of these different varied factors on cephalic morphometry. Here, we explore the association between trilobite cephalic morphometry and taxonomic variables, moulting behaviour, and facial suture type in Principal Components Analysis morphospace, and assess whether these variables can predict cephalic morphometry using Linear Discriminant Analyses. We employed Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs) to quantify the hierarchical importance of these variables for determining cephalic disparity. The dataset used comprises cephalon outlines for 762 species of trilobites from across the globe and through the entire Palaeozoic. We found that variation in cephalic morphometry is not clearly associated with moulting behaviour, nor is moulting behaviour linked to facial suture type. Trilobite moulting behaviour is evidently too phenotypically plastic, and/or preservationally impacted, to produce clear signals across broad datasets. Results demonstrate the utility of LMMs for palaeontological datasets; we found that family-level assignment overall well explains cephalic morphometry, more so than order-level assignment which shows significant overlap in morphospace. Geological Period, facial suture type, and moulting behaviour had little impact on cephalic morphometry. We thereby demonstrate that trilobite cephalic outline morphometry is generally in accordance with trilobite family-level systematics and highlight the use of LMMs for interrogating broad-scale fossil morphological data.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

By coupling base excision repair (BER) events to a programmable DNA-based transducer, our system converts the activity of DNA glycosylases, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) and human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1), into a robust fluorescence signal via Cas12a-mediated trans-cleavage. This one-step CRISPR-based assay operates directly in cell lysates, enabling rapid and sensitive readout of enzymatic activity with high specificity. Additionally, it also enables in 15 minutes the throughput screening of novel potential inhibitors with high sensitivity. The modular design allows adaptation to diverse repair enzymes, offering a generalizable strategy for transforming intracellular repair events into programmable outputs.

How then, do we decide whether to put this effort in? Decision-making not only involves choosing our actions, but also the meta-decision of how much cognitive effort to invest in making this choice, weighing the costs of cognitive effort against potential rewards. Popular recent theories, grounded in the field of reinforcement learning, suggest that this cost-benefit trade-off can be informed by the opportunity costs of effort investment, which the brain may approximate by the estimated average reward rate per unit time. It follows from intuition that in a low reward environment, investing cognitive resources in the task at hand will less likely lead to missed opportunities. Recent studies provided support for this idea, showing that people exert more cognitive effort when reward rate is low. Here, we replicate one of the key previous findings but provide an important nuance to this result. Cognitive effort allocation was better explained by participants' recent performance history (i.e. accuracy rate) than average reward rate. In combination with the observation that participants were insensitive to the reward currently at stake, this invites a reinterpretation of these previous findings and suggests the need for further studies to assess whether environmental richness may indeed serve as a heuristic to modulate cognitive effort allocation.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

This offers an opportunity to optimize the processing of repeated stimuli. Indeed, stimulus repetition leads to classically described neuronal response decreases, and to more recently described neuronal gamma synchronization increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials). Here, we used a full-screen colored background (FSCB) and a flashed black bar, while recording multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from area V1 of an awake macaque monkey. We found that the FSCB repetition induced neuronal response increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials) and gamma synchronization decreases (preceded by increases for a few trials). These effects are largely opposite to the dominant previous findings. Intriguingly, these surprising effects largely reversed when we isolated the responses to the flashed black bar. We discuss these findings, considering differences to previous studies with regards to the subject of the study, the stimuli and the task. We notice that in studies reporting classical results for gamma, sometimes in combination with firing rates, the stimuli were typically (partly) predictive of the reward. Here, we found non-classical results for the FSCB that was not reward predictive, and classical results for the black bar that was reward predictive. Whether this has revealed a general effect of reward predictive versus non-predictive stimuli will require further investigation with stimuli and task designs tailored specifically for this question.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We analyzed induced spectral power time-locked to three risk levels: early no-risk pumps, final successful pumps (preceding a cash out), and unsuccessful pumps (preceding a balloon burst). Time-frequency decomposition using Morlet wavelets revealed a parieto-occipital alpha power increase following early no-risk pumps, interpreted as disengagement from deliberative processing when anticipating sure rewards.

However, it is not possible to study the molecular mechanism(s) of entry, capsid uncoating and genome release without the production of virus particles. To utilise the benefits provided by replicons for the study of viral cell entry, it would be necessary to supply the structural proteins in trans.

The nascent replicons are packaged in trans to form virus particles containing fluorescent or luminescent replicon genomes. This enables the real-time assessment of EV entry and replication through quantification of fluorescence using live-cell imaging. We demonstrate that these TE particles are biologically accurate proxies to EVA71 virions and show utility for the study of EV entry, uncoating and replication.

The viruses possess an NA polymorphism associated with plasminogen binding, as well as an unusual sequence around the HA cleavage site; accordingly, HA cleavage mediated by NA-driven plasminogen recruitment has been proposed to underly their systemic spread and pathogenicity. To test this, we established a reverse genetics system for A/chicken/Belgium/460/2019 and created single mutations in HA (K345R), and NA (S122N) that restored the viruses to normal consensus, as well as an HA/NA double mutant. Confirming previous work, trypsin-independent spread and HA cleavage of wild type Ck/Belgium was observed in the presence of fetal bovine serum containing plasminogen in vitro. Dose-dependent HA cleavage and trypsin-independent spread was also observed in the presence of purified chicken plasminogen. Compared to wild type virus, both HA cleavage and virus spread in vitro were reduced by the HA K345R mutation and further blocked by NA mutation S122N. Plasminogen-mediated HA cleavage was seen in a variety of avian cell lines and chicken organoids, excluding cell type-dependent effects. Furthermore, in ovo tests showed that mutant viruses unable to recruit plasminogen were less able to replicate systemically in chicken embryos. Bioinformatics analyses revealed other viruses which could potentially recruit plasminogen, including two independent outbreaks of H6N1 viruses, one of which we confirmed PLG-driven spread in vitro. We conclude that PLG-recruitment by NA is a general virulence mechanism of N1 LPAIVs.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Here we assessed the spoilage capabilities of a large panel (n=124) of Pseudomonas species food-derived isolates on meat (chicken) and leafy greens (spinach). Most isolates (71/124) were capable of spoiling both foods, but some were only capable of spoiling only chicken (21/124) or spinach (23/124), or neither (9/124). Our data also demonstrated that the type of fresh food the strain was isolated from influenced spoilage capabilities: strains isolated from meat were likely to spoil both chicken and spinach, while those isolated from leafy greens were more likely to spoil only spinach. We used fluorescence microscopy to visualise how Pseudomonas spoilage species interacted with the meat or leaf tissue and observed significant tissue destruction associated with biofilm formation. For chicken, this was associated with the formation of dense biofilm pillars that penetrated deep into the tissue. For spinach we observed biofilms on the leaf in areas of tissue degradation. Finally, we explored the correlation between potentially relevant phenotypes (in vitro biofilm, motility and secreted enzyme production) and spoilage capabilities. There was no significant correlation between any of these phenotypes and spoilage, except for secreted protease activity and chicken spoilage.

Circadian rhythms appear to influence early developmental processes and may play a role in shaping this relationship. While infancy is a critical window for both gut microbiota establishment and the maturation of sleep regulation, the role of gut bacteria in modulating infant sleep remains poorly understood. In this longitudinal study, we performed continuous within-subject sampling (monitoring across 48 hours) in 20 infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to examine associations between the establishment of gut microbiota and sleep patterns. We hypothesized that microbial diversity and sleep rhythmicity would be linked across both short (diurnal) and long (monthly) time scales. Gut microbiota profiles were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing; gut melatonin concentrations were measured; and sleep metrics were quantified through wearable actimetry, parent-reported 24-hour sleep diaries, and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). Parents additionally completed the Baby Care Questionnaire (BCQ), assessing parenting style, and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), evaluating infant behavioral development. In some infants, alpha diversity followed diurnal rhythmic patterns. Although bacterial rhythmicity was not significantly associated with sleep rhythmicity, as quantified with the Circadian Function Index, infants with higher alpha diversity had more robust sleep rhythmicity (beta(Faith PD)= 0.0721, SE = 0.0337). Infant age emerged as the strongest predictor of both gut microbiota diversity (observed features: beta(age) = 0.101, SE = 0.0172) and gut melatonin concentrations (beta(age) = 0.638, SE = 0.162). For the same age, gut microbiota temporal volatility - an indicator for bacterial community instability - was not associated with sleep patterns. This study demonstrates promising short- and long-term links between gut microbiota diversity and sleep-wake rhythm maturation in infancy.

CasX2 offers several advantages over Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), including its smaller size, distinct protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements, staggered cleavage cuts that promote homology-directed repair, and no known pre-existing immunity in humans. A recent study reported that a three amino acid substitution in CasX2 significantly enhanced cleavage activity (1). Therefore, we compared cleavage efficiency and double-stranded break repair characteristics between the native CasX2 and the variant, CasX2Max, for cleavage of CCR5, a gene that encodes the CCR5 receptor important for HIV-1 infection. Two CasX2 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed that flanked the 32 bases deleted in the natural CCR5 {triangleup}32 mutation. Nanopore sequencing demonstrated that CasX2 using sgRNAs with spacers of 17 nucleotides (nt), 20 nt or 23 nt in length were ineffective at cleaving genomic CCR5. In contrast, CasX2Max using sgRNAs with 20 nt and 23 nt spacer lengths, enabled robust genomic cleavage of CCR5. Structural modeling indicated that two of the CasX2Max substitutions enhanced sgRNA-DNA duplex stability, while the third improved DNA strand alignment within the catalytic site. These structural changes likely underlie the increased activity of CasX2Max in cellular gene excision.

This study aims to assess the sensitivity of key factors governing the ecology of mosquitoes, using a deterministic, compartmental model developed for the transmission of RVFV in Kenya. Specifically, we investigate the influence of four model parameters on mosquito abundance, focusing on the proportion of water body area utilized for oviposition. A literature review was conducted to establish parameter ranges and distributions. The Sobol method of global sensitivity analysis was then applied to a simplified model environment, firstly with constant temperature and water body area and secondly with periodic temperature and water body area. The indices calculated were used to rank the parameters based on their influence on mosquito abundance. The analysis showed that there is a need to reduce uncertainty in the area scanned by Culex and identified the proportion of water body area used for oviposition as a highly influential parameter.

To this end, we have developed weighted sliced inverse regression (wSIR), a sufficient dimension reduction technique that performs dimensionality reduction and retains as much predictive power of the spatial coordinates as possible. As a linear dimensionality reduction approach, wSIR is applicable to multiple distinct spatial transcriptomic datasets, and is extremely scalable due to the algorithm and our Rcpp implementation, with over 100,000 cells processed in under 2 minutes on a standard laptop.

TQR and HI scales assessed perceived recovery and well-being. Results Significant changes were observed in jump height, concentric impulse, and RSImod between pre-match and 48 hours post-match in players with less playing time. Subjective variables TQR and HI did not show significant differences during the study period. Conclusion Competition did not significantly affect CMJ variables, suggesting that volleyball does not reduce jumping ability immediately after competing, which has direct implications for microcycle structure. The study highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of performance and recovery in volleyball.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

It has been shown that neuronal sequences with weak feedforward connectivity can be replayed due to amplification via intra-assembly recurrent connections. However, this phenomenon was thought to depend on inhibitory feedback, but its mechanisms were still unclear. Here, we arrive at a minimal spiking model that shows that feedback inhibition is not needed for this amplification to occur. We then introduce a population model of membrane-potential distributions that explains the spiking network behavior, and we analytically describe how different connectivity structures determine replay speed, with weaker feedforward connectivity generating slower pulses that can be sustained by recurrent connections. These pulses can only propagate if neuronal leak currents are slow enough with respect to the pulse speed. Together, our simulations and analytical results predict the conditions for replay of neuronal assemblies.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Although F. nucleatum is usually susceptible to a range of antibiotics, these have been associated with worse outcomes when administered with anti-neoplastic chemotherapy. Bacteriophages are viewed as natural alternatives to antibiotics that provide bacterial-specific targeting. In this study, we demonstrated that gastric tumour tissues and cells expressed Gal-GalNac molecules that facilitate binding of the fap2 receptor on F. nucleatum, leading to increased cancer cell proliferation and migratory potential. We then employed an F. nucleatum specific bacteriophage, FNU1, to limit the effects of this oncobacteria in colon cancer and gastric cancer cell models. We demonstrated that FNU1 was able to negate the F. nucleatum-dependent growth stimulatory effects, migratory ability, induction of reactive oxygen species, and autophagy in these cell lines. F. nucleatum also inhibited apoptosis in co-cultures with colon and gastric cancer cells, and FNU1 acted synergistically with the chemotherapy agents 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin to induce apoptosis in these models. Treatments with bacteriophage FNU1, therefore, have the potential to augment existing cancer therapy, and further testing in animal models is warranted.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Our study investigated the effect of migration on the gut microbiome of the Mishing ethnic community in India associated with urban migration from their pastural lifestyle. Gut bacterial diversity was profiled using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We observed notable alterations in microbial diversity and composition, including changes in the core microbiome. While Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus and Streptococcus significantly increased (p < 0.01) among the migrant population there was depletion in bacteria such as Succinivibrio and Prevotella. This change in core microbiome was further reflected on the functional profile of the bacterial community harbored by the urban and rural dwellers. While the rural population was enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, amino acid and Vitamin B2 biosynthesis pathways were more prominent in the microbiome of the urban dwellers. We further observed increase in diversity and richness of the microbiome following migration. Co-analysis with ASVs from food samples consumed by the Mishing rural population revealed that 51 ASVs among the rural dwellers were from a widely consumed beverage, Apong which were completely absent among the migrants. Our analyses highlight the dietary preferences, particularly abstinence from specific foods and beverages, may modulate the alterations in gut microbial profiles.

L.", "abstract": "Mutations in rpoB, a gene that encodes the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) beta-subunit, can cause high-level resistance to rifampicin. Approximately 95% of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates possess mutations in an 81-base pair rpoB region referred to as the rifampicin-resistance determining region (rpoB/RRDR). Also, rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates carry multiple mutations in RNAP genes (i.e., rpoA, rpoB, rpoC, rpoD), particularly rpoA and rpoC, which encode the alpha- (2) and beta'- ({beta}') subunits, respectively. Such secondary mutations offset the fitness cost associated with rifampicin-resistance mutations in M. tuberculosis, resulting in resistant strains that are as fit as the wildtype drug-susceptible strains. To analyse the patterns of compensatory mutations in RNAP encoding genes of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in Uganda, whole genome sequencing and Sanger DNA sequencing were performed on 52 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates - 20 drug-susceptible and 32 multidrug resistant (MDR). A total of 24 (75%) MDR-TB isolates had high-level rifampicin-resistance conferring mutations in rpoB/RRDR i.e., Ser531Leu (31%); His526Asp (6%); His526Leu (3%); His526Tyr (3%); His526Arg (3%); His526Gly (3%); Asp516Tyr (13%); Asp516Val (6%); Glu513Lys (3%); Leu511Pro (3%); Leu492Leu (3%); Gln490Arg (3%). Further, two putative compensatory mutations (Gln490Arg & Lys1025Glu) outside the RRDR and not resistance conferring were found in rpoB. Altogether, 16 (50%) MDR-TB isolates with rpoB/RRDR resistance conferring mutations had non-synonymous mutations in rpoC of the following patterns Leu39Phe (3%); Tyr61His (3%); Asp271Gly (3%); Ser377Ala (3%); Pro481Thr (3%); Val483Ala (6%); Leu516Pro (3%); Ala521Asp (3%); Gly594Glu (13%); Asn698Ser (3%); Leu823Pro (3%). In conclusion, putative compensatory mutations are prevalent in rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in Uganda, with rpoC/Gly594Glu and rpoC/Val483Ala as the most frequent.

We show that it is possible to estimate all sources of variation under realistic experimental conditions. Our results also show that model fitting can compensate by overestimating residual source of variation, leading to biased parameter estimates when the mechanistic noise is misspecified. Applied to empirical data, the model reveals that standard assumptions, such as prey renewal and lack of spatial structure, fail to capture observed variability.

To investigate the molecular basis of these opposing growth outcomes, we generated isogenic human embryonic stem cells carrying growth syndrome-associated mutations in DNMT3A and NSD1. Unexpectedly, both overgrowth- and growth restriction-associated DNMT3A mutations led to DNA hypomethylation in a shared subset of active enhancers, implicating H3K36me2 in directing enhancer methylation maintenance.

However, most in vitro assays used to study thrombosis do not include the endothelium. OBJECTIVE To develop a thrombus-on-chip model that includes endothelium and whole blood and allows for manipulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), shear stress and other vascular cells. METHODS A cylindrical vessel was created in a collagen matrix using the needle-based fabrication technique in a microfluidic device. Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) or endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) were cultured in the channel, with continuous monodirectional media turnover. Immunostaining and permeability measurement validated monolayer confluency and integrity. To investigate thrombosis, whole blood from healthy donors was perfused through TNF--activated or untreated EC-lined vessels. Image analysis and time-lapse microscopy were used to quantify labelled platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition. RESULTS TNF- treatment resulted in increased platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition compared to control vessels. TNF-induced endothelial activation was confirmed by upregulation of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, E-selectin and of tissue factor (TF). Thrombus formation in TNF- treated vessels was inhibited by an anti-TF antibody. In ECFC vessels, platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition were comparable to HUVEC, supporting feasibility of patient-based studies. CONCLUSIONS We developed a perfused thrombus-on-chip model that combines key elements of thrombus formation including endothelium. The model is amenable to independent control of microenvironmental stimuli, crosstalk with tissue-specific cells, and the inclusion of patients' own cells and blood for precision medicine studies.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

R.; Barbar, E. J.; Zuckerman, D. M.", "abstract": "Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a powerful technique for probing biomolecular interactions. However, accurate determination of binding parameters--such as enthalpy and free energy--as well as associated uncertainties can be hindered by noise and concentration variability. Notably, the mathematical ambiguity surrounding analyte concentrations in standard binding models intrinsically limits the precision with which binding parameters, particularly binding enthalpies, can be determined. Here, we present a Bayesian pipeline that resolves this ambiguity by combining two key strategies: simultaneous analysis of multiple ITC datasets and a hierarchical Bayesian treatment of analyte concentration priors. This dual approach not only lifts the degeneracy inherent in single-dataset studies but also removes an ambiguity typically present in Bayesian analysis by self-consistently refining concentration estimates, ensuring optimal joint inference of binding parameters and concentrations. Using modern Monte Carlo techniques enables our pipeline to provide robust posterior sampling for more than 10 datasets and 40 total parameters. We validate the approach with synthetic ITC datasets for single- and multi-site binding models and apply it to experimental data, including 14 datasets for 1:1 binding of Mg(II) to the chelator EDTA and multiple datasets of the hub protein LC8 with diverse binding partners.

In this study, we developed a sequence-based generative foundational model, ViraChron (Viral Chronology Foundation Model), that integrates multi-scale temporal information to compensate for the lack of ancient HBV data. We confirmed the robustness of our model through sequence identity, phylogenetic, and recombination analyses. ViraChron enabled the identification of fixed mutations specific to HBV genotype A, demonstrating that HBV acquires survival advantages through mutations that are ultimately fixed by natural selection.

A.; Fernandez-Barrena, M. G.", "abstract": "Background and Aims. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains limited, partly due to tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion. This study focused on the identification of potential epigenetic drivers of immune resistance in HCC evaluating the therapeutic potential of targeting the histone methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2). Approach and Results. We analyzed G9a expression across multiple human HCC cohorts and found that elevated G9a levels were inversely correlated with practically all the key immune-related gene expression signatures predictive of ICI responsiveness. Using HCC cell lines and orthotopic models in immunocompetent mice, we assessed the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of G9a with two innovative epigenetic inhibitors, CM272 and EZM8266. G9a blockade enhanced tumor cell immunogenicity by restoring IFNg; responsiveness, increasing MHC-I surface expression, and promoting chemokine-mediated (CXCL10) recruitment of T cells. Mechanistically, G9a inhibition induced a viral mimicry response through derepressing endogenous retroviral elements and the accumulation of cytosolic double-stranded RNA. In vivo, G9a inhibition synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy to suppress tumor growth, significantly increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration. Notably, in a clinically-relevant post-hepatectomy HCC recurrence model, the combination therapy overcame surgery-induced immune resistance. Conclusions: G9a functions as a central epigenetic barrier to antitumor immunity in HCC. Pharmacologic G9a inhibition reprograms the tumor microenvironment, enhances immunogenicity, and sensitizes tumors to ICI.

New method We developed REVS (Revolution Evaluation and Visualization Software), a low-cost, open-source hardware and software platform for analyzing and visualizing rodent wheel running behavior. REVS captures wheel revolutions using Hall effect sensors and computes 13 day-level behavioral metrics along with detailed bout-level data.

REVS supports customizable wheel types, facilitating use in animals with motor and/or sensory impairments. Results We validated REVS using a mouse model of partial spinal cord injury, where fine motor control is compromised. REVS detected impairments in 10 of 13 behavioral metrics post-injury, with varied recovery trajectories across measures. Principal component analysis revealed that recovery was closely linked to bout quality and intensity, rather than timing. Comparison with existing methods Unlike commercial and open-source systems, REVS offers more detailed metrics, customizable wheel compatibility, seamless blending with common vivarium hardware, integrated data visualizations, and ODC-compatible data export.

Despite their known roles in energy supply, calcium homeostasis, and proteostasis, our understanding of how the anabolism-linked organelles are structurally arranged within neurons remains incomplete. Due to the tremendous complexity in the morphologies and fine structural features and interwoven nature of these intracellular organelles, particularly the ER, our understanding of their structural organization is limited, particularly, with regard to quantitative assessments of their sites of interaction and accurate measures of their volumetric proportions inside of a single large neuron. To approach this challenge, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) to generate large-scale 3D EM volumes and electron tomography on high-pressure frozen tissue of the rodent cerebellum, including the largest cells in the vertebrate brain, the cerebellar Purkinje neuron as well as the most abundant cell type in the vertebrate brain, the much smaller cerebellar granule neuron. We reconstructed the neuronal ultrastructure of these different cell types, focusing on the ER, mitochondria and membrane contact sites, to then characterize intracellular motifs and organization principles in detail, providing a first full map to quantitatively describe a neuronal endoarchitectome. At the gross level organization, we found that the intracellular composite of organelles are cell type specific features, with specific differences between Purkinje neurons and Granule cells. At the level of fine structure, we mapped ultrastructural domains within Purkinje neurons where ER and mitochondria associate directly. In addition to cell type specific differences, we observed significant subcellular regional variation, particularly within the axon initial segment (AIS) of Purkinje neurons, where we identified ultrastructural domains with sharply contrasting distributions of ER and mitochondria. These findings suggest a finely tuned spatial organization of organelles that may underpin the distinct functional demands along the axon.

Methods: Twenty-two healthy participants underwent pupillometry using both the MV-based viewfinder and a typical LED-based system. Monochromatic red and blue light stimuli were presented for durations of 1 and 10 seconds. Pupil responses, including maximum constriction, PIPR amplitude after 6 seconds from the light offset, area under the curve (AUC) values of PIPR, and sustained slopes, were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model to assess the differences between the two systems. Results: The MV-based viewfinder significantly enhanced net PIPR amplitude (p < 0.05) and sustained slope (p < 0.01) during 10-second light stimulation compared to the LED system, demonstrating its capability to effectively measure ipRGC-driven responses. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the net AUC values. These results highlight that the MV-based viewfinder enables effective PIPR measurements by delivering constant and controlled light stimulation directly to the retina, minimizing the effects of dynamic pupil constriction during light stimulation.

However, little is known about their biological function or regulation. Seeking to fill these gaps in our knowledge, we have identified upstream and downstream partners of MAST1. 14-3-3, a neuronal 14-3-3 paralog, specifically interacts with MAST1 at two regulatory serines, S90 and S161. PAK, a neuronal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, phosphorylates MAST1 to regulate its interaction with 14-3-3. Exploiting mouse models of human Mega Corpus Callosum Syndrome (MCC) and whole brain phosphoproteomics, we identify the microtubule-associated protein Tau as a substrate of MAST1. We show that pathogenic MAST1 mutations perturb protein function either through misfolding or attenuation of kinase activity. Our data is consistent with a model in which the MAST kinases couple PAK, a neuronal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, to microtubule remodeling during the differentiation and specification of cortical neurons.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) comprises more than 80 - 90% of total cellular RNA, efficient rRNA removal is essential for accurately capturing the transcriptome, particularly to sequence low-abundance mRNAs. Inefficient rRNA removal during library preparation can result from variations in sample quality, preparation methods and handling. Estimating rRNA content in RNA-Seq libraries pre-sequencing is therefore challenging due to the absence of a reliable and cost-effective assessment method. This study addresses the issue by introducing a scalable qPCR-based assay targeting 18S rRNA to evaluate rRNA depletion efficiency pre-sequencing. qPCR efficiency was optimized using serial dilutions of Universal Human Reference (UHR) control and Ct thresholds were established using pilot data from 644 libraries. Following this optimization, analysis of 1,748 Total RNA-Seq libraries and 445 Poly A+ two widely used RNA-Seq library methods, demonstrated a strong correlation between 18S rRNA qPCR results and post-sequencing rRNA rates. This assay was also used to evaluate the performance of Oligo dT beads from four different vendors to enrich mRNA.

From December 2021 to September 2022, we conducted an entomological and molecular survey across sylvatic, transition, and urban zones in the Tai region of western Cote dIvoire. We collected 4,414 mosquitoes, representing 29 taxa, and grouped them into 1,553 pools of the same taxa for virus detection and identification. While Eretmapoditis sp. were dominant across all zones, their species composition varied between the zones, with Er. fraseri being most abundant in the sylvatic and urban zones. In the transition zone Er. quinquevittatus was the dominant species. Abundance of other species also varied across zones. Aedes aegypti and Anopheles sp. were most frequent in the urban zone with An. gambiae s.l. and An. paludis being the most common ones. Molecular screening revealed flavivirus RNA being present in multiple pools, with the highest detection rates in the transition zone. We were able to assemble three flavivirus contigs, including Cimo flaviviruses II and VIII, known as insect-specific flaviviruses that can influence vector competence. Notably, Anopheles sp. had the highest estimated infection rates in the sylvatic and transition zones, suggesting a potential role in arbovirus ecology. Our findings suggest that Eretmapodites sp., particularly Er. fraseri, may serve as key bridge vectors due to their widespread presence, mammalian feeding behaviour and potential virus competence. The transition zone emerged as a hotspot for arbovirus diversity and vector-host interactions. This study provides the first comprehensive ecological and molecular characterization of mosquito communities in the Tai region since more than twenty years and underscores the importance of longitudinal and habitat-specific surveillance for anticipating spillover risks.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

The paradigm for appendage evolution in this phylum is that the gene regulatory network responsible for leg subdivision and patterning is broadly conserved. Recent surveys of these genes have suggested that chelicerate exemplars exhibit divergent appendage patterning dynamics, though functional data remain limited. One salient mismatch in expression occurs in homologs of the homeobox gene clawless. In insects, clawless is expressed in the distalmost leg territory, specifying the claw-bearing pretarsus. In the harvestman, Phalangium opilio, clawless occupies a broad tarsal domain early in development, localizing later to the metatarsus-tarsus boundary, suggestive of a tarsal patterning function. Here, we tested the function of harvestman clawless using RNAi. Unlike insects, we show that clawless knockdown results in disrupted tarsal growth and patterning of its proximal segmental boundary, with no effect on the claw. Truncation of the tarsus is associated with defective tarsomere formation. We additionally surveyed clawless homologs in exemplars of chelicerate diversity, which suggests that the tarsal-patterning function for clawless was likely present in the chelicerate common ancestor. These results, alongside available expression data, suggest panarthropod appendage patterning exhibits numerous cases of developmental system drift.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics underlying {beta}-lactam resistance, we constructed a comprehensive combinatorial mutant library comprising all 55,296 possible TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase variants integrating 18 clinically observed mutations across 13 key residues. Over eight million empirical fitness measurements were obtained under selection pressure with both a native antibiotic substrate (ampicillin) and a novel antibiotic (aztreonam), establishing the largest experimentally determined fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance to date. Through graph-theoretic and epistatic analyses, we discovered that selection with ampicillin resulted in weak epistasis, with mutants rarely surpassing the fitness of the wild-type enzyme. Conversely, aztreonam selection elicited extensive higher-order epistasis, generating a rugged fitness landscape characterized by increased phenotypic unpredictability. Interpretable machine-learning analyses identified context-dependent epistatic interactions necessary for achieving high-level aztreonam resistance. Further evolutionary statistical analyses, including direct coupling analysis and latent generative landscapes, showed that top-performing TEM-1 variants consistently adhered to conserved epistatic patterns found in naturally occurring {beta}-lactamases. Our findings demonstrate that higher-order epistasis critically shapes fitness landscape ruggedness when enzymes adapt to novel substrates, whereas adaptations to native substrates exhibit predictably smoother landscapes. This integrated experimental and computational framework provides a foundation for predictive evolutionary pharmacology, enabling assessments of newly developed {beta}-lactams or emerging {beta}-lactamase variants for their potential contribution to ESBL evolution.

This mitogenome exhibited an unusually high GC content, lacked the cox2 gene, and could not be reliably positioned among animals based on phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data. Nevertheless, conserved gene clusters and the presence of atp9 indicated that this species is a sponge, while phylogenetic analysis using 18S and 28S places it in the order Haplosclerida of Demospongiae. Since no tissue of the cryptic sponge was found in the investigated association, its relationship with other sponges remained unclear. Therefore, we sampled 10 additional samples assumed to be H. plakophila - P. symbiotica associations in the field to search for the mysterious third sponge. PCR analysis revealed that one of the collected samples contained the novel sponge, but not H. plakophila. A follow-up morphological investigation revealed that this sponge, Haplosclerida sp. nov., while superficially indistinguishable from H. plakophila, differs in skeletal organization and spicule composition. Here, we report the unusual mitochondrial genome of the new species, along with a phylogenetic analysis using 18S and 28S sequences, and demonstrate that Haplosclerida sp. nov. belongs to a new clade of Haplosclerida.

We sought to connect escape response performance to genotype and phenotype across ontogenetic stages within a single population of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), to determine if a gene of major effect (Ectodysplasin; Eda) on adaptive lateral armour plate phenotype and fitness conveys a performance advantage in brackish and saltwater environments. We predicted that possession of one or more low-plated alleles would result in better escape performance in brackish environments across ontogeny, and that Eda genotype would result in variation in shape phenotype that would be predictive of escape performance before the completion of lateral plate development. We assessed three kinematic variables derived from C-start escape responses in wild-caught, F1 juvenile, and F1 adults, and found that Eda genotypes did not directly impact maximum velocity or curvature coefficient, but linked phenotypes contributed to an increase in total distance traveled in F1 adults. We further showed that Eda genotype impacted growth, producing variation in size which in turn influenced escape performance variables across age groups, with a particular focus on total distance traveled. The influence of Eda genotype on shape was confounded by sexual dimorphism, indicating that further sex-specific studies on shape and performance are needed. The presence of at least one low-plated allele conferred a growth advantage, particularly in a freshwater rearing environment, consistent with known pleiotropic effects of Eda, including on skeletal development, that may be modulating anti-predator responses before plate phenotype is fully expressed.

Meanwhile, declining costs and improved computational methods have made genome resequencing more accessible for non-model species, enabling the generation of datasets that can address evolutionary and ecological questions from micro- to macroevolutionary scales. Whether target capture approaches to likewise generate datasets that can address questions across broad hierarchical scales remains unclear. Here, we assess the efficacy of data collection (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) retention), predicted genetic variation across samples (i.e., heterozygosity), and phylogenetic congruence between data generated using reduced-representation methods and genome resequencing, leveraging publicly available datasets from plants and animals. We found that SNP retention varied by locus type, with genome-wide datasets retaining the highest proportion of SNPs and UCEs the lowest proportion. Heterozygosity also differed, with Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) producing the lowest estimates, followed by UCEs; the inclusion of supercontig flanking regions raised heterozygosity values moderately. Across all phylogenetic trees, UCE datasets had the lowest bootstrap support, followed by BUSCOs and single copy orthologous genes. Population structure analyses frequently underestimated the number of ancestral populations in reduced-representation datasets, often identifying fewer populations than genome-wide datasets and assigning samples to different clusters. These discrepancies underscore the challenges of relying solely on reduced-representation methods for robust inferences of genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and population structure.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

We used sequencing data from 1,903 Populus tremuloides Michx.

The two northern and western North American aspen lineages exhibited historical population expansion patterns, while the southernmost lineage experienced a historical bottleneck consistent with past glacial oscillations. We found that the earliest split between genetic lineages of P. tremuloides occurred in the southern part of its distribution range.

Importantly, 806 combinations of LEP and LEPR variants coexpressed with their respective wild type allele exceeded pathogenicity thresholds, revealing a potential digenic mutational burden.

This complex genetic architecture and the limited understanding of BrS genetic and molecular mechanisms hinder the development of efficient prevention strategies in the context of this syndrome and are unfavorable to the implementation of therapeutic interventions. In this context, understanding the functional impact of the identified putative risk alleles is a prerequisite.

Linear growth is governed by the somatotropic axis, wherein pituitary growth hormone (GH) stimulates hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to promote bone elongation.

Although there have been many successful uses of these tools for improved stability, solubility, and ligand binding, there have been fewer uses of these tools for designing proteins that have intrinsic allosteric mechanisms. In this regard, allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) are a class of regulatory proteins that includes repressors and activators that respond to environmental signals by allosteric communication to regulate their binding with DNA elements. The data exist for evaluating design algorithms for their ability to take allostery into account, as many aTFs have previously been engineered to respond to new ligands, enabling their use as biosensors. In particular, previous work from our lab used directed evolution to change the effector specificity of the transcriptional repressor, RamR, from cholic acids to each of five benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). We wanted to see to what extent we could recapitulate these results by instead using LigandMPNN to design the ligand binding pocket. The wild-type RamR structure was predicted in complex with the five BIAs, and the binding pocket was then targeted for computational redesign. However, there was little overlap between the results of directed evolution and computational redesign, and in fact the nine redesigned protein variants tested proved not to be functional in Escherichia coli.

C.; Baraban, J.; Abel, T.", "abstract": "Neurons utilize RNA interference in the reversible translational repression of synaptically localized mRNAs, enabling rapid translation in response to synaptic activity. Two evolutionarily conserved proteins, Translin and Trax, form an RNase complex which processes miRNAs, tRNAs and siRNAs. To determine the specific role of the RNase activity of this complex in brain function, we employed a mouse line harboring a point mutation in Trax (E126A) that renders the Translin/Trax RNase inactive. At the molecular level, we found alterations in the levels of multiple small RNAs including miRNAs, tsRNAs and substantial downregulation of gene expression at the mRNA level in the hippocampus of TraxE126A mice. At the synaptic level, TraxE126A mice exhibit deficits in specific forms of long-term hippocampal synaptic plasticity. At the behavioral level, TraxE126A mice display impaired long-term spatial memory and altered open-field and acoustic-startle behavior. These studies reveal the functional role of Translin/Trax RNase in the mammalian brain.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Working memory can hold many types of information and is crucial for cognition. Commonly, models of working memory maintain information such as hues or words by forming memory attractors through structured connectivities. However, real-world information can be novel, making it infeasible to use pre-trained attractors. In addition, most models-with or without attractors-have focused on maintaining binary categories instead of continuous information in each neuron. In the present study, we investigate how the brain might maintain working memory representations of arbitrary novel patterns with graded values. We propose an unstructured network model in which each neuron has multiple bistable dendrites. Each dendrite effectively implements fast Hebbian plasticity due to dendritic dynamics and dendrite-soma interactions. This network can maintain novel graded patterns under various perturbations without fine tuning of parameters. Through analytical characterization of network dynamics during the encoding and memory periods, we identify different conditions that yield either perfect memories or several types of memory errors. We also demonstrate memory robustness under various conditions and resilience to temporal inhibitory perturbations. Thus, this architecture provides robust and analytically tractable storage of novel graded patterns in working memory.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined the synaptic properties of CT axon terminals in the medial geniculate body (MGB), the auditory thalamus, in normal hearing mice and in a mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss. In normal hearing mice, we found that the synaptic strength of CTs to the core-type ventral subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGv), which mainly conveys rapid sensory information, is stronger than the synaptic strength of CTs to the matrix-type dorsal subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGd), which likely conveys higher-order internal state information. This is due to increased functional release sites (n) in CT[-&gt;]MGv compared to CT[-&gt;]MGd synapses. After noise trauma, we observed enhanced short-term facilitation in CT[-&gt;]MGd but not CT[-&gt;]MGv synapses. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity after noise-induced hearing loss via which CTs enhance the throughput of matrix-type thalamus, likely to improve perceptual recovery via higher-order contextual modulation.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}

However, its role in cancer pathogenesis, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains poorly understood. Through an analysis of public databases, we found that NSCLC patients with higher ZC3H12A expression levels had a worse prognosis than those with lower levels. To explore the function of Regnase-1 in NSCLC, we knocked out the ZC3H12A gene in NSCLC cell lines and compared their transcriptomes with those of parental cells. This analysis identified the SOX2 pathway as a common pathway suppressed by Regnase-1 deficiency. Consistent with the SOX2 contribution to the cancer stemness, Regnase-1 inhibition impaired oncosphere growth and tumor formation of cell lines derived from adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. It was also effective for NRF2-activated NSCLC cells, which are highly resistant to most of the therapeutics. Notably, post-tumorigenic suppression of Regnase-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth, suggesting that Regnase-1 could be a promising therapeutic target for post-tumorigenic treatment of NSCLC. Given recent studies describing that Regnase-1 inhibition enhances anti-cancer immunity, we propose that targeting Regnase-1 could be an ideal strategy for controlling intractable cancers by both suppressing cancer cells and activating anti-cancer immunity.", "date": "2025-07-11", "journal": ""}
