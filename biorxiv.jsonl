However, this approach is time consuming, produces variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice habituated more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in paw withdrawal and pain associated behaviors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdala neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map central control of pain.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1-CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial proteins and decreased ribosome abundance, like the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Knowledge of this coevolutionary system can help to understand tumour-immune dynamics both during tumorigenesis and during immunotherapy treatments. Here, we present an individual-based model of mutation accumulation, where random mutations in cancer cells trigger specialised immune responses. Unlike previous research, we explicitly model interactions between cancer and effector cells and incorporate stochastic effects, which are important for the expansion and extinction of small populations. We find that the parameters governing interactions between the cancer and effector cells induce different outcomes of tumour progress, such as suppression and evasion. While it is hard to measure the cancer-immune dynamics directly, genetic information of the cancer may indicate the presence of such interactions. Our model demonstrates signatures of selection in sequencing-derived summary statistics, such as the single-cell mutational burden distribution.

In yeast, the A/B toxin K28 is internalised to endosomes of susceptible yeast, before following the retrograde trafficking pathway and ultimately triggering cell cycle arrest. The endolysosomal defence factor Ktd1 protects against K28, but its regulation remains unclear. Cog7, a subunit of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex, has been implicated in K28 defence, though the mechanism is unknown. We developed a high throughput K28 sensitivity assay and bespoke analysis package to show that all lobe B COG subunits (Cog5 - 8) are required for K28 resistance. Although the COG complex modulates glycosylation of the surface molecules required to bind extracellular K28, our experiments reveal that the hypersensitivity of cog mutants is primarily explained by defects in Ktd1 trafficking. Ktd1 mis-localisation in cog mutants is reminiscent to disruptions in Snc1, a surface cargo that recycles multiple times via the Golgi. This work suggests not only that the COG complex is responsible for the precise trafficking Ktd1 required to mediate toxin defence, but that Ktd1 may survey endolysosomal compartments for internalised K28. This work underpins the importance of Ktd1 in defence against the A/B toxin K28, and implies various membrane trafficking regulators might influence toxin effects in other eukaryotic systems.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

BC cells that express the pro-metastatic actin regulatory protein MenaINV have an enhanced ability to migrate and intravasate within the primary tumor and extravasate at secondary sites. Though chemotherapy improves patient survival, treatment with paclitaxel leads to upregulation of MenaINV and an increase in metastasis in mice. MenaINV expression can be induced in BC cells through cooperative NF-kB/ Notch1 signaling with macrophages, which are often increased in tumors in response to chemotherapy. MenaINV-expressing cells are also resistant to paclitaxel, raising the question of whether paclitaxel increases MenaINV by de novo induction or by selectively killing non-MenaINV-expressing cells. We hypothesized that paclitaxel causes de novo MenaINV induction by increasing macrophage-tumor cell NF-kB/ Notch1 signaling. Understanding this pro-metastatic effect of chemotherapy is crucial to refining treatment strategies. In this study, we demonstrate that paclitaxel increases MenaINV expression by de novo induction. Mechanistically, paclitaxel induces MenaINV by repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These pro-inflammatory macrophages then participate in enhanced NF-kB/ Notch1 signaling with tumor cells, which leads to MenaINV induction in the tumor cells.

These fish have evolved distinctive morphological features and specialized behaviors that enable them to walk along the seafloor while detecting buried prey. This unique adaptation makes them ideal candidates for studies in evolutionary genetics. However, their phylogenetic relationships remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized publicly available genomic reads from the GenBank database to assemble the first complete mitochondrial genomes of three searobin species: Bellator militaris, Prionotus alatus, and P. stephanophrys. We conducted a comparative analysis of these mitochondrial genomes, including the first phylogenetic analysis of the Prionotinae based on complete mitogenomic data. The resulting circular contigs measured 16,765 base pairs for B. militaris, 16,602 base pairs for P. alatus, and 16,896 base pairs for P. stephanophrys. The three mitogenomes exhibited a typical vertebrate organization, which includes 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a putative control region. Notably, P. stephanophrys contained an additional tRNA-Leu and an extra non-coding region. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis grouped all Bellator species into a monophyletic clade within Prionotinae, while the sister taxon Prionotus formed a separate monophyletic subclade. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of the genera Bellator and Prionotus.

Myrmecophagous species are characterized by striking convergent morphological adaptations such as skull elongation, enlargement of salivary glands, and long claws to dig into ant and termite nests. These evolutionary modifications also include anatomical regression, such as dental simplification or loss, reduction of masticatory muscles, and possessing a reduced set of taste buds. To gain insights into the molecular changes underlying the regression of these morpho-anatomical traits, we investigated the functionality of candidate genes related to dentition, gustation, and mastication in nine convergent myrmecophagous mammalian lineages. We examined these genes in a comparative phylogenetic context, paired with molecular evolutionary analyses, to estimate the relative timing of loss of gene function over the evolutionary history of each convergent lineage. We found that gustatory reduction and pseudogenization of masticatory myosin often were associated with the regression of dental genes. Evidence of pseudogenization events linked to oral anatomy dates to as early as the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, and is an ongoing process including examples of incipient gene inactivations. Whereas we found evidence for gene inactivations across all three functional categories occurring during distinct temporal intervals, there was variation in the sets of genes lost and the relative timing of inactivation events. The combined evidence suggests that the convergent evolution of myrmecophagy has occurred as a protracted process with distinct phases of anatomical evolution, over timescales as long as 60 Myr.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We show that histone butyrylation on H3K27 is detected in human colon samples. Furthermore, histone acetylation, butyrylation, and propionylation on H3K9 and H3K27 are responsive to levels of SCFAs in human colon cancer cell lines and are associated with active gene regulatory elements. In addition, treatment of human cancer cell lines with individual metabolites or combinations of SCFAs replicating the intestinal lumen environment result in distinct and overlapping gene program changes, with butyrate largely driving gene regulatory effects of SCFA combinations.

Extant eukaryotes share several classes of highly conserved lipid transfer proteins (LTP) that associate with donor membranes, bind individual lipid molecules, and shuttle them to acceptor membranes. Because cells lacking organelles do not require extensive lipid transport networks, it is not known if this machinery pre-dated eukaryotic organelles or had to evolve alongside them. Here we describe a class of putative lipid transporters in the Asgard archaeota superphylum that share a common ancestry with eukaryotic LTPs in the START domain superfamily. We identified three classes of Asgard START proteins, StarAsg1-3, which are conserved across most Asgard phyla. Of these, StarAsg1 family proteins contain the predicted structural features necessary for lipid transfer: large, hydrophobic binding pockets lined with amphipathic motifs for membrane docking. In contrast, StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 family proteins contain smaller binding cavities and minimal predicted membrane interactions. We found that StarAsg1 from Lokiarcheota interacts with anionic membranes both in vitro and in yeast cells and can transfer sterols between liposomes. Phylogenetic analysis of START domains across the tree of life indicates that eukaryotic LTPs share a common ancestry with StarAsg1 homologs, while StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic heat shock protein cochaperones.

IDP/IDRs are heterogenous, existing in a conformational ensemble of various interconnected states without a definitive tertiary structure. The high dynamicity of IDPs/IDRs limits ensemble protein characterisation techniques from capturing their properties, and measurements at the single-molecule level are hampered by the necessity to label the protein or modify its microenvironment, affecting their biophysics. Consequently, our understanding of IDPs/IDRs is limited, translating to a lack of knowledge of their roles in related diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various cancers. This work presents the first experimental observation of unmodified IDP/IDR conformational dynamics in vitro, at the single-molecule level in real time, achieved by trapping individual IDPs/IDRs in a nanoscale volume using nanoaperture optical tweezers. Our results reveal that IDPs/IDRs exhibit significantly larger conformational variations in solution compared to globular proteins of similar size, as expected. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of native tau-441 by glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3{beta}-tau) induces compaction and reduced conformational dynamics.

Using multimodal stressors, including mechanical (ultrasonication/agitation), physical (hyperthermia), and biological (oxidative damage), we demonstrate that stress-modified sEVs exhibit high-affinity binding to small A {beta} ; aggregates (SA) through scaffold reorganization, as validated by super-resolution microscopy and quantitative colocalization assays.

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired microglial amyloid-beta phagocytosis is a key feature in AD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of enhancing this innate immune function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) ameliorated memory deficits and reduced amyloid-beta burden in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and metabolic fitness, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation. Mechanistically, we identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key regulator of microglial phagocytosis, as a direct substrate of PTP1B. Inhibition of SYK showed that PTP1B modulates microglial activation in a SYK-dependent manner. These findings established PTP1B as a critical modulator of microglial activation and a potential therapeutic target for AD.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

However, these proposed rearrangements have not yet been confirmed. Here, we have identified at least five distinct conformational states of Na+-NQR using: mutants that lack specific cofactors, specific inhibitors or low-sodium conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations based on these structural insights indicate that 2Fe-2S reduction in NqrD/E plays a crucial role in triggering Na+ translocation by driving structural rearrangements in the NqrD/E subunits, which subsequently influence NqrC and NqrF positioning.

We introduce aseQC, a statistical framework that quantifies sample-level ASE quality in terms of the overall expected extra-binomial variation to exclude uncharacteristically noisy samples in a cohort to improve robustness of downstream analyses. Applying aseQC to a dataset of rare mendelian muscular disorders, successfully identified previously annotated low-quality cases demonstrating clinical genomic utility. When applied to 15,253 samples in extensively quality controlled GTEx project data, aseQC uncovered 563 low-quality samples that exhibit excessive allelic imbalance. We identify these to be associated with specific processing dates but not otherwise described adequately by any other quality control measures and metadata available in GTEx data. We show that these low-quality samples lead to 23.6 and 31.6 -fold increased ASE, and splicing outliers, degrading the performance of transcriptome analysis for rare variant interpretation. In contrast, we did not observe any adverse effect associated with inclusion of these samples in common-variant analysis using quantitative traits loci mapping.

We find that several pathways, such as the hypoxia, myogenesis and glycolysis pathways, are significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes across populations.

The origin and evolutionary trajectory of PPNs remain elusive, largely due to the scarcity of chromosome-level genomic data. Among them, migratory PPNs are considered a key transitional form between free-living and obligate parasitic lifestyles, as they exhibit both plant parasitism and fungal feeding behaviors. In this study, we assembled a chromosome-level genome of the sweet potato rot nematode Ditylenchus destructor and confirmed the presence of four chromosomes through Hi-C scaffolding and karyotype analysis. Comparative genomic analysis with two other migratory PPNs, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Aphelenchoides besseyi, revealed that the Nigon elements in B. xylophilus are largely conserved with those of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, while D. destructor and A. besseyi exhibit extensive Nigon element rearrangements. These rearrangements were strongly correlated with patterns of protein sequence collinearity. Moreover, transcriptomic profiling across five developmental stages of D. destructor identified numerous stage-specific effectors and transcription factors. Functional analysis via RNA interference demonstrated that many of these genes play essential roles in embryogenesis and parasitic activity. Together, our results provide valuable genomic and transcriptomic resources for studying PPNs, uncovering critical insights into their genome evolution and parasitism-related gene functions, and laying a crucial foundation for advancing the understanding of PPN biology and their impact on agricultural systems.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Because variable RBDs of different SARS-CoV-2 strains must bind to the same human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for viral cell entry and infection, we hypothesize that designing a protein with the same or very similar hACE2 binding interface might have a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 strains. The designed protein binds specifically to the WT-RBD (with micromolar affinity) but not to RBDs from other SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, two rounds of the E. coli display and Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) selection are sufficient to yield a protein named CYN1 with nanomolar binding affinities not only to the WT-RBD but also to those of Omicron BA.1, XBB.1.16, and JN.1. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy hotspot analysis revealed that CYN1's broader spectrum capability stems from its engagement of essentially all ACE2 hotspot residues critical for WT-RBD binding, unlike the designed protein. The discovery of CYN1, differing by only four mutations from the designed protein, confirms that targeting the small interface of human viral receptors, rather than the entire receptor, offers a viable strategy for developing broad-spectrum inhibitors. This approach minimizes potential off-target effects arising from receptor multifunctionality.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We then optimize its binding affinity via structure-based rational design. Among the six designed candidates, five were experimentally verified and exhibited enhanced binding affinities compared to the original Ta sequence. Furthermore, we directly compared the binding properties of the RNA aptamers to neutralizing antibodies, and found that the designed aptamer TaG34C demonstrated a comparable binding affinity to the RBD compared to all tested neutralizing antibodies. This highlights its potential as an alternative to existing COVID-19 antibodies.

Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Conventional histopathology workflows rely on postmortem en bloc extraction of TBs, followed by lengthy decalcification, celloidin embedding, and manual serial sectioning of these large specimens--a process that takes one to two years, is labor- and cost-intensive, and lacks compatibility with most modern protein, DNA, and RNA assays.

Despite its clinical applications, we know little about how this diet impacts brain circuitry and neuronal function to elicit its protective effects. Here, we examined the impact of the KD on hippocampal function through integrative analysis of gene expression, epigenetics and neurotransmission. We found that KD induces profound transcriptional reprogramming of the hippocampus, including dampened expression of numerous synaptic genes. Through proteomic analysis of histone variants and post-translational modifications, we uncovered significant changes in activating and repressive histone marks in the hippocampus of KD mice. To determine how transcriptional rewiring of the hippocampus under KD impacts neurotransmission, we performed electrophysiological recordings of neurotransmission and synaptic dynamics at excitatory CA3-CA1 synapses. We found that KD diminishes synaptic gain and dampens short-term plasticity at excitatory synapses, resulting in reduced integration of synaptic inputs at the circuit level. Combining electrophysiology and electron microscopy, we determined that effects of KD in excitatory synapses are caused by a reduction in size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, as well as the total vesicle pool. Our findings show that the ketogenic diet triggers synaptic remodeling in the hippocampus, driven by broad transcriptional and epigenetic changes that reduce synaptic vesicle pools and short-term plasticity at excitatory synapses ultimately dampening excitatory synaptic gain and integration at the circuit level.

Although polygenic risk scores (PRS) effectively quantify genetic susceptibility to BD, the neurobiological correlates of this genetic risk during adolescent brain development remain unclear. Using normative modeling and longitudinal neuroimaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort (N = 4519), we examined cortical thickness (CT) deviations and structural covariance network (SCN) alterations in adolescents stratified into high and low BD genetic risk groups based on PRS. Adolescents with high PRS for bipolar disorder exhibited greater cortical thickening in the inferior frontal gyrus and primary visual cortex, whereas those with low PRS demonstrated greater thickening in the posterior cingulate cortex and middle precentral gyrus. These patterns suggest PRS-related variations in cortical maturation, potentially reflecting distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with genetic susceptibility to bipolar disorder. Furthermore, high PRS individuals displayed altered SCN topology, characterized by decreased local clustering and enhanced global network efficiency. Longitudinal data show that these abnormal regions exhibit atypical developmental trajectories, accompanied by a global reorganization of network topology. Additionally, high genetic risk was associated with lifestyle factors, especially correlated with increased positive expectancies toward substance use.

Recent machine learning methods have shown promise in reconstructing atomistic details, but most approaches only target simple systems at a small scale. In particular, conventional backmapping pipelines often fail to preserve stereochemistry, induce high-energy configurations, or require extensive minimization.

CGBack consists of backmapping and refinement procedures and accurately recovers atomic coordinates across diverse protein systems from small to large scales. We show that CGBack is capable of accurately backmapping both single-chain and multi-chain molecular systems, including densely packed intrinsically disordered proteins in condensates.

We further discover that presence of ATP fluidifies the entangled solution possibly by activating loop extrusion. Finally, we show that the observed rheology can be understood by modelling SMCs as transient crosslinkers in bottle-brush-like entangled polymers. Our findings help us to understand how SMCs affect the rheology and dynamics of the genome.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

V.; Alhammad, R.; Elayadi, A. N.; Martin, J.", "abstract": "Introduction Physical fatigue is a key determinant of operational readiness in the physically demanding occupations of tactical athletes. Specific hormonal, immune, and enzymatic biomarkers have been proposed for fatigue assessment, but their reliability can be affected by external factors. This study aimed to explore the predictive accuracy of targeted stress-related small molecules to proteins identified via untargeted salivary proteomics in classifying physical fatigue. Methods Ten recreationally active adults (6M, 4F) completed a fatiguing protocol designed to simulate common operational movements and intensities. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-protocol and analyzed for targeted biomarkers using commercial immunoassays and for untargeted proteins via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Machine learning models were trained to classify pre- vs post-exercise state using these biomarkers, with performance assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Targeted small molecules achieved an overall model accuracy of 86%, with immunoglobulin A and uric acid demonstrating the highest predictive power. However, a proteomic panel of four proteins (ATP1B1, STOML2, PGLYRP2, FH) exhibited superior performance, with 95% classification accuracy and improved sensitivity. Pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in mitochondrial function, immune regulation, and metabolic adaptation, suggesting their role in fatigue-associated physiological changes. Conclusions Salivary proteomics identified biomarkers with greater sensitivity and specificity for detecting physical fatigue than targeted stress-related molecules within this sample. These findings support the potential for non-invasive proteomic monitoring of fatigue in operational and athletic settings. Future studies should validate these findings in larger, more diverse populations and assess their applicability to chronic fatigue monitoring.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Using this technique, we identified a pretectal cluster expressing tcf7l2, which can be further classified into molecularly distinct subclusters. In vivo calcium imaging and cell ablation revealed that nkx1.2lb-positive pretectal neurons are commissural inhibitory neurons required for the optomotor response but not for the optokinetic response.

Modulating the gut microbiota composition and function through prebiotic supplementation has been repeatedly shown to improve host metabolism. While most studies have focused on the fecal microbiota due to the ease of sampling, fecal samples do not reflect the microbial dynamics throughout the gastrointestinal tract, as regional environmental conditions shape distinct microbiota composition. Given the metabolic significance of the proximal intestine and the potential influence of microbiota on these processes, we characterized the microbiota composition along the gastrointestinal tract in a widely used model for studying host-microbiota interactions: C57Bl6J male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without prebiotics supplementation (FOS, fructooligosaccharides). The microbiota composition, determined by long-read Nanopore sequencing, was markedly altered by HFD and FOS supplementation not only in feces but also in the jejunum, ileum and caecum. In contrast to previous observations made in humans, obesity in mice was associated with a decrease in microbiome diversity in the small intestine, highlighting species-specific microbial responses to metabolic challenges. Additionally, the pronounced bifidogenic effect of FOS supplementation in the ileum suggests FOS fermentation in the small intestine in mice, contrary to what has been previously described in humans. Finally, we report a relative homogeneity of microbiome composition along the digestive tract, possibly due to the coprophagic behavior of mice. These findings challenge the translational relevance of rodent models for studying the role of the small intestinal microbiota in human metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This parasite undergoes drastic changes in its morphology and metabolism between infective and noninfective forms through global remodeling of its proteome. Chemical modification of tRNA (tRNA modification) contributes to the control of protein expression by modulating the codon decoding process. However, knowledge of tRNA modification profiles, the enzymes that create modifications and their regulation in different cellular conditions is largely restricted to relatively few model organisms. Here, we profile tRNA modifications in both infective and noninfective forms of T. cruzi to probe their dynamic changes. Genome mining of tRNA modifying enzymes identified 66 putative tRNA modifying enzymes in T. cruzi, each responsible for at least one of fifty-seven modifications. tRNA sequencing detected reverse transcription-derived signatures at 182 sites in T. cruzi tRNAs that are likely derived from 18 tRNA modifications. tRNA modifications and tRNA modification enzymes are differentially modulated across the life stages of T. cruzi. We found that hydroxywybutosine (OHyW) at position 37 on tRNAPhe had a reduced level in the infective form (metacyclic trypomastigote) and the associated modification enzyme Tyw1a exhibited reduced expression in this stage. Knockout of Tyw1a increased the differentiation from epimastigote (noninfective form) to metacyclic trypomastigote, suggesting that OHyW37 modification levels control the rate of metacyclogenesis. Overall, our findings suggest that the global regulation of tRNA modifications in the life stages of T. cruzi plays a critical role in the differentiation of this parasite.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This study investigated whether early proteomic changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) can differentiate between patients maintaining stable graft function at 36 months and those developing CLAD within the first year. Additionally, findings were compared to proteomic data from non-transplanted individuals. Methods: BALF samples were collected at one and twelve months post-transplant from 43 lung transplant recipients together with clinical parameters. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry with label-free quantification for global protein profiling and heavy-labelled peptides for absolute quantification of mucins and related proteins. Differentially expressed proteins were identified and analyzed through pathway enrichment to explore biological mechanisms associated with CLAD. Results: No significant proteomic differences were detected at one month. By twelve months, 63 proteins were differentially expressed between patients who developed early CLAD and those with stable function. Mucin levels declined in stable patients but remained elevated in both groups compared to healthy controls. Cartilage acidic protein 1 was significantly higher in stable patients at twelve months and correlated with better pulmonary function. Pathway analysis linked several altered proteins in CLAD patients to networks associated with lung injury and remodelling. Conclusion: Protein profiles in BALF that resemble those of healthy lungs are associated with sustained graft function, while persistent expression of lung injury markers is associated with early CLAD. This suggests an adaptive process is needed for long-term post-transplant success.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We report that initial, very rapid translational silencing is driven by a specialized metabolic mechanism. Following glucose withdrawal, intracellular NTP levels drop drastically over 30 sec, before stabilizing at a regulated, post-stress set-point. Programmed translational control results from the differential NTP affinities of key enzymes; ATP falls below the (high) binding constants for DEAD-box helicase initiation factors, including eIF4A, driving mRNA release and blocking 80S assembly. Contrastingly, GTP levels always greatly exceed the (low) binding constants for elongation factors, allowing ribosome run-off and orderly translation shutdown. Translation initiation is immediately lost on all pre-existing mRNAs, before being preferentially re-established on newly synthesized, upregulated stress-response transcripts. We conclude that enzymatic constants are tuned for metabolic remodeling. This response counters energy depletion, rather than being glucose-specific, allowing hierarchical inhibition of energy-consuming processes on very rapid timescales.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Addressing the need for clinically relevant human models, this study developed and characterized a human ex vivo skin model that recapitulates the temporal molecular processes of cutaneous radiation injury, as demonstrated through bulk RNA-sequencing and tissue validation studies. Human skin explants subjected to ionizing radiation demonstrated rapid induction of DNA double-strand breaks, followed by a robust, p53-driven transcriptional program involving genes related to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. Over time, the irradiated skin exhibited increasing activation of pro-fibrotic pathways, notably epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF{beta}1-mediated signaling. This resulted in upregulation of classic fibrosis markers such as COL1A1, FN1, and increased collagen thickness. Importantly, regulators of the p53 axis, MDM2 and miR-34a, was observed, implicating these factors as potential therapeutic targets to modulate the balance between repair of radiation injury and pathologic fibrosis. Transcriptome analysis of irradiated and non-irradiated breast skin from post-mastectomy patients showed notable concordance of p53 and pro-fibrotic gene signatures comparable to the ex vivo model, underscoring its translational relevance. This work provides a platform for identifying early biomarkers and testing therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate cutaneous radiation toxicities, including RISF, beginning with elucidating the dynamic interplay between the p53-mediated DNA damage response and the onset of fibrosis following radiation.

However, the rapid updates to ONT basecalling models and the evolving landscape of computational tools for modification detection bring about challenges for reproducible and standardized analyses. To address these challenges, we developed Dogme, which is a Nextflow-based workflow that automates the processing of ONT data, including basecalling, alignment, modification detection, and transcript quantification. Dogme automates the reprocessing of ONT POD5 files by integrating basecalling using Dorado, read mapping using minimap2 and subsequent analysis steps such as running modkit. The pipeline supports three major types of ONT sequencing data - direct RNA (dRNA), complementary DNA (cDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA) - enabling comprehensive analyses across different library preparations. Dogme facilitates detection of diverse RNA modifications supported by Dorado such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), inosine, pseudouridine, 2'-O-methylation (Nm) and DNA methylation, while concurrently quantifying full-length transcript isoforms LR-Kallisto for transcript quantification for dRNA and cDNA. Results: We applied Dogme to three separate mouse C2C12 myoblast replicates using direct RNA sequencing on MinION flow cells. We detected an average of 147,879 m6A, 86,673 m5C, 21,242 inosine, 24,540 pseudouridine, and 83,841 2'-O-methylation sites per replicate with 96,581 m6A, 43,446 m5C, 8,825 inosine, 10,048 pseudouridine, and 30,157 2'-O-methylation sites detected in all three biological replicates.

Here we designed saRNAs where payload expression is regulated by an FDA-approved drug, trimethoprim (TMP), by fusing TMP-responsive degradation domains (DDs) to nsPs to regulate RNA self-amplification. Screening a library of nsP-DD fusions, we identified an optimal design with DDs fused to nsP2, nsP3, and the payload gene, achieving robust TMP-mediated control of expression between a fully 'off' state (no TMP) and an 'on' state (with TMP) matching expression levels of unregulated saRNA. In mice, this saRNA circuit showed reversible gene expression and enabled diverse gene expression patterns, including escalating and oscillating profiles in response to orally delivered TMP. Implementing this circuit to control the expression of an HIV immunogen for vaccination, we show that an escalating TMP regimen significantly enhanced germinal center responses critical for B cell affinity maturation compared to constitutively-expressing saRNA.

Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy have shown promising potential for treating glioblastoma; however, achieving optimal efficacy remains challenging due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and T-cell exhaustion. In this study, we developed a mathematical model of CAR T-cell therapy for glioblastoma to explore combinations of CAR T-cell treatments that take into account the spatial heterogeneity of antigen expression. Our hybrid model, created using the multicellular modeling platform PhysiCell, couples partial differential equations that describe the tumor microenvironment with agent-based models for glioblastoma and CAR T-cells. The model captures cell-to-cell interactions between the glioblastoma cells and CAR T-cells throughout treatment, focusing on three target antigens: IL-13R2, HER2, and EGFR. We analyze tumor antigen expression heterogeneity informed by expression patterns identified from human tissues and investigate patient-specific combination CAR T-cell treatment strategies. Our model demonstrates that an early intervention is the most effective approach, especially in glioblastoma tumors characterized by mixed antigen expression. However, in tissues with clustered antigen patterns, we find that sequential administration with specific CAR T-cell types can achieve efficacy comparable to simultaneous administration. In addition, spatially targeted delivery of CAR T-cells to specific tumor regions with matching antigen is an effective strategy as well.

Using iPSC-derived motor neurons from C9orf72 carriers and age-matched controls, we performed comprehensive cell cycle analysis, drug screening, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing validation in human brain tissue. C9orf72 neurons exhibit age-dependent cell cycle reentry with increased S-phase cells, elevated cyclin and CDK expression, and aberrant cell cycle gene signatures confirmed in patient brain excitatory neurons.

Mutations and certain post-translational modifications impact its aggregation propensity and pathogenicity. Glycation, a non-enzymatic modification enhanced during hyperglycemia and aging, both known risk factors for PD, has been implicated in -Syn pathology. Although preformed -Syn-fibrils induce PD-like phenotypes in mice, the impact of glycation on their pathogenicity is unclear. In the current study, we glycated -Syn using methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycating agent, resulting in altered biophysical characteristics in comparison to non-glycated -Syn. Glycation inhibited the formation of typical beta sheet structures under aggregating conditions. Despite that, glycated -Syn assemblies induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation to a similar extent as the non-glycated -Syn fibrils upon their injection in the mouse substantia nigra (SN). However, these glycated assemblies triggered higher neuroinflammation and increased accumulation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) compared to non-glycated fibrils. Consequently, an earlier onset of neuromuscular deficits and anxiety was observed in these mice.

We investigated if a non-enzymatic form of NF-1/CPE-E342Q is efficient in reversing AD pathology and carried out a proteomic study to uncover the mechanisms of action of NF-1/CPE in AD mice. Methods AAV-human NF-1/CPE and a non-enzymatic form, NF-1/CPE -E342Q were delivered into hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and effects on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, synaptogenesis and autophagy were investigated. A quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice with and without AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment was carried out. Results Hippocampal delivery of AAV-NF-1/CPE-E342Q prevented memory loss, neurodegeneration and increase in activated microglia in 3xTg-AD mice, indicating its action is independent of its enzymatic activity. Quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice that underwent NF-1/CPE gene therapy revealed differential expression of >2000 proteins involving many metabolic pathways. Of these, two new proteins down-regulated by NF-1/CPE: Nexin4 (SNX4) and Trim28 which increase A{beta} production and tau levels, respectively were identified. Western blot analysis verified that they were reduced in AAV-NF-1/CPE treated 3xTg-AD mice compared to untreated mice. Our proteomic analysis indicated synaptic organization as top signaling pathway altered as a response to CPE expression. Synaptic markers PSD95 and Synapsin1 were decreased in 3xTg-AD mice and were restored with AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment. Proteomic analysis hypothesized involvement of autophagic signaling pathway. Indeed, multiple proteins known to be markers of autophagy were down-regulated in 3xTg-AD mice, accounting for impaired autophagy. Expression of these proteins were upregulated in 3xTg-AD mice with NF-1/CPE gene therapy, thereby reversing autophagic impairment. Conclusions This study uncovered vast actions of NF-1/CPE in restoring expression of networks of critical proteins including those necessary for maintaining neuronal survival, synaptogenesis and autophagy, while down-regulating many proteins that promote tau and A{beta} accumulation to reverse memory loss and AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice.

These cells were tested in syngeneic, orthotopic GBM mouse models exhibiting heterogeneous EGFRvIII expression. CAR T cells were delivered intracranially without lymphodepletion. Results Intracranial administration of of scIL12-secreting CAR-T cells eradicated tumors without requiring lymphodepletion, achieving 50% long-term survival. Survival benefits depended entirely on endogenous CD8 T cells, as efficacy was abolished in CD8-deficient hosts and unaffected by NK cell depletion. Notably, therapeutic efficacy was abrogated by lymphodepletion, underscoring the necessity of an intact endogenous immune response. Mechanistically, scIL12 enhanced CAR-T cell persistence and reprogrammed tumor-associated microglia, indicating potential epitope spreading through polyclonal endogenous CD8+ T-cell responses, which facilitate the elimination of EGFRvIII-negative tumor cells. Conclusions This study demonstrates the pleiotropic benefits of IL-12 armored CAR-T cells with improved targeting of antigen-positive tumor cells and simultaneous remodeling of the microenvironment to engage adaptive immunity against antigen-negative clones.

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a promising treatment modality for patients with solid tumors but has been limited by the highly fibroinflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF{beta}) participates in the inordinately suppressive TME in PDA. Here, we test the impact of selective Tgfbr2 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 or genetic approaches in mesothelin (Msln)-specific T cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells during ACT of PDA. Abrogating TGF{beta} signaling augmented TCR-engineered T cell accumulation in autochthonous and orthotopic PDA models and promoted terminal effector T cells, although this largely required inclusion of a vaccine at the time of T cell transfer. While loss of Tgfbr2 impaired CD103 upregulation, it only modestly impaired donor T cell central, tissue resident, or Tcf1+Slamf6+ stem-like memory T cell formation. These attributes ultimately result in heightened functional capacity and delayed tumor growth. Unexpectedly, however, most tumor-infiltrating engineered T cells failed to differentiate into PD-1+Lag3+ exhausted T cells (TEX) regardless of TGF{beta}R2 expression and despite abundant Msln protein expression by PDA cells. Forcing Msln epitope processing in KPC tumor cells promoted donor T cell accumulation, acquisition of PD-1 and Lag3, increased IFN{gamma} production by TCR-engineered T cells refractory to TGF{beta} and bypassed the vaccine requirement for therapeutic efficacy. Thus, promoting increased antigen processing/presentation by tumor cells while abrogating Tgfbr2 in engineered T cells can sustain donor T cell function in the suppressive TME and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ACT. Our study supports pursuit of strategies that modulate tumor intrinsic antigen processing while relieving T cell suppression to safely promote the antitumor activity of TCR-engineered T cells.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In contrast, memory B cells display a progressive increase in IRF4 activity over time, leading to PRDM1 induction and exclusive differentiation into plasma cells. Using CRISPR-based perturbations, we demonstrate that IRF4 is indispensable for both GC and plasma cell development. Notably, IRF4 promotes GC fate independently of PRDM1, as PRDM1 disruption did not impair GC differentiation. We also find that while the abundance of antibody mRNAs is clonally correlated, class switch recombination (CSR) occurs stochastically and is clonally independent.

A.", "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a prolific opportunistic pathogen responsible for a range of life-threatening infections for which treatment options are increasingly limited due to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant isolates. Cyclic di-AMP has emerged as an essential bacterial signaling molecule due to its impact on physiological processes, including osmotic adaptation, cell wall homeostasis, antibiotic tolerance, and virulence. In addition, c-di-AMP is a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecule recognized by the host immune system to trigger protective responses. In previous work, we identified and characterized the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of intracellular c-di-AMP in E. faecalis, demonstrating that maintaining c-di-AMP homeostasis is vital for bacterial fitness and virulence. In addition to the intracellular enzymes that regulate c-di-AMP levels, a limited number of bacteria encode surface-associated nucleotidases capable of cleaving extracellular c-di-AMP, potentially facilitating immune evasion. Here, we characterize a novel and unique cell wall-anchored phosphodiesterase, termed EecP (E. faecalis extracellular c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase), which features duplicated catalytic domains and specifically degrades extracellular c-di-AMP. Deletion of eecP ({Delta}eecP) resulted in a marked accumulation of extracellular c-di-AMP. Although the {Delta}eecP strain exhibited comparable growth and behavior to the parent strain in vitro, it displayed increased susceptibility to killing by phagocytic cells. Using two murine infection models, we show that the impact of eecP deletion and the consequent buildup of extracellular c-di-AMP on E. faecalis pathogenesis may be site-specific. Notably, disseminated infection was more severe in mice infected with the {Delta}eecP strain, suggesting that extracellular c-di-AMP influences infection outcomes, likely through modulation of host immune responses.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

A founder population of PGCs was identified via protein immunolocalization in the posterior epiblast (TBXT+) region at E16, by the unique co-expression of OCT4, SOX17, PRDM1, and TFAP2C with absent SOX2. At E20, PGCs were spread along the allantois and hindgut endoderm, indicative of migration onset. Single-cell RNA-sequencing at E20-22 revealed ten PGCs that were subset using the above markers. Further analysis of this population uncovered conserved and novel markers of the early germline and gave numerous insights into their developmental status, including markers associated with pluripotency maintenance, cell migration, repression of the somatic program, and initiation of epigenetic remodeling.

Once processed, trafficked species are difficult to identify morphologically, and currently require DNA-based approaches that are time-consuming, costly, and lab-based. There is thus a need for a rapid, cheap, on-site method for species identification. We describe VeRIF-ID (Vertebrate Rapid In-Field Identification via DNA), a method that employs simultaneous on-site nanopore sequencing of four different mitochondrial DNA barcodes. Primers were designed to produce short amplicons to aid analysis of damaged DNA, and to be effective over a broad taxonomic range of vertebrates from lamprey to chimpanzee. Validation demonstrated species-level identification in 91% of 83 tested species, and genus/tribe-level identification of the remaining species (which are also problematic with existing approaches). DNA extraction, PCR and library preparation steps were simplified and optimised so that sampling to species identification takes <3 h for a single sample. Species components are identifiable non-quantitatively in prepared mixtures of muscle tissue from up to five species, and laboratory tests of Traditional East Asian Medicine samples reveal DNA from species including critically endangered saiga antelope and black rhinoceros. In conjunction with a portable BentoLab device the necessary equipment and reagents are easily portable, and we apply the method to analyse seized bushmeat and fish samples within an airport customs zone, identifying mammal and fish species in 15 samples within 6 h. The initial equipment costs for VeRIF-ID are ~$8K, and the cost per sample of ~$10-48 (depending on set-up), considerably cheaper than current conventional lab-based approaches. The method requires only basic hands-on skills. Ongoing trials with potential end-users will focus on establishing forensic reporting criteria prior to casework implementation.

KCNE-family subunits (KCNE1-5) associate with KCNQ1, conferring distinct properties across various tissues. KCNQ1 activation requires membrane depolarization and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) whose cellular levels are controlled by Gq-coupled GPCR activation. While modulation of KCNQ1's voltage-dependent activation by KCNE1/3 is well-characterized, their effects on PIP2-dependent gating of KCNQ1 via GPCR signaling remain less understood. Here we resolved structures of KCNQ1-KCNE1 and reassessed reported KCNQ1-KCNE3 structures with and without PIP2. We revealed that KCNQ1-KCNE1/3 complexes feature two PIP2-binding sites, with KCNE1/3 contributing to a previously overlooked, uncharacterized site involving residues critical for voltage sensor and pore domain coupling. Via this site, KCNE1 and KCNE3 distinctly modulate the PIP2-dependent gating, in addition to the voltage sensitivity, of KCNQ1. Consequently, KCNE3 converts KCNQ1 into a voltage-insensitive PIP2-gated channel governed by GPCR signaling to maintain ion homeostasis in non-excitable cells. KCNE1, by significantly enhancing KCNQ1's PIP2 affinity and resistance to GPCR regulation, forms predominantly voltage-gated channels with KCNQ1 for conducting the slow-delayed rectifier current in excitable cardiac cells1,2.

The basic premise of the model is that the cell membrane is organized into small domain regions through a combination of multi-component phase-separation and interaction between membrane components and the proximal fibers of the intracellular cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. The partitioned characteristics of this two-dimensional fluid are thought to impose both steric and hydrodynamic barriers that restrict the free motion of mobile membrane components, save for their occasional passage via hopping from one domain to another. Previous investigations of hop diffusion within the cell membrane have identified the potential for diffusional anisotropy [Jaqaman et al. 2011. Cell, 146(4), pp.593-606]. This work utilizes numerical simulations and develops new analytical theory to provide an approximate quantitative description of such asymmetric compartmentalization.

G.; Fitzgerald, B.; Lippman, Z.", "abstract": "The compositions of conserved gene families often vary widely between species, complicating predictions and experimental tests of shared versus distinct functions, especially in families shaped by extensive duplication, redundancy, and paralog diversification. The plant CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) small-signaling peptide family exemplifies these challenges. Although genetic studies in model systems have identified shared roles for a few CLE genes and species-specific redundancies, an evolutionary analysis of the entire family over deep time could empower predictive and experimental dissections of functions obscured by redundancy. We developed a scanning pipeline that de novo annotated CLE genes from 2,000 genomes representing 1,000 species, uncovering thousands of previously undetected family members and producing a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction and tracing of the family's evolution and sequence diversification over 140 million years. Computational modeling of coding and cis-regulatory regions predicted lineage-specific asymmetries in paralog redundancy, stemming from ancestral amino acids in the functional core of the dodecapeptide and partial conservation of promoter elements. We tested these predictions using two genome-editing strategies in Solanaceae. Base-editing of deeply conserved residues in the CLV3 dodecapeptide and its paralogs across three species confirmed their critical roles in repressing stem-cell proliferation, and multiplex CRISPR knockouts of the 52 tomato CLE genes resolved pairwise and higher-order redundancies, revealing previously uncharacterized regulators of shoot architecture and plant size.

Although ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) show potential in reversing opioid abstinence-related deficits in rodents, the molecular mechanisms underlying their efficacy remain poorly understood. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice underwent a 3-week opioid abstinence paradigm, followed by a single (2R,6R)-HNK (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline injection on day 28. Sucrose and social preference tests were used to assess behavioral deficits. We conducted RNA sequencing of ventral hippocampal tissue from these mice, followed by differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses. Additionally, Random Forest machine was applied to identify predictive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with (2R,6R)-HNK treatment response. Results: Transcriptomic analysis identified 206 DEGs in morphine-abstinent mice without treatment compared to opioid-naive controls (MOR-SAL vs. SAL-SAL), implicating altered immune signaling, synaptic function, and structural plasticity. Comparison of opioid-abstinent mice treated with (2R,6R)-HNK to opioid-naive controls (MOR-HNK vs. SAL-SAL) revealed 186 residual DEGs, enriched for Th17-mediated immune and fear regulation pathways, suggesting a persistent intermediate molecular phenotype despite normalized behavioural scores. DEGs overlap analysis between MOR-HNK vs. MOR-SAL and MOR-SAL vs. SAL-SAL groups indicated that (2R,6R)-HNK treatment reversed 55 DEGs in opioid-abstinent mice, including Transthyretin (Ttr) and T-cell surface glycoprotein (Cd5) expression levels. Machine learning identified interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (Il1rapl1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2 beta (Ctla2b) as top predictors of (2R,6R)-HNK's treatment response. Notably, while (2R,6R)-HNK induces transcriptional changes in opioid-naive mice (SAL-HNK), it does not affect behavior compared to untreated controls (SAL-SAL). In contrast, its therapeutic effects are evident in morphine-abstinent mice (MOR-HNK), highlighting its context-dependent efficacy. Conclusion: (2R,6R)-HNK promotes both transcriptional and behavioral recovery in opioid-abstinent mice, reversing key gene expression changes.

We hypothesized that early-life PCB exposure disrupts hepatic metabolic and immune function in a cell type-specific manner. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on liver tissue from postnatal day 28 female mice perinatally exposed to PCBs, we identified major hepatic and immune cell populations and assessed cell-specific transcriptional responses. PCB exposure significantly altered the proportions of endothelial cells and Kupffer cells and reduced neutrophil abundance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PCBs dysregulated key pathways in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, including ER stress responses, drug metabolism, and glucose/insulin signaling. Notably, hepatocytes exhibited upregulation of phase-I drug-metabolizing enzymes and uptake transporters, but downregulation of phase-II enzymes and efflux transporters. Kupffer cells and endothelial cells had altered immune and metabolic gene expression, and intercellular communication analysis predicted disrupted fibronectin, collagen, and chemokine signaling due to PCB exposure.

Results ImmunoFusion (https://shiny.zhoulab.ac.cn/ImmunoFusion) encompasses 21,014 clinical samples, serving as a comprehensive RNA-seq-derived gene fusion database and analytical tool. It offers functionalities to investigate fusion breakpoints, confidence scores, frequency patterns, and associations with clinical variables. The platform also enables TME evaluation and interactive exploration of fusions for analyzing tumor immunophenotypes in cancer and immunotherapy contexts. As an illustration, analysis of MTAP fusions in lung cancer cohorts revealed their association with a metabolically depleted, \"cold\" (immune-suppressive) tumor environment and poorer patient outcomes, pinpointing MTAP fusions as a novel biomarker for treatment selection. Conclusions ImmunoFusion represents a significant advancement, delivering a unified platform to explore the influence of gene fusions on cancer and immune responses. It offers particular value in understanding fusion-driven immunotherapy outcomes, paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This work introduces a pathway-based drug repurposing approach that combines protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and transcriptomic data to prioritize candidate drugs. The underlying assumption is that if disease 1 and disease 2 are both associated with the same biological pathway, then drugs known to be effective for disease 2 may be potential treatments for disease 1. To explore these relationships, disease.pathway.drug triplets are constructed. Genes shared between disease 1 and the associated pathway are identified, and their proximity is calculated within the PPI network using a Z score based on random permutations. Candidate drugs for disease 2 are then analyzed using the Connectivity Map data, assessing whether their up- or down-regulated gene signatures are enriched for the genes contributing to the proximity between disease 1 and the pathway. This integration enables the ranking of candidate drugs based on their potential biological impact on disease 1. Finally, top-ranked drug disease associations are evaluated through manual curation of the scientific literature to assess existing evidence supporting the proposed repurposing hypothesis.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

METHODS: GEO datasets GSE8479, GSE1428, and GSE136344 were obtained based on GEO database. MRGs and MARGs were acquired. Thereafter, GO, KEGG, GSEA and PPI analysis were implemented. Later, pooled GEO datasets (Combined Datasets) were further obtained to construct the sarcopenia diagnostic model and sarcopenia subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 62 M&MARDEGs were finally identified. There were altogether 9 model genes incorporated into the multifactorial regression model. Immunoinfiltration analysis revealed low scores of M&MARDEGs in the samples with sarcopenia. For macrophage activation in sarcopenia samples, most immune cells were strongly correlated in LowScore group (r = -0.707, p < 0.05). Many immune cells in Mitochondria & Macrophage Activation (HighScore) group were strongly correlated with each other (r = -0.661, p < 0.05).

We hypothesized that this nested structure provides unique adaptive advantages by combining transposition-driven genetic mobility with plasmid-mediated copy number amplification. Using engineered transposon systems, we demonstrated that nesting enables rapid and tunable responses of transposon-encoded genes in fluctuating environments. Specifically, transposition maintains a reservoir of the encoded genes, while plasmid copy number fluctuations further amplify the dynamic range of gene dosage, thus enhancing the response speed and stability of transposon-encoded traits.

We discovered that changes in standard light-dark conditions, such as exposure to constant light or simulated chronic jetlag, causes loss of associative memory in appetitive and aversive conditioning paradigms in D. melanogaster, and this behavior persists through three generations despite transfer of progeny to a standard light-dark cycle. Impaired memory is transmitted through females and is independent of any changes in fitness, brain or mushroom body architecture, or sensing acuity. Mechanistically, effects of constant light on memory are mediated by increased PIWI/piRNA pathway expression in the germline and its H3K9me3 writing capabilities, acting through altered expression of the Dopamine-1-like Receptor 1 (Dop1R1) in the brain.

Through larval connectomics, trans-tango labeling, and detailed anatomical analyses, we found that Odd neurons integrate innate valence through dendro-dendritic connections with KCs and learned valence via inhibitory inputs from mushroom body output neurons (MBON-g1 and MBON-g2). Optogenetic silencing of Odd neurons disrupted larval chemotaxis and associative memory by selectively impairing memory retrieval, while sparing memory formation, and by altering the turn rate during navigation. These results suggest that Odd neurons serve as an integrative hub, converging innate olfactory cues with learned reinforcement signals to fine-tune navigational choices. This study illuminates how distinct neural pathways converge in the larval brain to shape behavior, offering novel insights into decision-making circuitry that may extend to more complex nervous systems.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Post-mortem human brain studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between genetics, cell biology of neurological and psychiatric disorders and their clinical diagnosis and their clinical diagnosis. Given the central role of the synapse in these disorders, we evaluated the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect synaptic proteins in whole-cell lysates versus synaptosome preparations. First, we optimized sample preparation protocols for frozen human gray matter (GM), refining the suspension TRAPping (S-TRAP) digestion method to improve protein solubilization using thin tissue sections and to accomplish low technical variation by minimizing sample handling. Together, we achieved a highly reproducible sample preparation workflow by rigorously applying standardization and randomization across dissection, processing, and LC-MS/MS runs. Comparative LC-MS/MS analysis showed that whole-tissue lysates are practical for large-scale studies and broadly detecting synaptic proteins. However, enrichment by synaptosome isolation offered improved resolution of synapse-specific proteins. Because synapse-proteomics enables insight into spatial regulation -i.e., alterations at the synapse that are not reflected in the soma- we recommend a tiered approach: initial whole-tissue analysis for broad disease-associated changes, followed by targeted synaptosome proteomics to deepen insight into synaptic alterations. This strategy optimally balances throughput, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and enhances the study of brain disorders through proteomics. Moreover, analyzing synaptic proteins first at the tissue level improves insight into overall regulation of synaptic proteins induced by synapse loss or gain.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Linear mixed-effects models examined whether air pollution and brain microstructure are related to BMI changes over two years, and whether these associations differed by sex. Exposure to PM2.5 coupled with high RND estimates in right caudate nucleus, bilateral putamen, and pallidum were associated with higher BMI over time, with pronounced effects in males (all p<0.05).

The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) has been highlighted for its function in integrating arousal states and associated modulation in sleep homeostasis. However, there is limited understanding of the involvement of PVT neurons in regulating sleep patterns, especially during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. In this study, we investigated the potential function of the PVT in sleep disturbance during ethanol withdrawal using electrophysiology, in vivo calcium imaging, biochemical, and chemogenetic approaches. At 24 hours post-withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE) for four weeks, there is an increase in wake time and a decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The calcium transient levels in the PVT neurons are positively correlated with the transition from sleep to wakefulness. CIE elevates the PVT neuronal activity in a subregion-specific manner, resulting in a significant rise in cFos levels in the anterior PVT (aPVT). Temporal suppression of aPVT excitatory neurons via chemogenetics ameliorates the disturbance in sleep patterns generated by CIE. The aPVT has a notable distinction in the expression of the m-type potassium channel subunit, KCNQ2, with a higher expression level compared to the posterior PVT (pPVT). While the expression of KCNQ2 in the aPVT is reduced in CIE mice, the restoration of KCNQ2 expression using viral gene transfer within the aPVT alleviates the sleep disturbances produced by CIE. This data indicates a significant role of the PVT in sleep disturbance during ethanol withdrawal, which may partially be due to the downregulation of M-channels, hence underscoring M-channels in the PVT as a potential therapeutic target for sleep disturbance in alcohol use disorder.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated the effects of A{beta} and tau pathology (CSF A{beta}42/40 ratio and tau phosphorylated at position 181, p-tau-181, respectively) on effective connectivity (EC) related to memory encoding, which may constitute a link between synaptic pathology and cognitive outcomes.

EC was assessed by applying Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to the fMRI data, using brain regions previously implicated in memory-encoding: the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the hippocampus (HC) and the precuneus (PCU). Disruptions in forward connectivity from the PPA to the HC and PCU were associated with both memory impairment and indices of AD pathology. Specifically, reduced excitatory EC from the PPA to the HC was associated with higher p-tau-181 levels and correlated with poorer memory performance. Diminished inhibitory EC from the PPA to the PCU was driven by both tau and amyloid pathology and was likewise linked to memory decline.

Subjects underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning, wherein a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Event-related fMRI was conducted in awake subjects to evaluate CS-evoked neural responses. Behavioral and neural responses to the CS were assessed across three experimental phases: pre-conditioning (Pre-C), post-conditioning (Post-C), and Post-C with SCH administration. In behavioral assessments, CS presentation during Post-C elicited a robust suppression of ongoing operant responding, which was absent during Pre-C and significantly attenuated by SCH treatment (0.1 mg/kg). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results revealed that, relative to Pre-C, CS presentation during Post-C was associated with increased BOLD activity in brain regions previously implicated in fear processing (e.g., amygdala), expression and regulation (e.g., prefrontal cortex; PFC), as well as sensory integration. Critically, SCH (0.1 mg/kg) administration significantly attenuated CS-induced neural activation in these regions. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that SCH administration decreased connectivity between the PFC and the amygdala, while enhancing connectivity among subregions of the PFC.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), the protein Tau mislocalizes from axons to the somatodendritic compartment and aggregates into pathological filaments. Although Tau aggregation is a hallmark of AD, the subcellular dynamics of its synthesis and degradation are not well characterized. Because nascent polypeptides are particularly susceptible to misfolding, local control of Tau synthesis and degradation may be essential to prevent aggregation. Here, we develop STARFISH, a method for visualizing the subcellular site of endogenous mRNA translation in primary neurons and in vivo with single-molecule sensitivity and near-codon resolution, without modifying the nascent polypeptide. Using STARFISH, we show that despite the broad distribution of Mapt mRNA, Tau is translated almost exclusively in neuronal dendrites, revealing an unexpected level of spatial regulation. We further identify that one-third of newly synthesized Tau is co- or peri-translationally degraded in dendrites by a neuronal-specific plasma membrane-associated proteasome, the neuroproteasome. Failure of neuroproteasome-mediated degradation leads to the protein synthesis-dependent accumulation of somatodendritically mislocalized Tau aggregates. These findings define a previously unrecognized proteostasis mechanism that counterbalances the constitutive physiological overproduction of Tau. We speculate that failure of this proteostasis system contributes directly to Tau aggregation in dendrites, defining a new pathomechanism in Alzheimers disease.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We utilized whole cell sorting of astrocytes, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to characterize the astrocyte transcriptome in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in reward-processing, following cocaine self-administration, prolonged abstinence, and relapse in male mice. We found that astrocytes exhibit robust and contextually-specific transcriptional signatures that converge strongly with human cocaine use disorder. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB as a highly ranked predicted upstream regulator of cocaine-induced transcriptional regulation in NAc astrocytes, and CUT&RUN-sequencing mapped increased CREB binding across the astrocyte genome in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of CREB activity selectively in NAc astrocytes, in combination with several measures of addiction-related behaviors including conditioned place preference and self-administration, revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This effect is sex-specific, with no change in astrocytic CREB activity or CPP found in females. Subsequent experiments identify potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREB influence through modulating astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in response to cocaine. Finally, we show that astrocytic CREB selectively modulates D1-type medium spiny neurons in NAc to control cocaine-related behaviors.

Compared to EMG, VIS tended to overestimate RMT (mean bias = 5.23%, 95%CI = [1.00-11.00]), while ACC and VIS estimates were more closely aligned (mean bias = 0.43%, 95%CI = [-4.00 - 5.00]). ICC (2,1) values indicated moderate reliability for VIS vs EMG (mean = 0.580, 95%CI = [0.389 - 0.748]), and good-to-excellent reliability for VIS vs ACC (mean = 0.845). However, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals identified significant variability in the estimates provided by visual inspection, ranging from +1 to +11 for VIS vs EMG, but as low as -4 to +5 for VIS vs ACC. Conclusions: EMG remains the most sensitive technique for estimating the RMT, but when EMG is not feasible, accelerometery provides a quantifiable, more objective, and less variable alternative than visual inspection.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We recently discovered new orthoflavivirus-directed bnAbs, including F25.S02, which neutralizes DenV1-4 and ZikV with comparable or superior potency to the previously characterized E dimer epitope (EDE) bnAbs. Mutagenesis studies of viral envelope proteins showed that the epitope specificity of F25.S02 is distinct from EDE1 bnAbs. Here, we used cryoEM and X-ray crystallography to understand the basis of cross-neutralization of F25.S02 at the molecular level. We obtained a ~4.2 [A] cryoEM structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to a stabilized DenV3 soluble E protein dimer and a 2.3 [A] crystal structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to ZikV soluble E protein dimer. Like previously described EDE1 bnAbs, the structural epitope of F25.S02 is at the E dimer interface, encompassing predominantly conserved regions in domain II, including the fusion loop. However, unlike EDE1 bnAbs, F25.S02 binding is almost entirely dependent on the heavy chain and is shifted slightly away from the dimer symmetry axis. Our findings emphasize the importance of this cross-neutralizing site of vulnerability for DenV and ZikV that can facilitate rational design of vaccines and therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

F.; Hunter, C. A.; Adams, T. A.", "abstract": "The generation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses is dictated by the affinity of the cognate antigen, the stimulatory capacity of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and the metabolic pathways required for rapid cell proliferation. The complexity of these pathways is a significant challenge in designing vaccines against diseases that require a protective CD8+ T cell response. To understand the mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell responses, the STORE.2 model was developed to simulate the early events of T cell priming and expansion at the site of priming. STORE.2 is a mathematical, stochastic, and agent-based model based on first-principles that tracks every individual CD8+ T cell and APC. It allows for the simulation of different antigen affinity (Signal 1) as well as levels of costimulation (Signal 2) and inflammatory cytokines (Signal 3) provided by APCs. The impact of Signals 1-3 is translated to T cell responses via the transcription factor c-Myc, which supports T cell proliferation. Enhanced glycolysis during T cell activation results in a change in the metabolic environment that includes an increase in extracellular lactate concentration. STORE.2 models the role of lactate in the inhibition of T cell metabolism and proliferation as a negative feedback mechanism on c-Myc production. STORE.2 accurately recapitulated the CD8+ T cell response during in vitro T cell priming assays that control for Signals 1-3 as well as lactate concentration. Finally, application of STORE.2 to an in vivo response to immunization demonstrated that the model accurately simulates CD8+ T cell activation at the site of priming.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In the pancreas, oncogenic Kras hijacks this program, acting on tissue-specific enhancers to prevent the resolution of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and lock regeneration into a pro-inflammatory state that progresses to cancer. Enhancer transcription, an early event during cellular state transitions, can generate stable enhancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) positioned near key transcription factors and chromatin contact boundaries, often enriched for disease-associated variants. While enhancer-associated lncRNAs have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and genome organization, their role in pancreas regeneration and cancer initiation has remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated the expression of epithelial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their target genes in PDAC precursor lesion formation. We focus on lncRNAs transcribed from enhancer elements near cell identity transcription factors. We demonstrate that LINC00673, expressed from a Sox9-associated super-enhancer during pancreatic development, is reactivated in PDAC. Conditional deletion of LINC00673 in the murine pancreatic epithelium accelerates resolution of ADM and significantly impairs PDAC initiation. Notably, LINC00673 harbors a variant associated with risk of developing PDAC. Our study identifies a critical function of LINC00673 in regulating both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes during pancreas regeneration and Kras-driven cancer initiation. Furthermore, we highlight a previously unrecognized role of transcribed super-enhancers in facilitating long-range gene regulation during pancreatic cancer initiation.

There are currently no treatments for placental insufficiency or FGR, and the only intervention is iatrogenic pre-term delivery. We have previously shown efficacy of repeated placental nanoparticle-mediated insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) treatment in improving placental efficiency (increased fetal-placental weight ratio) and correcting fetal growth in a maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) guinea pig model of FGR. Here we investigate the structural remodeling of the placenta following 3 repeated intraplacental injections of nanoparticle-mediated hIGF1 that may underpin the published improvements in placental efficiency and fetal growth. We hypothesize placenta structural changes (reduced exchange area, altered vascular structure) that we and others have previously shown in the FGR/MNR placenta which lead to deficits in placental function are mitigated by our repeated nanoparticle-mediated hIGF1 treatment. Sham-treated MNR placentas displayed disorganized microvasculature labyrinthine exchange areas with a reduction in placental capillary number and maternal blood space areas, and an increase in the volume of the placenta macrovasculature. Repeated nanoparticle-mediated hIGF1 treatment, however, resulted in an improved exchange area with normalized placental capillary number and maternal blood space area, and macrovasculature volume. This data demonstrates repeated nanoparticle-mediated hIGF1 delivery corrects aberrant placenta structure likely leading to improved gas exchange and transfer of nutrients to the fetus restoring fetal growth.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This gap is particularly large regarding the state of immunity during early life and migration, and how different immune components interact with each other. In this study, the partial migratory long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) was used as a model to assess the state of acquired humoral immunity (total IgG concentration, tIgG) during early life, during the reproductive cycle and at the extremes of the migratory range of females. We also determined the relationship of tIgG with plasma bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli. The concentration of tIgG was stable throughout the reproductive cycle of adults, and no significant changes were detected at the extremes of the migratory range of females. However, tIgG concentration was reduced during early life (2 to 3 months of age) and in non-reproductive males in March-May 2019 relative to non-reproductive males in March 2020. The tIgG concentration had a positive relationship with plasma bactericidal ability in non-reproductive females, but no relationship was observed in non-reproductive males and reproductive females. These results suggests that tIgG concentration is resilient to physiological and ecological changes experienced by adults throughout their reproductive and migratory cycle. The reduction of tIgG during early life suggests that young individuals have not developed an IgG pool comparable to that of adults. Finally, the positive relationship observed between tIgG and BKA in non-reproductive females suggests that E. coli clearance is enhanced by the presence of antibodies that facilitate the elimination of this bacteria.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Background: Breeding pelagic seabirds feed over wide areas. Their diet and space use can therefore provide proxies for otherwise be difficult to observe environmental conditions but interpretation of these proxies requires knowledge of foraging range. Antarctic sea ice regulates global climate, but a paucity of data on its past extent causes uncertainty in climate reconstruction and prediction. Deposits of stomach oils, produced defensively by snow petrels Pagodroma nivea (near-obligate sea-ice foragers), reflect sea ice conditions, sometimes over tens of millennia, but spatial interpretation of these biological archives is hampered by lack of data on foraging range, and how this varies seasonally, among colonies and with sex. Methods: We tracked 34 and 60 snow petrels using light-based geolocators and GPS loggers, respectively to estimate foraging ranges at three colonies located 180-200 km inland in Dronning Maud Land. We tested whether foraging latitude is associated with ice edge latitude, estimated via satellite remote sensing. We then projected potential foraging ranges for all known colonies on the study area to reexamine assumptions made in paleoclimate studies. Results: During most breeding stages, and across breeding seasons, core home ranges were centred approximately 2 degrees south of the outer sea-ice edge and tracked this habitat as it receded during the spring melt. Females were approximately 7% lighter than males but foraged at similar distances and in similar areas. Foraging ranges differed little between colonies but substantially between breeding stages. For example, median range was ~1,400 km during the pre-laying exodus vs. ~550 km during brood-guard. Conclusions: Snow petrel stomach-oil deposits potentially integrate environmental conditions over greater and more seasonally variable areas than previously assumed, probably with a bias towards conditions in the outer Marginal Ice Zone during the early summer when stomach oil deposition due to nest competition is likely greatest. Projected potential home ranges of snow petrel colonies in the western Weddell Sea suggest that breeding is limited by access to foraging habitat, such as coastal polynyas. We hypothesise that as sea ice fluctuated over previous glacial-interglacial cycles, this also regulated breeding distribution across the region.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

However, the family Drosophilidae encompasses over 4000 species, spanning deep evolutionary divergences and diverse ecologies. Here, we use immune challenge with the gram-negative pathogen Providencia rettgeri to investigate the conservation and evolution of immune responses in three non-model drosophilid species, Hirtodrosophila cameraria, H. confusa, and Scaptodrosophila deflexa, each of which diverged from D. melanogaster over 45 million years ago. Results We find that all three species retain a core set of immune signaling and recognition genes, but exhibit substantial variation in effector gene content and inducibility. In particular, Scaptodrosophila deflexa lacks orthologs of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) known from D. melanogaster, including DptA, AttA, and AttC, and shows little transcriptional response to bacterial-challenge with Providencia rettgeri. In contrast, both of the Hirtodrosophila species exhibit substantial transcriptional responses, including strong induction of canonical Imd pathway genes. Microbiome profiling of our samples revealed higher Providencia abundance in H. cameraria, and high levels of the defensive symbiont Spiroplasma in S. deflexa, potentially explaining differences in infection outcome. Our combined annotation and expression analysis of these species also allowed us to identify 20 novel AMP-like candidates, many with structural features like known AMPs.

Location: Global, spanning tropical to temperate regions. Taxon: Tarantulas (family Theraphosidae). Methods: We compiled mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences for 48 tarantula species worldwide, including newly generated sequences, to estimate nucleotide diversity and Tajima's D. Species distribution models (SDMs) were constructed under present-day and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climatic conditions to quantify changes in habitat suitability since the LGM. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), we tested whether genetic and demographic metrics were associated with latitude and climate-driven habitat change and whether their relationship varied with latitude. Results: Pairwise correlations among latitude, habitat change and genetic metrics showed no significant associations. However, GLMs revealed a significant interaction: the effect of habitat suitability change on Tajima's D was strongly positive at high latitudes but negative or negligible at low latitudes. This indicates that demographic responses to past climate change varied with latitude. Several high-latitude species showed genetic signatures of demographic expansion and range increase since the LGM. Main Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that species at higher latitudes experience stronger demographic fluctuations due to historical climate change, aligning with Darwin's early predictions. Moreover, patterns of demographic growth in temperate taxa suggest that some species may benefit from recent warming, consistent with Janzen's climatic variability hypothesis. These findings demonstrate that climate-driven genetic and demographic responses in tarantulas are shaped by latitude and highlight the importance of integrating phylogeography with ecological niche modeling to understand species' resilience under climate change.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We generated a reference genome and re-sequenced genomes from contemporary N. picturata populations, as well as genome-wide data from relevant subfossils. A combination of model-free inferences, site frequency spectrum (SFS) based demographic modelling, and analyses of population structure including that of subfossils indicate that N. picturata colonized both islands independently and naturally from Madagascar, long before human arrival. Summary statistics and SFS-based modeling reveal large effective population sizes (Ne) and high genetic diversity in island populations, conflicting with historical accounts of human-induced demographic collapse. Based on goodness-of-fit, genetic structure and diversity indices do not discriminate between two solutions, one of which posits large recent Ne and negligible translocation rates, while the other supports recent severe bottlenecks followed by high post-human translocation from Madagascar. Nonetheless, linkage disequilibrium provides stronger evidence for the latter scenario, which may also explain high genetic diversity. Both modern and ancient DNA data sources independently support the classification of N. picturata as native to both islands.

Using published and novel genomic data, we explore the evolutionary and demographic history of C. lomamiensis and its sister species C. hamlyni, the only two members of the hamlyni species group. We estimate that the two species split ca. 3-4 million years ago, and find that they both show high genetic diversity despite being listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. We identify signatures of positive selection in the hamlyni group in genes involved in, e.g., pelage coloration and immune functions, as well as skeletal morphology and locomotor behavior, potentially related to their terrestrial lifestyle which stands out among the otherwise arboreal Cercopithecus genus. We specifically explored whether introgression from more distantly related terrestrial guenons was involved in the evolution of terrestriality in the hamlyni group. However, molecular convergence with other terrestrial species was low, suggesting that putative terrestrial adaptations occurred largely independently.

In humans, mutations in telomere regulatory genes lead to short or long telomere syndromes. These syndromes often show genetic anticipation, where disease has earlier onset and a more severe manifestation in each new generation. Later generations inherit not only the mutation affecting telomere length, but also abnormal length telomeres. Many aspects of telomere length homeostasis are conserved between mammals and yeast. Here we explored telomere length inheritance patterns through the sexual cycle in yeast. Analysis of single telomeres, rather than bulk telomeres, shows that if haploid yeast with short telomeres mate with wild-type yeast creating diploids, short telomere lengths rapidly normalize (within 30 cell divisions). However, long telomeres inherited from one parent can persist for more than 200 mitotic cell divisions. Long telomere can also be transmitted through more than one round of meiosis, independently of mutations that cause long telomeres. These patterns, along with haploinsufficiency effects, show that even in yeast there is a complex relationship between telomere length, telomere length inheritance, and mutations that affect telomere length.

Recently, a laboratory-selected Spodoptera frugiperda strain exhibited a high level of resistance to Vip3Aa (resistance ratio: 5562-fold), with the mutation of the chitin synthase gene, SfCHS2, identified as a key factor.

Notably, homozygous knockout strains suffered significant fitness costs and had difficulty surviving on corn leaves, in contrast to the Sfru_R3 strain, which showed no such survival issues.

In the case of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) specifically, summary statistics resulting from the standard analysis pipeline can be used as input of a procedure which identifies distinct signals across the genome with FDR control. This secondary analysis requires sampling of negative controls (knockoff) from a distribution determined by the linkage disequilibrium patterns in the genome of the population under study. In prior work, we have pre-computed this distribution for European genomes, starting from information derived from the UK Biobank. Thus, researchers working with European GWASes can carry out a knockoff analysis with minimal computational costs, using the distributed routine GhostKnockoffGWAS. Here we introduce and release a new software (solveblock) that extends this capability to a much richer collection of studies. Given a set of genotyped samples, or a reference dataset, our pipeline efficiently estimates the high-dimensional correlation matrices that describe correlation structures across the genome, making rather common sparsity assumptions. Taking this sample-specific estimate as input, the software identifies groups of genetic variants that are highly correlated, and uses them to define an appropriate resolution for conditional independence hypotheses. Finally, we compute the distribution for the exchangeable negative controls necessary to test these hypotheses. The output of solveblock can be passed directly to GhostKnockoffGWAS, allowing users to carry out the complete analysis in a two step procedure. We illustrate the performance of the routine analyzing data from five UK Biobank sub-populations. In simulations, our method controls FDR.

Here, we describe a unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based library preparation and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method for the identification and quantification of ultra-rare mutations in the mtDNA control region.

This method enables the use of total genomic DNA extract as starting point for the assay, overcoming the need for organelle isolation and/or mtDNA enrichment, hence broadening the type of specimen that can be studied, while offering cost and time benefits. The assay described herein has been demonstrated to reliably measure somatic variants present at approximately 0.05% variant allele frequency in a variety of tissues, including fresh and frozen biobanked specimens.

Assessments included dietary intake analysis, blood and urine biomarkers, aerobic and anaerobic performance tests, and metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses evaluated changes in microbiome composition and function and their correlations with physiological and dietary parameters. High-altitude exposure was associated with significant shifts in gut microbial composition and functional capacity. While the total number of bacterial species and functions remained stable, the glucose degradation pathway increased post-expedition. Participants with greater microbiome shifts showed improved performance and had richer baseline microbiomes. Pre-expedition, certain microbial functions were associated with vitamin B6 and C intake, while post-expedition correlations involved specific macronutrients and micronutrients. Additionally, some microbiome changes correlated with blood markers, indicating links to nutrient metabolism and electrolyte balance.

Mammalian gene regulation is controlled by promoters and enhancers with rapidly divergent activities. However, the interplay between human non-coding genetic variation and regulatory evolution remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated promoter and enhancer evolution in the mammalian heart using genome-wide epigenomic profiling, intersected these elements with genetic variants associated with cardiovascular traits, and experimentally tested candidate regions in human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. First, we applied a comparative genomics approach to identify epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers in the heart, as well as elements with primate-specific or human-only epigenomic signals. Second, we evaluated the association of common genetic variation and signatures of cell-type specific gene regulation with mammalian epigenomic conservation. We report an enrichment of common genetic variants in epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers, which also associate with regulatory pleiotropy across cardiac cell types, and promoter-enhancer contacts in cardiomyocytes. Based on these findings, we selected candidate epigenomically-conserved elements across three cardiovascular genetics loci (KCNH2, CPEB4 and PRKCE), and investigated gene expression and cellular outcomes upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of each region in human cardiomyocytes. These analyses inform how mammalian epigenomic conservation associates with specific gene expression contributions and downstream cellular responses, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and sensitivity to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Moreover, the comparative analyses we present here contribute to ongoing efforts to prioritise and functionally characterise cardiovascular association signals from human population genetics.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

J.; Kriebel, A. R.; Welch, J. D.; Buttitta, L.", "abstract": "The Drosophila accessory gland performs functions analogous to the mammalian prostate in production of seminal fluid components that are essential for male fertility. The mammalian prostate and Drosophila accessory glands share a similar tissue organization and structure. Both organs contain secretory epithelial cells forming a gland lumen, surrounded by a stroma with extracellular matrix enveloped by innervated muscle for organ contraction and fluid release. However, the Drosophila accessory gland secretory epithelium is postmitotic, polyploid and binucleate, and lacks a known stem cell population. By contrast, the mammalian prostate epithelium is made up of diploid luminal secretory cells and diploid basal cells that are maintained by at least two stem cell populations. Despite the differences in the tissues, it has been argued these tissues may share a deep homology based on the expression of conserved genes during development. Here we performed a cross-species comparative analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult tissues using data from the Drosophila Fly Cell Atlas and mammalian adult prostate single-cell datasets. Our analysis provides additional evidence of transcriptomic similarity between the main epithelial cells of the Drosophila prostate-like accessory gland and the basal epithelial cells of the mammalian prostate. While we do not know whether these similarities reflect shared evolutionary homology, or independently derived features due to shared tissue functions, our results strengthen the arguments that the Drosophila accessory gland can be used to effectively model aspects of human prostate biology and disease.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

While sensorimotor transformations have been extensively studied in visual and somatosensory systems, their structure remains poorly understood in substrate-borne vibration sensing. Here, we combine high-resolution web vibration recordings with fine-scale behavioral tracking in the orb-weaving spider Uloborus diversus to dissect the sensorimotor basis of prey capture. Using unsupervised modeling, we identified discrete behavioral states that structure spider capture sequences, achieving over 83% classification accuracy. We then developed a predictive framework combining a linear-filtered generalized linear model (GLM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that robustly forecasts behavioral transitions across diverse prey vibration contexts. Notably, spiders exhibit context-dependent motor transitions, such as crouching and shaking, following decreases in prey vibrational power, consistent with active sensing behaviors that enhance signal detection. Furthermore, spiders reliably turn toward the web radius exhibiting the highest vibration amplitude during prey localization, demonstrating that amplitude alone predicts turning direction. These findings reveal a structured, predictive sensorimotor transformation linking external vibration cues to internal behavioral states. Our results highlight general principles of active sensing and closed-loop control in non-visual invertebrate systems, with broader implications for sensorimotor integration across species.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

However, the use of exogenous labels and dyes in conventional optical microscopy results in tissue deformation and requires time-consuming tissue preparation. Here, we demonstrated single-cell imaging of metabolic changes and heterogeneity in freshly excised adipose tissues that can distinguish tissue types without the need for exogenous labels using bond-specific, non-destructive, mid-infrared optoacoustic microscopy (MiROM) that allows preserving the native tissue architecture with minimal sample preparation time. Further leveraging MiROM, we monitored intracellular molecular and morphological changes during postnatal remodeling of adipose tissue when metabolic characteristics of adipocytes undergo a transient drastic change. Additionally, we developed an AI-based quantitative spatial tissue analysis tool (Q-SAT) to predict the spatial distribution of white fat- and brown fat-like features, providing a robust digital scoring method for adipose tissue phenotypic assessment.

This disadvantage necessitates exploration through neuromusculoskeletal modeling to reveal its intricate effects on balance. In this study, we presented a novel full-body musculoskeletal model of both the torso and the lower limb with 290 muscle actuators to control 23 independent degrees of freedom and support for different levels of sarcopenia. Using reinforcement learning coupled with curriculum learning and muscle synergy representation, we trained an agent to perform standing balance on top of a backward sliding plate and compared it against identical human experimentations. Our results show that without any pre-recorded experimental data, both healthy and sarcopenia agents are capable of reproducing the ankle and hip balancing strategy matching the experimental data.

To address this, we developed DR-GEM, a self-supervised meta-algorithm that combines principles in distributionally robust optimization with balanced consensus machine learning. DR-GEM supervises itself by (1) using the reconstruction error to identify and reorient its attention to samples/cells that are otherwise poorly embedded, and (2) using balanced consensus learning as a mechanism to increase robustness and mitigate the impact of low-quality samples/cells.

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input.

It is thus important to elucidate the evolutionary origins of orphans. Orphan genes can result from sequence divergence beyond recognition, when homologous proteins diverge to an extent at which tools that rely on sequence similarity to establish homology can no longer identify them as homologues. Orphans can also result from other processes, including de novo gene emergence from previously noncoding sequences, in which a homologous protein-coding gene truly does not exist. Here we propose that orphans resulting from divergence might be recognizable from their patterns of non-statistically significant similarity hits which are almost always discarded. To test this, we simulated diverged orphan protein sequences based on conserved proteins from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein catalogue (UHGP) and used reversed protein sequences as negative data sets. We trained four machine learning classifiers on features extracted from the similarity search tool DIAMOND's output, like total query coverage or maximum bit score. We tested the influence of evolutionary parameters such as simulation tree branch length, indel rate and among-site rate heterogeneity. We found that the performance of the models depends on the simulation parameters: when the underlying simulated divergence was moderate, accuracy reached ~90%, but when extremely diverged scenarios where simulated accuracy dropped to ~70%. The most important features for the classification were the number of alignments (hits) and the minimum hit E-value. When applying our classifier on a set of ~170,000 eligible simulated orphans from the UHGP dataset, we found that ~30% of them are predicted to be divergent and these are shorter and more disordered than the rest. Our classifiers and pre-processing python scripts are available at https://github.com/emiliostassios/Classification-of-divergent-genes-using-ML and can be readily used as a computationally fast means to obtain a candidate set of diverged orphans from any similarity search output. Therefore, our work allows to study such orphans across the tree of life and in doing so to recover cases of remote homology, get better estimates of the evolutionary age of protein families, detect cases of rapid divergence and more generally better understand how genetic novelty arises.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

First, we performed matrix factorization using PLIER on Human Trisome Project (HTP) RNA-Seq profiles from 304 trisomy-21 (T21) and 95 euploid (D21) individuals, deriving 156 biologically interpretable gene modules. We then identified 92 modules whose activity differed significantly between T21 and D21 and annotated these with prior-knowledge and KEGG pathways. To connect modules to clinical traits, we integrated PrediXcan-derived TWAS results from the UK Biobank, revealing 25 T21-specific modules with significant gene-trait associations (FDR < 0.1), including modules linked to cardiovascular, hematological, immune, metabolic, and neurological phenotypes relevant to DS. Using HTP clinical records as a replication cohort, 13 of these modules reliably predicted comorbidity status (AUC > 0.65, mAPS > 0.65).

A number of conditional mouse models of JAK2-V617F-driven MPN have been generated that rely on Cre-LoxP mediated activation, resulting in polyclonal disease. To more closely mimic the monoclonal origin of human MPN, transplantations of single purified JAK2-mutant HSCs or bone marrow (BM) at limiting dilutions into lethally irradiated recipient mice have been previously performed. However, irradiation is known to alter the BM microenvironment and also to induce transient aplasia accompanied by elevated cytokine levels that promotes the expansion of the mutant clone. To overcome these limitations, we examined whether JAK2-V617F-mutant HSCs are able to engraft and initiate MPN in non-conditioned recipients. We found that BM from two different MPN models, one expressing the human JAK2-V617F, and another expressing the mouse Jak2-V617F, efficiently engrafted and initiated MPN in non-irradiated immunocompromised Rag2-/- recipients. MPN evolved even in transplantations at limiting dilutions, showing high competitiveness of single JAK2-mutant HSCs. Thus, JAK2-V617F mutant HSCs can outcompete resident non-mutated HSCs in the absence of elevated cytokine levels and without the need of emptying stem cell niches by irradiation. However, only BM from mice expressing the mouse Jak2-V617F engrafted and initiated disease in non-conditioned C57BL/6 mice, while BM from mice expressing the human JAK2-V617F was rejected, indicating that mouse Jak2-V617F is ignored by the immune surveillance.

C.; Strupp, M.", "abstract": "N-acetyl L-leucine (NALL, USAN or levacetylleucine, INN or trade name Aqneursa) is an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). The N-acetyl group renders the compound a prodrug of L-leucine, making it a substrate for membrane-spanning monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which are ubiquitously expressed delivering NALL to all tissues with high capacity, including to the central nervous system. NALL enters enzyme-controlled pathways that correct metabolic dysfunction and enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics. Because NALL improves energy production (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) and ameliorates lysosomal function, it is potentially a therapy for a broad range of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders (in addition to lysosomal storage disorders) in which energy homeostasis and lysosomal function are impaired. Here, we have performed a series of in vitro studies which reveal an additional aspect of NALLs polypharmacological mechanism of action. The studies demonstrate a direct lysosomal effect whereby NALL rapidly activates the translocation of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in HeLa cells. The activation of TFEB is known to trigger the activation of specific genes that restore lysosomal biogenesis and function, as well as autophagy. Consistent with this, we show that NALL increases production of a TFEB target gene LAMP1, an integral lysosomal membrane protein responsible for maintaining lysosomal integrity, function and pH. This in vitro effect occurs at concentrations consistent with concentrations in plasma in humans after standard therapeutic dosing. We further demonstrated that acetylation is critical to this aspect of NALLs mechanism of action, as L-leucine itself had no effect on the activation of TFEB. Consistent with previous studies N-acetyl-D-leucine was inactive and also had no effect. Similarly, N-acetyl-DL-leucine also had only a modest effect, providing further evidence that N-acetyl-D-leucine is even antagonistic and inhibits the effects of the active L-enantiomer. This mechanism of action of NALL to activate TFEB signalling, thereby enhancing lysosomal and autophagic function, further elucidates the ways by which this compound targets the fundamental etiology of rare and common neurodegenerative disorders, from Niemann-Pick disease type C to Parkinsons disease. Based on its mechanism of action by improving the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis, NALL has the potential to be an effective therapy for a broad range of neurological and neurodevelopment conditions.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Using benzoxazinoids and their derivatives as a model in both simplified pairwise experiments and more complex multi-organism analyses, we show that these chemicals can modulate bacteria-bacteria, as well as bacteria-plant interactions. While the chemical environment alone had little effect on the plant at the molecular level, it differentially affected plant chemical defences, immunity, and sugar transport when combined with single-isolate or micro-community inoculums.

Driven by factors such as community vulnerability and the competitive abilities of tall-grass species, this phenomenon is exemplified by Brachypodium rupestre (Host) Roem. & Schult, a perennial tall-grass native to Europe. B. rupestre spreads aggressively in the grasslands of the western Pyrenees due to a disrupted regime of lack of herbivory and recurrent burnings that has persisted over several decades. This study aims to investigate whether the contrasted managements of grazing, abandonment and burnings have promoted specific reproductive traits and impacted the population genomics of B. rupestre. Nine sites varying in cover of B. rupestre classified into three expansion phases associated to different management regimes were monitored: i) scattered populations in multispecific grazed sites, ii) stand populations expanding at sites of relaxed grazing or abandonment, and iii) superdominant populations constituting dense degraded covers in recurrently burned sites. ddRADseq data showed high genomic diversity but relatively low genomic structure, likely due to substantial gene flow and the absence of wind barriers. The standardized index of association supported asexual reproduction in all populations, which is coupled with sexual reproduction. Contrasting management practices did not promote distinct genomic identities between expansion phases; rather, the genetic differentiation and divergence of populations responded to life history and spatial isolation, even within a small geographic area. The similar levels of genetic diversity and the significantly different number of clones between expansion phases suggest a complex pattern of genotypic and clonal variability, which may be influenced by environmental factors (historical disturbance regimes).", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In response to diverse chemical and mechanical signals, the cortical array can remodel within minutes to assume new configurations or altered filament abundance. The homeostatic cortical actin array of some plant epidermal cells comprise sparsely distributed individual actin filaments and actin bundles, which enables tracking and quantitative analysis of dynamic properties over many minutes at high spatiotemporal resolution. Previous studies using quantitative live-cell imaging, small molecule inhibitors, and genetic mutations reveal the robust dynamic steady state of the cortical actin array, with individual filaments showing a behavior termed stochastic dynamics. Compared to experimental findings, computational efforts focused on the plant actin cytoskeleton are lacking, although computational models have the potential to define underlying mechanisms of actin array homeostasis and remodeling. Here, we used an agent-based computational model to reproduce the stochastic dynamic behavior of individual actin filaments in epidermal cells with consideration of key governing factors, including the nucleation, polymerization, depolymerization, severing, capping, and branching of filaments. Our model was able to reproduce experimental observations with respect to the abundance and length of filaments as well as the rates or frequencies of dynamic events. This model can be used to study the role of myosin motors and other actin-binding proteins, as well as the effects of signaling events and fluxes in cellular second messengers, on actin dynamics in plant cells.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

D. M.; Dicenta, F.; Martinez-Garcia, P. J.", "abstract": "Almond (Prunus dulcis) is a major nut crop with high genetic complexity due to its heterozygosity and self-incompatibility. In this study, genetic parameters for flowering and maturity time, two key complex traits in almond breeding, were estimated using classical methods (midparent-offspring regression and between/within family variance components) as well as a Bayesian linear mixed model. A comprehensive dataset from the CEBAS-CSIC Almond Breeding Program (CC-ABP), comprising over 17,500 individuals and more than 30 years of historical phenotypic records, was used to generate the first complete pedigree and evaluate trait inheritance. Narrow-sense and broad-sense heritability estimates were obtained, showing substantial variation across traits and methods, with the highest values derived from classical approaches. Bayesian mixed models, implemented via the MCMCglmm R package, allowed for the estimation of breeding values (EBVs), repeatability, and variance components under unbalanced data conditions. Repeatability estimates ranged from 0.15 to 0.56. EBVs were calculated for all individuals, including those without phenotypic records, enabling the construction of trait-specific rankings for early or late flowering and maturity. Reliability values were used to refine these rankings, improving the accuracy of parental selection. Genetic trends based on EBVs revealed changes in breeding objectives over time and highlighted the limited genetic progress achieved through phenotypic selection alone. The integration of the complete pedigree, EBVs, and trait rankings offers a robust framework to optimize crossing strategies. This work lays the groundwork for incorporating genomic selection into future almond breeding efforts, improving selection efficiency for traits of agronomic importance.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Preys can respond to the risk of being predated in three ways: habitat selection, diel activity modifications and adoption of behaviors to detect predators before they constitute a danger. However, rarely these strategies have been analyzed simultaneously within an entire community. Through a camera trapping study conducted in the Julian Prealps Natural Park and surrounding territories (North-East of Italy), we analyze these three antipredator responses to understand which strategy is adopted by target species. Results show how, for the majority of species, the main antipredator response is the selection of time intervals when corresponding predators are inactive. On the opposite, habitat selection seems to be more influenced by environmental characteristics of the area. Similar, behavioral traits do not result related to presence probability of predators. Therefore, in the area analyzed, we demonstrated the existence of a landscape of fear that influences species choices regarding mainly diel activities. The study underlines also the importance of simultaneous consideration of antipredator responses for a more accurate understanding of how fear structures communities and ecosystems.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

However, although they are differentiated by anatomical origins, vulnerable neuronal subtypes, and specific misfolded proteins, neurodegenerative diseases also share many important features. During presymptomatic disease phases, neural networks initiate multiple compensatory processes to maintain network function, including increased network centralisation and reliance on a rich-club of hub nodes, which have been proposed as common reconfigurations to neural network damage. Currently, while supporting evidence for such mechanisms has been found in some neurodegenerative diseases, it is limited in others, like ALS. This knowledge gap makes it challenging to ascertain if there are indeed common pre-symptomatic mechanisms within and across different neurodegenerative diseases. To address this, we investigated the structural and functional properties of ALS patient derived motor neuron networks and counterpart networks from a healthy donor using longitudinal multielectrode array recordings and graph theory-based network analysis. We demonstrate microscale-level motor neuron dysfunction, including TDP-43 proteinopathy, hyperactivity and reduced spike amplitude. Structurally, we observed neurite hypertrophy, indicating that degenerating networks attempt to establish new connections. We furthermore document mesoscale-level functional reconfigurations, including increased rich-club connectivity and network assortativity, indicating functional compensation in ALS where networks become more centralised to maintain computational capacity. We thus provide novel evidence that ALS networks become increasingly centralised, which places progressively mounting demands on a rich-club, predisposing networks to further damage, consistent with existing models of common reconfigurations in neurodegenerative disease.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Unimodal tuning to stimulus duration, for example, has been observed in some of these areas but not in others, and its presence is either inconsistently reported or appears redundant along the cortical hierarchy. Moreover, how this duration tuning supports different functions or perception remains unclear. To address these questions, we measured brain activity with ultra-high field (7T) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a visual duration discrimination task. Using neuronal-based modeling we estimated unimodal responses to visual durations across a multitude of cortical areas defined with high anatomical precision. In the parietal and premotor cortices, and the caudal portion of the supplementary motor area (SMA), we observed neuronal populations tuned to the full range of presented durations, spatially clustered in well-defined maps. In contrast, in the rostral SMA, inferior frontal cortex, and anterior insula, neuronal units showed duration preferences centered around the mean of the presented duration range. This preference also correlated with the perceptual boundary participants used to solve the task. Differences in preference, spatial clustering, and behavioral correlation suggest distinct functional roles for these cortical areas -ranging from abstract duration representations for readout and task-related goals in the parietal and premotor cortex, to more categorical and subjective representations in the insula and inferior frontal cortex. In line with these hypothesized roles, we also observed distinct patterns of correlation in duration preferences across these cortical regions.

Here we provide a remarkable deviation from this state of affairs in the peripheral nerves of mice with a conditional knockout of sensory neuron PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten). PTEN is normally expressed in adult sensory neurons, particularly small IB4 nonpeptidergic subtypes and its knockdown after injury or during experimental diabetes improves axon regrowth. We studied Advillin Cre;PTEN null mice lacking PTEN in their sensory neurons. As might be expected, their harvested and cultured DRG neurons displayed enhanced neurite outgrowth in vitro. In vivo, these mice were healthy and had a normal sensory behavioural phenotype. However, the nerves of mice lacking sensory neuron PTEN were highly abnormal, with augmented clusters of small myelinated and unmyelinated axons populating endoneurial fascicles of their peripheral nerve trunks. The axon clusters did not disrupt normal fascicular anatomy but invested the epidermis with greater axon numbers. Within endoneurial fascicles, supernumerary axons formed regenerative units and expressed ongoing growth markers, unlike normal adult axons. This was not accompanied by rises in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuron numbers, indicating enhanced distal sprouting from parent neurons. Additionally, sprouting axons were electrophysiologically intact, generating rises in the amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials. Despite this extensive regenerative activity of intact nerves, regeneration indices after superimposed injury were only modestly enhanced or unchanged. This unusual behaviour of adult sensory axons lacking a single growth-suppressive molecule may identify insights into what molecular constraints the nervous system normally utilizes to suppress inappropriate plasticity.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

We uncover previously unidentified cellular mechanisms in vivo, characterised by reduced inhibitory synaptic input, hypoactivity of fast-spiking interneurons, and enhanced bursting in pyramidal neurons. At the network level, we reveal accelerated hippocampal oscillations, marked by increased theta and beta power, a departure from the conventional view of oscillation slowing in AD. Mechanistically, this acceleration stems from strengthened synchrony of excitatory currents at higher frequencies and an overall reduction in oscillation-associated inhibitory currents. Our findings provide the first direct in vivo evidence linking early hippocampal hyperactivity to specific synaptic transmission and network dysfunctions, resolving a long-standing ambiguity.

To test whether CMs are selectively processed within the magnocellular pathway, we assessed envelope motion discrimination and detection for achromatic (yellow-black) and chromatic (red-green) CMs in the presence of luminance masking noise to disrupt luminance-based mechanisms of motion processing. Compared to achromatic CMs, perception of chromatic CMs was more sensitive to luminance masking noise, suggesting that CM envelope motion perception relied predominantly on luminance signals. Specifically, envelope motion discrimination performance was better maintained for achromatic CMs than chromatic CMs, even at high masking noise levels. Notably, luminance masking noise greatly impaired envelope direction discrimination for chromatic CMs but had minimal impact on their detection, suggesting that chromatic aberrations may enhance envelope motion perception for chromatic CMs by introducing luminance signals. These findings collectively emphasize that CM stimuli selectively activate Y-like/parasol RGCs of the retino-geniculate magnocellular pathway, underscoring their potential to specifically target this pathway. This might have clinical advantages for early diagnosis in disorders such as glaucoma or dyslexia, where magnocellular pathway dysfunction is predominant.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

The neural pathways and signals that enable animals to override these fullness cues remain unclear. We examined a central amygdala (CeA) projection to the dorsolateral pons that targets the parabrachial nucleus, a well-established meal termination center, and the adjacent supratrigeminal nucleus, a region that controls orofacial movements. Activity in this CeApons pathway correlated with licking behavior but was not modulated by metabolic need or palatability cues. CeApons stimulation caused animals to overeat, consume non-edible objects within reach, or exhibit ingestion-like behaviors (licking, chewing, and grasping) even when no target was present. Depending on training and context, stimulation elicited either licking or pellet consumption, suggesting that CeApons promotes a flexible, goal-directed ingestive state by recruiting consummatory motor circuits rather than simply suppressing satiety signals. These findings highlight how forebrain-brainstem interactions can re-engage feeding behavior beyond homeostatic need.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Injury to the somatosensory nervous system causes maladaptive plasticity that initiates and maintains chronic pain. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cells of the innate immune system shape the response of the injured nervous system and drive pain pathogenesis. Data from preclinical models and human patient biopsies have specifically implicated peripheral macrophage populations for a pro-algesic role, yet how these cell types influence damaged sensory neurons and whether they directly contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability is unclear. Here, we have developed an iPSC co-culture system to study the interactions of macrophages and sensory neurons in a fully humanised experimental model. We found that analogous to endogenous counterparts, iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) display a dynamic molecular and functional profile that is highly dependent on neuronal state. Co-culture with injured iPSC-derived sensory neurons (iSNs) induces morphological, gene expression, and secretory profile changes in iMacs that are consistent with findings from in vivo nerve injury studies. iMacs in turn amplify spontaneous firing in damaged sensory neurons, implicating macrophages in this cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. These results illustrate the utility of an iPSC-based model to study signalling between these two cell types; they support a role for macrophages in directly amplifying damaged sensory neuron activity and highlight disrupting pathological signalling between these cell types as a promising strategy for future analgesic drug development.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Recently, our group determined that the organochlorine pesticide cis-chlordane is toxic to human motor neurons in a dose-dependent manner, causing an ALS-like phenotype in culture and animals with a mode of action independent of its known GABAA antagonism. Here, we aimed to characterize downstream motor neuron phenotypes associated with cis-chlordane treatment. We performed bulk RNA sequencing, live imaging, immuno-fluorescent labeling, and real-time metabolic assays on stem cell-derived motor neurons to assess chlordane-associated phenotypes in vitro. We demonstrate that cis-chlordane treatment causes a highly altered mitochondrial phenotype in motor neurons, including increased production of reactive oxygen species, decreased OCR and ATP production, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. We further implicate cis-chlordane as a possible mediator of potent motor neuron damage, with exposure to the pesticide inducing mitochondrial phenotypes akin to those seen in ALS. We suggest that future studies investigating the role of pesticides in ALS development center upon the organochlorine molecules.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate the impact of T2D, independent of obesity, on the neuroendocrine stress axis, as well as molecular, cellular, and behavioral indicators of emotional dysfunction. Using the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of T2D, we assessed the effects of diabetes on hormonal and neuronal stress responses, molecular and structural markers of stress in the brain, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. We also evaluated the impact of adrenalectomy in GK rats to determine the contribution of glucocorticoids to their behavioral impairments. Our findings reveal that non-obese diabetes leads to heightened endocrine and brain responses to stress, along with upregulation of stress-related molecular markers and structural features indicative of chronic stress, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, GK rats exhibited pronounced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. Importantly, lowering glucocorticoid levels in GK rats helped alleviate some of the metabolic and emotional disturbances.

We applied genomic structural equation modeling to 17 impulsivity and risk-taking GWAS datasets to explore the overlapping genetic architecture underlying these phenotypes. We then computed polygenic scores (PGSs) for each genetic latent factor in 4,142 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and examined how each factor was associated with the brain structure during early development. We further tested whether socioeconomic status modulated the association between the PGSs and brain structures. We identified three genetic latent factors, which we labeled as lack of self-control, reward drive, and sensation seeking. These showed distinct associations with brain structure in late childhood and early adolescence, relating to the frontal cortex, subcortical cellularity, and white matter structure in different ways. The association between PGS of lack of self-control and white matter mean diffusivity was modulated by socioeconomic status. Our findings revealed that genetic predisposition for impulsivity and risk-taking is associated with morphological brain differences as early as ages 9--10.

Few rodent studies have been conducted to understand the network-level implications of these disruptions. We assessed how adolescent binge-like alcohol consumption in a drinking in the dark (DID) model affected adult aversion-resistant alcohol consumption, exploration, and brain-wide functional connectivity in mice. Approximately one month after the conclusion of DID, only female mice exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited aversion-resistant alcohol preference in adulthood. Adult females exhibited additional sex-specific changes in exploratory behavior in the elevated plus maze after adolescent alcohol consumption. Resting state neuroimaging revealed changes in prefrontal cortical connections with sensory motor, hippocampal, striatal, and other networks, providing insights into the putative systems underlying deficits caused by adolescent alcohol exposure. Critically, our data corroborate a growing body of literature in human and rodent studies demonstrating that adolescent alcohol use may increase risk for adulthood alcohol use more strongly in females.

Here, we have characterized MHC class II genes and explored their polymorphism and evolution in one of the most abundant vertebrates in the world, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The vast population size and schooling behavior make Atlantic herring an attractive target for pathogens. Hence, we hypothesized that it would maintain exceptionally high MHC polymorphism. We used PacBio HiFi long-read whole genome sequencing data of 14 individuals from three different geographic regions in the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. The analysis identified nine MHC class II loci distributed across four chromosomes. We found two distinct lineages of class II genes, a highly polymorphic one denoted DA and a non-polymorphic DB lineage, arranged as alpha-beta gene pairs (DAA-DAB or DBA-DBB). The DA genes showed extremely high nucleotide diversity in exon 2, strong signatures of positive selection (dN/dS >> 1) as well as copy number variation. Structure prediction revealed that all highly polymorphic amino acid residues occurred in the predicted peptide binding cleft. Two of the most polymorphic loci showed distinct allelic groupings (supertypes), with high sequence similarity within supertypes and high sequence divergence between supertypes. Most of the haplotypes had genes from different supertypes, thus maintaining diverse class II repertoire in a single individual. There was also a highly significant nonrandom association of DAA and DAB alleles within supertypes, strongly suggesting coevolution of DAA and DAB alleles forming the peptide binding domain. This study reveals that the herring MHC class II genes are among the most, if not the most, polymorphic so far described in vertebrates. Their exceptional polymorphism surpasses that of human due to a larger gene repertoire, copy number variation, and pronounced sequence divergence among alleles. This unheralded polymorphism is most likely explained by the combined effects of the vast population size, minimizing genetic drift, and strong pathogen-driven balancing selection.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify LmGypsy, a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon in Locusta migratoria, as a critical mediator of biphasic antiviral immunity against Acrididae reovirus (ARV). ARV infection triggers selective de-repression of LmGypsy, which orchestrates dual antiviral pathways: (1) its encoded reverse transcriptase synthesizes viral DNA (vDNA) from ARV RNA, fueling RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated viral RNA degradation through Dicer-2-dependent vsiRNA biogenesis; (2) LmGypsy-derived nucleic acids activate cGAS-like receptors (LmcGASs) and induce immune responses. Strikingly, vDNA persists in infected locusts from 24 h post-infection until host death, suggesting a role in sustaining antiviral activity akin to immune memory mechanisms observed in Diptera. This study provides the first evidence that insect cGAS homologs function as retrotransposon sensors, mirroring mammalian cGAS-STING recognition of endogenous retroviral elements.

Here, we report that higher KDM5A expression strongly correlates with higher MHC-I expression, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and prolonged survival in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. KDM5A promotes MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor killing across multiple murine cancer models.

We characterized the cEV biogenesis in vivo using ciliated sensory neurons of C. elegans. In response to sensory cues, interruption of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) -a ciliary trafficking machinery carrying cargoes along the cilium- occurs together with ciliary membrane fission, resulting in the release of cEVs. Similarly, mutants disrupting IFT and ciliary receptor trafficking also enhance cEV production. To investigate how IFT influences the rate and location of cEV biogenesis, we selected a membrane marker that spans the entire length of the ciliary membrane independently of IFT. Single-molecule tracking demonstrates that the tetraspanin TSP-6 enters and diffuses within the cilia and does it independently of IFT. Lack of receptor retrieval or receptor entry in the cilium induces membrane budding from ciliary or periciliary membranes, respectively. Prior to fission, these membrane buds get enriched in TSP-6 as well as signaling receptors. Coupling receptor buildup with their export by cEVs provides a mechanism to preserve ciliary function and to modulate ciliary signaling.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then \"zippers\" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships.

However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally \"anti-neural\" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo.

Deconstruction of the successful biological control of the highly destructive cassava mealybug (CM) and cassava green mite (CGM) in Africa is used to show how ex ante pre-release analyses of natural enemies can increase the success rate. A meta-population tri-trophic physiologically based demographic model (PBDM) of the cassava system accurately predicted the weather-driven daily dynamics of cassava, CM, CGM, and their introduced natural enemies across the ecological zones of Africa. Marginal analyses of the simulation data enabled parsing the differing contributions of two exotic parasitoids and a fungal pathogen in the control of CM, and the contributions of two mite predators, local pathogens and rainfall mortality in the control of CGM. The contribution of each natural enemy to the ~95% recovery of cassava yields is estimated. The results show ex ante analyses of prospective natural enemies using well parameterized PBDMs can predict natural enemy prerelease efficacy across vast geographic areas and increase the success rate of biological control programs. Ex ante analyses can also explain whether biological control is a viable option (e.g., Cure et al. 2020).", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In contrast, northwest (north-, northwest, and west-facing) and southwest (south-, southwest, and west-facing) slopes are more suitable for tree growth in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively.

Changes in genome size are often attributed to variable amounts of repetitive sequences, including transposable elements. However, it remains poorly understood how such changes were accommodated while maintaining other genomic components. Elasmobranchs, including sharks, rays, and skates, exhibit high among-species variation of genome size and high within-species variation of chromosome length, offering a unique study system to address the question. In this study, we present the first whole genome sequences of the whitebelly skate with remarkably small genome size among elasmobranchs (2.2 Gb), and the red stingray. These chromosome-scale assemblies enabled the assessment of genomic compositions including centromeres and non-coding elements, which revealed notable profiles of tRNA loci and unbiased intragenomic distribution of transposons in elasmobranch genomes. Comparative analyses across these species revealed a shared genomic architecture characterized by correlations of intergenic and intronic sequence lengths with chromosome sizes, with repetitive element accumulation in elongated regions. We analyzed tandemly duplicated genes with high copy number variability. This genome-wide survey revealed the tendency for more frequent tandem gene duplications along with genome size expansion. We document the batoid HoxC cluster in the red stingray genome, which has undergone extensive repetitive element invasion and co-localizes with the HoxB cluster on a sex chromosome.

We have developed a novel biomimetic scaffold (0.4 mm thick hernia patch) derived from soluble collagen. This biomimetic scaffold exhibits exceptional strength, low immunogenicity, and structurally mimics the natural muscle fiber arrangement. The scaffold is utilized to repair a VML rabbit model (30 x 30 mm defect in abdominal wall) using nylon sutures for connection. It was observed that the VML site was gradually covered by regenerated tissue, which consisted of 2-3 mm thick functional muscle. By 32 weeks post-surgery, the newly formed muscle tissue had covered the majority of the VML area, as evidenced by morphological observations and histological evaluations. Approximately 24 weeks after surgery, the scaffold underwent complete degradation. This degradation exhibited a strong correlation with muscle regeneration. Furthermore, it was observed that the nylon sutures gradually migrated towards the VML center as muscle regeneration progressed, and nylon sutures exhibited an adverse impact on muscle regeneration. The study did not employ exogenous cells or growth factors. However, the collagen scaffold effectively stimulated endogenous muscle regeneration. In contrast to the previous limited partial recovery or fibrotic scar healing, the collagen scaffold successfully induced genuine structural and functional muscle regeneration. The 0.4 mm thick scaffold (hernia patch) exhibits a different structure from the 2-3 mm thick natural abdominal muscle wall. This suggests that a simple scaffold can regenerate functional tissue with a complex structure. This research represents the first successful functional regeneration of VML in clinically relevant animal models through the utilization of artificial materials. This technology possesses transformative potential in the treatment of muscle defects arising from trauma, tumor resection, hernia, or congenital anomalies.

However, variations in model architecture and data sources lead to inconsistent downstream performance and complicate centralized training. Specifically, the lack of data sharing makes retraining foundation models with pooled data infeasible. Alternatively, the release of model parameters enables combining multiple models during fine-tuning. Inspired by the meta-analysis method, we propose the Meta-Encoder framework, which integrates features from multiple foundation models to generate a comprehensive representation, improving downstream fine-tuning task performance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that Meta-Encoder is more effective than individual foundation models, with its strengths more pronounced in handling complex tasks. While single models may perform sufficiently well for simple tasks, Meta-Encoder can match or even surpass the best-performing single model, alleviating concerns over model selection. Moderately challenging tasks benefit from Meta-Encoder's concatenation or self-attention strategies, with the latter demonstrating superior performance in more challenging scenarios. For highly complex tasks, such as high-dimensional gene expression prediction, self-attention proves to be the most effective Meta-Encoder strategy, balancing feature integration and computational efficiency. For three patch-level spatial gene expression prediction tasks (HEST-Benchmark, CRC-inhouse, and Her2ST), the self-attention strategy improved the Pearson correlation by 38.58%, 26.06%, and 20.39%, respectively, compared to the average performance of three patch-level single models.

Unlike previous studies focused on structural accuracy, we evaluated AlphaFold s capacity to reveal SLiMs independently of model quality. To this end, we benchmarked several scoring metrics and showed that AlphaFold2 combined with MiniPAE yields the best performance, outperforming AlphaFold3 in this context. Building on these findings, we also provide a streamlined and cost-effective workflow for SLiM prediction requiring no installation or local computation. To overcome challenges associated with SLiM validation, we also introduce a highly sensitive detection method based on proximity labeling in living cells. This workflow was used to predict the occurrence of SLiMs that mediate binding to ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3 (RPS6KA3 or RSK2).

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below ~26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue.

In animal-microbe symbioses, established symbionts are often thought to be confined to a specific cellular or tissue niche and generally lose their motile appendages such as flagella. However, whether the loss of motile appendages necessarily implies immobility within the animal host remains an open conundrum. Here, we present the discovery of long-range, host actin-driven symbiont mobility in a dinoflagellate - acoel worm symbiosis. Using long-term tracking, fluorescence, and electron microscopy, we find that dinoflagellate symbionts (Amphidinium sp., 10-20m in size) travel throughout an extensive network of thin host cells (~200 nm in regions without symbionts) in Waminoa sp. acoel worms, which are part of a deep-diverging bilaterian lineage. Although FIB-SEM-based 3D reconstruction shows symbionts still retain both flagella, we uncover that it is host actin machinery that plays a primary role in overcoming large drag forces under confinement to achieve mobility throughout the worm at surprisingly high velocities (around 1m/s). Long term in-toto imaging further reveals diel rhythms and spatiotemporal regulation of symbionts during regeneration.

Here, we developed an in vitro assay using HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid to evaluate NET-inducing activity in a standardized, non-animal model. Graphene oxide (GO), a model nanomaterial known to trigger NETs in primary neutrophils, induced concentration-dependent NET formation in dHL-60 cells, with maximal induction at intermediate doses and attenuation at higher concentrations, likely due to particle aggregation. NET formation was validated by extracellular DNA staining and scanning electron microscopy. GO also induced superoxide-mediated ROS production, as confirmed by electron spin resonance, consistent with canonical NETosis pathways. Furthermore, GO suppressed PMA-induced NET formation, suggesting a dose- and context-dependent immunomodulatory effect.

The iris-to-pupil (IP) ratio, previously validated by our group in primates and cattle, reflects autonomic nervous system balance and may serve as a physiological indicator of stress in laying hens. This study evaluated the utility of the IP ratio under field conditions across diverse commercial layer housing systems. Materials and Methods: 296 laying hens (Lohmann Brown, n = 269; White Leghorn, n = 27) were studied across four locations in Canada housed under different systems: Guelph (indoor; pen), Spring Island (outdoor and scratch; organic), Ottawa (outdoor, indoor and scratch; free-range), and Toronto (outdoor and hobby; free-range). High-resolution photographs of the eye were taken under ambient lighting. Light intensity was measured using the light meter app. The IP ratio was calculated using NIH ImageJ software. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and linear regression using GraphPad Prism. Results: Birds housed outdoors had the highest IP ratios, followed by those in scratch systems, while indoor and pen-housed birds had the lowest IP ratios (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses of birds in Ottawa and Spring Island farms confirmed significantly higher IP ratios in outdoor environments compared to indoor and scratch systems (p < 0.001). IP ratio correlated weakly with ambient light intensity (r = 0.25) and age (r = 0.05), indicating minimal influence of these variables. Although White Leghorn hens showed lower IP ratios than Lohmann Browns, this difference was confounded by housing type; all White Leghorns were housed in pens. Thus, housing system but not breed was the primary driver of IP variation. Conclusion: IP ratio is a robust, non-invasive physiological marker of welfare assessment in laying hens, sensitive to housing environment but minimally influenced by light or age. Its potential for integration with digital imaging technologies supports its use in scalable welfare assessment protocols.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

It has been shown that anthocyanin production is inhibited when pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) is activated in Arabidopsis thaliana. An important component of PTI is the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). Interestingly, exogenous treatment with SA has been shown to induce anthocyanin content in grape, apple, maize roots, rose callus, or Arabidopsis seedlings. In this study, we used several A. thaliana mutants with modulated SA content to decipher the role of endogenous SA in anthocyanin production in A. thaliana. We treated WT and mutants with anthocyanin-inducible conditions and measured anthocyanin content using spectroscopy. We showed that high endogenous SA accumulation correlates with low anthocyanin production. This was confirmed by the treatment of the A. thaliana seedlings with exogenous SA. Additionally, using microscopy in the 5gt mutant, which exhibits enhanced production of anthocyanin vesicular inclusions (AVIs) due to the inhibition of ligandin-dependent vacuolar import, we showed that high endogenous SA also correlates with lower AVI abundance. Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis WT and mutants used in this study indicates a possible inhibitory effect of SA accumulation on anthocyanin content under anthocyanin-inducible conditions (AICs). We suggest that under AICs, SA downstream signaling independent of NPR1 is responsible for lower anthocyanin accumulation.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Therefore, enhancing drought resistance is a crucial priority in crop breeding for ensuring sustainable agriculture. The root system architecture (RSA) influences the efficiency of water acquisition from land; therefore, a deep RSA is advantageous for avoiding drought stress. Here, we demonstrated that deeper RSA promoted by the qSOR1-v mutant allele (an enhanced functional allele of the quantitative trait locus for SOIL SURFACE ROOTING 1) significantly improves rice yield under drought when compared to the deep RSA achieved through the functional qSOR1 allele that originated from natural variation. The qSOR1-v mutant exhibited stronger root gravitropism than the wild type. This was characterized by a more pronounced polarization of auxin on the lower side during root curvature, leading to a robust vertical rooting phenotype that was consistently expressed across different soil-water environments. Additionally, the qSOR1-v mutation site was well conserved among angiosperm orthologs, and the corresponding mutation in LZY3 of Arabidopsis (qSOR1 ortholog) resulted in a steeper root growth angle. The rice introgression line, which was substituted from the functional qSOR1 allele to qSOR1-v through marker-assisted selection, showed vertical rooting, resulting in increased grain yield in an upland field under drought stress. No yield penalty was observed for this line under well-watered upland conditions than the original variety.

G.; Shou, W.; soyer, o. s.", "abstract": "Metabolic behaviours of cells, such as metabolic overflow, involve regulation of metabolic fluxes across differ- ent pathways. Two well-established concepts in flux regulation are the transcriptional regulation, involving changes in enzyme levels through gene regulation, and allosteric regulation, involving changes in enzyme catalytic activities through metabolite binding. Here, we describe an additional mechanism arising through co-substrate usage around metabolic branch points. We find that asymmetric usage of a given co-substrate by reactions at and around a branch point introduces nonlinear flux switching at that branch point with increasing influx. This provides cells with an inherent self-regulation embedded in the architecture of metabolic pathways. Using models of different branch point motifs, we explain this regulation mechanism and provide parameter ranges under which it can operate. We then develop a specific model of the yeast pyruvate branch point and NADH usage around it to show that co-substrate based flux switching can explain experimental data obtained during yeast metabolic overflow. Furthermore, the model captures observed effects of altering NADH dynamics on the metabolic overflow initiation point. We conclude that co-substrate dynamics around branch points provides an inherent regulatory mechanism that could explain observed relations between co-substrate dynamics and metabolic behaviors. Additionally, the presented theory offers a quantitative approach to manipulation of co-substrate dynamics for metabolic engineering.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) is a key oxidoreductase responsible for detoxifying reactive aldehydes. Pharmacological activation of ALDH2 using Alda-1, a selective agonist, has been shown to reduce aldehyde accumulation, alleviate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in experimental SCI models. However, approximately 8% of the global population carries the ALDH2*2 mutation, which severely impairs this detoxification pathway. In this study, we used a transgenic ALDH2*2 mouse model to investigate the role of ALDH2 in SCI pathology. This model mimics the human ALDH2*2 condition, allowing us to examine the impact of impaired aldehyde clearance on acrolein accumulation and its pathological consequences. We modulated endogenous aldehyde detoxification through both genetic deficiency and pharmacological activation with Alda-1. Our results showed that ALDH2 deficiency led to significantly elevated acrolein levels, which were associated with increased microglial activation, cytokine storm, neuronal loss, demyelination, and tissue damage compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment with Alda-1 enhanced ALDH2 activity and significantly reduced acrolein levels in both ALDH2*2 and WT mice from 2 to 28 days post-SCI. This was accompanied by reduced inflammation, improved preservation of myelin, and marked improvements in locomotor and sensory function, especially in ALDH2*2 mice. Notably, even beyond the traditionally ideal treatment window, Alda-1 treatment remained effective in promoting recovery, particularly in motor function and to a greater extent in ALDH2*2 mice. Our study comprehensively evaluated ALDH2's role in SCI by both genetically impairing and pharmacologically enhancing its activity, highlighting ALDH2 as a critical modulator of acrolein-mediated damage and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target, especially for individuals with the ALDH2*2 mutation.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

T.; Petersen, B.; Seeberg, A. B.; Vuust, P.; Brattico, E.", "abstract": "Approximately 30% of cochlear implant (CI) users report that restoring their ability to enjoy music is a primary goal. However, music perception in CI users has mostly been investigated in controlled laboratory settings using simplified stimuli, such as pure tones or monophonic melodies. There is an increasing interest in developing objective measures of CI outcomes in everyday listening situations, particularly in music listening, which involves complex stimuli rich in timbre, pitch, rhythm, and overlapping sounds. One promising approach is to measure cortical auditory evoked responses (ERs) in CI users. We investigated whether ERs to sound onsets in a naturalistic four-minute music piece could be measured in adult CI users (N: 25; ages 18-80; CI experience: 0.3-14 years). We assumed that the accumulation of CI experience might be reflected in the morphology of the ERs. The results confirmed that P2 responses to sound onsets embedded in a whole piece of music can be detected in experienced CI users. Compared to a control group with normal hearing, the CI users showed P2 responses with lower amplitudes and longer latencies. Exploratory linear regression models suggested that the logarithmic duration of CI experience significantly predicted both perceived quality of musical sounds and P2 amplitude, explaining 38% and 28% of the variance, respectively. The findings suggest that music perception outcomes may continue to improve for up to 2-4 years post-implantation. Altogether, the results are consistent with the use of ERs to track CI adaptation to music listening.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we explore a neuromodulation approach that employs locally injected magnetoelectric nanodiscs (MENDs) as an alternative to electrode-based DBS. The MENDs, composed of Fe3O4 cores and two consecutive shells of magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 and piezoelectric BaTiO3, convert weak magnetic fields into electric polarization, enabling remote neuronal excitation in the mouse STN comparable to electrode DBS. To assess the effects of the MEND and electrode DBS on motor performance in a unilateral mouse model of PD, we develop a computational pipeline that extracts salient gate features.

The participants were primed with these images prior to performing the attentional task. We found that both sets of food images elicited an emotional attentional blink (EAB), but a stronger EAB was observed for the high-protein foods, and this observation was further supported by a negative correlation between the attentional bias (ABias) and the proportion of protein consumed by the participants before the experiment, with participants who consumed less protein exhibiting a stronger ABias toward high-protein foods. These findings suggest that an ABias might also arise to facilitate the consumption of high-protein foods when prior consumption of this macronutrient is low.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

This study investigated possible relationships between prepronociceptin (PNOC) and OPRL1 expression and psychiatric symptoms in AD, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains. Methods: Post-mortem brain tissue from the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (BA32) was analyzed in 61 donors across different Braak and Braak (B&B) stages. RNA expression of PNOC and OPRL1 was quantified and correlated with RDoC scores derived from medical records using NLP. Sex-stratified analyses, circadian rhythmicity analysis, and cell-type specific expression patterns were examined. Results: Both genes showed significant downregulation in AD cases (PNOC: p = 0.024; OPRL1: p < 0.001), with notable sex differences. Men displayed higher post-mortem PNOC (Cohen's d = -0.482) and OPRL1 (Cohen's d = -0.237) expression compared to women. In adjusted models controlling for B&B stage and post-mortem interval, PNOC expression significantly correlated with dimensional scores of positive valence ({beta} = -0.38, p = 0.035) and arousal regulatory systems ({beta} = -0.43, p = 0.015) derived from a text classification algorithm applied to medical records. OPRL1 showed disrupted circadian rhythmicity in AD cases (p = 0.151 vs. p = 0.020 in controls). Conclusions: These findings suggest distinct roles for PNOC and OPRL1 in AD pathology, with PNOC primarily associated with psychiatric symptoms and OPRL1 showing disrupted circadian regulation. Sex-specific expression patterns further indicate the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the nociceptin system.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

Humans produce nine different antibody isotypes and their effector functions differ according to the type of antigen and route of exposure. Phenotypic variation between isotype-switched B cell subsets is expected but not studied in detail. To obtain a molecular definition of isotype-defined cell identity, we performed proteomics and transcriptomics on isotype-defined populations of human naive and memory B cells (MBCs): CD27-IgM+IgD+, CD27+CD38lo/-IgM+IgD+, CD27+CD38lo/-IgM+IgD-, and IgA1, IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 MBCs (CD27+CD38lo/-Ig+). Combined proteome and transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA and protein expression profiles separate isotype-defined B cell subsets according to their differentiation status. mRNA and protein expression levels correlated reasonably well for many genes. IgG4-switched B cells were most distinct from naive B cells in terms of mRNA as well as protein expression profiles. Besides a distinct expression profile of cytokine and Fc receptors, we identified a high expression of IgE-coding mRNA in IgG4-switched B cells.

Transwell assays revealed a concentration-dependent chemotactic response, with a three-fold increase in migration toward MI homogenate. Wound healing assays confirmed enhanced migration speed under MI conditions. Bulk RNA sequencing identified TGF-{beta} signalling as a key regulatory pathway, and both pharmacological inhibition and antibody neutralisation of TGF-{beta} significantly impaired migration. These findings demonstrate the inherent chemotactic ability of hiPSC-CMs and identify TGF-{beta} signalling as a central mediator in response to MI stimuli.

Histone methylation plays a critical role in cartilage development, making it an appealing target for improving cartilage engineering protocols. In this study, we evaluated the roles of JMJD3 (KDM6B) and UTX (KDM6A), both demethylases of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), in chondrogenesis and their application in gene-modified mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cartilage tissue engineering. Using high-throughput analyses such as ChIP-Seq and whole-transcriptome microarray, we explored the functions of JMJD3 and UTX in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSC) undergoing chondrogenesis. We investigated the impact of inhibiting JMJD3 and UTX with the pharmacological inhibitor GSK-J4 or using siRNA. Additionally, the effects of transiently transfecting JMJD3 or UTX expression vectors were assessed both in vitro and in vivo, following the implantation of hBM-MSC embedded in alginate in nude mice. Our findings revealed that JMJD3 is specifically upregulated during chondrogenesis in hBM-MSC, and is crucial for this differentiation process. In contrast, UTX was found to be dispensable for chondrogenesis. Nevertheless, both JMJD3 and UTX share the ability to demethylate similar gene loci, thereby promoting the expression of chondrogenic signature genes, which suggests functional redundancy. Notably, the genes encoding these H3K27me3 demethylases emerge as strong candidates for enhancing gene-modified mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cartilage tissue engineering, as their overexpression during chondrogenesis significantly increased the formation of thicker cartilage discs enriched with type II collagen. In conclusion, this study provides important insights into the epigenetic regulation of chondrogenesis, especially regarding the role of H3K27me3 demethylases. We demonstrate that, although JMJD3 and UTX have overlapping targets, only JMJD3 is critical for the chondrogenesis process. Additionally, the findings emphasize the potential of transient JMJD3 transduction, along with a lesser emphasis on UTX, as effective strategies for improving gene-modified mesenchymal stem cell therapy in cartilage tissue engineering.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

DUI is unique to bivalve mollusks and has been identified in all major bivalve clades, including Protobranchia, the most basal bivalve subclade. Meanwhile, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and evolution of DUI remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the early stages of divergence of male and female mitochondrial genomes by sequencing them in a basal Protobranchia species Yoldia hyperborea where they are characterized by low level of divergence, suggesting a recent origin of this system. Despite the relatively high relatedness of female and male genomes, we find that they have undergone rapid divergence both on the sequence and the structural level, including an origin of a novel gene, the ORFan, in the male genome. This novel gene is functional, as evidenced by the fact that it is transcribed and is subject to purifying selection. We show that this gene is a result of duplication and rapid evolution of another mitochondrial gene, NAD2. Additionally, the female mitogenome carries a duplicated cassette containing the cytochrome b gene, resulting in two different transcripts in female gonads both of which are subject to purifying selection, although their transcription levels differ by two orders of magnitude. These results showcase the rapid evolution of mitochondrial genes following their duplication, which occurred near the time of divergence of M- and F-mitochondrial genomes within a doubly uniparental inheritance system.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, the barley reference genome was examined and from that a new EPRV was identified and named Hvu-EPRV. In contrast to all EPRVs identified thus far, Hvu- EPRV contains long terminal repeats (LTRs) which are similar to LTR retrotransposons. Homologous sequences of Hvu-EPRV were found in a wide range of plants, however, only those in 17 grasses belonging to the six tribes contain LTRs. The insertion times of nested LTR retrotransposons indicated that Hvu-EPRVs inserted into barley more than 2.37 million years ago, but the invasion and endogenization of Hvu-EPRV related elements in the grass family may be ancient, and horizontal transfers may have occurred between grasses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Hvu-EPRV and its homologs in grasses were grouped apart from all 13 reported genera of exogenous and endogenous pararetroviruses, thus the EPRVs in grasses represent a novel genus of the Caulimoviridae family named Moridahovirus. Genome-wide comparisons of Hvu-EPRVs were conducted between the reference genome and other 84 genomes of cultivated and wild barley, three independent integration events were observed and suggested that the integrations likely occurred after the divergence between barley and its wild progenitor.

Here, we combine single-cell analysis with long-read nanopore sequencing to capture full-length RNA isoforms and uncover temporal changes in RNA transcription, processing, and alternative splicing in the aging mouse cortex and hippocampus. By profiling transcriptomes from young adult to very old mice, we identify non-linear, cell-type-specific isoform expression changes and isoform usage shifts, primarily driven by transcription start site selection.

Often naturally derived hydrogels are used, as their inherent bioactivity supports dynamic cellular behaviors. Hydrogel biomaterials that are partly or fully synthetic are desirable in engineering systems with specific, designed properties, though they typically lack bioactive features of natural materials without additional molecular design. In particular, permissive biomaterials enable physiologically relevant dynamic cellular behaviors. Granular hydrogels offer inherent permissiveness, owning to porosity between particles and dynamic behaviors in the absence of interparticle crosslinking. However, applying these in MPS to model tissues requires stable channels to perfuse fluid in these dynamic systems. Here, we establish channels within granular hydrogels to enable perfusion through spatially controlled interparticle crosslinking. Selective crosslinking allowed for the formation of stable channels while allowing the microparticles of a granular hydrogel between two channels to remained uncrosslinked. This allowed spatiotemporal control of signals within an environment established from microparticles without interparticle crosslinking. Fluorescently tagged molecules allowed for the visualization of controlled soluble gradients between two channels within the device. Additionally, embedded 3D printing processes can be used to specify material composition within the system, demonstrating integrated technology for engineering well-defined hydrogel systems. Integrated microfluidic-based control over soluble signals in a system that is compatible with 3D printing processes will establish a basis for building MPSs for broad applications, and the ability to maintain granular systems in culture without interparticle crosslinking will enable design of synthetic hydrogels that access unique dynamic properties within these systems.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}

In particular, the feedback inhibitor CITED2 operates a unidirectional switch that efficiently terminates the hypoxic response by displacing the C-terminal activation domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 from its complex with the TAZ1 domain of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Unidirectionality of the switch arises from subtle allosteric conformational changes in TAZ1 and from differences in the strength of thermodynamic coupling between the TAZ1-binding motifs in the multivalent HIF-1 and CITED2 activation domains. To investigate the role of binding cooperativity, we mutated a linker sequence in the HIF-1 activation domain to enhance or reduce the thermodynamic coupling between its TAZ1-binding motifs. An efficient native-gel assay shows that certain linker mutations enhance the affinity of HIF-1 for TAZ1, and fluorescence anisotropy competition and NMR measurements show that these mutants can compete with CITED2 for TAZ1 more effectively than wild-type HIF-1. The wide range of mutants, which include insertion, deletion, replacement and scrambling of residues in the linker, provide insights into the molecular basis for the exquisite tuning of the hypoxic switch: the TAZ1 affinity and consequent CITED2 competition enhancement depends both on the flexibility of the linker sequence (particularly the presence of glycine residues) and the unfavorable electrostatic interactions of a highly conserved arginine side chain in the center of the linker with an electropositive surface of TAZ1.", "date": "2025-06-08", "journal": ""}
