S.; Biswas, R. R.; Iyer-Biswas, S.", "abstract": "Individual bacterial cells grow and divide stochastically. Yet they maintain their characteristic sizes across generations within a tightly controlled range. What rules ensure intergenerational stochastic homeostasis of individual cell sizes? Valuable clues have emerged from high- precision longterm tracking of individual statistically-identical Caulobacter crescentus cells as reported in [1, 2]: Intergenerational cell size homeostasis is an inherently stochastic phenomenon, follows Markovian or memory-free dynamics, and cells obey an intergenerational scaling law, which governs the stochastic map characterizing generational sequences of cell sizes. These observed emergent simplicities serve as essential building blocks of the data-informed principled theoretical framework we develop here. Our exact analytic fitting-parameter-free results for the predicted intergenerational stochastic map governing the precision kinematics of cell size homeostasis are remarkably well borne out by experimental data, including extant published data on other microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, our framework naturally yields the general exact and analytic condition that is necessary and sufficient to ensure that stochastic homeostasis can be achieved and maintained. Significantly, this condition is more stringent than the known heuristic result from quasi-deterministic frameworks. In turn the fully stochastic treatment we present here extends and updates extant frameworks, and highlights the inherently stochastic behaviors of individual cells in homeostasis.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

This heterodimer complex helps in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via the proteasome with the help of the AAA+ ATPase CDC-48. While the ubiquitin-proteasome system is known to have important roles in maintaining innate immune responses, the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in regulating immunity remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in maintaining Caenorhabditis elegans innate immune responses. Inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex activates an aberrant immune response that reduces the survival of the wild-type worms on the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite diminishing colonization of the gut with the bacterium. This aberrant immune response improves the survival of severely immunocompromised worms on pathogenic bacteria but is detrimental on nonpathogenic bacteria. Transcriptomics studies reveal that the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediates the aberrant immune response upon inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. Collectively, our findings show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex triggers an aberrant immune response that is detrimental to immunocompetent worms under infection conditions but can be advantageous for immunocompromised worms.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

We introduce ODEinherit, a new statistical framework leveraging ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to measure how much a mother cell's regulatory network is passed on to its daughters, addressing this gap. ODEinherit first estimates cell-specific regulatory networks through ODE systems, incorporating novel adjustments for non-oscillatory trajectories. Then, inheritance is quantified by evaluating how well a mother's regulatory network explains its daughter's trajectories. We demonstrate that precise quantification of this inheritance relies on pruning and adjustment for the network density. We benchmark ODEinherit on simulated data and apply it to live-cell, time-lapse microscopy data, where we track the expression dynamics of six proteins across 85 dividing S. cerevisiae cells over eight hours.

C.; Thorson, J.", "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to standardize spatially unbalanced data, project climate impacts, and identify habitat for conservation. SDMs typically estimate the impact of local environmental conditions by estimating a dome-shaped or non-parametric \"environmental response function\". However, ecological responses often integrate across local habitat conditions, such that species density depends on habitat at the location of sampling but also at nearby locations. To address this, we extend methods from the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method that is widely used in INLA, which approximates spatial correlations based on local diffusion over a finite-element mesh (FEM). We specifically introduce the sparse inverse-diffusion operator on a FEM, and apply this operator to covariates to efficiently calculate a spatially weighted average of local habitat that is then passed through pointwise basis-expansion to predict species densities. We show that this operator has several useful properties, i.e., conservation of mass, linear computational time with spatial resolution, and a uniform stationary distribution, where the latter ensures that estimated responses are invariant to linear (scale and offset) transformations of covariates. We test this covariate-diffusion method using a simulation experiment, and show that it can correctly recover a non-local environmental response while collapsing to a local (pointwise) response when warranted. We apply it to monitoring data for 25 bottom-associated fishes in the eastern Bering Sea and 20 bird species in the western United States. This application confirms that non-local responses in the eastern Bering Sea case study are parsimonious for 25 species-maturity combinations, while 20 collapse to the pointwise method. Estimates suggest that some species-maturity combinations avoid proximity to the continental slope, beyond what is predicted by local bathymetry in isolation. By contrast, in only 2 of the 20 bird species is the diffused human population density covariate more parsimonious than the original covariate. The covariate-diffusion method introduced here constitutes a fast and efficient approach to modelling non-local covariate effects. This flexible method may be useful in cases when covariates influence nearby population densities, for instance due to movement of the sampled species or its important biological or physical drivers.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Some COs form chiasmata, which physically connect homologous chromosomes and ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis I. Meiosis is highly relevant to speciation, with the mismatch repair (MMR) system believed to prevent IH-HR, leading to postzygotic isolation between closely related species. We report that several Saccharomyces cerevisiae HR proteins exhibit anti-MMR activities, including Rad51, Rad54, and synapsis-promoting ZMM proteins (Mer3, Zip1, Zip4, and Msh4) in SK1/S288c hybrid zygotes. Srs2 (an ortholog of Escherichia coli helicase UvrD) facilitates MMR by dissembling Rad51-ssDNA presynaptic filaments. Rad51 antagonizes MMR and Srs2 to catalyze D-loop formation.

In 2022, TB affected approximately 10.6 million people worldwide, resulting in 1.3 million deaths. In regions with a high burden of zoonotic TB, Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) accounts for nearly 10% of human TB cases. The immune evasion strategies and latent nature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) pose significant challenges to understanding the host immune response to TB infection. In this study, we identify RNA-binding motif protein X-linked 2 (RBMX2) as a novel host factor that may facilitate M. bovis infection. However, the molecular mechanisms and functional roles of RBMX2 during M. bovis infection remain poorly understood. Our findings show that RBMX2 is significantly upregulated across multiple cell types following infection, including embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells, bovine macrophage (BoMac) cells, bovine pulmonary alveolar primary cells, and human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). Using a combination of global transcriptomic sequencing, proteomic profiling, cell adhesion assays, ChIP-PCR, and Western blotting, we demonstrate that RBMX2 suppresses cell adhesion and tight junction formation in EBL cells while promoting M. bovis adhesion and invasion through activation of the p65 signaling pathway. Importantly, integrated analyses of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data reveal that RBMX2 plays a key role in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process closely associated with cancer progression. To further explore the potential link between RBMX2 and cancer, we analyzed the TIMER2.0 database and found elevated RBMX2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues compared to normal lung tissues. These findings were corroborated by immunofluorescence staining. Using an M. bovis-infected BoMac-induced EBL-EMT model, we show that RBMX2 promotes EMT through activation of the p65/MMP-9 pathway following infection. Additionally, we validated the EMT process in human lung epithelial cancer cells (H1299), further supporting the involvement of RBMX2 in this transition. Collectively, our study identifies RBMX2 as a novel host factor that may enhance M. bovis infection and drive infection-induced EMT. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TB pathogenesis and suggest that RBMX2 could serve as a potential target for the development of TB vaccines and therapeutic strategies against TB-associated lung cancer.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Likewise, pain chronification, which is defined as the transition from an acute pain state to a persistent one in response to repeated or intense nociceptive stimuli, involves crucial contributions from astrocytes. Although lactate transport by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) astrocytes has been shown to influence pain chronification, the specific metabolic pathways and upstream signaling events remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified glycogenolysis in ACC astrocytes as a central signaling mechanism controlling pain chronification. Inhibition of glycogenolysis suppressed pain-related behaviors and normalized neuronal hyperactivity. To extend the effects of glycogenolysis to broader metabolic dynamics, we conducted integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses as chronic pain progressed. Interestingly, those analyses revealed that chronic pain was accompanied by a shift toward cancer-associated metabolic programs in the ACC, and that shift was driven by astrocytic glycogenolysis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that pain chronification is mediated by astrocytic glycogenolysis, which induces a cancer-associated metabolic pathway. Therefore, alterations in astrocytic glycogen metabolism could be key signals for cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming.

D.; Steinsaltz, D.", "abstract": "Developing population dynamic models that can flexibly adapt to different species remains a challenge due to the context-dependent nature of demographic studies. This work introduces ABC_GP IPM, a novel Integral Projection Model (IPM) framework, aimed at mitigating key limitations associated with traditional IPMs, including (i) reliance on predefined vital rate models with restrictive assumptions, (ii) omission of potential vital rate interactions, and (iii) limited flexibility in incorporating domain- or user-specific knowledge. The purpose of this work is to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of IPMs across various ecological and evolutionary studies. Our methodology integrates Gaussian Process (GP) models with Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). GP models introduce a non-parametric structure that accommodates a broader range of demographic patterns, reducing sensitivity to specific model choices. The incorporation of ABC methods allows IPMs to integrate additional population-level information, enabling potential interactions among vital rates to be reflected in model outcomes without requiring additional datasets. The information can be user-modified, facilitating the tailoring of IPMs to specific requirements or domain-specific knowledge. Recognising the inherent challenge of selecting appropriate summary statistics in ABC applications, we further propose a systematic procedure tailored to navigate this complexity effectively when applying ABC_GP to IPMs. The method demonstrated strong flexibility and adaptability across different modeling scenarios. In simulation studies, ABC_GP IPM showed notable improvements over traditional GLM-based IPMs across multiple population metrics commonly used in biological research. When applied to real-world datasets, the method captured complex demographic patterns more effectively, supporting its potential as a practical and adaptable alternative to existing IPM frameworks. The ABC_GP IPM framework provides greater flexibility in model specification, accommodating potential non-linearities with fewer assumptions. It also facilitates the incorporation of user expertise and domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its applicability to context-dependent demographic studies. While offering a more adaptable modeling approach, the method remains accessible to users without specialized expertise in statistical modeling. Importantly, ABC_GP IPM delivers these improved outcomes using identical datasets as standard IPMs, facilitating easier adoption for studies that have applied traditional IPMs.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

D.; Steinsaltz, D.", "abstract": "Many complex systems are modelled using modular models, where individual sub-models are estimated separately and then combined. While this simplifies inference, it fails to account for interactions between components. A natural solution is to estimate all components jointly, but this is often impractical due to intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides a likelihood-free alternative, but its standard implementations are computationally inefficient, particularly when applied to high-dimensional modular models, or when sub-models involve costly machine learning methods, like Gaussian Process (GP) models. The ABC-Population Monte Carlo (ABC-PMC) framework improves on vanilla ABC by using sequential Monte Carlo sampling with adaptive tolerances and proposal kernels, yielding much higher acceptance rates and more efficient exploration of parameter space. Existing ABC-PMC algorithms are not, however, especially efficient in the high-dimensional parameter setting typical of modular models. We introduce a novel modification of the ABC-PMC method that leverages model modularity. Our approach refines the prior distribution and perturbation kernel by using precomputed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from individual sub-models, making parameter updates more efficient. Additionally, we employ an adaptive summary statistic weighting strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution of different statistics, reducing the influence of less informative statistics. These modifications greatly reduce overall computational cost. In our case studies, the runtime for 10,000 simulation attempts drops from over 20 days to under 1 minute, following a one-off preprocessing step that consists of standard MCMC sampling for each sub-model (typically 3-10 hours, depending on model complexity). We apply our method to an ecological case study using an Integral Projection Model (IPM) for Cryptantha flava, where survival, growth, and reproduction processes are modelled using GP models. The results of the simulated and the real case studies demonstrate greatly improved computational efficiency while preserving inference quality.

A key sensor motif within many of these proteins is the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, known for its conserved fold yet highly divergent sequences, allowing for a broad range of ligands to control PAS protein function by changes in small molecule binding occupancy or configuration. This diversity introduces a challenging step -- identification of ligands for \"orphan\" PAS proteins which show signatures of ligand binding but no copurifying high-affinity bound small molecules -- into characterization and engineering of such proteins. In this study, we characterized CU228, a putative PAS-HTH transcription factor from Candidatus Solibacter usitatus, as a novel model system for searching for novel ligands by small molecule stabilization. Bioinformatics and structural analyses predicted a PAS domain with an Trp-rich internal cavity, suggesting potential small molecule interactions.

Triple and quintuple scamp mutants show only mild developmental delay under standard growth conditions, but are more tolerant to drought.

Mutation of the RUN domain (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) cargo adaptor unc-14 dramatically impacted both dendritic spines and overall GABAergic neuron morphology. In contrast, mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha subunit unc-63 caused a failure in AChR assembly in GABAergic neurons but did not significantly alter dendritic spine structure or abundance. Notably, specific expression of wild type unc-14 cDNA in either GABAergic neurons or presynaptic cholinergic neurons was not sufficient to rescue the unc-14 mutant phenotype while pan neuronal expression provided significant rescue, indicating that disruptions in GABAergic neuron morphology arise from compound effects. Finally, we obtained a mutation in the Liprin-; synaptic scaffold syd-2 that produces a stop codon in a C-terminal SAM domain and has severe effects on dendritic spines and AChR localization. Our unbiased strategy identified key genes that implicate three distinct cellular processes important for synapse/circuit development and maturation. The identification of these genes from our screen highlights how mechanisms for receptor assembly, cargo trafficking and synapse structural organization each contribute to circuit connectivity.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Each re-exposure to the spatial environment stimulates retrieval of the stored experience followed by information re-encoding, including updating if the environment has changed. It remains unclear if the same neurons are involved in these three events. Here, we used a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) approach that detected time-locked nuclear immediate early gene(IEG) expression to identify hippocampal neuronal ensembles that were engaged in the acquisition of a spatial representation, as well as its subsequent stabilization and/or updating. Responses were assessed in distal(dCA1) and proximal CA1(pCA1) of male rats. Homer1a was used to detect neuronal recruitment triggered by novel learning of a holeboard environment(HB). cFos and Arc expression was used to detect ensemble stability and/or expansion, or ensemble remodeling, respectively, that was triggered by animal exposure to the now familiar HB that included novel objects(HBO) 25min after the initial HB exposure. Novel HB exposure resulted in nuclear Homer1a expression in both dCA1 and pCA1. Subsequent HBO triggered significant cFos and Arc expression only in dCA1. IEG co-labelling (Homer1a/cFos, Homer1a/Arc and Homer1a/cFos/Arc) was also only evident in dCA1, reflecting both re-iteration and remodeling of dCA1, but not pCA1 ensembles. In sum, we show that the contiguous acquisition and updating of spatial representations recruits distinct populations of CA1-neurons reflecting ensemble selection and stabilization, as well as ensemble remodeling. Moreover, whereas dCA1 and pCA1 are involved in the acquisition of the original spatial representation, only dCA1 is engaged in representation updating related to changes in spatial content information.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

We found that inhibiting the scaffolding protein Clarinet/CLA-1, a C. elegans ortholog of Piccolo and Fife, robustly improves axon regeneration. Despite the importance of CLA-1 during synapse development, disrupting the medium isoform of CLA-1 increases the number of axons that regenerate to the neuromuscular junction without significantly influencing synapse reformation. Consequently, the axons that do regenerate are capable of regaining function. Mechanistically, the enhanced axon regeneration observed in cla-1(-) mutants depends on the function of PTRN-1, a microtubule minus-end binding protein. Our data supports a model where loss of CLA-1 promotes PTRN-1 function, which speeds trafficking of injury-related cargo to and from the lesion, thus improving repair. Together, our results reveal a highly conserved synaptic active zone protein that can be manipulated to enhance axon regeneration without sacrificing the function of the repaired axons.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Working memory relies on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging short-term storage with broader cognitive processing. However, when the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the delay non-match to place (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to silencing the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behaviour progressively shifts toward automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Accordingly, silencing the DLS during maintenance of the task triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behaviour. Our findings strengthen the view that memory traces result from a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view that information merely migrates between brain structures. We here propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state less energy-consuming for the system while still allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Lowered arousal is thought to arise from sensory gating in the brain, yet there is compelling evidence that stimuli can still be processed to some degree. Which aspects of sensory information are processed during sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive recordings of activity from multiple neuron types during sleep and wakefulness in the Drosophila olfactory association center. We find that baseline activity of dopamine neurons (DANs) is distinct between active, rest and sleep states, enabling a decoder to predict when the fly is asleep. Optogenetic inhibition of DANs acutely induces sleep and lowers odor-evoked arousal, suggesting causality between DAN activity and behavior. We then examine odor processing during sleep, and find that whereas coding of odor identity in Kenyon cells (KCs) remains intact, coding of odor value in DANs is altered. Specifically, DANs encoding positive (attractive) and negative (aversive) values change their odor responses in an opposing manner, producing more aversive odor representations during sleep. Consistent with these changes in neural activity, sleeping flies awoken by odors show reduced approach and increased avoidance behaviour. Taken together, our data reveal that the brain does not simply suppress the propagation of sensory signals during sleep; rather, it utilizes different cell types to retain or modify specific aspects of sensory information. The aversive odor evaluation in DANs may have ethological benefits as it suppresses the motivation to pursue attractive odors during sleep and primes defensive action when aroused by the scent of potential dangers.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall.

We tested whether hunger, sensory-specific satiety and BMI interact to shape automatic capture of attention by real high-calorie snack foods. Methods: Two emotional-attentional-blink (EAB) experiments presented food distractors either 300 msec (lag-3) or 900 msec (lag-9) before a neutral target. Experiment 1 (N = 183; whole BMI range) randomly assigned participants to taste (non-satiated), satiated or non-eating conditions; the snacks eaten (or not eaten) subsequently re-appeared as distractors in the EAB task. Experiment 2 (N = 61; 31 overweight/obese, 30 normal-weight) manipulated hunger/satiety states and snack type (consumed vs. novel) orthogonally, in a double session design. Results: Experiment 1; food images presented at lag-3 reduced target detection compared with lag-9 (OR = 0.61, CI 0.50 - 0.75, p < .01. Higher BMI predicted a larger AB when hungry, but a smaller AB when satiated (OR = 0.65, CI 0.48 - 0.88, p < 0.01). Experiment 2; For novel snacks, an interaction revealed that participants with overweight/obesity retained robust AB after satiation, whereas AB declined for participants with normal-weight (OR = 2.45, CI 1.09 - 5.51, p = 0.03). For snacks just eaten, AB remained significant in both groups (lag-3 vs. lag-9: OR = 0.37, CI 0.25 - 0.55, p < .001). Conclusions: Real-food cues automatically biased attention regardless of metabolic state, with BMI modulating this effect: even when satiated, individuals with overweight/obesity continue to orient their attention toward both familiar and novel high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that satiety signals alone may be insufficient to curb attentional capture by food in obesity, highlighting the need for interventions that target attentional control and limit food availability.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Here, using cortex-wide population voltage imaging in awake mice, we found that bouts of 5-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex are accompanied by similar oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex, occurring both spontaneously and evoked by visual stimulation. Injection of psychotropic 5-HT2AR agonist induced a significant increase in spontaneous 5-Hz oscillations, and also increased the power, occurrence probability and temporal persistence of visually evoked 5-Hz oscillations. This modulation of 5-Hz oscillations in both cortical areas indicates a strengthening of top-down control of perception, supporting an underlying mechanism of perceptual filling and visual hallucinations.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Contrary to this dogma, we show that mouse NGOs possess abundant histone modifications that both underlie maintenance of the ovarian reserve and prime the epigenome of growing oocytes for early embryogenesis. As NGOs are established around birth, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) mediates abundant H2AK119 ubiquitylation and reprograms the H3K27 acetylation landscape, which is essential to maintain the ovarian reserve. Importantly, the PRC1-driven epigenetic state of NGOs provides a blueprint for subsequent generation of a PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 trimethylation profile in growing oocytes that is characterized by broad domains and DNA methylation-independent imprints that are transmitted to the embryo.

Unlike visually guided animals, bats navigate and maintain cohesion in dense groups using self-generated sonar signals. I present a biologically grounded simulation framework in which agents operate asynchronously using a closed-loop control policy based on local echo delays. Building on the theory of biosonar responsivity and the deduction of temporal precision in bat echolocation, my model predicts a tight coupling between echo delay, call duration, and call rate, and demonstrates that local, echo-timed interactions suffice to generate stable, self-organised swarm behaviour. To test these predictions, I systematically varied initial velocity and responsivity coefficient, kr, across a simulation grid and analysed the resulting call dynamics and collision risks. An information propagation model was derived, estimating the effective spatiotemporal speed of behavioural updates across the swarm. I also developed a decay-based model of perturbation attenuation to quantify the spatial limit of influence for local disturbances. Together, these analyses reveal a trade-off between responsiveness and stability: lower kr yields faster information flow but higher collision risk in denser regions, while higher kr promotes stability but reduces reactivity. My results align closely with recent empirical findings and provide a generative explanation for swarm cohesion based on the temporal precision of echolocation. These insights offer a promising design framework for decentralised control in bioinspired robotic swarms, where stability, autonomy, and resilience emerge from local sensing and feedback, rather than explicit synchrony or global coordination.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Metabolic profiling revealed an accumulation of hexose phosphates and Krebs cycle intermediates in Nicotiana benthamiana plants following BaMV infection. Fluxomic analysis uncovered an orchestrated redirection of metabolic flux toward glycolysis and the Krebs cycle during infection. Proteomic data further highlighted a concerted upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes, with three mitochondrial proteins showing markedly increased accumulation in BaMV-infected tissues.

The recent developments in hormetic studies are of paramount importance in plant research as they help in risk assessment of environmental contaminants, protect the vegetation against pollution, and improve crop productivity. As one of the most toxic contaminants, cadmium is considered to have detrimental effects on the growth and development of plants. However, recent studies have revealed the beneficial effects of cadmium in plants at low levels of exposure however the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is poorly deciphered. In this study, we have focused on observing the response of tomato seedlings under different concentrations of cadmium. The morphological, biochemical, and histochemical characterization of these seedlings under low cadmium exposure has confirmed their hormetic effects. The differential gene expression by transcriptomic profiling in low cadmium showed that, apart from genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, and signaling, several lncRNAs, also differentially expressed. The lncRNAs are known to regulate gene expression on the chromatin level and post-transcriptional regulation. First time we are reporting the expression of lncRNAs in hormesis as important factor for enhanced growth.

Our findings, first of its kind, demonstrate the initial comprehensive model of sequential causal structure and hierarchical cascade of organelle collapse of different but important organelles such as mitochondria, lysosome, vesicles trafficking and nuclear architectures under anaesthesia in plants.

In a time dependent experiment, we found that plant cells exposed to lidocaine for up to four hours could still recover mitochondrial potential, lysosomal function, and nuclear integrity when anaesthesia is removed. However, beyond four hours, the damage, especially to the nucleus, was irreversible, and cells proceeded to programmed cell death. Our data further demonstrate that organelle functions can recover after brief exposure to anaesthetic stress.

We studied 43 uprooted 30-year-old naturally infected vines in three experimental conditions: well-watered asymptomatic (Control) vines, vines with esca symptoms (Esca), and vines subjected to water deficit (WD) over two consecutive summers. We profiled trunk, cane, stem and petiole Ascomycota communities by DNA metabarcoding with primers specifically designed for grapevine trunk-associated Ascomycota, and quantified wood necrosis. The Ascomycota communities of trunks and younger organs clearly differed, and drought and esca had different impacts on the Ascomycota communities of perennial and young organs. In the trunk, drought significantly decreased fungal diversity in healthy wood and increased the abundance of wood pathogens (e.g. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Botryosphaeria dothidea). In young organs, esca expression decreased the species richness and diversity of the Ascomycota community to a greater extent than drought. We also found that the relative proportion of healthy wood was smaller in plants with esca symptoms than in asymptomatic plants.

Root uptake extracts water from the soil based on a two-node (root and leaf) plant model, with stomatal conductance a function of leaf water potential, and transpiration driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The results of multi-day simulations reproduce published observations of near-perfect conservation of transpiration despite a doubling of VPD and show that the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to VPD depends on the ratio of total daily potential transpiration to the maximum soil flux. Osmotic adjustment to maintain open stomata to lower water potentials is shown to be ineffective for increasing carbon gain.

This experiment aimed at identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs), associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms linked with several yield-related traits, such as biological yield(B/Y), yield per plant(Y/P), days to maturity(DM), and harvest index(HI), that have a role in heat stress tolerance by evaluating 184 Pakistani wheat accessions. Marker trait associations were identified using Genome wide association study (GWAS) that revealed 59 QTLs related to B/Y, Y/P, HI and DM across all of the 21 chromosomes out of which 32 had high confidence protein coding regions. These QTLs were functionally characterized using wheat databases including ENSEMBL and UNIPROT. Their functional annotation revealed that some of the proteins expressed by these regions including elongation factor alpha and cytochrome p450 on chr5B and chr5D exhibit direct response to heat stress. Several transcription factors on chr5A and 1A help repair damaged DNA or act as chaperones and restore cellular activity, playing a key role in rendering heat tolerance to wheat. 2B was identified as QTL hotspot having 6 significant SNPs that were related to proteins having substantial role in heat tolerance. Haplotype analysis of these SNPs revealed the patterns of inheritance of these SNPs.

Here we propose plastome loss in holoparasitic Mystropetalaceae (Santalales), which consists of three monotypic genera: Dactylanthus, Hachettea, and Mystropetalon. Using Illumina DNA sequencing data, we successfully assembled the complete mitochondrial genomes of all three genera; however, we failed to recover any plastome sequences from them using reference-based and de novo assembly approaches. Illumina RNA sequencing data for Hachettea revealed the absence of plastid gene transcripts and losses of many nuclear-encoded genes with plastid function, including genes involved in DNA transcription, translation and protein degradation. Convergent loss of these key genes has also been documented in other plastome-less non-photosynthetic plant lineages. Taken together, we provided compelling evidence for plastome loss in the family Mystropetalaceae.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Acute aerobic exercise (AAE) can modulate primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. To date, studies evaluating the effects of AAE on M1 excitability have focused almost exclusively on concentric cycling. Interestingly, eccentric cycling increases frontal-parietal brain activation more than concentric cycling. Critically, we recently found eccentric AAE enhances motor learning more than concentric AAE. Yet, the M1 excitability mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of eccentric cycling AAE on M1 excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirty adults performed three 20 min-conditions: i) eccentric cycling AAE, ii) concentric cycling AAE, and iii) rest. Cycling AAE was carried out at a workload corresponding to 70% of peak heart rate (%HRpeak) measured during concentric incremental cycling exercise. TMS assessments were conducted before (Pre), immediately (Post0) and 20 minutes after (Post20) AAE/rest to evaluate changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI). We found CSE increased and SICI decreased at Post20 following eccentric and concentric cycling AAE compared to rest. Also, %HRpeak, muscle pain and perceived effort were lower during eccentric cycling AAE compared to concentric cycling AAE. Our results showed that eccentric cycling impacted M1 excitability change to a comparable degree as concentric cycling, while requiring less cardiovascular response, eliciting less muscle pain and lower perceived effort. Taken together, our results suggest that eccentric cycling AAE may be a valuable intervention to modulate M1 excitability for populations with limited cardiovascular capacity and have potential implications in clinical and sports-related contexts.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

However, to date there is little direct evidence for the involvement of preparatory attention during language processing. In this study, we investigate preparatory attention during spoken language comprehension by measuring alpha neural activity with EEG, a known measure of temporal attentional preparation. Alpha activity leading up to target words that were either focused or defocused by a preceding discourse question did not vary as a function of focus, challenging the assumption that attention is pre-allocated to the timing of focused words. On the other hand, we found that trial-by-trial fluctuations in alpha activity predicted both the depth of processing and the subsequent memory for new information. Specifically, pre-target alpha modulated a centro-parietal Dm subsequent memory effect for focused words, linking preparatory attention to memory encoding during comprehension. Together, these findings bridge psycholinguistic studies on information structure and cognitive neuroscience research on temporal attention, offering novel insights into the role of alpha activity in attentional dynamics during spoken language processing.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Dataset 1 combined three stimulus intensities (10{degrees}C, 42{degrees}C, 60{degrees}C) with topical application of thermosensitive TRP; channel agonists (menthol 20%, capsaicin 1%) or vehicle; Dataset 2 manipulated the block wise transition probability of receiving cold (15{degrees}C) or hot (58{degrees}C) stimulation. PCI scaled non-linearly with temperature, being lowest at the intermediate 42{degrees}C and highest at the cold and hot extremes (Datasets 1 and 2). PCI was sensitive both to peripheral sensitisation, as topical menthol and capsaicin selectively reduced PCI during cold stimulation (Dataset 1), and to changes in block-wise stimulus probability (Dataset 2). Across all analyses, classical ERP peak measures (N2-P2 amplitude/latency) failed to explain PCI variance. These findings demonstrate that sensory-evoked PCI reflects the brain's response to exogenous, sensory-driven perturbations, quantifying changes in neural complexity associated with both stimulus intensity, peripheral sensitisation and probabilistic manipulations.

A.", "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in which autoreactive immune cells migrate through a damaged blood brain barrier, resulting in focal demyelinating lesions of both the white and grey matter. Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS. Methods: We first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption. Results: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour. Conclusion: These data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects of non-motor MS symptomatology.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors.

In rice, exposure of leaves to short days induces the differentiation of a branched inflorescence called panicle at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Systemic communication from the leaves to the SAM is mediated by members of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, including HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), commonly referred to as florigens. Florigens are ~20kDa proteins translated in leaf companion cells and loaded into the phloematic stream, through which they reach the SAM. Once in meristematic cells, they are translocated to the nucleus, where they form higher-order protein complexes that include transcription factors and drive transcriptional reprogramming of meristematic cells. The activity of Hd3a and RFT1 at the SAM is partly mediated by FLOWERING LOCUS T LIKE 1 (FTL1) encoding a florigen-like protein required to accelerate flowering and establish the branching pattern of the panicle. The photoperiodic regulatory network is largely based on protein-protein interactions (PPIs), that take place in different tissues and in response to environmental variation. Capturing the full extent of these interactions for a specific protein and in vivo is a challenging task. Here, we developed a protocol of Proximity Labeling (PL) to study the interactome of FTL1 in developing panicles. We show that FTL1 associates with or is proximal to several proteins implicated in vesicular trafficking, microtubule binding and transcriptional regulation. Using a transient system, we demonstrate that FTL1 can actively move between cells, similarly to Hd3a and RFT1. This study establishes a protocol to implement PL for the study of a dynamic process during rice reproductive development, identifies interactors of FTL1, and suggests novel features possibly linked to its function.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

To rectify this deficiency, we examined the subcellular impacts of anaesthetics utilizing HEK 293T and HepG2 cell lines, alongside with Caenorhabditis elegans as a comprehensive organismal model. In vitro treatment to lidocaine and isoflurane resulted in mitochondrial depolarization, lysosomal aggregation, and buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Chronic gastric inflammation caused by H. pylori damages the gastric mucosa and promotes carcinogenesis. Glucocorticoids are immunoregulatory hormones that limit immune activation in the stomach. This study aimed to determine how endogenous glucocorticoids regulate the gastric immune response to Helicobacter infection and their impact on preneoplastic lesion development. Methods We examined the role of endogenous glucocorticoids in shaping the gastric immune response to Helicobacter felis colonization. Gastric immune cell infiltration, atrophy, metaplasia, and preneoplastic lesion development were evaluated in adrenal-intact control mice and adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. Auto-reactive IgG antibodies were assessed using a mouse self-antigen array and by measuring their binding to healthy gastric tissue. Results Loss of endogenous glucocorticoids led to significantly increased H. felis-induced gastric T cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine expression compared to intact-infected controls. While all intact mice maintained chronic infection for up to 12 months, nearly all ADX mice eradicated H. felis within 2 - 3 weeks. Despite bacterial clearance, ADX mice continued to exhibit chronic gastric inflammation and developed dysplasia. Autoantibody profiling showed that both intact and ADX groups generated self-reactive IgG during active infection. However, only ADX mice sustained autoantibody production following bacterial eradication. Conclusions Endogenous glucocorticoids attenuate gastric inflammation during Helicobacter infection, supporting bacterial persistence while maintaining immune tolerance. These findings suggest that heightened immune responses to H. pylori may trigger autoimmune gastritis (AIG) development, which can persist after H. pylori clearance and continue to drive gastric cancer risk.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we have utilized the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to identify the metabolic and molecular targets that mediate the beneficial effects of dietary Shankpushpi intake. Metabolomic analysis revealed changes in Ascorbic acid, glucose, and Adenosine monophosphate in the head tissue of fruit flies that were fed Shankpushpi for 20 days. Subsequent gene expression analysis revealed significant changes in expression of glut 1 (Glucose transporter 1), CG6293 (Ascorbate transporter), rdl (Resistant to dieldrin), GABA-B-R1 (GABA-B receptor subtype 1) and sod 1 (Superoxide dismutase 1) in the head tissue of adult flies that were exposed to different doses of Shankpushpi. Consistent with the expression data, knockdown of sod 1, glut1, GABA-B-R1, and CG6293 but not sod 2 abolished the Shankpushpi-mediated resistance to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. To uncover downstream effectors that are responsible for the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of Shankpushpi, we examined the effects of dietary intake of Shankpushpi in a stress-induced model of depression. Administration of Shankpushpi during development alleviated depression-like behavior in Drosophila. Wild-type adult flies that were fed Shankpushpi accumulated high levels of Ascorbate in the head tissue, and knockdown of Ascorbate transporter abolished the antidepressant activity of Shankpushpi in the stress-induced model.

Here, we find that diversity in the aGPCR C-terminal intracellular tail modulates G protein activation, arrestin-3 recruitment, and utilization of selective GRKs in LPHN2, a postsynaptic aGPCR essential for synapse formation. The C-terminal tail of LPHN2 is required for G protein activation and arrestin-3 recruitment. LPHN2 with an intact tail recruits arrestin-3 in the absence of G protein activation, suggesting constitutive arrestin-3-biased signaling. Alternative splicing of the LPHN2 tail modulates G protein activation and arrestin-3 binding independently, supporting that it controls G protein vs arrestin-3 bias.

The LMW thiol N-methyl-BSH (N-Me-BSH) has been characterized in the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum, unveiling the presence and role of a putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MT), NmbA, catalyzing the final biosynthetic step of N-Me-BSH. In this work, we report biochemical evidence for NmbAs function as an MT of the N-atom of the BSH cysteine moiety, showing substrate specificity, which together with our bioinformatics analyses classifies NmbA and its outspread homologs as N-directed natural product MTs (NPMTs) of the LMW thiol BSH. We also present the first crystal structure of NmbA, which shows that NmbA is a Class I SAM-dependent MT, however, displaying a unique three-dimensional architecture unlike that observed for other NPMTs.

While the biosynthetic functions are known for each enzymatic domain of RIFS, structural and biochemical analyses of this system from purified components are relatively scarce. Here, we examine the biosynthetic mechanism of RIFS through complementary crosslinking, kinetic, and structural analyses of its first PKS module (M1). Thiol-selective crosslinking of M1 provided a plausible molecular basis for previously observed conformational asymmetry with respect to ketosynthase (KS)-substrate carrier protein (CP) interactions during polyketide chain elongation.

Microtubule-binding components of the human outer kinetochore, such as Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are present in multiple copies and together bind several microtubule ends, creating a highly multivalent binding interface. Whereas Ndc80:Ndc80 and Ndc80:microtubule binding is crucial for interface stability, Ndc80 alone in absence of Ska is unable to support stable kinetochore-attachments. Using cryoET, we demonstrate that oligomeric Ndc80:Ska assemblies stabilise microtubule ends against shortening by strengthening lateral contacts between tubulin protofilaments at microtubule plus-ends. We further identify a point mutation within the SKA1 microtubule-binding domain that does not affect microtubule-binding of individual Ska molecules, but does abolish Ska:Ska interactions. Finally, we report that oligomerisation of Ska, in a cooperative fashion together with the Ndc80, is necessary to maintain stable microtubule attachments both in vivo and in vitro.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

Few methods enable simultaneous target identification and biophysical affinity measurement, and these either apply to specific enzyme classes or proteins with ligand dependent shifts in stability. Here we describe a general platform, termed Affinity Map, which leverages competitive binding analysis, high fidelity photocatalytic labeling, and high throughput proteomics for global quantitative binding affinity profiling.

Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) confirms that glutamine binding stabilizes these filaments, which in turn exhibit reduced catalytic specificity for ammonia at physiological concentrations. This inhibition appears induced by a conformational change that remodulates the active site loop ensemble gating substrate entry. Metadynamics ensemble refinement revealed >10 [A] conformational range for the active site loop and that the loop is stabilized by transient contacts. This disorder is significant, as we show that the transient contacts which stabilize this loop in a closed conformation are essential for catalysis both in vitro and in cells.

These \"classical\" genes represent a set of well-studied genes with known genetic and phenotypic effects. We generated structures for each gene using these programs and compared how sequence, structural, and evolutionary conservation impacted the structures' confidence and geometric features. Proteins lacking conserved sequence and/or structural domains had on average 25% to 43% lower confidence scores than proteins having both domains. Proteome-wide phylostratigraphy revealed that species-specific proteins had substantially lower confidence scores than proteins conserved amongst angiosperms and Eukaryotes. Boltz-1 and ESMFold structures had the highest occurrence of structures with severe geometry issues, including overlapping atoms and unlikely bond angles. We also compared computational and experimental alignments of Arabidopsis, maize, rice, wheat, and soybean proteins from the Protein Data Bank and identified structures showing incongruences with experimental data.

The symptoms of ovarian cancer are typically subtle and alike to less lethal diseases found more prevalently in the population, frequently resulting in late diagnoses and advanced tumour stages upon treatment initiation. While surgery and platinum-based treatments can be curative, ovarian cancers found at the latter, metastasised stages are likely to be recurrent and more tailored towards palliative care. Metastasised ovarian cancer spreads to surrounding organs and tissues such as the greater omentum, a large fat pad composed of adipose tissue stretching from the stomach and hanging over the intestines. The location of this is key in its role towards ovarian cancer and its progression. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the role that adipocytes found in adipose tissue can have in ovarian cancer progression. Observations of biological experiments from two cell lines create foundations to build a multiscale agent-based model in a Physicell framework. The impact of the adipose derived media concentration, treatment dosage, and initial tumour size are explored to find how these conditions affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of cancer tumours.", "date": "2025-07-06", "journal": ""}

However, even transient YAP/TAZ inhibition alone is sufficient to suppress tumor growth in advanced stages. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ activity promotes T cell exclusion from the tumors by inducing target genes involved in tissue remodeling.

Leveraging ion mobility-based ion cloud information from DDA-PASEF experiments, we developed DIA-PASEF methods that identified 3,904 proteins across biological triplicates grown in rich medium. Compared to prior studies, this represents an increase in protein identifications of more than 140% and was achieved with more than five-fold reduction in analysis time.

The {Delta}mpkA strain exhibited expression of approximately 500 additional proteins and occupancy of over 1,800 additional phosphosites relative to a control. Differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins increased by more than an order of magnitude in the {Delta}mpkA mutant across both iron-replete and iron- deplete conditions.

Yet growing evidence suggests that their function may extend beyond the nucleus. Here, we systematically characterise the decay kinetics of eRNAs across human cell types using time-resolved transcriptomics and kinetic modelling. While most eRNAs undergo canonical exponential decay, a subset displays non-linear dynamics, suggesting context-dependent degradation mechanisms. Perturbation of core decay regulators, including components of the mA and CCR4-NOT pathways, reveals that eRNA stability is modulated by a patchwork of pathways governing mRNA turnover. Integrating transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, and half-life data, we identify eRNAs associated with changes in mRNA stability and translation efficiency of their target protein-coding transcripts. Functional validation of one such eRNA, en4528, shows it regulates CDKN2C mRNA independently of transcription and impacts cell migration. These findings redefine the regulatory scope of eRNAs, positioning them as active participants in post-transcriptional gene control and cellular behaviour.

Yet, the influence of specific ligands, like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on phagosome maturation is unclear. Here, using sterile, non-immunogenic particles as model cargo phagocytosed by macrophages, we show that in the absence of an external signal, less than half the phagosomes fuse with lysosomes. By quantifying phagosome maturation in terms of lysosomal localization and mapping lumenal pH dynamics, we find that early events triggered by LPS-induced signaling enhance both cargo delivery to lysosomes and phagosome acidification rates. We demonstrate that stress-activated p38 alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) is important for this signaling event. Other signals known to activate p38 MAPK such as flagellin, IgG and albumin also enhance lysosomal delivery of phagocytosed cargo.

These subspecies are morphologically indistinguishable and classified according to host in which they are found, type of disease and geographical distribution. During the last few decades, there has been considerable effort to genetically characterize Tb s.l. isolated from domestic and wild animals in order to better evaluate the impact of animal reservoirs on the epidemiology of HAT. To assess genetic diversity of Tb s.l. strains circulating in three endemic or historical HAT foci in Cote Ivoire, we conducted a population genetics study of these parasites. Biological and isolated stock samples collected from pigs and reference stocks were tested with the primers of the Trypanosoma gambiense-specific-glycoprotein gene (TgsGP) and were genetically characterized with eighteen microsatellite primers. TgsGP positive samples did not fit into Tbg as regard to their microsatellite profile. We also found that in Ivoirian foci, Tbb populations (animal trypanosomes) were structured as several strongly isolated units that propagate clonally. This is in variance with other published data on that subspecies.

To address these limitations, we developed 3D fluorescence tomography (FT) for high precision functional image-guided research and integrated it with small animal irradiators. Methods: The FT system, integrated with a commercial bioluminescence-guided platform in a standalone configuration, enabling compact multi-projection and multi-spectral imaging. A dual-axis galvo mirror scanner was used for laser spots scanning to excite internal fluorophore. A transportable mouse bed allows animals imaged in the optical system and transferred to irradiators for CBCT imaging and FT-guided irradiation. Spatial geometry-based methods were developed to map the laser spots and fluorescence images onto the animal numerical mesh surface, generated from the CBCT image, to serve as input data for FT reconstruction. A self-calibration method using Born-ratio data, fluorescence normalized to the excitation image, was adopted for reconstruction. Mouse phantom embedded with QD800 reporter and orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) model injected with IRDye 800CW labelled U87-EGFR cells were used to verify the FT-guided system in target localization. Results: The laser spot mapping accuracy are within 0.7 mm maximum deviation. Our system can reconstruct the target QD800 as deep as 17 mm in the mouse phantom with single projection fluorescence imaging at localization accuracy < 1 mm deviation. Using the Born ratio approach, we effectively eliminated excitation light leakage and autofluorescence, enabling our FT system to localize IRDye 800CW-labeled EGFR-overexpressing GBM cells in the mouse brain with approximately 1 mm accuracy.
