Transcription factors are the most frequently mutated and dysregulated genes in AML and they have critical roles in AML pathogenesis and progression. In this study, we performed large-scale RNA interference screens in MLL-AF9 transformed AML cells and identified GTF2IRD1 as a novel transcription factor essential for the survival of various types of myeloid leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but not for primary normal hematopoietic cells. Inhibition of GTF2IRD1 reduced the frequency of primary childhood and adult AML cells, including cell populations enriched for leukemia-initiating cells. In animal models for AML, inhibition of GTF2IRD1 significantly delayed the disease progression. Inhibition of GTF2IRD1 caused an accumulation of quiescent AML cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle but caused minor effects in apoptosis. In line with this, RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant downregulation of E2F targets as a consequence of inhibition of GTF2IRD1. Taken together, we identified GTF2IRD1 as a transcription factor with a selective importance in AML and our findings may contribute to new therapeutic inventions for the disease.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Despite the existence of several methods, performing a rational analysis including multiple algorithms while integrating different conditions such as clinical data is still not trivial. To make such investigations more accessible, we developed mosna, a Python package to analyze spatial omics data in integration with clinical or biological data, providing insight on cell interaction patterns or tissue architecture. mosna is compatible with all spatial omics techniques, it leverages tysserand to build accurate spatial networks, and is compatible with Squidpy. It proposes an analysis pipeline, in which increasingly complex features computed at each step with either the mosna- algorithms or others can be explored in integration with clinical data. The approach produces easy-to-use descriptive statistics and data visualization, while seamlessly training machine learning models and identifying variables with the most predictive power. mosna can take as input any dataset produced by spatial omics methods, including sub-cellular resolved transcriptomics (MERFISH, seqFISH, Xenium) and proteomics (CODEX, MIBI-TOF, low-plex immuno-fluorescence), as well as spot-based spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq). Integration with experimental metadata or clinical data is adapted to binary conditions, such as biological treatments or response status of patients, and to survival data. We demonstrate the proposed analysis pipeline on two spatially resolved proteomic datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset containing either binary response to immunotherapy or survival data, and we assess the performance of the proposed niche discovering method in a manually annotated spatial transcriptomic dataset. mosna identifies features describing cellular composition and spatial patterns that can provide biological insight regarding factors that affect response to immunotherapies or survival.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

When the synaptic annotation is available, the analysis of high-resolution connectomes allows for unraveling the circuit architectures. Despite the continuous technological and computational improvements, obtaining a whole-brain bauplan based on synaptic annotation remains a demanding effort. As an alternative, we present here an approach to extract an approximated brain connectome starting from libraries of single cell anatomical reconstructions aligned on the same anatomical reference brain. Our approach relies on the identification of neurite terminal nodes based on Strahler numbering of the cell morphology, and the adoption of a proximity range criterion, so as to infer, in the absence of synapse information, approximated brain network architectures. As an initial benchmark we used information theory metrics to confront our approach against a synaptically-annotated EM dataset of Drosophila melanogaster hemibrain. The comparison with our approach revealed a general agreement in the organization of the extracted connectivity modules measured in terms of Normalized Mutual Information, Adjusted Rand Index and Pearson correlation. Moreover, we show that the modules identified, along with their organization, can capture known circuit motives. We then applied this approach to a light microscopy dataset of the zebrafish larval brain composed of about 3000 neuronal skeletonizations. We show that the approximated connectome and the resulting modular organization is capable of capturing specific and topographically organized connection patterns as well as known functional circuit architectures. In conclusion, we present a scalable, from-circuit-to-brain range, approach to reveal approximated neuronal architectures supporting brain mechanisms, potentially suitable for hypothesis generation and for guiding the exploration of and integration with EM connectomes.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Participants memorized the orientations of cued and uncued grating memoranda that appeared in opposite hemifields. A grating distractor, flashed during the delay period, produces space-specific biases: memorized features are attracted towards or repelled away from the distractor's orientation depending, respectively, on when the distractor appeared in the same hemifield as the memorandum, or opposite to it. Neural prioritization in WM by cueing, and stronger memorandum maintenance mitigate this bias, whereas stronger distractor encoding enhances it.

A major differentiator between interneuron subtypes is whether they synapse onto perisomatic or dendritic regions. They can also engender local inhibitory rhythms, beta (12-35 Hz) and gamma (40-80 Hz). The interaction between the rhythmicity of inhibition and its spatial targeting on the neuron may determine how it regulates neuronal integration. Thus, we sought to understand how rhythmic perisomatic and distal dendritic inhibition impacted integration in a layer 5 pyramidal neuron model with realistic dendrites supporting Na+, NMDA, and Ca2+ spikes. We found that inhibition regulated the coupling between dendritic spikes and action potentials in a location and rhythm-dependent manner. Perisomatic inhibition principally regulated action potential generation, while distal dendritic inhibition regulated the incidence of dendritic spikes and their temporal coupling with action potentials. Perisomatic inhibition was most effective when provided at gamma frequencies, while distal dendritic inhibition functioned best at beta. Moreover, beta modulated responsiveness to distal inputs in a phase-dependent manner, while gamma did so for proximal inputs. These results may provide a functional interpretation for the reported association of soma-targeting parvalbumin positive interneurons with gamma, and dendrite-targeting somatostatin interneurons with beta.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

While drinking water-based administration is ideal for sustained exposure in high feasibility, available compounds are limited, with thioacetamide (TAA) being the primary option. Here, we aimed to establish a novel drinking water-induced mouse model of cholestatic liver injury using 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), and to characterize its pathological trajectory in comparison to the TAA model. Methods: Mice were administered MDA via drinking water for 28 Days. To elucidate the early events that give rise to chronic pathological divergence, we conducted a multi-layered analysis comprising plasma biochemical assays, immune cell profiling by flow cytometry, and hepatic transcriptomics at five time points during the early phase. The MDA model was evaluated against the established TAA model. Results: MDA administration induced sustained ALT elevation, peribiliary fibrosis, and spatially irregular focal hepatocellular necrosis, distinguishing it from the centrilobular injury observed with TAA. Early-phase analyses revealed model-specific differences in immunological and molecular responses, including increased CD8 T cell populations and enrichment of fibrinolysis-related gene expression in MDA-DW mice. Conclusions: We present the MDA-DW model as a novel, longitudinally tractable liver injury model that complements existing systems by capturing alternative spatial, immunological, and transcriptional patterns of injury.

Furthermore, there is extensive evidence of a correlation between mRNA stability and protein expression level, though the mechanistic determinants remain unclear. Using yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as a reporter gene, we herein demonstrate that adenosine (A) abundance in the first six codons is a critical determinant for achieving high protein synthesis in E. coli. Increasing A and/or decreasing guanosine (G) content in this region results in substantial increases in protein expression level both in vivo and in vitro that are correlated with steady-state mRNA concentration in vivo, and this effect is attributable to changes in the stability of the mRNA that are directly coupled to its translation efficiency. Increasing A content promotes mRNA incorporation into the functional 70S ribosomal initiation complex without altering its affinity for the 30S ribosomal subunit. These results support a model in which base composition in the first six codons modulates local mRNA folding energy to control the balance between productive translation initiation versus degradation of mRNAs bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Based on these findings, we developed a short N-terminal coding sequence that optimizes translation initiation efficiency for protein production in E. coli.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

C.; Tikhonov, M.", "abstract": "Microbial ecosystems exhibit a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity at all levels of taxonomic resolution, presenting a significant challenge for most modeling frameworks. A long-standing hope of theoretical ecology is that some patterns might persist despite community complexity -- or perhaps even emerge because of it. A deeper understanding of such \"emergent simplicity\" could enable new approaches for predicting the behaviors of the complex ecosystems in nature. However, the concept remains partly intuitive with no consistent definition, and most empirical examples described so far afford limited predictive power. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework for defining and quantifying emergent simplicity in empirical data based on the ability of coarsened descriptions to predict community-level functional properties. Applying this framework to two published datasets, we demonstrate that all five properties measured across both experiments exhibit robust evidence of what we define as \"emergent predictability\": surprisingly, as community richness increases, simple compositional descriptions become more predictive. We show that standard theoretical models of high-diversity ecosystems fail to recapitulate this behavior. This is in contrast to simple self-averaging, which is well-understood and generic across models. We propose that, counterintuitively, emergent predictability arises when physiological or environmental feedbacks oppose statistical self-averaging along some axes of community variation. As a result, these axes of variation become increasingly predictive of community function at high richness. We demonstrate this mechanism in a minimal model, and argue that explaining and leveraging emergent predictability will require integrating large-N theoretical models with a minimal notion of physiology, which the dominant modeling frameworks currently omit.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, we explored the environmental distribution of myristate, and evaluated the impact of exogenous myristate on the carbon-phosphorus exchange between R. irregularis and alfalfa or rice in a greenhouse experiment. Symbiotic AMF can absorb exogenous myristate, as evidenced by 13C enrichment and transcriptional activation of fatty acid transport and metabolism genes in AMF extraradical hyphae. Myristate is commonly present in various soil and plant environments, and its application increased both intraradical and extraradical fungal biomass, possibly linked to suppressed mycorrhizal-activated defense responses in host roots. Unexpectedly, exogenous myristate reduced the mycorrhizal phosphorus benefits for both alfalfa and rice and decreased their symbiotic carbon allocation to root-colonizing AMF, although these effects varied with soil phosphorus conditions.

However, the use of sensitive genomic data in PRS calculations raises concerns about privacy and security. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution by allowing computations on encrypted data, preserving the privacy of both genomic information and PRS models. Methods: Here, we present an application of FHE for encrypted PRS calculations using a particular protocol (CKKS) within the Lattigo library. Our approach involves a three-party system: clients (clinicians handling sensitive genetic data), modelers developing a PRS (academics or companies), and evaluators (a local hospital running the models while maintaining data confidentiality). We demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach by applying it to synthetic datasets of various sizes and to a robust 110k-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) model for schizophrenia. The complete codebase and a sample dataset are available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/HEPRS. Results: The difference between traditional plaintext and encrypted PRS calculation results is negligible: the R^{2} is 0.999 and the mean squared error is 2.27 x 10^{-6}. Moreover, while the encrypted calculation is roughly 1,000 times slower than conventional non-encrypted ones (when considering only the core PRS calculation), the computation remains feasible on a single-CPU node. For example, processing ~1,100 individuals with ~110k SNPs took six minutes and ~65 GB of memory on a laptop computer. In addition, we investigated the impact of the encryption parameters on the computational time and accuracy in detail, showing the expected slowdown with higher security settings. Conclusion: Our approach showcases the applicability and feasibility of using FHE on real-world PRS models.

This global analysis identified 60,803 fragmentation spectra corresponding to 8,801 unique substitution sites in proteins derived from 1,782 genes, including 2,000 confidently localized sites. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize how alternatively translated proteoform ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions.

To explore how these maternal factors impact offspring disease development, we used IgA-deficiency induced maternal dysbiosis in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) dams to study T1D development in their progeny.

After drawing up a scenario tree of virus transmission from one farm to another, data were collected through a literature review or through experts elicitation. Three questionnaires were developed according to the experts field of expertise: avian influenza, broiler and layer sectors. The experts estimates were combined using a beta distribution weighted by their confidence level.

While there are many hypotheses as to how classical psychedelics could induce these effects, there are no concrete mechanistic models that capture the variety of observed effects in humans, while remaining consistent with the known pharmacological effects of classical psychedelics on neural circuits. In this work, we propose the \"oneirogen hypothesis,\" which posits that the perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like states. We simulate classical psychedelics' effects via manipulating neural network models trained on perceptual tasks with the Wake-Sleep algorithm. This established machine learning algorithm leverages two activity phases: a perceptual phase (wake) where sensory inputs are encoded, and a generative phase (dream) where the network internally generates activity consistent with stimulus-evoked responses. We simulate the action of psychedelics by partially shifting the model to the 'Sleep' state, which entails a greater influence of top-down connections, in-line with the impact of psychedelics on apical dendrites.

J.; Freed, J. D.; Nagel, K. I.", "abstract": "Working memory and evidence integration are fundamental components of cognition thought to arise from distributed circuits throughout the brain. Theoretical and behavioral studies argue that both processes are required for plume navigation, an innate task in which animals use stochastic sensory cues to navigate towards the unknown location of an odor source. Here we identify a small population of local neurons in the navigation center of Drosophila that exhibits both evidence integration and working memory dynamics during goal-directed olfactory navigation. Developing a closed-loop virtual plume navigation paradigm, we show that a bump of activity in this population ramps up with successive odor encounters, and can persist for variable intervals after odor loss. While bump activity persists, the fly maintains the goal heading it adopted during odor. Silencing these neurons impairs the persistence of upwind heading after odor loss. Simulations show that the time constant of persistence observed in these neurons optimizes navigation in a turbulent boundary layer plume. Our work localizes working memory and evidence integration to a specific group of genetically-identified neurons, which will facilitate the mechanistic dissection of these building blocks of cognition.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

A branch point sequence motif UACUAAC is variably conserved in eukaryotic genomes, but in some organisms, more than one protein can recognize it. Here, we show that SF1 and Quaking (QKI) compete for a subset of intron branch sites with the sequence ACUAA. SF1 activates exon inclusion through this sequence, but QKI represses the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons with this intron branch point sequence. Using mutant reporters derived from a natural intron with two branch site-like sequences, we find that when either branch point sequence is mutated, the other is utilized; however, when both are present, neither is used due to high-affinity binding and strong splicing repression by QKI. QKI occupancy at the dual branch site directly prevents SF1 binding and subsequent recruitment of spliceosome-associated factors. Finally, the ectopic expression of QKI in budding yeast (which lacks QKI) is lethal, at least in part due to the widespread repression of splicing. In conclusion, QKI can function as a splicing repressor by directly competing with SF1/BBP for a subset of branch point sequences that closely mirror its high-affinity binding site.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We used a novel approach to consider brain degeneracy during a visual short-term memory task (VSTM) across the adult lifespan in the cross-sectional Cam-CAN study (n = 113, 23-87 years old). Our main goal was to identify subgroups of participants whose VSTM performance was characterized by distinct brain activation patterns. First, we identified seven brain modules that responded similarly to the VSTM task across participants, and resembled previously identified functional networks. Subsequently, latent profile analysis revealed four distinct subgroups of participants. Each subgroup was characterized by different recruitment patterns of these brain modules, predominantly in the frontal control module (FCM), visual module (VM), and default mode module (DMM). Subgroups did not differ in demographics or task performance. However, associations between brain activity and performance varied across subgroups, particularly in the FCM, suggesting that individuals may use different cognitive operations to perform the VSTM task. Further analyses revealed group differences in white matter integrity, mostly in the uncinate fasciculus, suggesting that individual differences in structural brain properties may shape the different brain activation patterns.

V.; Miller, L. E.; Bensmaia, S. J.", "abstract": "The transition from hand opening to grasping a coffee cup happens smoothly, yet the neural systems underlying this behavior undergo a significant state change at the onset of grasp. At this moment, the motor system begins to control contact forces and the somatosensory system receives a barrage of cutaneous signals that convey information about contact forces and the object's local features (e.g., edges, texture, and curvature). These cutaneous signals supplement the ongoing flow of proprioceptive input that encodes hand posture as well as muscle forces. How object identity is represented in sensorimotor cortex across this transition remains unknown. In the present study, we sought to quantify the object-specific neural signals in individual neurons of the primary motor cortex (M1) and Brodmann areas 3a, 3b/1, and 2 of the somatosensory cortex in macaque monkeys. Before contact, object-specific information was carried mainly by M1 and proprioceptive area 3a, but this information did not generalize between the periods before and after contact. This observation is consistent with the abruptly changing force signals at contact affecting the assumed postural representation of the object, rather than each modality maintaining an invariant identity. After contact, despite a general decrease in firing rates, information about object identity increased and was encoded with high efficiency across sensorimotor cortex. Cutaneous areas 3b and 1, largely uninformative before contact, became highly informative once objects were grasped. Area 2, which receives both cutaneous and musculotendinous inputs, conveyed little object-specific information before contact, when it too became strongly informative, consistent with its integrative role. Thus, M1 and 3a serve as the main carriers of object information before contact, while cutaneous and integrative somatosensory circuits dominate after contact. This shift highlights the profound change in the coding of object identify in the sensorimotor cortex during contact.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

NHSL1, a Nance-Horan Syndrome protein family member, localises to leading-edges of cells, where it regulates migration, and to vesicular puncta, where its function is undetermined. Here, we show that NHSL1 and its uncharacterised family member NHSL2 co-localise and engage in direct, multivalent interactions with EndoA2. NHSL1 also binds Ena/VASP proteins, a family of actin elongators. NHSL1 promotes FEME and its interactions with EndoA2 and Ena/VASP proteins are required for this function.

Genetically, small populations can face an \"extinction vortex\" - a positive feedback loop between declining fitness and declining population size. Two distinct genetic mechanisms can drive a long-term extinction vortex: i) ineffective selection in small populations allows deleterious mutations to fix, driving \"mutational meltdown\", and ii) smaller populations generate fewer beneficial mutations essential for long-term adaptation, a mechanism we term \"mutational drought\". To determine their relative importance, we ask whether, for a population near its critical size for persistence, changes in population size have a larger effect on the beneficial vs. deleterious component of fitness flux. In stable environments, we find that mutational drought is nearly as significant as mutational meltdown. Drought is more important than meltdown when populations must also adapt to a changing environment, unless the beneficial mutation rate is extremely high. Using simulations to capture the complex linkage disequilibria that emerge under realistically high deleterious mutation rates, we find that decreased effective population size is driven primarily by linkage disequilibria between deleterious and beneficial mutations, rather than among deleterious or among beneficials. These disequilibria modestly increase the importance of mutational drought.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

These properties can, in turn, be modulated by the composition and activities of the cellular proteostasis network. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is the master regulator of the cytosolic and nuclear proteostasis networks, dynamically tuning the expression chaperones and quality control factors in these cellular compartments to meet demand. Chronic increas-es in HSF1 levels and activity are prominent hallmarks of cancer cells, for reasons that remain poorly understood. One plausible explanation is that the consequent upregulation of proteostasis factors could biophysically facilitate the acquisition, selection, and maintenance of oncogenic mutations. Here, we ex-perimentally evaluate the impacts of chronic HSF1 activation on the mutational landscape accessible to p53, the protein encoded by the most mutated gene in human cancers. Specifically, we apply quantitative deep mutational scanning of p53 to assess how HSF1 activation shapes the mutational trajectories by which p53 can escape cytotoxic pressure conferred by the small molecule nutlin-3, a potent antagonist of the p53 negative regulator MDM2. We find that HSF1 activation broadly increases the selection of domi-nant-negative substitutions within p53. This effect of HSF1 activation was particularly notable for non-conservative, biophysically unfavorable amino acid substitutions within buried regions of the p53 DNA-binding domain. These results indicate that chronic HSF1 activation shapes the oncogenic mutational landscape, preferentially supporting the acquisition and maintenance of cancer-associated substitutions that are biophysically disruptive.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Moreover, preparing extensively annotated cellular cryo-ET tomograms for training macromolecule localization methods is extremely time-consuming and burdensome due to the large volume and low signal-to-noise ratio of the tomograms. In this work, we developed TomoPicker, an annotation-efficient macromolecule localization method for cryo-ET tomograms. To achieve such annotation-efficiency, TomoPicker regards macromolecule localization as a voxel classification problem and solves it with two different positive-unlabeled learning approaches. We evaluated TomoPicker on two experimental cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) datasets of crowded eukaryotic cells and one experimental dataset of relatively less crowded prokaryotic cell. We observed that, with only 10 annotated macromolecule locations, TomoPicker with positive unlabeled learning achieved a performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art supervised methods trained with several hundred annotations. In other words, TomoPicker achieved plausible segmentation with up to 98\\% less data compared to supervised learning-based methods.

By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA -- a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) -- we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e., ChIP-seq peaks). Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that high specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on the derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA-binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs.

To overcome this, we developed randomly-barcoded promoter-library insertion sequencing (RB-PI-seq) and combined it with chassis-independent recombinase-assisted genome engineering (CRAGE), using Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 as a model rhizobacterium. This method enables targeted amplification of barcoded transcripts, bypassing plant RNA interference and allowing measurement of thousands of promoter activities during root colonization. Our analysis revealed time-resolved dynamics of promoter activities, highlighting early transcriptional reprogramming as a key determinant of successful colonization.

Using published sources, we categorized prey by hardness and flight speed, bats by bite force and functional group, and examined the relationships among these variables. IB species showed differences in prey composition, type, and activity timing. As expected from its fast flight and strong bite, M. molossus diet consisted primarily of fast-flying, highly sclerotized insects, with activity times peaking significantly earlier than in the other two bat species. In contrast, M. nigricans and N. furinalis had diets consisting primarily of slower-flying prey and showed high temporal overlap in activity, although with different peak foraging times. Notably, N. furinalis stronger bite may have enabled it to exploit more sclerotized prey than M. nigricans, despite similar flight capabilities. indicating that prey hardness helps reduce dietary overlap.

To address this, we trained adult male and female mice born a day early (preterm mice) on a visual discrimination task and found that they fail to achieve high levels of performance due to increased responding to the non-rewarded cue (false alarms). While the representation of task cues measured with in vivo electrophysiology is intact in the primary visual cortex (V1) of trained preterm mice, the representation of the non-rewarded cue is significantly weaker in regular spiking, putative pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area that mediates response inhibition. Responses to both task cues are blunted in electrophysiologically and optogenetically identified fast-spiking Parvalbumin interneurons in preterm mice, indicating impaired processing of task cues in their PFC. Indeed, single trial neuronal responses evoked by the non-rewarded cue predict the behavioral outcome more accurately in term than in preterm mice. Similar cue representation and processing is present in the PFC of adolescent term-born mice, suggesting that preterm birth impedes prefrontal maturation. Surprisingly, environmental enrichment, a well-established paradigm that promotes sensory maturation, fails to improve the performance of preterm mice.

Understanding how disruptions to these functionally diverse genes lead to the shared core features of ASD remains a major challenge. Moreover, ASD is three- to four-fold more common in males than females, and autistic females tend to carry more autosomal risk alleles for ASD compared to autistic males, but the biological basis of this \"female protective effect\" (FPE) is unknow. Here we show that individual perturbations of 18 ASD genes converge on shared effects on gene expression, including widespread downregulation of other ASD genes. De novo reconstruction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) enabled the identification of central transcriptional regulators, including the prominent ASD gene CHD8 as well as novel candidates such as REST, that drive this transcriptomic convergence in ASD. Furthermore, the X-linked transcription factor ZFX, which is expressed from both the active and the \"inactive\" X chromosomes in females, emerged as a key activator of many ASD genes: we propose that the higher ZFX expression level observed in female brain can buffer damaging mutations in diverse ASD genes, contributing to the FPE.

Mediating soil gas exchange, nutrient and carbon availability, and soil moisture, wetland vegetation interacts with these compound stressors. However, the exclusion of plant-driven redox shifts from many mesocosm studies limits our understanding of their role in shaping microbial responses to hydrologic conditions. This study employed a soil mesocosm approach to investigate the impact of hydrology (wet, dry, and interim) and plant presence on microbial communities and greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal freshwater wetland soils with varying past hydrologic regimes (i.e., soil history) and salinity stress. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize the functional potential of soil microbes, measured \\textit{in situ} greenhouse gas fluxes, and characterized soil physicochemistry. Results showed that contemporary hydrology and soil history significantly impacted microbial gene composition related to sulfate and iron reduction. The compositions of genes for sulfate and iron reduction were correlated, and dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes influenced methane emissions. Findings highlight the roles of historical hydrology, potential saltwater exposure, and soil iron in shaping microbial responses to future changes in soil moisture, plant cover, and salinity. While plants did not significantly influence sulfur or iron metabolism, plant presence did impact greenhouse gas fluxes. We found a strong relationship between sulfate reduction and methanogenesis, which complements previous studies that have shown enhanced methanogenesis with seawater amendment. These results indicate that flooding without salinity is sufficient for coupled sulfate reduction and methanogenesis, provided that a legacy of saltwater intrusion has altered soil sulfate concentrations and sulfate-reducing microbial communities.

Structural studies of protein-translocating AAA+ machines proposed a coupled and sequential translocation process, whereby ATP hydrolysis events lead to short threading steps. Yet, direct real-time observation of these events remains elusive. Here, we employ single-molecule FRET spectroscopy to track substrate translocation through ClpB, a quality control AAA+ machine. We isolate ClpB and its substrate within lipid vesicles and find that translocation events, while dependent on ATP, take milliseconds, much faster than ATP hydrolysis times. Surprisingly, the translocation rate depends weakly on temperature and ATP concentration. Using three-color FRET experiments, we find that translocation events can occur bidirectionally but are not always complete. Replacing ATP with the slowly hydrolysable analog ATP{gamma}S abolishes both rapid translocation and directionality. These results indicate a fast, stochastic Brownian-motor-like mechanism, redefining how ATP is coupled with mechanical action in AAA+ machines.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Protein scaffolds can be built by fusing peptide binding domains (PBD) and attaching the peptide they bind to the enzymes, inducing spatial proximity. Only a few PBD-peptide combinations have been tested in this context, and no combination produced a high yield in yeast, an important chassis in biotechnology. Therefore, there is a need for more exploration of PBD-peptide pairs to be used in this model. Scaffold characterization is challenging because it is often dependent on a model pathway with an output that is difficult to measure quantitatively. Here, we use a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) to study scaffolding efficiency in yeast, which allows to couple scaffolding efficiency with growth rate. First, we characterize the strength of PBD-peptide interactions (PPI) and the binding availability of the PBDs and peptides. Then, we test different scaffold architectures and expression levels to quantify the simultaneous binding of peptide pairs to the scaffold. We show that PPI strength of the weakest binding PBD-peptide pair is critical for scaffolding efficiency and that PPI strength is limited by low binding availability of some domains and peptides in vivo. Also, we find that slight architectural variations and expression levels have a significant impact on scaffolding efficiency detected by DHFR PCA. Finally, we used DHFR PCA approaches to characterize novel PBD-peptide pairs and we identified pairs to expand the sequence toolbox for scaffold design in yeast through DHFR PCA easy-to-read signal.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Prolonged M phase, caused by spindle attachment defects or microtubule-targeting drugs triggers formation of the ternary \"mitotic stopwatch pathway\" complex (MSP) consisting of 53BP1, USP28, and p53. This complex stabilizes p53, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in daughter cells. In cancers that are resistant to paclitaxel, a microtubule-targeting agent, cells bypass mitotic surveillance activation, allowing unchecked proliferation, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify GMCL1 as a key negative regulator of MSP signaling. We show that 53BP1 physically interacts with GMCL1, but not its paralog GMCL2, and we map their interaction domains. CRL3GMCL1 functions as a ubiquitin ligase that targets 53BP1 for degradation during the M phase, thereby reducing p53 accumulation in daughter cells. Depletion of GMCL1 inhibits cell cycle progression upon release from prolonged mitotic arrest, a defect that is rescued by co-silencing 53BP1 or USP28. Moreover, GMCL1 depletion sensitizes cancer cells to paclitaxel in a p53-dependent manner. Together, our findings support a model in which dysregulated CRL3GMCL1-mediated degradation of 53BP1 prevents proper MSP function, leading to p53 degradation and continued proliferation. Targeting GMCL1 may therefore represent one possible avenue for addressing paclitaxel resistance in cancer cells with functional p53.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Resting-state EEG (rsEEG) parameters, particularly the aperiodic exponent, a marker of cortical excitation-inhibition balance, and individual alpha peak frequency, a correlate of neural processing efficiency, have demonstrated associations with ageing and cognitive functions. This study investigated associations between these rsEEG markers and performance across multiple memory systems in healthy older adults (n = 99) aged 50-84 years, specifically the direct associations of these markers on memory across episodic, working, and visual short-term memory systems, assessed via computerised tasks, as well as their moderating effects on age-memory relationships. While no direct associations were seen between rsEEG markers and memory performance across tasks beyond the contribution of age, gender and education, results revealed significant moderating effects of the aperiodic exponent on age-related performance in episodic and visual short-term memory. Notably, for individuals with a higher exponent, age was not significantly associated with episodic or visual short-term memory performance, whereas those with average and lower exponent values showed poorer performance with older age. These findings suggest that average and lower aperiodic exponents may reflect a marker of decrement in age-related memory performance and higher exponents may index an underlying protective mechanism against age-related memory decline. This investigation extends the current understanding of cognitive ageing mechanisms by identifying the aperiodic exponent as a potential biomarker explaining individual differences in cognitive ageing trajectories in older adult populations, particularly in episodic and visual short-term memory systems, and establishes a framework for studying neuroprotective mechanisms and developing interventions to preserve cognitive function in older adults.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We present a method inspired by cosmological techniques for analyzing galaxy surveys, utilizing higher-order summary statistics with multivariate two- and three-point analyses in 3D Fourier space. This method offers physiological interpretability during the inference, allowing the detection of scales where brain anatomy differs across age groups, providing insights into brain aging processes. Similarly to the evolution of cosmic structures, the brain structure also evolves naturally but displays contrasting behaviors at different scales. On larger scales, structure loss occurs with age, possibly due to ventricular expansion, while smaller scales show increased structure, likely related to decreased cortical thickness and gray/white matter volume. Using MRI data from the OASIS-3 database of 869 sessions, our method predicts chronological age with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~3.1 years, while providing information as a function of scale. A posterior density estimation shows that the 1-sigma uncertainty for each individual varies between ~2 and 8 years, suggesting that, beyond sample variance, complex genetic or lifestyle-related factors may influence brain aging. We perform a twofold validation of the method. First, we apply the method to the Cam-CAN dataset, yielding a MAE of ~5.9 years for the age range from 18 to 88 years.

The canonical EB model (CEB), grounded in equilibrium redox potentials, dictates the order of EB steps with initial endergonic reduction of high-potential iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe2S) by quinol followed by exergonic reduction of low-potential heme bL (bL) by semiquinone (SQ). However, this concept falls short in explaining several experimental observations, including intermediate semiquinone spin-coupled to 2Fe2S (SQ-2Fe2Sred) and the absence of short-circuiting. Presented here DFT calculations on large cluster models of cytbc, encompassing both 2Fe2S and bL, identified location of donor (HOMO) and acceptor (LUMO) orbitals along with the previously not considered microstates to reveal that EB is an emergent property of an integrated system of redox cofactors where transient charge separations dynamically modulate electron affinities. In this system, electron transfer initiates preferentially toward bL, indicating a departure from the conventional sequence proposed by CEB. Based on this finding, we introduce an EMBER (EMergent BL-first Electron Routing) model of EB and demonstrate that its assumptions are supported by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy data. Unlike CEB, EMBER proposes a relatively flat energy profile for EB that accommodates stable SQ-2Fe2Sred and explains suppression of short-circuits without additional assumptions. It highlights the importance of dynamic electrostatic interactions in shaping electron transfer pathways. In general, the concept of emergence inherent to EMBER offers a mechanistic framework applicable to a broad range of multi-cofactor redox enzymes beyond cytbc.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

These behaviors are guided by graded extracellular Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signals emanating from cells anterior to FSCs and an inverse gradient of JAK-STAT pathway activity. Here, we used lineage analyses to investigate the development of ECs, FSCs and FCs from a common set of precursors during pupation. Previous studies found that the most anterior precursors divide slowest, with quiescence spreading from the anterior over time to include all ECs, that FSCs are specified simply by their location at eclosion, and that the first FCs derive from cells that accumulate posterior to the developing germline over the first 48h of pupation. We now provide evidence that those accumulating cells derive from migration out of the developing germarium. We found that Wnt pathway activity favored conversion of precursors to more anterior adult derivatives (ECs rather than FCs), while JAK-STAT pathway activity favored posterior outcomes. Posterior bias and faster division, explored by altering Cyclin E activity, both favored a precursor becoming an FSC. Both JAK-STAT and Hh signaling could increase precursor division rate. All of these characteristics resemble regulation of adult FSC behavior. We suggest that similar signaling networks and division rate dependence during maintenance and development may be general features for stem cells that are specified in parallel with tissue development and that exhibit division-independent differentiation.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

To overcome this limitation, we engineered Escherichia coli to utilize hydrogen gas (H2) and formate (HCOO-) as alternative sources of energy and reducing equivalents, thereby decoupling energy generation from carbon metabolism. This approach enabled precise suppression of decarboxylative oxidation during acetate growth, with 86.6 +/- 1.6% of electrons from hydrogen gas (via soluble hydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator H16) and 98.4 +/- 3.6% of electrons from formate (via formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. 101) offsetting acetate oxidation. Hydrogen gas supplementation led to a titratable and stoichiometric reduction in CO2; evolution in acetate-fed cultures. Metabolomic analysis suggests that this metabolic decoupling redirects carbon flux through the glyoxylate shunt, partially bypassing two decarboxylative steps in the TCA cycle. We demonstrated the utility of this strategy by applying it to mevalonate biosynthesis, where formate supplementation during glucose fermentation increased titers by 57.6% in our best-performing strain. Flux balance analysis further estimated that 99.0 +/- 2.8% of electrons from formate were used to enhance mevalonate production.

Previous studies have shown that group housing suppresses many behaviors like courtship, aggression, and feeding in Drosophila melanogaster, in addition to resetting the circadian state. Here, we focus on group housing-induced courtship suppression. To determine the mechanisms by which social experience modulates courtship behaviors, we performed bulk tissue RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq from cells expressing FruitlessM (FruM) and DoublesexM (DsxM), two transcription factors that label interconnected neural circuits for socially driven behaviors, from grouped or isolated male brains. These revealed that social isolation alters fru and dsx levels throughout the brain. Knocking down fruM in different fruM-positive neuron subpopulations in the brains has diverse effects on social experience-dependent changes in courtship. Furthermore, group housing increases the expression of stripe (sr) and Hormone receptor-like in 38 (Hr38) genes encoding neural activity-induced transcription factors in most neurons within social circuits. We found that knocking down sr in fruM-positive neurons effectively eliminates the impact of social experience by increasing courtship in group-housed males. Importantly, social experience also alters the expression of FruM/DsxM putative target genes regulating circadian states throughout the brain. Disrupting the function of multiple circadian genes diminishes the effect of group housing on courtship. Our findings suggest that group housing/social enrichment suppresses courtship by reprogramming the circadian arousal state, whereas courtship-elevating effects of social experience rely on unique influences of FruM expression and function in different neurons within social and clock circuits. These results are significant as they point to modulation of circadian arousal state as a possible central strategy for mediating the pleiotropic effects of social experience on organismal responses.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We found decreases in the number and length of long DTC processes with age. We also found that a long-lived daf-2 mutant exhibits a daf-16-dependent maintenance of long DTC processes. Surprisingly, the tissue requirement for daf-16(+) is non-autonomous, and daf-16(+) in body wall muscle is both necessary and sufficient. In addition, after a delay, pre-formed DTC processes deteriorate upon premature germline differentiation, but not upon cell cycle inhibition. We propose a reciprocal DTC-germline interaction model and speculate how reduced daf-2 activity both delays stem cell exhaustion and maintains DTC processes.

V.", "abstract": "Influenza viruses are characterized by high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations primarily arise from the error-prone activity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts. This phenomenon aligns with the quasi-species model, in which a cloud of related viral genomes evolves under selective pressures (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and informing future vaccine design. However, conventional RNA sequencing technologies often fail to reliably detect low-frequency variants due to technical errors introduced during sample preparation and sequencing steps. In this study, we implemented a single unique molecular identifier (sUMI) approach to minimize sequencing artifacts and achieve an error rate of approximately 10-. This high-resolution method enabled precise quantification of quasi-species diversity from influenza virus populations isolated at the single-particle level. Comparative analyses revealed mutation frequencies well above background error levels, confirming that the observed variation was of biological origin. Furthermore, application of information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that the mutation distribution was non-random, suggesting the presence of selective constraints. Our findings establish a robust framework for studying intra-host viral evolution and provide critical insights that may enhance AI-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and support more effective influenza vaccine strategies.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Accordingly, aberrant RNA modification pathways contribute to a variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. However, recognition and catalytic mechanisms of most RNA-modifying proteins remain obscure, due to sparse structural data. Recently, the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of N3-methyl-cytosine (m3C) methyltransferase METTL6 revealed seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) as a cofactor for tRNASer selection, but left the cooperative role of SerRS and the reaction process undefined. Here, combining computer simulations and in vitro experiments, we define the mechanism of concerted substrate identification by METTL6 and SerRS, demonstrating that SerRS pre-organizes the tRNASer variable arm for METTL6 recruitment. We show that once METTL6 is stably docked onto the SerRS-tRNASer complex, thereby ensuring the precise alignment of the reactants, the methylation reaction proceeds spontaneously. Our results establish the catalytic mechanism of m3C methyltransferases and provide the foundation for rational design of targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

R.; Singh, R.

This limitation underscores the need for molecular and biotechnological strategies for its genetic improvement. Flowering, a key determinant of saffron yield, is strongly influenced by temperature; however, the genetic regulatory networks underlying this process remain poorly understood. Our study identifies key regulators of saffron's flowering, focusing on the Florigen Activation Complex (FAC) components: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), bZIP transcription factor FD, and TERMINAL FLOWER-1 (TFL-1), and demonstrate their temperature-dependent roles in floral regulation. Spatiotemporal expression analyses suggested that CsatFT3 and CsatFD2, expressed in the floral meristem promote floral induction, while CsatTFL1-3 acts as a floral repressor. Protein interaction studies showed that CsatFT3 and CsatTFL1-3 compete for binding to CsatFD2, and their balance modulates floral induction. Functional validation in Arabidopsis and Saffron confirmed these findings. Furthermore, we identified CsatSVP2, an ortholog of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), as a low temperature-responsive repressor that directly binds the CsatFT3 promoter to inhibit its expression. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of temperature mediated floral induction in saffron and provide insights and lay the groundwork for genetic interventions to enhance yield under variable temperature conditions.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

R.; Katz, D. B.", "abstract": "Gustatory cortical (GC) and basolateral amygdalar (BLA) taste responses consist of an inter-regionally coherent 3-part state sequence. This coherence suggests that reciprocal BLA-GC connectivity is important for taste processing, but it remains unknown: 1) whether BLA-GC coherence actually reflects a reciprocal \"conversation\" (as opposed to one region simply driving the other); and 2) whether such a \"conversation\" has anything to do with the taste processing observed within GC response dynamics. Here, we address these questions using network and single-neuron analysis of simultaneously-recorded GC and BLA taste responses in awake rats. We find asymmetric, reciprocal -frequency influences that reflect taste processing dynamics: BLA[-&gt;]GC influence dominates between 300 and 1000msec (the epoch in which BLA codes palatability); afterward, when GC responses become palatability-related and GC has been shown to release a behavior-relevant signal, the direction of influence reverses, becoming GC[-&gt;]BLA. Follow-up analyses demonstrate that this \"turn-taking\" exists alongside effectively synchronous amygdala-cortical coupling-the two regions functioning as a unified structure. Finally, to assess the implications of these interactions for single-neuron responses, we tested the response properties of GC neurons categorized by their inferred connectivity with BLA: GC neurons influenced by BLA produce stronger taste-specific and palatability-related responses than other GC neurons, and the strongest taste encoding is specifically found in GC neurons that both influence and receive influence from BLA-those most deeply embedded in the reciprocal circuit. These results, consistent with findings in multiple systems, support the novel conclusion that taste processing and decision-making is a function of the amygdala-cortical loop.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

They also often overlook recurrent structural features shared across multiple predictions of the same sequence. Although consensus approaches have proven effective in RNA sequence analysis and evolutionary studies, no existing tool applies these principles to evaluate ensembles of 3D models. This gap hampers the identification of native-like folds in computational predictions, particularly as AI-driven methods become increasingly prevalent. Results: This paper presents RNAtive, the first computational tool to apply consensus-derived secondary structures for reference-free evaluation of RNA 3D models. RNAtive aggregates recurrent base-pairing and stacking interactions across ensembles of predicted 3D structures to construct a consensus secondary structure. It introduces a novel conditionally weighted consensus mode that treats interaction networks as fuzzy sets and uniquely allows integration of user-defined 2D structural constraints, enabling evaluation guided by experimental data. Input RNA models are ranked using two adapted binary-classification-based scores. Benchmarking against CASP15 competition data shows that models consistent with the consensus exhibit native-like structural features. The RNAtive web server offers an intuitive platform for comparing and prioritizing RNA 3D predictions, providing a scalable solution to address the variability inherent in deep learning and fragment-assembly methods. By bridging consensus principles with 3D structural analysis, RNAtive advances the exploration of RNA conformational landscapes and has potential applications in fields like therapeutic RNA design.

In previous in vivo studies P. leucopus and M. musculus differed in the degree of sickness and profiles of biomarkers after exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4 agonist. As an approach for assessing immunity of mammals in nature and for longitudinal studies of colony animals in the laboratory, we evaluated using bulk and single cell RNA-seq primary dermal fibroblast cultures of P. leucopus and M. musculus in their short-term responses to a TLR2 agonist lipopeptide. By single cell RNA-seq cultures of both species comprised at least two types of fibroblasts, which were further differentiated in their responses to TLR agonists. With continued passage the mouse cell population lost viability, while the deermouse cell population spontaneously transformed into a cell line stably maintained under standard conditions. Bulk RNA-seq revealed distinctive profiles for deermouse and mouse cells in arginine metabolism gene expression, high baseline transcription of the antioxidant transcription factor Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) in deermouse fibroblasts, and the transcription of the aging-associated cytokine interleukin-11 in agonist-treated mouse fibroblasts but not deermouse fibroblasts. In both species' cultures there was increased transcription of several types of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and transposable elements (TE) after exposure to the agonist. The transcribed ERV/TE sequences in M. musculus cells were generally longer in length and with greater potential for translation than sequences in treated P. leucopus cells. The results indicate feasibility of this in vitro model for both laboratory- and field-based studies and that inherent differences between deermice and mice in cell-autonomous innate immune responses and ERV/TE activation can be demonstrated in dermal fibroblasts as well as the animals themselves.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Despite the diversity of cortical regions and thereby supported tasks, we identify two fundamental computations that explain neural activity across visual cortex: object and appearance-free motion recognition. Strikingly, a single objective underlies both: these inherent computations in the brain emerge from optimising for understanding world dynamics, and their arrangement is highly distributed and smooth across cortex rather than strictly aligning with the two visual streams.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern that demands effective patient monitoring to mitigate secondary complications and improve recovery. TBI increases the risk for neurodegeneration by destabilizing proteostasis that increases protein degradation and proteinopathy. Despite the clinical importance of noninvasive TBI biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), their mechanistic and cytological underpinnings remain poorly understood, hence are addressed here. Methods: Deep proteomic profiling of GFAP used mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of immunopurified GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) in TBI patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. A unique trauma culture model used human neocortical astrocytes for GFAP epitope mapping and GFAP-BDP compartmental localization. Immunofluorescence, protease inhibitors (calpeptin, ZVAD-FMK), and live protease reporters document GFAP proteolysis and citrullination in dye-uptake-identified membrane-wounded astrocytes. Temporal profiles of GFAP and GFAP-BDPs were measured in TBI patients CSF via calibrated, sub-saturated immunoblot densitometry. Fragment-specific prediction of six-month recovery used the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE). Results: GFAP-BDP sequence sets with mapped posttranslational modifications (PTMs, citrullinations and acetylations) were identified in TBI patients biofluids. Citrullinated GFAP profiles were distinct from unmodified GFAP in TBI patients CSF. Novel TBI-specific cleavage fragments differed from those of Alzheimers and Alexander diseases. Antibody mapping in the culture trauma model confirmed GFAP-BDPs, identified a new trauma cleavage region and revealed GFAP rod-domain harbored coil1-BDPs were selectively released into fluids, while coil2-BDPs remained as intracellular aggregates. Citrullinated coil2-BDPs formed non-filamentous aggregates in dystrophic astrocytes. Calpains and caspases contributed to trauma-generated GFAP-BDPs that were active in distinct astrocyte morphotypes and injury states. TBI patient GFAP proteolysis trajectories show that full-length GFAP and 45-49kDa fragments peaked acutely, then declined, whereas calpain-generated 37-39kDa BDPs remained elevated. Small GFAP-BDP-levels were imbalanced from expected proportions, with 20-26kDa products exceeding 15-19kDa products in CSF, consistent with preferential coil1-BDP release and coil2 retention shown in vitro. GFAP fragment profiles, but not those of uncleaved GFAP, predicted good versus poor outcome of TBI patients. Conclusion: These findings highlight the translational importance of novel proteomic GFAP proteolysis profiles that could serve in neurocritical care monitoring. GFAP use as fluid biomarker, tied to astroglial proteinopathy, is relevant to post-traumatic neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Triethylene glycol (TEG) has been documented as having microbicidal capabilities and has been proposed as one such mitigation strategy. Aerosolized TEG exhibits antimicrobial activity against airborne microorganisms; Grignard Pure Technology was developed to safely aerosolize TEG for decontamination of enclosed spaces. Here we show that this TEG formulation effectively inactivates airborne microorganisms, resulting in 2 to 4.5 net log reduction in concentration of viable bacteria, viruses, and mycobacteria within 30-60 minutes at TEG concentration (aerosol + vapor) of ~0.7 mg/m3, which is well within the range considered safe for humans. Our data also demonstrate that aerosolizing both the test organisms and the antimicrobial product provides a more accurate and relevant measure of the product's efficacy for indoor usage than traditional surface - or solution - based disinfection assays. Accurate evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy is a crucial step in adopting novel interventions and tools to control airborne pathogens that pose a public health risk. Our findings argue that testing protocols must match the intended use of any intervention. Given the safety concerns of aerosolizing human pathogens for direct testing of airborne infectious burden, we also advance an approach for selecting suitable surrogate microorganisms based on their phenotypic and biophysical similarity to corresponding pathogenic species.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that the presence and proportion of MoAM in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with SSc-ILD may be a biomarker of ILD severity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed BAL fluid from 9 prospectively enrolled patients with SSc-ILD and 13 healthy controls using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Patients with SSc-ILD had more MoAM and interstitial macrophages in BAL fluid than healthy controls, and their abundance was associated with lung fibrosis severity.

While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

This is because measuring colony-forming units (CFU), the standard assay to quantify inhibition, is slow, labour-intensive, costly, and can be unreliable at high drug concentrations. At subinhibitory concentrations, luminescence assays are widely used to quantify growth kinetics, but remain underexplored at super-MIC concentrations. To fill this gap, we compared luminescence- and CFU-based rates across 20 antimicrobials. In our experiments, luminescence- and CFU-based rates did not differ significantly for half of them. For the other half, CFU-based estimates of rates of decline were consistently higher. The estimates differed for two main reasons: First, because light intensity tracks biomass more closely than population size, luminescence declined more slowly than the population when bacteria filamented. Second, CFU-based estimates indicated a steeper decline when antimicrobial treatment reduced the number of colonies formed per plated bacterium. This effect can result from changes in clustering behaviour, physiological changes that impair culturability, or antimicrobial carry-over. Thus, the suitability of luminescence to quantify bacterial decline depends on the physiological effects of the antimicrobial used (e.g. filamentation) and whether the quantity of interest is cell number or biomass. Within these limitations, luminescence can serve as an efficient, high-throughput alternative for quantifying bacterial dynamics at super-MIC concentrations.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In many animals, social isolation increases aggression, courtship, locomotion, and feeding while disrupting sleep. This occurs when peripheral neurons detect social signals, such as pheromones, which activate decision-making circuits in the brain. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms of how chronic social isolation or enrichment alter gene expression and affect neuronal function and behavior remain unclear. In this study, we examined how transcription patterns and chromatin marks in male Drosophila brains change in response to social experience, and the effect of pheromone circuits and transcription factors involved in social circuit function. We focused on pheromone receptors Or47b and Or67d, as well as transcription factors FruM and DsxM. Our findings suggest that social experience affects multiple genes in the central brain. Disrupting Or47b, Or67d, FruM, and DsxM function moderated the transcriptional responses through antagonistic interactions. Specifically, Or47b circuits predominantly mediated transcriptional responses to social isolation through DsxM function, while Or67d and FruM regulated responses to group housing. Notably, mutants of fruM and dsxM exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes in the brain than Or mutants, especially for FruM/DsxM target genes. While social experience did not lead to detectable alterations in the overall chromatin profile in the whole brain, mutants of the four genes resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) compared to wild type. Furthermore, mutants in fruM and dsxM generally eliminated social experience-dependent changes in sleep and locomotion behaviors, whereas Or mutants exhibited more modest disruptions. Overall, our results uncover the pheromone circuits and transcriptional cascades in regulating molecular and behavioral responses to social experience.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

As the wall is extended due to turgor pressure, the wall mechanical response, specifically the walls elastic properties, are not well understood. In this study, we introduce a new surface morphology-based method to measure the elasticity of the cell wall in tip-growing cells. Previous work is based on the wall meridional outline on the assumption the cell is axisymmetric, an idea that does not align well with the reality of the cells. Instead, we developed a way to triangulate the surface of the cell using marker point locations that could be achieved experimentally with fluorescent labeling. After measuring the elastic stretch and curvatures from our triangulation, a mechanical model is used to measure the tensions and surface bulk modulus distribution. We simulated moss tip cells from experimental Physcomitrium patens plants to challenge the method with noise estimated from experiments. We discovered that increasing the discretization of the triangulation improved robustness against noise. With multiple cell sampling, we found that around 10 cells were sufficient to recover the elasticity distribution with noise, but only when the elastic stretches were high enough at the tip. With low elastic stretch at the tip, the appearance of non-physical modulus values led to underestimated inference values there, causing false-positive gradient results. This compelled us to study a range of cases, leading us to a dimensionless global phase map showing areas of good inference. This technique will open the field to more comprehensive measurements of tip cell elasticity, providing a key step in understanding tip cell growth and morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that despite large structural differences, three evolutionarily distinct viral systems (i.e. VSV M protein, SARS-CoV2 ORF 6, and KSHV ORF 10) share nearly identical single methionine-dependent functional dynamics related to the host cell inhibition of nuclear transport. This finding strongly supports a convergently-evolved common functional mechanism across viruses involving specific structural placement of non-polar residues like methionine and potentially providing a common therapeutic target for broad spectrum anti-viral treatment.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Theory of Mind (ToM) and discourse production deficits are well documented in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural basis of discourse-related ToM processes in ST remains unclear. This study investigated brain activation during narrative planning and production in individuals with schizotypal traits. Methods: Thirty young adults (mean age = 18.8 years) completed standardized assessments, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief Revised (SPQBR), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), depression (PHQ9), and dissociation (DESB). Participants performed a discourse task in an fMRI scanner, describing nine-panel cartoons requiring inference of character intentions. Behavioral discourse metrics included total and inferred events. fMRI analyses examined activation during planning and production phases, with SPQBR positive, negative, and disorganized traits entered as regressors. Results: Schizotypal traits correlated with multiple psychosocial risk factors, including elevated depression, ACEs, and dissociation (r = .48 .82, p < .01). During planning, canonical ToM/self-referential regions (vmPFC, precuneus, insula) were recruited. Positive traits correlated with increased activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and lingual gyrus, whereas disorganized traits were associated with reduced activation in the precuneus and lingual gyri. During production, networks spanning vmPFC, hippocampus, right TPJ, and basal ganglia were engaged. Negative traits correlated with increased motor/premotor activation, while disorganized traits correlated with reduced activation in lingual gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate distinct neural correlates of schizotypal traits during discourse planning and production, supporting models of schizophrenia spectrum risk emphasizing disrupted inference and integration processes.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Because of the practical and ethical challenges of performing human studies in space, researchers use ground-based analogs to study the hematological changes that occur upon exposure to microgravity. Understanding these changes is important for protecting astronauts during long spaceflights and for guiding medical treatment on Earth in cases of prolonged inactivity or bed rest. Methods The literature search was done in April 2025 in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane. The inclusion criteria are randomized or non-randomized controlled trials and experimental repeated-measures studies that enrolled humans exposed to simulated microgravity for at least 24 hours. This study followed PRISMA (2020) guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO under CRD420251104161. Data was analyzed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results Ten studies, involving 152 participants, met the inclusion criteria. During exposure, the first effect was a decreased plasma volume, leading to hemoconcentration. Erythropoietin concentration decreased, while parameters dependent on plasma volume, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count, falsely increased. Total hemoglobin mass and red cell volume showed a marked decrease, suggesting suppressed erythropoiesis. Iron status markers increased significantly, while classic hemolysis markers did not confirm increased hemolysis. Post-reambulation, erythropoietin rebounded, while the true decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count were revealed as hemoconcentration resolved. Conclusion Simulated microgravity induces hemoconcentration, erythropoietin suppression, and altered iron metabolism. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of hemolysis and to develop efficient countermeasures.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

K.; Yue, Z.; Ball, G.; Booth, A. J.; Tanaka, T. U.", "abstract": "For correct segregation of chromosomes in mitosis, they must efficiently and properly interact with the mitotic spindle during prometaphase. For this, the locations of chromosomes in the nucleus or relative to spindle poles are crucial - chromosomes at the nuclear periphery or behind spindle poles (polar regions) interact less efficiently with the mitotic spindle and show higher risks of missegregation in the subsequent anaphase. Nonetheless, the missegregation rate of such chromosomes is still relatively low in unperturbed normal cells. Thus, unknown mechanisms may mitigate the risks of their missegregation. We previously found that the actomyosin network (PANEM) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope during prophase, and its myosin-II-dependent contraction facilitates chromosome interaction with the mitotic spindle, shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). However, it remains unclear which chromosome interaction steps are facilitated or which chromosomes specifically benefit from it. Here, we show that the PANEM contraction directly pushes chromosomes located at the nuclear periphery inward immediately after NEBD. Tracking motions of individual kinetochores reveals that the PANEM contraction facilitates kinetochores initial interaction with spindle microtubules, but does not affect their subsequent poleward motion. The PANEM contraction also promotes the onset of their congression towards the spindle mid-plane, but does not affect congression itself once it starts. Furthermore, the PANEM contraction reduces the volume of polar regions, and helps reposition chromosomes from these regions and initiate their congression. Impaired PANEM contraction results in defective chromosome congression and frequent chromosome missegregation. In conclusion, shortly after NEBD, the PANEM contraction repositions chromosomes from unfavorable locations, i.e. the nuclear periphery and polar regions, to facilitate productive kinetochore-microtubule interaction and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the kinetics and mechanism of the MIC telomere elimination. Comparison of the MIC and MAC genome sequences indicated that the MIC telomeres are excised from chromosomes as part of larger MIC-limited sequences (MLSs) through chromosomal breakage. We confirmed this using an optimized oligo-FISH protocol and found that their elimination occurs in parallel with other programmed DNA elimination processes. CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of a MLS-associated Chromosome Breakage Sequence (CBS) showed that elimination of the MLS was not blocked but instead led to loss of adjacent MAC-destined sequence (MDS), suggesting abnormal co-elimination. In biparental crosses of the CBS mutant, however, both MLS and MDS were retained, DNA elimination was broadly disrupted, and no viable progeny were produced. These findings indicate that chromosome breakage at MLS-associated CBSs is essential for the proper separation of MLSs and MDSs, ensuring correct DNA elimination and successful sexual progeny development.

This was first made possible by fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) technology, which distinguishes specific cell cycle phases through the reciprocal degradation of fluorescently tagged, truncated forms of human CDT1 and GMNN proteins. Fucci genetic systems have been successfully implemented in transgenic mice, zebrafish, and axolotls. To date, no viable, stably expressing Fucci line has been developed in an avian species. Although a range of continuously improving Fucci constructs have been developed in recent years, existing in vivo Fucci models remain limited because they rely on older reporter technology that fails to distinguish cells in S, G2, and M phases or to label cells in early G1. As a result, these models can be challenging to interpret and their utility for continuous cell tracking and precise analysis of cell-cycle dynamics is limited. Here, we introduce FuChi, a multicistronic Fucci-expressing chicken line incorporating a newly optimised reporter construct comprising of an mCerulean-tagged Histone H1.0 linker protein fused via a self-cleaving 2A peptide to the tandem Fucci(CA) cell cycle biosensor, with additional epitope tags included for detection in fixed tissues. We show that this system accurately discriminates and tracks cells in G1, S, G2, and M phases both in vitro and in vivo, enabling faithful visualisation of cell cycle status in intact tissues and organs. Using FuChi embryos, we mapped proliferation dynamics across developing tissues, analysed cell cycle states of migrating cells, and performed live imaging of early embryos. These latter experiments revealed that transition from S phase may be a key morphogenetic event during gastrulation as mesendoderm cells egress from the primitive streak to form embryonic structures including the prechordal plate. Pairing this advanced reporter with the intrinsic experimental advantages of the chicken embryo, positions FuChi as a premier in vivo system for studying cell-cycle kinetics in development, delivering clear technological improvements over current Fucci models. FuChi chickens provide a powerful new resource for studying embryonic development, organ growth, tissue homeostasis, disease processes, and infection responses.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In this study we use passive acoustic monitoring coupled with human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence to analyse >12 months of soundscape recordings from 45 sites across five biogeographically independent regions to investigate the impact of active restoration on reef functioning. We trained and rigorously evaluated machine learning models to identify 34 biological sound types within this data, generating >912,000 high-confidence detections. These detections were used to infer four key functions across healthy, degraded, early-stage (<3 months) and mid-stage (32-53 months) restored reefs. Restoration significantly enhanced: (i) biological sounds at night, key to recruiting juvenile fish; (ii) diversity of biological sounds, an indicator of fish community diversity; and (iii) snapping shrimp activity, an indicator of bioturbation. However, effects varied by region, and audible parrotfish grazing, key to algal control and bioerosion, did not differ among habitat types in four of the five regions.

Using a 96-channel Utah electrode array implanted in the occipital cortex of a blind participant, we trained a deep neural network to predict single-trial evoked responses. The network was used in two complementary control strategies: a learned inverse network for real-time stimulation synthesis and a gradient-based optimizer for precise targeting of desired neural responses. Both approaches significantly outperformed conventional methods in controlling neural activity, required lower stimulation currents, and adapted stimulation parameters to resting state data, reliably evoking more stable percepts. Crucially, recorded neural responses better predicted perceptual outcomes than stimulation parameters alone, underscoring the value of our neural population control framework.

These models generalize remarkably well to new environments, but it is unclear how neural circuits acquire this flexibility.

These representations have been observed in different areas of the brain, for example, in the motor cortex of monkeys, which have been shown to reuse primitives in sequences. They enable compositional generalization, a mechanism that could explain the brain's adaptability, where independent modules representing different parts of the environment can be selected according to context. We trained an RNN to predict future frames in a visual environment defined by independent latent factors and their corresponding dynamics. We found that the network learned to solve this task by developing a compositional model. Specifically, it had disentangled representations of the static latent factors, and formed distinct, modular clusters, each implementing a single dynamic. The network autonomously selects which cluster to use according to the context, using competitive dynamics between clusters. This modular and disentangled architecture enabled the network to exhibit compositional generalization, accurately predicting outcomes in novel contexts composed of unseen combinations of dynamics.

In Arctic ecosystems, spring snowmelt sets the timing and duration of the snow-free period, thereby controlling food availability, while predation often imposes additional control on prey species. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic filters on distribution is also susceptible to vary with body size. Using 10-years of high-resolution data on all major members of an Arctic vertebrate community and their shared predator, we tested how snowmelt timing interacts with predation to shape species occurrence and community structure. Species occurrence declined with later snowmelt dates, with larger-bodied species being particularly constrained by short snow-free periods. Predation further modulated species occurrence, with responses varying according to body mass. Our findings highlight the combined influence of the phenology of food availability and predation as important filters shaping local community structure.

Yet how tissue structure changes with aging remains largely unknown. Current aging research primarily focuses on molecular changes, missing this structural dimension. Here, we present PathStAR, Pathology based Structural Aging Rate, the first computational framework that captures when and how tissue structure changes during aging from histopathology images. We applied it to 25,306 postmortem tissues covering 40 tissue types from individuals aged 21 - 70, connecting structural aging to molecular data, health records and genotype data. Without any training on chronological age, PathStAR captured non-linear functional decline of ovary, undetectable by bulk-molecular profiling. Applying it across 40 tissues, it revealed that structural aging occurs through discrete phases of rapid change (accelerated periods), with tissue-specific trajectories following three patterns: Early Aging Tissues (vascular system with major changes during the 30s), Late Aging Tissues (uterus and vagina with major changes during menopause (50s)) and Biphasic Aging Tissues (digestive, male reproductive tissues, and ovary with two periods of major changes). During these accelerated phases, most tissues exhibited shared aging hallmarks of inflammation and energy production decline, coupled with disruption of pathways governing their specialized functions. Cross-organ analysis revealed coordinated aging within organ systems and an unexpected link between digestive and male reproductive tissues. We next identified 123 germline variants associated with organ-specific accelerated structural aging, including SIRT6 variants linked to accelerated vascular decline. Finally, individuals with systemic autoimmune disease, as well as tissues with classical aging pathologies (atrophy, calcification, fibrosis), showed elevated structural aging scores.

While the mechanisms underlying toxin-mediated acute diarrhea are known, the molecular events involved in ETEC related sequelae remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) profoundly remodels intestinal epithelial composition and function through modulation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. Using human ileal enteroids, we demonstrate that LT stabilizes {beta}-catenin independently of WNT ligands, promotes its nuclear accumulation, and enhances TCF/LEF-driven transcription. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal that LT increases intestinal proliferation by enhancing cell cycle activity across all epithelial lineages, thus disrupting epithelial composition by expanding proliferative progenitor populations at the expense of absorptive enterocytes. Simultaneously, LT impairs epithelial maturation and suppresses transcriptional programs required for nutrient absorption and differentiation. Together, these findings identify LT as a potent driver of intestinal epithelial reprogramming, providing mechanistic insight into how ETEC infection may drive long-term consequences beyond acute diarrhea and may inform strategies to prevent major sequelae, including malnutrition, that affect millions of children worldwide.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In parallel, we performed an in vivo screen using >1,500 FDA-approved compounds and identified multiple novel small molecules that reduced inflammation and prevented LPS toxicity. We focused on the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, which was identified through both the in vivo and in silico analyses. We found that dabigatran co-administration significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and completely protected zebrafish from endotoxemic death due to LPS. Surprisingly, we found that this protection occurs in prothrombin mutant fish, proving that protection from endotoxemia occurs independently of the anticoagulant function of dabigatran. We additionally found that dabigatran administration significantly decreased nitric oxide production and apoptosis compared to LPS treatment alone, suggesting possible mechanisms by which protection from endotoxemia is achieved.

This study uncovers the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in driving female-specific AD pathology. Analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD cortical tissues and in vitro AD models reveal a notable increase and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of XIST, a phenomenon not previously observed in neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, altered EZH2 levels dampen the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the inactive X chromosome, disrupting epigenetic silencing. This dysregulation impacts the X-linked RNA export factor subunit THOC2, whose levels are also elevated in AD. Cytoplasmic XIST acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-186-5p, rescuing EZH2 and THOC2 transcripts. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains both nuclear epigenetic machinery and cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation by XIST. The miR-186/EZH2/THOC2/XIST axis offers a molecular framework for understanding the female-biased vulnerability in AD, linking XIST-driven epigenetic changes with nuclear RNA export pathways via cytoplasmic XIST. Disrupted EZH2-XIST interaction reduces H3K27me3 marks on the inactive X chromosome, while increased THOC2 promotes THOC2 (TREX) binding to XIST, maintaining the harmful feedback. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism through which XIST gets recruited to the nuclear export pathways in AD. These results position XIST as a key epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulator in female AD pathophysiology and suggest it could be a target for sex-specific therapeutic interventions.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/680468v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5bc27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33e57forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ff5faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14dff06_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Cold, hot, and variable temperatures may impede nestling songbird growth due to increased thermoregulatory costs and reduced food delivery by parents. At a broad scale, temperature effects on nestling growth vary across climatic zones, but how temperature effects vary with early-life developmental constraints imposed by the timing of thermoregulatory development, competition with siblings, and the amount of parental care has received less attention. We investigated whether the effect of temperature on the mass of wild barn swallow (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) nestlings (n = 113 nestlings, 31 nests) in Boulder County, CO depends on timing of exposure during development, relative size within the brood, or level of parental feeding. We found that the effect of minimum temperature differed in early and late development (before versus after putative development of thermoregulatory independence) and may be less pronounced for nestlings that received more parental feeding. We did not find evidence that the smallest nestling in the brood differs from other nestlings in vulnerability to temperature. These findings indicate the existence of fine-scale heterogeneity in which the effects of temperature on nestling development are sensitive to metabolic constraints and early-life social environment, providing key insight into the factors that may ameliorate or exacerbate climate impacts on individual birds.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Despite the maturation of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) methodologies, generating high-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions from micrographs is a time-intensive process involving iterative rounds of subjective data curation and hyperparameter optimization. Current approaches to particle classification are often unable to remove all low-quality particles from particle stacks, largely due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the high dimensionality of particle images, and the multiple degrees of freedom associated with each particle's unknown rotation, orientation, and class assignment.The retention of low-quality particles negatively affects the overall quality of the final EM density and continued efforts to eliminate their deleterious contributions are warranted. Here, we present ANTIDOTE (A Neural network Trained In Deleterious Object deTection and Elimination), a neural network framework that discriminates between constructive and deleterious particles using per-particle metadata generated during 3-D classification in RELION. Using benchmark and real-world cryoEM datasets, we demonstrate that ANTIDOTE paired with RELION 3-D classification achieves higher particle classification accuracy than conventional data processing approaches alone, yielding improvements in reconstruction quality, global and local resolution, and map interpretability while reducing time-consuming hyperparameter optimization. We additionally detail practical use-case scenarios for ANTIDOTE and demonstrate its versatility in increasing particle curation accuracy for high-quality cryoEM reconstruction.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Using resident-intruder assays in male and female Swiss Webster mice, we combined iDISCO+ c-Fos imaging with a weighted co-expression network analyses to identify mesoscale co-activation modules in aggressive (AGG) vs. non-aggressive (NON) animals. We performed a module preservation analysis between each phenotype within each sex followed by differential correlation to localize edge-level changes. Behaviorally, AGG mice spent more time attacking, while females showed greater social investigation. Network analyses revealed that NON networks often preserved density of AGG modules, but connectivity reorganized with aggression. In male AGGs there was large spread reorganization of numerous modules: a large sensorimotor-subcortical \"blue\" module, a pallidal/hypothalamic/brainstem \"yellow\" module, and a brainstem-heavy \"green\" module. Surprisingly the \"brown\" module, enriched for classic social-behavior regions was moderately preserved in male NONs. In females, the turquoise module spanning somatosensory/interoceptive cortex and midbrain regions and the \"brown\" sensory cortex-amygdala module were the least preserved. These results indicate that aggression recruits distributed mesoscale communities via edge-specific gain, with males displaying broad strengthening along a cortex/basal ganglia/ hypothalamus/brainstem axis and females showing more targeted potentiation within sensory/arousal modules.

Theoretical models suggest pathogens have important implications for plant populations and perhaps even limit plant ranges, though more empirical evidence is needed, especially in wild plant populations. In the field, we characterized the infection dynamics of phytoplasma, a vectored and sterilizing bacterial pathogen, in wild populations of white trillium and identified the bacterial strain and local vectors. We then leveraged community science data to reveal patterns and potential drivers of phytoplasma occurrence across the range of white trillium. Within populations, we found that phytoplasma infection presence was more likely in low host density plots, where insect vectors occupied a higher proportion of trillium, indicative of an encounter-dilution effect. Leafhoppers in the genus Empoasca are the likely vectors of Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni-related, group 16SrIII infections between trillium. Phytoplasma was widely distributed across trillium's range, even at range edges, and probability of infection was significantly reduced by hotter summer temperatures and increased by proximity to cropland.

The C9orf72 repeat expansion is bidirectionally transcribed into sense and anti-sense RNA foci, and also produces dipeptide repeats (DPRs) via a non-canonical translation mechanism known as repeat-associated (RAN) translation. Each of these components of the G4C2 repeat expansion cause neurodegenerative effects in animal models when expressed in neurons, but impacts from glial expression are more poorly understood. Here, we use glial cell type-specific expression of individual DPRs, of RNA repeat-only, or of the G4C2 repeat that is capable of producing both DPRs and RNA repeats to systematically investigate both the glial cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity of each of these components. Our results show that as with neurons, the GR and G4C2 transgenes, produce the highest degree of cell-intrinsic toxicity when expressed in glia. Both of these transgenes are capable of producing the GR DPR, which is also typically found to be the most toxic factor in neurons. We demonstrate that both the GR and G4C2 transgenes cause activation of mdg4, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). Such ERV expression is a hallmark of TDP-43 dysfunction that is commonly observed in C9orf72 patients and contributes to both cell intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity. We find that only the G4C2 transgene produces measurable non-cell autonomous effects that result in loss of nearby neurons. But manipulations of apoptosis reveal non-cell autonomous or systemic effects from either GR or G4C2 expressing glia. Blocking apoptotic cell death of either GR or G4C2 expressing glia via the p35 caspase inhibitor further exacerbates effects on lifespan and ablating such glia via expression of the proapoptotic reaper gene partially ameliorates these effects.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Movements during development are refined through the ongoing maturation of the spinal circuits that mediate them. In many vertebrates, including zebrafish, this maturation process involves neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine; however, the targets of this neuromodulation remain largely unknown. Recent work has revealed distinct developmental dynamics of the non-inactivating subthreshold potassium current, the M-current, in primary motoneurons of larval zebrafish. Considering that neuromodulators play a role in the maturation of locomotor control in larval zebrafish, we asked whether neuromodulators might target the M-current in primary motoneurons during development. Our patch-clamp experiments in primary motoneurons of zebrafish aged 3 to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) reveal distinct modulation of the M-current by serotonin and acetylcholine that is age-dependent. Our data demonstrates an inhibitory influence of serotonin signaling via 5HT1A receptors that promotes repetitive firing in primary motoneurons specifically at 3 dpf. We also show that acetylcholine, likely via M2/M4 receptors, enhances the M-current and limits repetitive firing in primary motoneurons but does so only after 3 dpf. Modulation of the M-current in primary motoneurons was not observed across all neuromodulators as dopamine had no effect at any age. Considering that the M-current transiently peaks at 3 dpf and is reduced at 4 and 5 dpf, our findings suggest that the developmental changes in this current can shape how neuromodulators modulate firing properties of primary motoneurons.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

A.; Hanks, T. D.; Edelman, C. L.; Carter, C. S.; Joiner, W. M.", "abstract": "When sampling visual information from the environment, humans execute fast sequential saccadic eye movements and yet preserve stability in their visual percept. This ability relies on the continuous integration of external sensory information (e.g., visual displacements) and internal monitoring signals. At the time of the saccade subjects often experience saccadic suppression of displacement--a failure to notice changes in the location of visual objects slightly shifted during the eye movement. Although well studied, questions remain regarding how and when external sensory signals lead to perceptual judgment alterations following saccadic eye movements. Here we used a drift diffusion modeling (DDM) framework to systematically examine the extent to which sensory information biased perceptual judgments when detecting trans-saccadic shifts of visual targets. Healthy human participants (N = 30, 21 female) completed a visual perception task in which a visual target was shifted following a prompted saccadic eye movement (4o or 8o). Target displacements occurred up to +/-2.5o along the horizontal axis, and participants reported the shift direction with a button press response. Incorporating the perceptual response and visual error between the displaced target and end-movement fixation location, the DDM accounted for the visuospatial biasing effects of sensory processing on decision-making. The modeling framework based on the visual error could also capture individual positive and negative biasing effects across backward shifts (i.e., towards the initial fixation location) and forward shifts (i.e., further away from initial fixation). Furthermore, participants whose perceptual bias was more pronounced in either the backward or forward directions tended to show a greater visuospatial offset in evidence accumulation preceding perceptual judgments due to an overreliance on the visual error information. The DDM computational modeling approach described here shows promise as an explanatory framework to account for sensorimotor integration impairments based on perceptual deficits demonstrated in certain patient populations.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

This study aims to test the hypothesis that the increased rate of mutation accumulation could have led to exceptionally high levels of intraspecific polymorphism in Balanophoraceae. To this end, we studied the plastid genomes of 7 samples of the species Rhopalocnemis phalloides. Although all 7 plastid genomes possessed the same genes arranged in the same order, the level of polymorphism was indeed extremely high, possibly the highest among all known genomes of any living organisms.

A.; Kaplan, T.; Hoffmann, S.; Boemmel, A. v.", "abstract": "Methylation-based epigenetic clocks are among the most accurate tools for predicting chronological age. Although DNA methylation (DNAm) at genomic CpG sites is linked to various regulatory mechanisms, the biological interpretability of epigenetic clocks remains surprisingly limited. One primary mechanism by which DNAm is thought to influence gene regulation is by modulating transcription factor binding activity. In this study, we examine established epigenetic clocks to assess the regulatory potential of their predictive CpGs during the aging process. Our analysis reveals that generally most CpG sites used by epigenetic clocks do not overlap known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), indicating that changes in TFBS dynamics may not account for prediction accuracy of these models. On the other hand, by identifying age-associated CpGs that overlap TFBSs, we identified transcription factors that may be involved in the aging process. Specifically, the TFBSs of ZBED1, NFE2, CEBPB, FOXP1, EGR1, SP1, PAX5, and MAZ were particularly enriched for age-associated CpGs, while RBPJ, NFIC, RELA, IKZF1, STAT3, and USF2 were significantly protected against methylation changes. By focusing on TFBS-associated CpGs, combined with additional feature selection and engineering steps, we developed an alternative, TFMethyl Clock model, outperforming several existing approaches. Target genes of model-selected, age-predictive CpGs are enriched in the interleukin-1{beta} production and long-chain fatty acid metabolism pathways. In contrast, these CpGs themselves are enriched mainly at binding sites of NR2C2 TF. Furthermore, approximately three-fourths of the target genes downstream of age-predictive CpGs exhibit significant age-related changes, suggesting that our approach captures deeper insights into possible methylation-driven biological aging processes. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating regulatory loci into the design of epigenetic predictors may provide mechanistic insights into the aging process while maintaining or even improving the predictive power.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Hard X-ray imaging, with its ability to penetrate samples several tens of micrometers thick, offers a complementary approach for high-resolution visualization. A major concern is whether cryo-preserved samples can withstand the handling conditions at synchrotron facilities without excessive icing or devitrification, and whether the radiation exposure during X-ray imaging compromises specimen integrity, thereby hindering subsequent attempts to achieve high-resolution 3D reconstructions via cryo-EM. To evaluate this, we deposited apoferritin samples on a cryo-EM grid, exposed them to varied X-ray doses typical for X-ray tomography experiments at a synchrotron facility, and subsequently analyzed the exposed particles by cryo-EM. Despite the apparent damage sustained throughout the experiment, the samples remained amenable to cryo-EM analysis, with structural details at a resolution of ~4 Angstrom at the highest applied X-ray dose of 100 MGy. By comparison, a similar cryo-EM dataset of the apoferritin particles that were not exposed to X-rays, but were mounted on the same cryo-EM grid, resulted in a 3D reconstruction at 3.1 Angstrom resolution. Thus, while radiation damage may limit the high-resolution information in specimens processed by cryo-X-ray tomography, the cryo-preserved biological material exposed to these high X-ray doses can be still used for subsequent cryo-EM workflows aiming to obtain structural biology insights and intermediate to high resolution. These findings lay the groundwork for an integrated imaging workflow that combines X-ray and cryo-EM techniques to enable multiscale analysis of thick vitrified biological specimens.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Using chimeric eCLIP in CRISPR-edited IMD1+/+, LIMD1+/-, and LIMD1-/- human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs), we reveal a transcriptome-wide dependency on LIMD1, an AGO2 adaptor, for effective miRNA targeting and repression. In LIMD1-deficient cells, miRNA loading is uncoupled from productive targeting: despite increased AGO2-miRNA interactions, complexes engage fewer transcripts and sites, reducing occupancy and more than halving both the breadth and depth of targeting. We also observe altered AGO2 positional footprints across targets in LIMD1 deficient cells. LIMD1 dependence is most pronounced at defined RNA contexts: weak (GC-poor) seed pairings, interactions involving evolutionarily young miRNAs or sites that nonetheless form thermodynamically stable duplexes, with these losses particularly enriched in coding sequences of rapidly evolving C2H2-zinc-finger genes. Even within canonical seed repertoires of individual AGO2-miRNAs, LIMD1 is most critical at poorly conserved sites, indicating that LIMD1 broadens miRNA regulation beyond ancient, deeply conserved targets. In culture, LIMD1 deficiency de-represses oncogenic proteins that, in vivo, inversely correlate with LIMD1 levels in normal lung and adenocarcinoma, where LIMD1 is characteristically reduced, and whose dysregulation predicts poor survival. Thus, LIMD1 emerges as a key determinant of miRISC architecture, targeting, and potency, challenging RNA-centric models of miRNA function and exemplifying how adaptor proteins diversify post-transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Grosell, M.; del Campo, J.", "abstract": "Marine fish play a significant yet understudied role in the oceanic carbon cycle through the production of magnesium rich calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitates known as ichthyocarbonates. These deposits form in the gut of marine teleost fish in response to salinity, serving as part of their osmoregulation strategy. Through this, marine fish may contribute as much as 9.04 Pg of CaCO3 per year in global new carbonate production, being equivalent to or potentially higher than the production by coccolithophores and pelagic foraminifera. Despite their ecological relevance, the biological mechanisms driving ichthyocarbonate precipitation remain to be fully resolved. Intriguingly, bacteria are consistently found in intimate association with ichthyocarbonate precipitates. Given the widespread capacity of prokaryotes to mediate CaCO precipitation, this association points to a previously unexplored microbial contribution to the process. To investigate the potential role of bacteria in ichthyocarbonate production, we subjected Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) to a salinity challenge common to their native range and known to elicit elevated CaCO3 precipitation. To assess the respective contributions of the host and its microbiota to ichthyocarbonate formation in the gut, we characterized the microbiome across the toadfish gut and performed meta-transcriptomic analysis. Across the toadfish gut, we identify a high abundance of vibrios associated with ichthyocarbonates with the metabolic potential for CaCO3 precipitation. Specifically, we observe the expression of the transcriptional activator of urease (ureR) by Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae, which can induce the precipitation of CaCO3 via the production of bicarbonate. We demonstrate that CaCO precipitation in marine fish may not solely be a host-driven process, but potentially the result of a functional symbiosis with gut-associated Vibrio bacteria. We hypothesize that just as photosymbionts enable corals to build reefs, fish hosts along with their microbial partners may synergistically contribute to oceanic carbonate production. This discovery, if confirmed, expands the role of symbiosis in marine biomineralization and underscores its broader influence on global biogeochemical cycles.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We applied stringent statistical hypothesis for detecting enrichment and enrichment-adjusted Minimal Estimate of Mutation Load (MEML) in trinucleotide motifs preferred by known mutagenic processes. We found that several mutational motifs previously identified in human cancers are readily detected in cancer-free tissues. Samples enriched with C to T mutations in nCg motif associated with clock-like spontaneous deamination of meCpG were detected across all tissues. We revealed another ubiquitous clock-like motif in several tissue types - T to C substitutions in aTn motif previously associated with exposure to small epoxides and other SN2 electrophiles. Analyses of UV-associated yCn motif and its sub-motifs, as well as a minor UV-motif nTt revealed UV-mutagenesis only in skin. APOBEC-induced C to T and C to G mutations in tCw motif were enriched in bladder, lung, small intestine, liver, and breast with preference for APOBEC3A-like mutagenesis in most. Non-cancerous diseased samples showed significantly higher, age-independent accumulation of the clock-like motifs aTn and nCg compared to healthy tissues. Together, our analyses elucidated several ongoing mutagenic processes in normal human tissues and provided a robust analytical framework for identifying mutagenic sources from low-burden mutation catalogues.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Despite their crucial regulatory roles, microRNAs (miRNAs) face a significant curation bottleneck, with only 1,400 articles manually curated to the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase over a decade. We present GOFlowLLM, an automated curation pipeline powered by reasoning-enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) that follows established GO curation flowcharts to extract and structure miRNA-mediated gene silencing data at scale. When evaluated on existing curation, GOFlowLLM selects the correct GO term in 90% of cases. Curators also agree with 95% of the system's reasoning steps and 90% of the evidence selected. Applied to 6,996 previously uncurated articles, our system identified 2,538 new candidate GO annotations on 1,785 articles in just 58 hours - potentially doubling the available miRNA GO curation. Manual review of a subset of these annotations shows that curators agreed with the selected term in 87% of cases, the model's reasoning in 92% of cases, and the extracted evidence in 93%. GOFlowLLM demonstrates how LLMs can significantly accelerate biocuration while maintaining high-quality standards by following expert-designed reasoning frameworks. The integration of reasoning traces in our system provides transparent justification for annotations that can be reviewed by human curators, addressing one of the key challenges in adopting AI for scientific curation, potentially transforming how we manage the growing corpus of scientific knowledge in molecular biology.

A.", "abstract": "With repeated exposure to addictive drugs, there is a shift from drug abuse to drug addiction that is mediated by the transition from goal-directed to habitual control. It is well known that the development of habitual control over behavior relies upon cell-type-specific synaptic changes in both D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in dorsal striatum. Specifically, habitual behavior is mediated by increased synaptic strength in D2 MSNs in dorsolateral striatum (DLS), suggesting similar cell-type-specific synaptic changes may underlie the development of habitual cocaine-seeking behavior. However, cell-type-specific synaptic changes have not been evaluated in DLS in this context. Therefore, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine in a cocaine self-administration paradigm that allows for differentiation of goal-directed vs. habitual cocaine-seeking behavior. Moreover, we used a viral vector under a D2-specific promoter to fluorescently label D2 MSNs with eYFP in DLS. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were used to determine AMPA:NMDA receptor ratio and the rectification index. Surprisingly, we did not observe any significant differences in these measures in DLS of cocaine-seeking rats, regardless of whether cocaine seeking was under habitual control. Interestingly, preliminary observations revealed significant changes in the paired pulse ratio (PPR), suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms may be involved in the development of habitual control over cocaine seeking. Overall, however, these results suggest there are no changes in postsynaptic strength of D2 MSNs in the DLS of rats with an extended history of cocaine self-administration and regardless of whether the cocaine seeking is under goal-directed or habitual control.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

To investigate microglial contributions to AD development prior to overt plaque deposition, we developed an open-source morphometric pipeline to systematically quantify hippocampal microglial structure and activation states in pre-plaque 5xFAD mice. Across ~11,000 cells, we extracted multidimensional parameters including area, circularity, convex hull, branch points, nearest-neighbor distance, and nuclear features, alongside Iba1 and CD68 intensity measurements. While no significant overt gliosis was observed at this early stage, microglia from 5xFAD mice exhibited subtle trends toward increased structural complexity compared to wild-type controls. Importantly, significant sex-specific differences were detected within the CA1 subregion: male 5xFAD microglia displayed hyper-ramified morphologies consistent with enhanced surveillance states, whereas female microglia demonstrated greater density and a more reactive phenotype. Correlation analyses revealed a conserved association between microglial complexity and Iba1/CD68 expression, independent of sex or genotype, underscoring a fundamental link between cytoskeletal remodeling and phagolysosomal activity. These findings highlight the capacity of morphometric profiling to sensitively detect early, region-specific, and sex-dependent shifts in microglial phenotype before amyloid deposition. By integrating quantitative morphology with canonical molecular markers, this framework provides a robust and unbiased approach for characterizing microglial activation trajectories.

A major barrier to understanding the pathophysiology of XDP has been the lack of relevant animal models. Here, we introduce a novel conditional humanized XDP mouse model harboring a hybrid mouse-human Taf1/TAF1 gene (hyTAF1) containing the pathogenic SVA_F insertion. We activated the hyTAF1 in Nestin+ neural progenitor cells and found that the resulting XDP male mice recapitulate features of the human disease including severe motor impairment, striatal atrophy, and reactive gliosis. Transcriptomic, histological, and electron microscopy analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and widespread myelin disruption. Consistent with these findings, postmortem brain tissue from XDP patients revealed similar myelin pathology, including near-complete loss of myelin in parts of the medial prefrontal cortex.

Here, we genomically rewrote a portion of the mouse Taf1 allele with the corresponding 78-kb human TAF1 allele derived from an XDP patient. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the presence of the intronic SVAs, rather than the hybrid gene structure reduces hyTAF1 levels.

MVdeltaC exhibited potent oncolytic activity in a broad panel of human tumor cell lines, with a vast majority of them showing high sensitivity. This enhanced efficacy is dependent on RIG-I stimulation, mainly through the generation of defective viral genomes, which trigger apoptosis, robust IFN-I signaling and massive CXCL10 production. MVdeltaC infection induced immunogenic cell death, the release of danger signals, and the maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo, MVdeltaC significantly reduced tumor burden in xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Intratumoral MVdeltaC administration in immunocompetent A/J mice grafted with syngeneic neuroblastoma led to complete tumor rejection in 90% of animals and long-term antitumor memory. Efficacy was dependent on CD8+ T and NK cells and was further enhanced by anti-CTLA-4 treatment or CD4+ T cell depletion. Prior measles immunization accelerated tumor clearance, indicating memory-boosted antitumor responses.

Although FA maturation and organization have been extensively studied, it remains unclear how regulatory proteins influence the 3D architecture of FAs. Here, we show that loss of the vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) impairs adhesion dynamics. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of VASP and/or the mechanosensitive adaptor protein zyxin to investigate their respective roles in actin adhesion coupling. Loss of VASP and zyxin correlates with altered FA morphology and impaired dynamics. Using cryo electron tomography (cryo ET), we resolved the polarity of individual actin filaments associated with FAs and identified a contractility related actin layer enriched with tropomyosin. VASP and zyxin are required for the assembly of dense and aligned actin bundles with uniform polarity, oriented with their barbed ends towards the cell edge. In contrast, the tropomyosin decorated dorsal actin layer remains unaffected by these perturbations.

We introduce FLEX (Fast, LD-aware Estimation of eXome-wide and gene-level heritability), a scalable and flexible framework for estimating and partitioning heritability across genes or sets of genes using WES data. FLEX integrates all coding variants--from common to ultra-rare--within a unified model and corrects for LD-induced effects to improve the accuracy of heritability estimates. In addition, FLEX supports both individual-level and summary statistic data and is computationally efficient for biobank-scale datasets. Through extensive simulations, we show that FLEX is well-calibrated while providing accurate heritability estimates. We applied FLEX to WES data across N = 153, 351 unrelated European ancestry individuals and 20 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank. We identified 64 gene-trait pairs with significant gene-level heritability (p < 0.05/18, 624 accounting for the number of protein-coding genes tested), among which rare coding variants explained 38% of gene-level heritability, on average. Compared to heritability estimates from genome-wide imputed SNPs, incorporation of rare and ultra-rare coding variants led to a 24.8% increase in heritability on average, while effect sizes at rare and ultra-rare variants are substantially larger ({approx}18x on average). Partitioning across variant effect annotations, we find that predicted loss-of-function variants had stronger individual effects than missense variants (24% on average) while missense variants accounted for a greater share of rare coding heritability.

Despite this long history, available therapeutic methods, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, fail to control seizures in over 10% of patients. At the same time, there exists a diversity of theories regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying epilepsy. Understanding the biophysical basis of the simplest manifestation of epileptic activity, the paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS), could therefore be highly valuable. Prevailing ideas consider PDS as exaggerated synaptic excitatory potentials, but experimental evidence shows that PDS can be generated in isolated neurons devoid of synaptic input. Ulrich Altrup proposed an alternative view, suggesting that PDS represent aberrantly large pacemaker potentials rather than giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Theoretical work by Hernandez-Caceres and Brenes supported this concept, demonstrating a bifurcation-like transformation from physiological pacemaker potentials to PDS and finally to long-duration sustained depolarizations. According to Altrup's membrane pollution hypothesis (MPH), epileptic activity emerges as a consequence of incorporating amphiphilic pollutants into neuronal membranes, which leads to an increase in membrane micro-viscosity. Using a biophysically sound model for pacemaker activity, we explored the possibility of eliciting PDS through increased membrane micro-viscosity. Provided results suggest that this is theoretically plausible. Further experimental and theoretical research is needed to refine details of the MPH and to develop new strategies for combating epilepsy.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Understanding the evolution of traits influencing ontogeny is challenging because their fitness effects unfold across an individuals lifetime and may differ between classes such as sexes. Here, we analyze selection on non-plastic traits (e.g., fixed resource allocation strategies) that determine the development of dynamical states throughout life (e.g., body size), with consequences for fecundity and survival in age- and class-structured populations. Using invasion analysis, we derive expressions for directional and quadratic selection that decompose into age- and class-specific components. This allows us to identify convergence stable trait values, assess whether they are uninvadable or potentially experience evolutionary branching, and pinpoint the age and class pathways through which correlational and disruptive selection act. Applying our results to a model of growth under size-mediated sexual selection, we show how developmental trade-offs and sex-specific constraints can generate disruptive selection on male growth and favour the evolution of alternative male life histories. More broadly, our results highlight how adaptation is mediated by the interaction of development and demography, and provide tools to investigate how conflicts across ages and classes influence senescence, sexual dimorphism, and the diversification of ontogenetic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

This study was focused on Rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression of several solid tumor types including, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thyroid carcinomas, and luminal breast cancer subtypes. FDA-approved selective RET inhibitors, pralsetinib and selpercatinib, have demonstrated potent intracranial activity in brain metastases from NSCLC and thyroid cancer; however, their efficacy in BCBM has not been investigated. Here, we report that RET activation is elevated in brain metastases of breast cancer patients compared to matched primary tumors (N=30), and in three brain-tropic breast cancer cell lines compared to the parental lines. High RET pathway activation is associated with shorter overall metastasis-free survival and brain metastasis-free survival in patients with HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Using isogenic TNBC cells lines RET overexpression, we demonstrated that RET strongly promotes their preferential metastasis to the brain in mice with intracardiac injections to tumors cells. Using intracranial tumor implantation of the isogenic lines, we further found that RET significantly enhances the formation and progression of brain tumors in vivo. Moreover, we report that selective RET inhibition using pralsetinib and selpercatinib significantly reduces cell viability, enhances apoptosis, and attenuates migration of brain-tropic breast cancer cells in vitro. Using two mouse studies that model multi-organ metastases and breast tumor formation in the brain, we observed that RET inhibition significantly prevented the circulating tumor cells from forming brain metastases and suppressed the growth of intracranially implanted tumor cells, but did not significantly inhibit the progression of well-established brain metastases. Together, our findings demonstrated that RET is highly activated in BCBM and functioning as a novel mediator of BCBM, and that RET plays a new role as a viable therapeutic target for BCBM.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Detecting adverse health effects of drugs and other chemicals early during chemical/drug development saves significant time and resources. Freshwater planarians are an emerging invertebrate model for rapid, cost-effective neurotoxicity screening. Because planarians exhibit seizure-like behavior when exposed to chemicals that cause seizures in mammals, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and picrotoxin, they could be a useful first-tier model for seizure screening and thus reduce the need for slow and expensive mammalian tests. However, planarian seizure studies to date have been low-throughput and lacking the necessary standardization and automation to make this model a viable screening solution. Here, we present results from medium-throughput behavioral testing conducted in 48-well plates using two popular models for planarian pharmacological and toxicological studies: Dugesia japonica and Dugesia dorotocephala. Planarian behavior was scored using automated image analysis, measuring both translational behavior and body shape changes. We found that known seizurogenic compounds in mammals (NMDA, nicotine, picrotoxin, pilocarpine, and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)) induced seizure-like behavior in both planarian species within 30 min of exposure. We also tested three pesticides (parathion, carbaryl, and permethrin). Parathion and carbaryl, but not permethrin, caused planarian seizure-like activity. While the planarian species responded similarly to most compounds, some compounds showed potency differences of 10-100-fold (pilocarpine and nicotine, respectively). D. dorotocephala planarians were generally more sensitive, but D. japonica planarians displayed more reproducible behaviors. By standardizing both experimental approach and analysis methods and making them available, this work can serve as a framework for future testing of chemicals for seizurogenic potential in planarians.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Direct mechanistic evidence from human-relevant models remains limited. To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 {micro}M, 9 at 50 {micro}M, and 16 at 100 {micro}M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Schleifer, C. H.; Kushan-Wells, L.; Miranda, B. A.; Bondy, E.; Mathews, P. J.; Bearden, C. E.", "abstract": "Background: Individuals with copy number variants (CNVs) at 22q11.2 are at elevated risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. For psychosis, effects diverge, with 22q11.2 deletion (22qDel) conferring one of the highest known risks for schizophrenia, while duplication (22qDup) may be protective. Prior investigations of neurobiological mechanisms in 22q11.2 CNVs have predominantly focused on the cerebrum, whereas the cerebellum--a region increasingly recognized for its contributions to cognitive, affective, and social processes--remains underexplored and represents a promising target for investigation. Although alterations in cerebellar structure have been reported in 22qDel, they remain largely unexplored in 22qDup. This study provides the first characterization of regional cerebellar volumes in 22qDup and the first direct comparison of cerebellar structure across 22q11.2 CNVs, offering a unique opportunity to identify shared and distinct neurobiological mechanisms with implications for understanding cerebellar contributions to brain-behavior relationships in CNV carriers. Methods: We analyzed 514 longitudinally collected structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 111 individuals with 22qDel, 37 individuals with 22qDup, and 167 typically developing (TD) controls. Total and regional cerebellar volumes were quantified using ACAPULCO, a deep-learning-based parcellation method that segments the cerebellum into 28 subregions. Group differences in cerebellar volumes, as well as their associations with cognition, autism-related traits, and psychosis-risk symptoms, were examined using linear mixed-effects models. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to control for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Results: In relation to TD controls, cerebellar volumes were broadly reduced in 22qDel, whereas cerebellar alterations in 22qDup were more modest and variable. Regional analyses revealed both linear (22qDel < TD < 22qDup) and nonlinear (22qDel {approx} 22qDup < TD; 22qDel < 22qDup < TD) gene-dosage patterns, though not all reached significance. Vermis VII was significantly reduced in both CNVs but showed no relationship to behavioral differences. In contrast, reduction of Right Lobule VIIIA was associated with greater social impairment in 22qDup. Unlike TD controls, this region was not associated with IQ in 22qDup, suggesting CNV-specific alterations in cerebellar-behavior relationships. Conclusion: These findings indicate that reciprocal CNVs at the 22q11.2 locus both affect cerebellar structure, yet their functional consequences diverge, suggesting overlapping but distinct pathways to clinical risk. They underscore the cerebellum's multifaceted role in neurodevelopment and highlight the need for studies examining broader cognitive and socio-affective domains, as well as cerebellar-cortical connectivity, to clarify links to clinical outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Using Yersinia pseudotuberculosis as a model, we performed in vivo spatial transcriptomics to investigate bacterial gene expression as it translocates from cecal lumen to associated lymphoid tissue in the mouse intestine. By optimizing bacterial RNA enrichment, we achieved near-complete transcriptome coverage and identified compartment-specific transcriptional profiles. Bacteria in lymphoid tissue exhibited elevated expression of virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS) genes and markers of increased replication, alongside a higher plasmid copy number. Oxygen availability emerged as an environmental cue for T3SS induction. Importantly, we discovered a role for the non-coding 6S RNA in accelerating virulence gene expression. Tissue-localized bacteria had significantly upregulated 6S RNA levels, and deletion of the ssrS gene encoding 6S RNA impaired T3SS gene expression and effector secretion. Further, spatial analyses of bacterial gene expression in foci of infected lymphoid tissue revealed heterogeneous expression patterns with significantly elevated expression of T3SS and 6S RNA in bacteria located close to surrounding phagocytes. Together these findings demonstrate that Y. pseudotuberculosis undergoes rapid transcriptional reprogramming upon epithelial barrier crossing coordinated by environmental sensing, where 6S RNA accelerates tissue colonization by promoting efficient expression of T3SS.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Results showed that interactions between the two opportunistic pathogens were influenced by media nutrient availability, and that the presence of C. albicans in a culture reduces the effectiveness of certain antibiotics against GBS in vitro. This study also utilized a larval zebrafish model to investigate differences in virulence in solo infections vs co-infections with both pathogens in vivo. Co-infections of GBS and C. albicans into the otic vesicle were found to have increased virulence compared to solo infections of either pathogen. Co-infection also led to an increased GBS burden compared to solo GBS infections. Co-infections of GBS and C. albicans by yolk sac injection were not more virulent than solo infections with either pathogen. However, the antibiotic clindamycin was less effective in preventing mortality in co-infections compared to solo GBS infections. Overall, these findings highlight how interactions between GBS and C. albicans can influence treatment effectiveness and virulence during infection.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the development of a complex synthetic community model of the subgingival microbiome, designed for systematic interrogation of ecological factors that drive community restructuring. The model includes 22 prevalent and abundant subgingival species maintained in mucin-rich medium under microaerophilic, continuous culture conditions, in a chemostat. Using this system, we interrogated the impact of serum, as a surrogate for the inflammatory exudate, on community structure and function. Through integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we found that serum was not required for a community with a periodontitis-like configuration to establish, but its presence intensified features of dysbiosis. Serum increased total biomass, promoted polymicrobial aggregate formation, promoted nitrogen and protein metabolism thereby modifying the environmental pH towards alkalinity, and introduced nitrosative stress. Serum also modified the community metatranscriptome in ways that paralleled microbiome activities in human periodontitis. Serum, however, decreased community diversity by disproportionally conferring a competitive advantage to the pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. This synthetic community model has revealed serum as a key nutritional pressure that modulates subgingival microbiome ecology and may perpetuate dysbiosis.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

However, challenges in contrast multiplexing and high-resolution isotropic three-dimensional (3D) imaging hinder the non-invasive, simultaneous assessment of nucleolar activity and subcellular metabolic maps across different tissue contexts, especially in complex 3D environments. To fully harness the nucleolus's potential as a biomarker and diagnostic target, we present a multimodal imaging platform that combines third harmonic generation (THG) imaging with metabolic autofluorescence of NAD(P)H and FAD to study structural and metabolic nucleolar dynamics. Enabled by a high-power multimode fiber source and an axial deblurring network, we achieved 400 nm isotropic resolution in deep 3D imaging and confirmed the high accuracy of our method for label-free nucleolus identification using co-registered immunostaining and electron microscopy. To establish the biological relevance of our approach, we demonstrate that nucleolar stress leads to an unexpected depletion of NADH across cellular compartments. Furthermore, in the human endometrium-where nucleolar dynamics are central to the tissue's response to progesterone-our label-free imaging strategy delineated endometrial structures in freshly excised tissues and revealed that progesterone treatment induces distinct changes in nucleolar translocation and metabolic adaptation in organoids derived from diseased patients compared to controls. This capacity to non-invasively visualize and quantify features of the nucleolus and its local metabolic microenvironment at single-cell resolution in human tissues-and dynamically track these changes over time in patient-derived organoids-provides a powerful tool for uncovering the roles of the nucleolus in development, disease progression, and therapeutic response.

Under heme-deficient conditions, HRI dissociates from heme, becomes activated, and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing HRI activation remain incompletely understood. In this study, we delineate part of the regulatory mechanism involving autophosphorylation-dependent activation and heme-mediated deactivation of HRI. HRI formed a dimer in solution through its N-terminal domain, irrespective of its phosphorylation state. However, a mutant with deletion of the N-terminal domain retained autophosphorylation activity, indicating that N-terminal domain-mediated dimerization is not essential for activation. Phosphorylated HRI formed a stable complex with eIF2, whereas the dephosphorylated form failed to bind, indicating that autophosphorylation is required for eIF2 recognition. Biochemical analyses, together with modeling based on the predicted structure, revealed that the phosphate groups of Thr488 and Thr493 interact with adjacent basic residues. These interactions enhance eIF2 recognition and phosphorylation. Additionally, heme-induced deactivation selectively targeted the dephosphorylated kinase domain and suppressed autophosphorylation.

In turn, for the configuration with a higher concentration and higher density solution above the membrane (B) and a sufficiently large initial concentration quotient on the membrane, greater than 50, current pulsations are observed over time, resulting from hydrodynamic instabilities occurring in the vicinity of the membrane. The increase of initial concentration quotient on the membrane in configuration B causes an increase in the frequency of current pulsations and a change in their amplitudes over time. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between the types of the temporal changes in membrane currents in both configurations, and these differences persisted even 24 hours after turning off mechanical stirring of solutions.

Although genomic and transcriptomic aberrations correlate with lineage plasticity, the absence of pan-cancer markers to rapidly identify plastic subtypes has limited their predictive utility. Homeobox (HOX) genes encode transcription factors that define tissue identity through distinct expression patterns, or HOX codes, in specific lineages. By analyzing multi-omics data, including 39 HOX genes from over 80,000 RNA-seq samples across 114 cancer types, we discovered that HOX code expression robustly represents cancer cell lineages and revealed multiple previously unrecognized lineage-plastic subtypes in prostate cancer, lung cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), each displaying altered HOX patterns compared to non-plastic subtypes. Differential expression analysis further identified RUNX1T1 as a novel and consistent marker of plasticity, elevated across all three cancer types and correlating with HOX code and lineage-plastic marker genes. Importantly, we not only validated these correlations in bulk and single-cell RNA-seq from extensive preclinical and clinical cohorts, but also provided direct functional evidence that RUNX1T1 is required for lineage-plastic programs in prostate cancer cell lines. Using AI-based modeling, we identified NCOR/HDAC as RUNX1T1 binding partners, forming a co-repressor complex that regulates HOX codes and plasticity. Finally, we demonstrated that pharmacologic HDAC inhibition selectively suppresses the growth of plastic cells, establishing a novel therapeutic vulnerability.

METHODS 30 individuals meeting AUD criteria and reporting heavy alcohol consumption on timeline follow-back (TLFB) participated. Subjects completed a validated ISA task wherein pictures depicting inherently appetitive, aversive, or emotionally neutral content are shown along with pictures that are less evocative but are predictive of reward (candy) delivery and (in this study) also alcohol images. To capture individual variations in ISA, a picture-elicited neural response that scales with picture salience - the late positive potential (LPP) - is indexed and then submitted to k-means clustering to classify different modulation profiles. RESULTS Replicating prior work, clustering indicated a 2-group solution where an \"F>P\" (n=14) group showed enhanced LPPs for food-predicting, relative to standard appetitive, pictures and an \"F<P\" group (n=16) showed reduced LPPs for food-predicting pictures. Also replicating prior work, both groups showed typical enhancement for appetitive and standard aversive, relative to neutral, pictures; and contrary to expectations, both also showed minimal LPP enhancement for alcohol pictures. Examining behavioral correlates of F>P versus F<P status, groups did not differ in reward consumption during the task, nor did they differ in AUD symptoms or weekly drinking per TLFB. Finally, while the LPP was not enhanced for alcohol pictures, enhancement for alcohol relative to neutral pictures was observed for an earlier (P300) neural response - and this was consistent across F>P and F<P groups. CONCLUSIONS Similarly sized groups of individuals who were more versus less responsive to natural reward cues is consistent with prior studies in non-AUD samples. At the same time, the lack of commensurate differences in task reward consumption differs from those studies, and could reflect change in natural reward processing in individuals with AUD. Implications for continued research are discussed.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Although traditionally considered a peripheral regulator, emerging evidence indicates that PTH also exerts effects through the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigated the neuropsychiatric impact of elevated PTH and explored potential CNS involvement using multiple murine models of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Distinct behavioral phenotypes were observed across models, indicating that psychiatric symptoms vary depending on disease etiology and progression. The effects of hPTH(1-34), a clinically approved PTH analog, were further assessed in male and female mice. Under pharmacological concentrations, hPTH(1-34) enhanced locomotor activity in males but induced mild anxiety-like behavior in females. These behavioral changes in females were independent of the estrus cycle and were amplified by ovariectomy. Metabolic analysis indicates PTH affects the basic metabolism by inhibiting the respiratory exchange ratio, promotes the energy expenditure and locomotion without affecting the food consumption in a 48hr range. To further investigate the molecular effect of PTH in the brain, a PTH1R-Cre mouse line was generated to map PTH receptor-1 (PTH1R) expression. Widespread expression of PTH1R was detected across the brain, including in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. These findings suggest that PTH may influence behavior through interactions with PTH1R-expressing cells in brain vasculature and circumventricular regions. However, further studies are warranted to define the specific brain nuclei and cell types involved in PTH-driven modulation of neurobehavioral function.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Our previous studies identified thiophen-2-yl pyrimidines (TPPs), which are structurally derived from microtubule (MT)-active phenylpyrimidines, as potent paralytics of Schistosoma mansoni. Although relatively non-toxic to mammalian cells, the progenitor compound, 3, had poor aqueous solubility and was lipophilic potentially hindering preclinical advancement. To address these issues and expand on the structure-activity and structure-property relationships, 43 new TPP analogs were designed and synthesized, their lipophilicity calculated (cLogP), and their anti-schistosomal activity evaluated in culture. This effort yielded compound 38, which possessed an oxetane-containing amine moiety at C5, and an ortho, ortho-difluoroaniline at C6 of the TPP scaffold. Compared to 3, compound 38 had better aqueous solubility (46 vs. < 0.5 micromolar), decreased lipophilicity (cLogP 4.48 vs. 6.81), a 14.5-fold increase in paralytic potency against adult S. mansoni (EC50 = 37 vs. 538 nM), and limited toxicity (CC50 > 20 micromolar) to three mammalian cell lines. In mice, 38 demonstrated a 3-fold longer plasma half-life (t1/2; 1.51 vs. 0.48 h) for a 40% loss in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax). In washout experiments, 38 produced a sustained paralysis of both juvenile and adult S. mansoni, possibly suggesting a broader in vivo efficacy spectrum compared to PZQ, which is inactive against the juvenile parasite. The two other medically important species, Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma japonicum, were also susceptible to 38. Finally, to identify potential protein targets, we synthesized a TPP photoaffinity labeling (PAL) probe that labeled several S. mansoni proteins by SDS-PAGE fluorescence analysis, although, notably, not tubulin, suggesting that the antischistosomal activity of 38 is a function of engaging other targets. Future work with the TPP series will aim to decrease toxicity further and improve pharmacokinetic properties to better support in vivo efficacy testing.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Using the largest global dataset of quantitative networks (>3,400 networks, >110,000 interactions), we show that the latitudinal specialisation gradient (LSG) exists, but it is non-linear, hemispherically asymmetric, and strongly taxon-dependent. Network-level and pollinator specialisation were lowest in the tropics and peaked at northern mid-latitudes, whereas plants tended to become more specialised toward higher latitudes. Climate consistently outperformed latitude, species richness, and environmental productivity as a predictor of these patterns. Specialisation declined with increasing temperature, rose with moderate rainfall before declining at the wettest sites, and increased with temperature seasonality, but plants and pollinators responded differently to these drivers. Functional groups diverged strongly: ectothermic insects were most specialised in cooler, seasonal climates, while birds showed weaker links to latitude but reduced specialisation in wetter regions. These findings demonstrate that climate, rather than latitude or species richness, structures global variation in specialisation. Because warmer and less seasonal climates promote generalisation, climate change is likely to disrupt the most specialised pollination systems, unevenly across taxa and regions, with important consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem stability.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Understanding how these factors interact to shape AMF community assembly allows for the selection of crop genotypes that may maximally utilize AMF associations in agricultural systems. We assessed the development of AMF communities colonizing the roots of eight genetically diverse genotypes of Sorghum bicolor across a growing season. We used two field sites with contrasting environments and management histories. Sorghum cultivated in Arizona (AZ) contained low diversity AMF communities, while in Georgia (GA) sorghum harbored more diverse and evenly distributed AMF communities. We observed evidence of host-filtering of AMF communities, though with genotypes displaying more distinct associations in GA than AZ. AZ showed rapid shifts from early Funneliformis mosseae dominance to dominance by either Entrophospora etunicata or Diversispora aurantia. In GA, such drastic abundance shifts were not observed. Instead, consistent temporal turnover was associated more with higher level family abundance patterns driven by the combination of minor variations in multiple low-abundance taxa. Our findings demonstrate that there is potential for leveraging intra-species genetic variation in AMF community assembly as an extended plant phenotype.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Plasmid dependent phages (PDPs) are particularly attractive as therapeutics because they can both kill targeted pathogen cells, whilst also potentially preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistance genes encoded by plasmids. However, we lack experimental studies of the ecological and evolutionary response of multidrug resistance plasmids against plasmid dependent phage treatment under ecologically relevant scenarios allowing plasmid conjugation. We experimentally evolved populations of E. coli carrying the multidrug resistance RP4 plasmid with the PRD1 PDP under conditions where conjugation was associated with either strong or weak benefits. When opportunities for conjugation were rare, PRD1 only transiently suppressed the conjugative plasmid population due to the rapid evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids that lacked conjugative ability. Increasing the ecological opportunity for conjugation enhanced plasmid suppression and delayed the evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids. PRD1 resistance was associated with reduced conjugative ability, but this trade-off was complex due to the heterogeneous impacts of resistance mutations on pilus production and conjugative ability. Mutations and IS element insertions in conjugation genes caused a wide range of PRD1 resistance phenotypes, ranging from complete resistance (virB4) to partial resistance (trbB, trbL). Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available IncP plasmid sequences showed that truncated variants of VirB4 protein are common in natural populations, suggesting that plasmid-dependent phages are an important selective pressure in microbial communities. Our results demonstrate an evolutionary trade-off between conjugative ability and phage resistance that cannot be easily circumvented by plasmids. Targeting multidrug resistance plasmids with PDPs is likely to drive loss of conjugation limiting the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We found low-dimensional neural manifolds that capture neural population trajectories. During the attention phase, trajectories exhibited increasing amplitude and oscillatory modulation along successive stimuli, consistent with a resonant-like mechanism. Transition to tapping was marked by a reliable shift into a distinct manifold subspace, enabling accurate decoding of the switch in behavior. In addition, large amplitude and oscillatory indices were higher in successful tapping synchronization trials than in incorrect ones.

Because such data are difficult to obtain, most state-of-the-art approaches, including Cellpose, segment individual 2D slices and then heuristically reconstruct 3D volumes, thereby losing critical spatial context. Our analysis of human expert annotator performance confirms that ignoring 3D context introduces substantial variability in nuclear detection and annotation. While a few 3D models have been trained on small or toy datasets, no large-scale, openly available resource currently exists to enable robust training of high-capacity 3D segmentation networks. To address this, we present NucGen3D, a customizable simulation framework that generates large-scale, annotated 3D microscopy datasets from limited 2D input, specifically the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset. NucGen3D produces realistic 3D volumes across diverse biological and imaging scenarios, including variations in nuclear morphology, spatial arrangement, acquisition artifacts, and imaging noise. Using this synthetic data, we trained two models from scratch: a 2D convolutional neural network under Cellpose-like conditions, and a fully 3D convolutional model that extends the 2D settings. We evaluated both on a challenging, independent real-world dataset with complex nuclear architectures. Both models, especially the 3D model, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, including those trained on larger annotated datasets or based on more complex architectures. These results demonstrate that synthetic data can effectively substitute for real 3D annotations in training performing models at scale. To promote reproducibility and further research, we release both the NucGen3D framework and the fully trained 3D segmentation model as open source, making this the first end-to-end open resource for large-scale 3D nuclear segmentation.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

NIS couples the inward transport of I- against its electrochemical gradient to the inward translocation of Na+ down its electrochemical gradient. NIS also transports oxyanions (XO4-s), such as perrhenate (ReO4-) and the environmental pollutant perchlorate (ClO4-). Furthermore, NIS is the basis for radioiodide (131I-) therapy for thyroid cancer (administered after thyroidectomy), the most effective targeted internal radiation cancer therapy available. 131I- selectively targets remnant malignant cells and metastases expressing NIS, causing only minor side effects. There is great interest in expressing NIS exogenously, by gene transfer, in extrathyroidal cancers to render them susceptible to destruction by 131I-. This approach, however, would also harm patients thyroids. Therefore, a strategy is needed for killing non-thyroidal cancer cells exogenously expressing NIS while protecting the thyroid. Addressing this need, we present here an engineered double mutant, L253P/V254F (PF)-NIS, which selectively transports XO4-s but not I-. We used cryo-EM to determine the structure of PF-NIS with ReO4- and Na+ ions bound to it at a 2.58 [A] resolution, and showed that high concentrations of non-radioactive I- protect WT-NIS-expressing cells from radioactive 186ReO4-, whereas PF-NIS-expressing cells are killed. Thus, PF-NIS could potentially be used, together with 186/188ReO4- and non-radioactive I-, to treat non-thyroidal cancers while safeguarding the thyroid.

It presents significant treatment challenges due to its inherent resistance to conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT). Single high dose radiation therapy (SDRT) has promise for the treatment of radioresistant sarcomas, especially those characterized with extensive vascularity. However, its clinical application is severely constrained by toxicity to adjacent critical tissues. Radiosensitizers can enhance tumor cell susceptibility to radiation-induced DNA damage, improving therapeutic efficacy and potentially reducing collateral toxicity. Monotherapies targeting tumor vasculature alone in solid tumors have shown limited success as radiosensitizers in clinical settings. This highlights the importance of compounds that can simultaneously target both tumor cells and its associated microvasculature to maximize the therapeutic outcome to SDRT. Riluzole, the FDA-approved drug for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is currently under investigation as a therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma. Riluzole acts to inhibit glutamate release, reduce glutathione levels in cancer cells, and mitigate tumor angiogenesis, positioning it as a potent radiosensitizing agent for the treatment of osteosarcoma. We hypothesize that Riluzole enhances osteosarcoma radiosensitivity to SDRT by simultaneously targeting intrinsic tumor radioresistance and pro-angiogenic signaling. Our findings demonstrate that Riluzole radiosensitizes osteosarcoma cells in vitro by reducing clonogenic survival and enhancing apoptosis. Mechanistically, Riluzole potentiates irradiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, inhibits DNA repair, and thereby amplifies radiation-induced DNA damage. Additionally, Riluzole suppresses radiation-induced Vascular Endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression indicating its ability to overcome endothelial cell mediated radioresistance. Collectively, these results establish Riluzole as a promising radiosensitizer for osteosarcoma, with the potential to improve SDRT efficacy by overcoming both tumor-intrinsic and microvasculature-mediated radioresistance.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

However, for individuals with vocal tract paralysis, lack of articulatory movements can pose a challenge for speech BCI development. To address this challenge, our study aims at extracting generalizable articulatory features from a group of native Dutch speakers and reconstructing these features from brain data of a separate group of able-bodied individuals. Approach: We applied a tensor component analysis (TCA) model to extract generalizable articulatory features from a publicly available articulatory movement dataset. To reconstruct articulatory features from the brain, we analyzed data of three able-bodied participants P1, P2, and P3 with high-density electrocorticography (HD-ECoG) electrode arrays implanted over the sensorimotor cortex. For each participant, a separate TCA model was applied to extract neural features. A gradient boosting regression model was used to reconstruct articulatory features from neural features. Reconstruction performance was measured as Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) between the reconstructed and the generalizable articulatory features. Results: The extracted articulatory features showed even contributions across participants, indicating that these features captured generalizable articulatory kinematic patterns. By using these features, we were able to reconstruct articulatory features from brain data. PCC between the reconstructed and original articulatory features were significantly above chance for all three participants, with mean PCCs of 0.80, 0.75, and 0.76 for P1, P2, and P3 respectively. Significance: With the rapid development of speech BCI, our research demonstrates that speech-related articulatory features can be restored from HD-ECoG signal using generalizable articulatory features derived from able-bodied individuals.

Electrophysiological analyses reveal that sleep loss enhances small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel-mediated afterhyperpolarization in GABAergic anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons, leading to reduced levels of feedback inhibition onto Kenyon cells and compromised sparse coding. Targeted knockdown of SK channels in APL neurons reduce their augmented afterhyperpolarization and rescues the pattern separation deficits caused by sleep deprivation.

However, whether directly modulating beta ERS can causally influence motor performance remains unclear, largely due to the lack of methods designed to specifically target this neural activity. To address this gap, we developed a novel behaviourally-driven, closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) approach to target movement-related beta ERS during a visuomotor adaptation task. We found that the behaviourally-driven, closed-loop beta-tACS specifically enhances beta ERS without affecting beta event-related desynchronization (ERD). Critically, this targeted enhancement significantly improves retention of motor adaptation. These findings establish a causal relationship between beta ERS and motor behaviour and highlight the potential of behaviourally-driven beta-tACS as a therapeutic approach for improving motor function in clinical populations characterized by impaired beta activity.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Objective: To evaluate differential effects of three types of tES - tDCS, tACS and oscillatory tDCS - (otDCS), on canonical EEG microstates (A-D) in healthy adults. Methods: In a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study, 42 participants completed four sessions (tDCS, tACS, otDCS, sham). Stimulation (20 min) used a P3-cheek montage: tDCS +1.5 mA; tACS at individualized theta frequency (ITF, 4-8 Hz), {+/-}1 mA; otDCS anodal with {+/-}0.5 mA oscillation around +1.5 mA at ITF. A five-minute resting EEG (eyes closed then eyes open) was recorded pre- and post-intervention. Microstates were extracted (A to D), back-fitted, and assessed on duration, occurrence, contribution, and mean GFP using linear mixed-effects models with sham and pre/post adjustments. Results: Four canonical microstates explained ~80% variance with stable topographies across conditions. Modulation patterns were modality-specific. MS A (sensory/arousal) increased across all active protocols, strongest after otDCS. MS B (visual-autobiographical) was consistently suppressed, again most following otDCS. MS C (self-referential) decreased selectively after oscillatory stimulation (tACS, otDCS) only. MS D (executive/attention) diverged by waveform: enhanced by tACS and otDCS but reduced by tDCS. Across outcomes, otDCS produced the largest and most widespread effects, overlapping features of both tDCS (tonic/stabilizing) and tACS (oscillatory/entraining) influences. Conclusions: Resting-state EEG microstates provide a sensitive systems-level assay of tES aftereffects. Constant and oscillatory current waveforms reorganize network states in dissociable ways, with otDCS exerting the most robust, comprehensive modulation. These findings support microstates as practical biomarkers for differentiating, optimizing, and monitoring neuromodulation strategies.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

While traditional experimental methods for siderophore typing are time-consuming and low-throughput, we present a genome-based pipeline for high-throughput digital siderophore typing in Pseudomonas. Our approach integrates profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), substrate-specific motif identification, and co-evolutionary analysis to predict both the structure of pyoverdines and their corresponding uptake receptors from any given Pseudomonas genome. By this approach, we developed pHMM from 94 previously defined receptor groups and validated their accuracy and robustness across 14,230 Pseudomonas genomes. Application of our method to this large dataset demonstrated the potential of our algorithm for identifying both novel \"lock-key\" receptor groups and previously uncharacterized pyoverdine structures. Notably, our pipeline corrected long-term misclassifications in classical strains and proposed a new reference for the canonical Group III pyoverdine. Furthermore, interaction network analysis supports the observation of distinct siderophore utilization patterns between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. This standardized, user-friendly platform offers a robust tool for annotating siderophore behaviors in Pseudomonas and demonstrates the potential of digital siderophore typing in exploring iron-mediated ecology across microbes.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Giardia duodenalis is the most frequent intestinal protozoon affecting young children worldwide and nitroimidazoles are the main treatment, but non-responding cases are widely reported. In this paper we tested the antigiardial activity of several Lamiaceae and Asteraceae plants. Essential oils from 22 traditional medicinal plants from Lamiaceae and Asteraceae families and its main components were tested against the parasite employing the MTT method. The composition of the essential oils was determined by a metabolomic approach (GC-MS). Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to evaluate morphological alterations. The best antigiardial activity was obtained with the genera Lavandula, Mentha, Thymus, and Satureja, while the best selective indexes were obtained with compounds {gamma}-terpinene, caryophyllene oxide, carvacrol and thymol. Synergies were observed with linalyl acetate + linalool (Lavandula EOs), linalyl acetate + {rho}-cymene or thymol, or combinations of {rho}-cymene, {gamma}-terpinene, thymol, and carvacrol (Satureja EOs). Membranolysis, enlarged periplasmic vacuoles, and loss of the cytoplasmic content were evident effects of {gamma}-terpinene on trophozoites after 1 hour.

Here, we introduce a high-throughput microfluidic-based assay that allows systematic characterization of factors required for gametogenic rejuvenation in S. cerevisiae. A key innovation of this method involves two inert genetic modifications that enable specific enrichment of gametes. With this technique, we confirm the rejuvenation of aged precursor cells upon completion of gametogenesis and show that we can capture a wide range of gamete replicative lifespan, consistent with known longevity mutants. Excitingly, using this technique, we identify factors involved in ER-phagy as essential for full restoration of replicative lifespan in gametes.

We show that K13 levels are exquisitely responsive to nanomolar amounts of heme. Heme stabilizes K13 with molecular specificity, raises its oxidative-stress responses and association with autophagic-endosomes.

Here, we monitor 33 in vitro fungal traits in a population of 48 genetically diverse isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis, over 18 weeks, across plate compartments with and without direct plant root influence. This study reveals that intraspecific AMF variability is extensive, and that R. irregularis traits are mostly positively correlated, especially in root-free environments. The few trait trade-offs (negative correlations) found existed in proximity to the host root. Given the large screening population and the variance decomposition method of repeatability, we find that the genetic individuality of isolates significantly explained variation in approximately half of the AMF traits measured, and especially those related to hyphal growth, branching structures and reproduction near plant roots. Especially, differences in the frequency and fineness of branching right after growth from the plant host, which did not correlate to nearly any other traits, were explained by isolate identity (i.e., genotype). The new information we reveal on R. irregularis trait relationships, over time and in different environments, as well as trait links to genetic differences among isolates, provides the foundation for future understanding of AMF functional diversity.

The study also involves analysis of co-evolutionary dynamics of BLs with related genes. PPI analysis identified NagZ as central interacting partner for BLs in P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting its pivotal role in BL expression, and highlighting its probable role as a potential drug target. In contrast, A. baumannii exhibited such a high diversity in protein interactions, that considering a single protein as topmost interacting partner was difficult. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strong co-evolutionary trends between functionally-related proteins such as NagZ, AmpC and AmpR. Plasmid-encoded MBLs and related proteins seem to exhibit higher HGT rates between Acinetobacter and Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, similar evolutionary patterns for chromosomally-encoded BLs like AmpC and related genes was found in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Analysis of PFAM domains showed that catalytic and substrate binding domains are more conserved than accessory ones. Few domains were found to be conserved across all MBLs and thus carry the potential drug targets.

CRISPR homing drive currently represents the most powerful type, and regulating Cas9 expression with specific promoters has been effective for improving drive performance. However, selecting these is often a major challenge. Here, we evaluated 35 Cas9 constructs driven by distinct promoters in different gene drive systems and identified associations between drive performance and single-cell RNA expression patterns of the promoter-associated genes. Our results indicate that higher drive conversion is significantly associated with elevated expression of the promoter-associated gene in the respective reproductive cells, but embryo resistance allele formation correlates with excessive female germline expression. For males, early germline expression produces superior performance. Thus, we find that optimal drive performance requires restricting Cas9 expression to a tight quantitative and spatiotemporal window. In addition, found that in situ integrated rhino-Cas9 constructs significantly reduce somatic expression, underscoring the importance of genomic locus. On the basis of these results, we propose criteria for selecting promoters, providing a theoretical rationale and practical guidance for optimization of promoter elements in homing gene drive systems.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

The specific genetic mechanisms which underly cardiac remodeling, however, are still unclear, due in part to the challenge of accounting for environmental effects in human population studies. To overcome this challenge, we used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population to investigate heritable susceptibility to cardiovascular stress by chronic -adrenergic receptor stimulation. Across 8 founder and 63 CC lines, we measured cardiac structure and function, organ weights, cell and tissue morphology, and left ventricular gene expression. Genome-wide scans detected 49 genome-wide significant loci, collapsing to 20 unique intervals (nine significant for multiple traits and eleven trait-specific), averaging 12.83 Mb in size. To identify high-confidence candidate genes from these loci, we augmented our trait mapping with associations between loci and gene expression, isoproterenol-dependent transcriptional changes, coding variants drawn from sequencing data, tractability in our in vitro rat cardiomyocyte model, and previously reported protein functions and mouse or human phenotypes. This approach recovered both known regulators, such as Hey2, and new candidates. Functional tests in in vitro models highlight three candidate genes that modulate hypertrophic growth: Abcb10, Mrps5 and Lmod3. Abcb10 knockdown increased cell size at baseline and further with isoproterenol, consistent with loss of a mitochondrial stress-buffering role. Mrps5 knockdown blunted stress-induced hypertrophy. Paradoxical upregulation of Lmod3 after siRNA transfection (validated at the protein level) also attenuated hypertrophy, consistent with reinforcement of actin-assembly control under catecholamine stress.

Here, we identify WNK kinases as novel upstream regulators of RNF43 through proximity labeling proteomics. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we show that WNKs control RNF43 surface localization and thereby its ability to ubiquitinate and downregulate WNT receptors. Pharmacological inhibition of WNKs increases RNF43 membrane abundance and enhances WNT suppression, an effect abolished in RNF43/ZNRF3 double knockout cells and organoids. Mechanistically, WNK inhibition alters RNF43 trafficking and ubiquitination, revealing a role for WNKs in regulating its plasma membrane distribution.

To explore its chemical tractability, we applied an affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) workflow to screen 10,000 small molecules for CHI3L1 binding. The screen yielded 124 initial hits with a hit rate of 1.24%, which were prioritized based on chemical suitability, and six candidates were advanced for validation using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Among these, compound A9 exhibited a clear, dose-dependent binding response in MST with a Kd of 182 M. Molecular docking supported these findings, revealing that A9 forms hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions within a defined pocket of the CHI3L1 structure. Although modest in affinity, A9 represents the first small molecule binder of CHI3L1 identified through AS-MS. This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration that CHI3L1 can be chemically engaged using AS-MS, establishing a foundation for future medicinal chemistry optimization and the development of chemical probes targeting this previously undruggable extracellular protein.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

The process of protein directed evolution can be envisaged as navigation over high-dimensional landscapes with numerous local maxima. The performance of any strategy in navigating such a landscape is dependent on the ruggedness of that landscape. However, this information is generally unavailable at the outset of an experiment, and cannot currently be computed using analytical methods. Here we propose SLIDE, Sequence-free Landscape Inference for Directed Evolution, which consists of two parts. First, SLIDE provides an estimation for landscape ruggedness from a mutating population using only population-level phenotypic data and an estimation of mutation rate. Ruggedness information in itself is valuable in protein design, for instance in predicting evolutionary stability. Second, SLIDE offers a framework for using the estimated ruggedness metric to select high-performing parameters for directed evolution control. Using theoretical NK landscapes and four real-world protein fitness landscapes, we demonstrate improvement upon the performance of standard selection strategies, particularly on rugged landscapes, using a pipeline that could also be combined with emerging AI-based methods for driving direction evolution.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we used ChIP-seq and eCLIP-seq in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to map AUTS2 chromatin targets and, for the first time, its direct RNA interactome. AUTS2 knockdown in NPCs led to widespread gene expression changes and impaired cell proliferation, migration, and neurite outgrowth.

A.; Polimeni, J. R.", "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is broadly used to measure human brain activity, however the hemodynamic changes that comprise the fMRI response to neuronal activity are often interpreted using microscopy data in mice. These microscopy data provide ground-truth observations of how individual blood vessels respond to neuronal activity and thus form the basis of our fundamental understanding of neurovascular coupling. Although these invasive experiments provide invaluable insight, there are striking differences in the vascular architecture of mouse and human brains that may influence the hemodynamic response. Motivated by this, we developed a biophysical modeling framework for realistic hemodynamic simulations in both mouse and human cerebral cortex. For this, we utilized Vascular Anatomical Network (VAN) models that explicitly represent the full microvascular tree as a single connected network, originally based on anatomical reconstructions from a given location of mouse cerebral cortex. We extended the VAN modeling framework using synthetic VAN models representing the microvascular network at a single location of the human cerebral cortex. To account for larger size and complexity of the human VAN models, we developed an efficient computational framework to simulate the full hemodynamic responses in this human model and compared the simulated fMRI responses between mice and humans. Our biophysical simulations are based entirely on first principles (e.g., conservation of mass); model parameter values were fixed across all simulations, not tuned to fit data, as they represent meaningful physical constants taken from previous measurements. Only two simple calibrations were tuned for each simulation, to match baseline perfusion rates (blood flow) and oxygen extraction (OEF). Our results show that differences in microvasculature indeed influenced the hemodynamic response and led to observable differences in timing-e.g., the simulated fMRI response peak in humans was delayed by ~2 s compared to mice, consistent with prior fMRI observations. While there are many known differences in vascular architecture in rodents and humans, we also discovered that, unexpectedly, an asymmetry in the numbers of branches of the penetrating intracortical arterioles and venules appears to be conserved across species. We demonstrate through further simulations that this anatomical property may also be needed for suitable hemodynamic responses. Our framework thus provides a valuable tool for bridging in-vivo microscopy of microvascular dynamics to human fMRI.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Following the established narrative of development, committed B cells undergo heavy and light chain recombination, which together form the functional BCR. However, a granular per-subset phenotypic analysis reveals proliferative bursts following each recombination event, an aspect of BCR recombination previously undescribed in the pro-B phase of development. Heavy and light chain pairing becomes more similar to that of mature, circulating B cells with progress through lymphopoiesis, deleting features associated with autoreactivity.

F.; Lovdal, T.; Kjos, M.", "abstract": "An estimated 30% of all food produced worldwide is lost or wasted every year. A considerable portion of that waste is due to perishable food products, that spoil and can become unsafe to eat relatively quickly. For some high-quality perishables, such as fresh fish and cold-smoked salmon, traditional food preservation techniques are unsuitable as they can compromise sensory qualities such as flavor, texture, and freshness. These products often support the growth of the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, which can be present if thermal treatment is not applied. Thus, antilisterial bacteriocins like garvicin KS (GarKS) in combination with conventional technologies like high-pressure processing (HPP) or modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) are being investigated as hurdle strategies to increase the shelf life and food safety of packaged fish products. In this study we showed that L. monocytogenes strains associated with fish food and fish processing plants are susceptible to GarKS with MIC values ranging from 20 to 275 nM. Exposure to GarKS resulted in an upregulation of genes involved in the phage shock protein response, and isolation of resistant mutants indicated a low frequency of resistance to GarKS (10e-9 to 10e-11). Resistant mutants were shown to harbor disruption mutations in lmo2468, encoding a PspC-domain-containing protein. Overexpression of this gene increased susceptibility to GarKS two-fold and restored wild-type susceptibility in a disruption mutant.

In two field experiments, we combined transcriptomics and allometric analyses to investigate functional variation in cassava-AMF interactions using sterile, single isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis. We developed a novel Index of Symbiotic Transcriptional Activity (ISTA) and accounted for sampling times to reduce transcriptomic noise and improve links to biomass traits. ISTA significantly correlated with cassava shoot biomass in an isolate-dependent manner, and allometric analyses revealed that R. irregularis isolates can either reinforce or uncouple cassava shoot-root relationships to maximize root yields. Differential expression and co-expression network analyses uncovered isolate-specific plant and fungal gene module responses.

The vascular niche is crucial for maintaining cardiac homeostasis, yet endothelial cell (EC) impairment during aging remains poorly understood. This study investigates epigenetically regulated mechanisms mediating EC-dependent cardiac aging and identifies a critical role of Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16 (ZBTB16). Methods: Chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (snRNA-seq) analyses were performed on aged hearts to identify age-related regulatory changes. Functional studies using genetic models, assessed cardiac aging phenotypes. In vitro assays examined EC senescence and secretory profiles, while co-culture experiments analyzed the impact of ZBTB16-deficient EC supernatants on fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and neurons. Overexpression experiments in vitro and in vivo tested the potential for ZBTB16 to mitigate aging-associated dysfunction. Results: Aged hearts exhibited decreased chromatin accessibility and expression of the transcription factor ZBTB16 in both human and mice. Loss of ZBTB16 in young mice, including Zbtb16 haploinsufficient and endothelial-specific knockout mice, led to premature aging, diastolic dysfunction, and increased secretion of pro-fibrotic and inflammatory factors. Supernatants from ZBTB16-deficient ECs activated fibroblasts, induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and impaired neuronal sprouting. Overexpression of ZBTB16 reversed these effects in senescent ECs and aged mice and reduced diastolic dysfunction. Mechanistic studies identified key downstream targets of ZBTB16, including nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1). ZBTB16 suppressed NRIP1 expression, limiting fibroblast activation and pro-fibrotic signaling. Conclusions: ZBTB16 is a key regulator of endothelial function, maintaining vascular niche homeostasis and mitigating aging-associated cardiac dysfunction. Its loss promotes EC senescence and pro-fibrotic signaling, contributing to diastolic dysfunction. Overexpression of ZBTB16 presents a potential therapeutic strategy for preserving cardiac function during aging. These findings establish a novel role for ZBTB16 in endothelial aging and cardiovascular disease prevention.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

While these changes are well-documented in pollen and archaeological records, their underlying drivers, whether socio-political instability, agricultural crises, or environmental pressures, remain debated. Here, we synthesize multiproxy evidence, including high-resolution pollen data, climate reconstructions, and archaeobotanical data to explore the interplay between climatic fluctuations, agricultural practices, and human mobility during LAMP. Although previous studies have examined socio-environmental changes during the Migration Period using archaeological and palynological evidence, this study is the first to integrate high-resolution pollen records, archaeobotanical data, and climate model simulations specific to northeastern Germany to systematically evaluate the role of climatic anomalies in shaping agricultural and demographic patterns. We focus on the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP; from 350 to 700 CE) and the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA; from 536 to 660 CE), which brought cold and wet conditions to northern Europe, likely disrupting agricultural productivity and fostering the spread of Claviceps purpurea (ergot), a toxic fungus affecting cereal crops, particularly rye. Our findings suggest that these climatic anomalies created favorable conditions for ergot outbreaks, leading to agricultural instability and reduced food security. This, combined with socio-political pressures, may have contributed to the observed decline in human activity and settlement abandonment. By integrating palynological, climatic, and archaeobotanical data, this study highlights the complex interactions between environmental stressors and human responses during the LAMP. We suggest that the climatic anomalies of the DACP and LALIA, coupled with the vulnerability of cereal crops to ergot infestation, influenced agricultural and demographic shifts in northeastern Germany. This review not only refines our understanding of the DACP and the LALIA but also demonstrates how climatic stressors and natural hazards can amplify socio-political vulnerabilities in past societies (or pre-industrial societies).", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we revisit this narrative through environmental DNA (eDNA) and multiproxy analyses of sediment cores from Lake Tjornin in central Reykjavik, one of Iceland's earliest and longest-occupied settlements. Originally a marine embayment, Tjornin became a freshwater lake around 660 CE. Our record reveals a human presence decades before the long-accepted arrival date of 877 CE, marked by the Landnam volcanic tephra. Early settlement brought livestock, barley cultivation, and other introduced taxa that enhanced nutrient cycling and unexpectedly increased local biodiversity. Contrary to the conventional view of rapid deforestation, eDNA shows that birch and willow expanded during the settlement period, likely supported by deliberate management. Pronounced ecological and landuse shifts occurred after 1200 CE, but these were coincident with the Little Ice Age cooling, compounded by volcanic eruptions, storm surges, and plague, rather than anthropogenic degradation. Crop cultivation ceased, arboreal taxa retracted, and grazing pressure maintained open landscapes. Even more profound ecological changes came after c. 1750 CE with urbanization and industrialization, as wastewater discharge, heavy-metal pollution, and fossil fuel use reshaped Tjornin's ecosystem. These findings challenge the prevailing model of Norse-induced environmental collapse, revealing instead a dynamic human--environment relationship shaped by both cultural practices and external stressors. By applying eDNA to a long-occupied urban catchment, we demonstrate the power of genomic methods to refine settlement chronologies, reassess ecological baselines and changes, and integrate natural and cultural histories.

Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

Compounds targeting the serotonin type 4 receptor (5-HT4R) hold promise as novel rapid-acting treatments of mood disorders. However, a lack of selectivity and numerous side effects have been limiting factors for their clinical use. Here, we developed and characterized novel-composition 5-HT4R compounds in mouse models of stress. METHODS: Three 5-HT4R-targeting compounds were designed and synthesized based on PF-04995274, a high-affinity 5-HT4R ligand reported to be a partial agonist. G-protein assays were utilized to characterize molecular activity. Saline, PF-04995274, or a novel compound were administered before or after stress in male and female mice. Drug effects were assayed using behavioral paradigms. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of drug on glutamatergic activity in hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3). RESULTS: Prophylactic administration of DL5, DL7, or DL8 was effective at reducing stress-induced maladaptive behaviors in male and female mice; DL7 and DL8 were effective when administered after stress. When administered following learned helplessness (LH), DL7 reduced behavioral despair and increased c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. All novel compounds attenuated large-amplitude AMPA receptor mediated bursts in ventral CA3 (vCA3). In aged male mice, prophylactic DL7 reduced behavioral despair.

As BazPeriod itself oscillates tidally, it may explain how a single endogenous clock yields both tidal and diel rhythms. The work also spotlights the highly time-sensitive biology of vastly unexplored deep-sea biology.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In this sudy the extent of fibrosis in obese patients (n 50) was significant only in visceral parenchymal fat (4.7% vs 2.5% in controls (n 15) P<0.0001) and not in subcutaneous fat. Electron microscopy, in vivo and in vitro data, suggested that obese adipocytes are responsible for fibrillar collagen (I and III) production. COL6 (gene producing the non fibrillar form) resulted less expressed. In line, patients with COL6 mutations, showed increased fibrotic tissue even in subcutaneous fat: about 6.5 times vs controls in the patient with the severe form (Ullrich) and 2.8 times in two patients with the milder form (Bethlem). Approximately 15% of obese adipocytes were dead (perilipin1 negative), and consequent infiltrating macrophages showed hyperexpression of CD38 , an ectoenzyme implicated in systemic fibrosis. Correlations with gene expression confirmed the importance also of myofibroblasts and the extracellular matrix peptidase D.

L.; Chen, M.; Chen, J.; Lee, T. C.; Yu, C.-H.; Efremov, A. K.; Johnson, H. E.", "abstract": "Integrin-adhesion complexes (IACs) form spontaneously in cells on extracellular matrix substrates, allowing them to sense matrix composition and transduce force. However, IACs often do not form uniformly across a cell, which begs the question: What is required to nucleate an adhesion, and what factors enable the stabilization of an IAC once it has formed? Many factors have been suggested to promote formation and the subsequent stabilization of IACs. It is difficult to explicitly test these factors in vivo as IACs undergo constant remodeling. Here, we employ optogenetics to explicitly test the ability of talin in different activity and phase states to nucleate and stabilize IACs in regions where none are present. We find that fusion of intrinsically disordered regions directly to talin enhances its adhesion nucleation potential and allows new adhesions to be produced in response to optogenetic talin clustering. Similarly, expression of factors previously shown to enhance biocondensation in vitro, such as paxillin, the paxillin N-terminus, or unfolding of talin, allows for adhesion nucleation and biocondensation of talin. We show that these biocondensates of talin can cluster and activate integrins even in the absence of extracellular matrix. By applying optogenetic activation to regions of the cell with or without ventral actomyosin, we demonstrate actomyosin engagement promotes the formation and stability of adhesions. These results are corroborated by theoretical modelling which shows that phase separation of talin is enhanced by differential clutch formation in the presence of actomyosin thus enabling peripheral adhesion formation and stability. This work establishes a model in which increased cooperativity of talin enables IAC nucleation through talin biocondensation, which clusters and activates integrins. In addition to these findings, we generate multiple optogenetic tools that enable local nucleation or enhancement of IACs.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We investigated the seasonal feeding behaviour and fitness consequences of feeding preferences in natural zooplankton communities for toxic (microcystin-producing) versus non-toxic cyanobacteria across temperature gradients in eutrophic Lake Greifen, Switzerland. We conducted monthly experiments from April to October 2023 to test the grazing behaviour of four zooplankton groups (daphnids, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, and microzooplankton) exposed to mixed diets of green algae and either toxic or non-toxic Microcystis strains at 15{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C. Contrary to expectations of cyanobacteria avoidance, zooplankton exhibited predominantly non-selective grazing throughout the seasonal succession, consuming both toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria at similar rates, regardless of temperature. Notably, during the peaks of phytoplankton abundance (April and September), mesozooplankton demonstrated a selective preference for cyanobacteria over green algae, particularly non-toxic strains. Temperature effects were subtle but revealed metabolic constraints: elevated temperatures occasionally triggered selective consumption of cyanobacteria in copepods, while fitness costs (survival) from exposure to toxic species were mostly restricted to transitional bloom periods and high-temperature conditions. These findings suggest that toxic cyanobacteria may not always evade grazing pressure through secondary metabolite deterrent effects. Our results suggest that zooplankton communities can adapt and graze on cyanobacteria regardless of toxicity under the tested conditions, even during bloom conditions. These observations highlight the potential for zooplankton to interact with cyanobacterial populations, which may have implications for bloom prediction and management strategies, particularly under climate warming scenarios.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

However, the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression remains ambiguous and difficult to generalize. Here we explored the hypothesized causality between the level of transcription and cytosine methylation at the 5' end of genes (around transcription start sites and start codons) in relation to whole-genome duplication in natural and synthetic allohexaploid wheat (Triticum/Aegilops complex). Using transcriptomes and a sequence capture protocol coupled with bisulfite sequencing, we observed sometimes significant, but overall very weak associations between gene expression and 5' end methylation on a genome-wide scale. In synthetic wheat allohexaploids, global methylation differences between subgenomes are not triggered by the polyploidization, as the subgenome patterns are rather faithfully inherited from parents. A small number of genes differentially methylated between the parents and synthetics was consistently recovered in reciprocal synthetics and subsequent generations. Differences in transcription between homeologs are not clearly associated with 5' end methylation in either natural or synthetic wheat. Overall, allopolyploidization triggers only minor methylation changes around transcription start sites and start codons of nascent wheat allopolyploids, and these are not statistically associated with differential expression. Although there is a measurable methylation difference between expressed and non-expressed genes, our results do not support the hypothesis that 5' end DNA methylation is engaged in the regulation of gene expression in natural and synthetic wheat.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Solutions to reduce this cost include targeting a proportion of the genome (e.g. SNP arrays) or lowering the sequencing depth (low-coverage WGS, lcWGS) but both solutions suffer from either genotype missingness or uncertainty. Genomic imputation addresses this problem by inferring missing or uncertain genotypes using a collection of high quality genomic data (a reference panel). However, certain methods can impute a lcWGS dataset without a reference panel. Because the investment into generating a reference panel can be prohibitively expensive in non-model species, a benchmarking of the accuracy of these alternative methods of imputation can help inform study design. Here, we imputed a dataset of 2800 lcWGS in the presence and absence of a reference panel of 502 samples. We used 32 individuals sequenced at both high and low coverage to estimate the accuracy of each method and explored the limitations of lcWGS sample size and reference panel size. Although the best results were achieved with a large reference panel, using only a lcWGS dataset showed accurate imputation, when over 500 samples were used and we account for missing data and low frequency alleles. In addition, imputing with or without a reference panel gave similar results in a GWAS for a polygenic trait but required some quality control in the identification of homozygous-by-descent segments. Thus, while using a reference panel remains the ideal approach, imputation in suitably large lcWGS datasets can provide sufficient accuracy given proper quality control.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

To address this, we introduce an iterative sampling framework that systematically explores the MSA space using residue-specific frequencies and coevolutionary patterns inferred via Markov random fields. We also develop tools to identify a protein's variable regions and to subsequently extract representative structures. Together, our method yields a high-quality and compact set of final structural models for downstream analysis with good coverage of the distinct conformational states. On a benchmark set of fold-switching proteins, our method outperforms existing ones by substantially improving the diversity of the sampled structures.

By using a high-coverage mouse brain MERFISH dataset as the reference benchmark, we showed that ReconST outperforms existing methods in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and spatial pattern preservation.

Using rbcL gene sequences, codon evolutionary models were used to test for positive and divergent selection and convergent evolution. Protein structure modeling was performed to predict side chain changes and protein stability. Phylogenetic comparative methods were used to examine the relationship between protein stability to growing season temperature. All four clades showed significant evidence of positive selection, with multiple convergent substitutions predicted to alter side chain polarity and interactions with the solvent. In viburnums, biome transition rates were dependent on amino acid substitution, with positive selection was concentrated in cold temperate and cloud forest clades. Rubiscos with higher stability occurred in species from warmer environments. However, this correlation was weaker after correcting for phylogeny.

However, because GhV has not been isolated in culture, its biology, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential remain poorly understood. Using reverse genetics at BSL-4, we recovered a full-length infectious clone of recombinant GhV, requiring rational reconstruction of the incomplete 3' leader and correction of a non-canonical transcriptional initiation site. GhV showed restricted receptor tropism (ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-B3) and distinct innate immune antagonism mechanisms compared to NiV. Relative to NiV, GhV replication was attenuated in primary human and porcine cells but enhanced in specific bat cell lines. Experimental infection of Syrian golden hamsters with GhV resulted in no observable disease or mortality. Furthermore, a chimeric NiV encoding the GhV receptor binding protein was completely attenuated in vivo, strongly implicating ephrin-B3 receptor usage as a key determinant of henipavirus pathogenesis. We further identified several broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that inhibit Ghana virus replication.

Methods: Pairwise samples of ETA and BAL obtained from mechanically ventilated patients at our intensive care units were collected anonymously for testing the accuracy of ETA compared to BAL. Bacterial community structure was assessed by a metabarcoding approach based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing in ETA and BAL samples.

Disruption of these networks is associated with cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure. Our previous work identified the transcription factor \"Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1\" (ZEB1) as a downstream effector of Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein 4 (CPEB4), an RNA-binding protein responsive to cardiac stress. While ZEB1 is known for its role in cancer metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), its function in cardiomyocytes is not well understood. Based on previous findings, we hypothesize that ZEB1 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of cardiomyocytes. Hypothesis and objectives: We hypothesized that ZEB1 plays a critical role in maintaining cardiomyocyte structure and function. Deletion of Zeb1 may result in sarcomeric disorganization and mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas its overexpression appears to promote maladaptive hypertrophy. Our objectives are to: 1. Investigate if ZEB1 overexpression induces pathological cardiac remodeling. 2. Examine the effects of ZEB1 deletion on cardiomyocyte structure and function. 3. Identify ZEB1-regulated transcriptional networks. Methods: AAV9-ZEB1 was used for the overexpression of ZEB1. Using a myosin heavy chain alpha ( -MHC) Cre system, we created a ZEB1 conditional knockout mouse. To evaluate the cardiac function, we used methods like echocardiography, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry. We identified differential expressed genes upon deletion of Zeb1 using RNA-seq and integrated the data set with ChIP-seq. Results: ZEB1 deletion leads to sarcomere damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dedifferentiation, with more pronounced effects in females. Overexpression promotes hypertrophic remodeling. Echocardiographic analysis showed progressive systolic dysfunction, and histology revealed sarcomeric disarray, again especially in females.

In polyploids, regulatory differences may preferentially affect genes on homoeologous chromosomes or sub-genomes. Selection in plant breeding may act upon total transcript dosage across homoeologous genes and on alleles that have strong effects on the transcriptome. Results To investigate these questions, we identified regulatory polymorphisms between an old and a recent hexaploid bread wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum, 2n=6x=42, AABBDD). The recent cultivar was the product of decades of selection for grain yield and quality. Regulatory allele polymorphisms preferentially affected genes on homoeologous chromosomes but rarely affected genes on specific sub-genomes. The chromosomal distributions of regulatory alleles indicated that past selection had acted upon them, and the effect of selection differed between alleles targeting environmental response genes and genes involved in other processes. Modern cultivar alleles that affected many genes' transcripts corresponded to known selection targets and improved field crop performance. Modern cultivar alleles also had significant effects on homoeologous genes, and these alleles also improved crop performance. Conclusions Polyploid breeding across many species has been and will continue to be the key factor in plant improvement.

To answer these questions, we combined controlled injury experiments with automated behavioral tracking across six colonies of the ant Camponotus fellah. Our results reveal that wound care is primarily provided by a non-specialized subset of individuals whose behavioral traits align with a transitional phase between the nurse and forager roles. Among these transitioning ants, care provision was best predicted by their prior spatial and social proximity to the injured individuals in the hours before the injury, indicating that pre-existing social affinity influences caregiving behavior. These findings offer the first empirical evidence of how caregivers are integrated into the colony's social structure and highlight the role of social interactions in shaping the organization of wound care in ants.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

However, chemical halogenation lacks stereoselectivity and requires the use of toxic or expensive chemicals. Although enzymatic halogenation can improve selectivity and reduce environmental impact, current halogenases are inefficient and insoluble, leading to low yields that limit their applications. Here, we develop RebHEvo4, a soluble and highly active tryptophan halogenase, containing 12 mutations that confer 37-fold and 44-fold increases in 7-chloro and 7-bromotryptophan production respectively, in vivo. To create RebHEvo4, we devised an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase based halogenase biosensor and conducted over 500 hours of phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE). Use of RebHEvo4 in a bioreactor resulted in the production of 2.7 g/L of halogenated tryptophan. When coupled with a downstream enzyme, RebHEvo4 allowed 36-fold increased yields of halogenated tryptamines compared to the wild-type enzyme. Additionally, RebHEvo4 enabled efficient production of genetically encoded antimicrobial halogenated peptides. The efficient, site-specific halogenation by our evolved halogenase will accelerate sustainable biomanufacturing of halogenated drugs.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Recent studies show that specific tFUS parameters targeted to pain-processing brain circuits can significantly alter pain-related behaviors in rodent models and humans. However, a comprehensive understanding of how tFUS influences brain networks and cellular mechanisms is essential to optimize efficacy and facilitate safe translation to clinical pain therapies. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the modulation of inhibitory neural circuits induced by tFUS of 40 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) in a humanized mouse model of chronic pain, integrating local and network-level electrophysiological investigations, molecular analyses, and histological assessment to confirm safety. Methods and Results: We used a 128-element random array transducer for stimulation, along with a non-invasive and flexible 30-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to assess local evoked responses, topographical brain activity, and global brain dynamics including excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance. To further assess tFUS neuromodulation effects at the cellular level, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis and found that tFUS significantly increased the activity of inhibitory neurons as indicated by elevated expression of Glutamate Decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and Parvalbumin (PV). Finally, safety was evaluated in the same brain samples used for mechanistic analysis, with blinded histological assessment revealing no signs of tissue damage. Conclusions: These findings provide new evidence that tFUS non-invasively engages PV GABAergic inhibitory circuits in a chronic pain mouse model, supporting its development as a robust neuromodulation strategy.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

GROMODEX automates this process, systematically exploring performance parameters to find the best configurations for each system. By using statistical techniques, it evaluates multiple parameters simultaneously, optimising for CPU and GPU architectures, and reducing simulation times while ensuring efficient resource use. We evaluated GROMODEX on four computational platforms spanning a wide range of cost and hardware complexity four molecular systems from the NVIDIA GROMACS benchmark suite. Quite surprisingly, our results show that the performance does not always correlate with the hardware complexity and cost in a system-dependent manner.

In this preliminary study, we systematically investigated the formulation stability of liposomes co-encapsulating tubacin and erlotinib.HCl, as well as the development of a freeze-drying (FD) method as a stabilization strategy. Notably, the effect of cryoprotectants on size and drug encapsulation conservation was studied both before and after freezing and thawing (FD). Tubacin was passively loaded into the lipid bilayer, while erlotinib.HCl was remotely loaded via an ammonium sulfate gradient. Lipid composition studies revealed that erlotinib.HCl encapsulation was the highest at pH 3. Additionally, DSPC:Chol ratios significantly impacted drug loading: high cholesterol content improved erlotinib.HCl retention but reduced tubacin encapsulation. Despite optimization, substantial drug losses occurred during storage at 4 deg C, leading to the development of freeze-drying as a stabilization strategy. Sucrose and trehalose were evaluated as cryoprotectants at different concentrations. Sucrose (10% w/v) demonstrated higher cryoprotection, maintaining liposome sizes within a range optimal for the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, the inclusion of internal sucrose did not further improve stability. Process optimization identified 150 mM ammonium sulfate as the optimal concentration for remote loading while preserving formulation stability. Comparative evaluation of two freeze-drying protocols revealed that the controlled stepwise system (Telstar) outperformed the alternative approach, demonstrating superior drug retention and particle size preservation. Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation coupled with dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering (AF4-DLS-MALS) analysis confirmed minimal particle aggregation post-lyophilization, with preserved monodispersity and spherical morphology.

Although throwing behavior emerges early in childhood, the neuromuscular mechanisms that support its development remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide novel evidence for the developmental reorganization of whole-body muscle synergies during maximum-effort throwing in preschool-aged (PS) and school-aged (SA) children. Electromyography was recorded from 16 muscles, and non-negative matrix factorization was applied to extract low-dimensional coordination modules (muscle synergies). We compared ball speed, number of synergies, synergy structure, and temporal consistency between groups. Ball speed was significantly higher in SA than PS (33.6 {+/-} 10.2 vs. 21.4 {+/-} 6.2 km/h, p < 0.05), reflecting improved performance. Yet, the number of synergies did not differ (PS: 6.0 {+/-} 1.1; SA: 6.4 {+/-} 1.3, p > 0.05), suggesting that the dimensionality of coordination is largely established by the preschool years. Instead, developmental improvements were driven by structural and temporal reorganization: trunk- and upper-limb synergies merged into a single module in SA, reflecting improved postural integration, while a bilateral soleus-dominant synergy fractionated into lateralized modules, reflecting increased lower-limb specialization. Moreover, the temporal variability of synergy activation was reduced in SA (p < 0.01), indicating that movement sequences became more precise and stable with development. These findings reveal that early gains in throwing arise not from expanding synergy number but from reorganizing their structure and sharpening temporal coordination, offering mechanistic insight into how complex whole-body skills are refined during childhood.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

We show that tracheal tuft cells discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic bacteria by sensing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Rodentibacter pneumotropicus within the first 4 h of invasion, and recruit neutrophils and macrophages to the trachea and alveolar spaces. Taste signaling through the chemosensory transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (Trpm5) channel was essential for tuft cell activation and LT release. Mice lacking Trpm5 were not capable of detecting bacteria-released ATP and became colonized upon R. pneumotropicus infection. In contrast, Trpm5+/+ mice cleared the pathogen.

Replacing cytidine with tomato seedling exudate was slightly less effective at 71%, but the reduction in disease symptoms was still larger than with A. brasilense Sp7 alone at 55%.

While CYB5R3 expression is decreased during aging, the downstream consequences of CYB5R3 loss are not understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of CYB5R3 in primary human aortic endothelial cells activates a Ca2+ influx network characterized by the upregulation of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel subunits ORAI2 and ORAI3, as well as the non-selective cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2). When endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ stores were depleted, CYB5R3-deficient cells had increased Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane, part of which was insensitive to classical store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) blockers and was mediated by TRPV2, as demonstrated by genetic knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition. Mechanistically, loss of CYB5R3 increased Ca2+-dependent NO production through elevated CRAC channel activity, which oxidatively inhibited the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). This prevented TRPV2 dephosphorylation, thereby maintaining Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-dependent channel activation downstream of SOCE. It also enhanced the responsiveness of TRPV2 to physiological heat stimuli. Thus, CYB5R3 normally acts as a brake, limiting NO-dependent PTPN1 oxidation and restraining TRPV2 activity. In vivo, endothelial-specific Cyb5r3 deletion enhanced acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and improved exercise capacity, demonstrating a physiological function for this pathway in vascular adaptation. Together, these findings identify a CYB5R3-NO-SOCE-PTPN1-TRPV2 signaling axis that couples endothelial redox balance to Ca2+ dynamics and vascular function.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Since DNA was extracted for the first time, countless protocols have been developed yielding excellent results; however, the diversity of plant families and the distribution in remote areas represent a challenge for these protocols. Orchidaceae, one of the most species-rich plant families in the world, is a group with abundant polyphenols and polysaccharides in its tissues. In addition, sample collection in remote areas represents a challenge, consequently, conventional protocols can be inappropriate for obtaining DNA. In this way, CTAB-based gel preservation has emerged as an excellent alternative to easily collect, store and transport samples, moreover, alternatives such as sterile sand and DNA stabilization solutions during grinding allow a suitable DNA extraction. Here, we combined saturated NaCI-CTAB gels, sterile sand, sucrose-based DNA stabilization buffer, and conventional CTAB solution for obtaining DNA from fresh and stored samples for up to 32 days at room temperature, and described, from sample collection to spectrophotometer-obtained quantification, a non-organic method for obtaining DNA from orchids species for genomic applications. This protocol allows not only the extraction of suitable quantities of high molecular weight DNA of adequate purity and integrity from different orchid species without the use of expensive equipment and cumbersome reagents such as liquid nitrogen and toxic phenols, and/or time-consuming procedures, but also, the use of this DNA in downstream applications such as PCR-based genotyping, restriction enzyme analysis, and most genomic applications.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

However, prevalences and P values for mutations do not directly quantify the cancer effects of somatic variants. Methods: We calculated cancer effect sizes accounting for substantial gene- and site-specific mutation rates, to quantify somatic selection across stages. This approach provides a direct measure of cancer-driving impact of new mutations and reveals the genes that drive tumorigenesis and progression, and whether mutations have greater effects in primary or metastatic THCA. Results: Trinucleotide mutation profiles were similar between primary and metastatic THCA. Most canonical driver genes (BRAF, NRAS, TP53, ATM, EIF1AX, KMT2C, NF1, RBM10, ARID1A, PIK3CA, and NKX2-1) exhibited stronger selection during initial tumorigenesis (from organogenesis to primary THCA) than during progression (from primary to metastatic THCA). Notably, TERT mutations have been shown to be at higher prevalence in metastatic tumors, yet their strongest selection occurred earlier, during tumor initiation. In contrast, RET mutations exhibited the opposite trajectory, experiencing weaker selection during tumorigenesis but stronger selection during metastatic progression. Conclusion: Cancer effect size analysis revealed dynamic shifts in selective pressures across THCA evolution, distinguishing genes that drive initiation from those that promote metastatic progression.

However, the lack of information pertaining to the underlying mechanisms for legacy and especially second-generation PFAS exacerbates the risk. This study investigates legacy and second-generation PFAS to determine their individual effects on neurotoxicity and mitochondrial respiration. Legacy PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and second-generation PFAS, GenX, and ADONA were employed, and studies were conducted using Caenorhabditis elegans and mitochondria isolated from Rat brain for Complex I to IV.

PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA also exhibited significant inhibition to most of the mitochondrial complexes. Whereas in the case of second-generation PFAS ADONA, and GenX, it was only limited to the inhibition of Complex IV. GenX only exhibited neurodegeneration at very high doses. Our findings conclude that the legacy and second-generation PFAS might have significant neurotoxic implications.

The majority of frameworks - most prominently based on Golden Gate - have been developed and optimized for the assembly of transcriptional units (TUs) and thereof composed multi-gene expression constructs. This is significantly enabled by the modular organization of functional elements underlying any given TU. In contrast, the assembly of protein coding sequences typically necessitates tailored approaches. Addressing this technological gap, iterative functional linker cloning (iFLinkC) was recently developed to provide a standardized framework for assembling protein coding sequences of arbitrary size and complexity from the ground up based on pairwise ligations of any two DNA fragments via a two-base overlap. Yet, a need for physically purifying DNA fragments imposes significant procedural complexity and operator skill. Overcoming these limitations, a new assembly algorithm, termed iFLinkC-EZ, is presented. Crucially, the DNA assembly products are now purified by genetic means which greatly simplifies the underlying assembly process and also renders it compatible with robotic automation. Further, the potency of iFLinkC-EZ is demonstrated in the assembly of mono- and poly-chromatic poly-fluorescent fusion proteins as well as poly-cistronic expression constructs while examining the effect of poly-PT and poly-GGS linkers as well as ribosome binding sites on the functional expression of poly-fluorescent fusion protein constructs. Further, the utility of poly-fluorescent proteins is demonstrated for the enhanced labeling of surface displayed recombinant binders in yeast display.

This indicates that water quality acted as an environmental filter on microbial communities at the subcontinental scale, but was masked by small-scale patches that created high spatial heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales to fully understand benthic microbial communities' role in stream biogeochemistry.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

L.; Follows, M. J.", "abstract": "Phytoplankton elemental composition shapes the distribution of dissolved nutrient concentrations and thus plays a key role in ocean biogeochemistry. While the carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (C:N:P) in marine phytoplankton has been extensively studied, the hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) content have received less attention despite their critical role in determining dissolved oxygen (O2) consumption rates in the ocean. Here, we estimated the elemental composition of marine phytoplankton, including the H and O content, from first principles, using a cellular allocation model embedded in a global ocean model. We estimated that an average phytoplankton cell has a chemical formula of C107H190N16O53P, with an O2 demand of 149 mol O2/mol P and respiration quotients of 1.40 mol O2/mol C, suggesting a lower H and O content, and higher O2 demand than commonly assumed. We found global variations in the O2 demand of organic matter respiration driven by population structure and cellular reorganisation under different environmental conditions. By testing how shifts in the macromolecular composition of phytoplankton cells affect the ocean O2 budget, we found that O2 consumption increases significantly when shifting cell composition from carbohydrate-rich to protein- or lipid-rich cells. As a result, low-O2 (hypoxic) zones in the ocean expanded by 75%. These findings demonstrate that cellular-level processes in marine phytoplankton shape the global O2 cycle and large-scale patterns of ocean biogeochemistry.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

Over macroevolutionary time scales, these networks change as species emerge and go extinct, yet the stability of their structural organization remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ancestral interaction networks can be reconstructed from present-day phylogenetic and interaction data. Focusing on large biogeographic scales, we infer the ancestral networks of plant mutualisms involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, bat pollinators, and bird seed dispersers. We find that these mutualistic networks exhibit a modular structure that has persisted for millions of years, maintained by the evolutionary conservatism of species interactions. As species diversify, they show limited shifts in mutualistic partners. This minimal evolutionary rewiring results in a remarkable long-term stability of mutualistic network structure.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "During the transition to multicellularity, nascent multicellular organisms evolved reproductive strategies that relied on coordinating behaviour across cells in the group. Cell-cell interactions that once occurred between independent single-celled organisms in an ecological context were integrated into the developmental programs of emerging multicellular forms. To study this transition, we developed a spatially structured evolutionary model in which cells can migrate, divide, and adhere to neighbours --- behaviours common to most unicellular eukaryotes. When coupled to a selective pressure driven by food scarcity, the model reveals how ecological interactions between single cells can give rise to multicellular reproductive programs. We show that a life cycle alternating cohesive multicellular clusters and dispersive unicellular propagules --- the most prevalent reproductive strategy in multicellular life --- evolves spontaneously as a dispersal strategy in environments where food is concentrated in patches of intermediate size. More broadly, the spatial distribution of food strongly shaped evolutionary outcomes: environments where food was homogeneously distributed favoured unicellular life cycles, while those where food was heterogeneously distributed favoured multicellular life cycles. Furthermore, we show that ancestral unicellular and multicellular life cycles were co-opted and encapsulated as phases of the reproductive programs of propagule-forming lineages during evolution. Taken together, our results highlight how ecological interactions can be repurposed to organise development during the transition to multicellularity.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

S.; Seefried, F. R.; Pausch, H.", "abstract": "Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in cattle populations have traditionally relied on progeny-derived phenotypes such as estimated breeding values (EBVs) as input phenotypes to identify additive quantitative trait loci (QTL) for complex traits. Increasing availability of cow genotype data now enables GWAS using own performance records to detect both additive and non-additive QTL. Results: Sequence-variant genotypes were imputed for 57,863 cows from the Holstein, Brown Swiss, Original Braunvieh and Simmental cattle populations that had own performance records for stature and three mammary gland morphology traits (fore udder position, central ligament, front teat position). Genomic heritability ranged from 0.25 to 0.33 for fore udder position, 0.27 to 0.43 for udder central ligament, 0.49 to 0.59 for front teat position and 0.61 to 0.73 for stature. Additive genetic effects explained most of the SNP-based heritability for all traits and breeds. Within-breed genome-wide association studies identified 118 additive and 29 non-additive QTL for the four traits. Non-additive associations were only detected for stature. Meta-analysis of the additive GWAS identified 63 mammary gland morphology and 43 stature QTL. A Holstein-specific mammary gland morphology QTL (Chr1_2748715, p=7.59e-35) colocalized with the POLLED locus on chromosome 1. Fine-mapping of this region revealed undesired effects of the Friesian POLLED haplotype on mammary gland morphology traits. Conclusions: Direct phenotypes for a large cohort of genotyped cows provide high statistical power for additive and non-additive association testing. Sequence-based association studies revealed QTL and candidate causal variants for stature and mammary gland morphology traits. Pleiotropic effects of the Friesian POLLED haplotype highlight the need for careful monitoring of potential unintended consequences when selecting for polledness in cattle.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

In this direction, we designed a strategy to generate minimal-size probes composed of a controlled 1:1 conjugate between a small domain binder and a 1.4 nm-gold nanoparticle with direct access to fluorescent labelling for dual light-electron microscopy. Our approach was applied to the widely used single-domain antibody against GFP (GBP). The modified GBP-gold conjugate retained normal binding to purified GFP in vitro, specifically labelled COS-7 cells and neurons expressing GFP-tagged synaptic membrane proteins, and penetrated readily into tight cell-cell contacts including neuronal synapses. The optional fluorescence labelling with a second ALFA nanobody allowed dSTORM imaging, while the silver-enhanced nanogold particle detected in TEM was used to characterize the number and nanoscale organization of individual proteins in the synaptic cleft. We counted a small number of endogenous neurexins in the pre-synapse and a larger number of AMPA receptors in the post-synapse, often aligned in nanodomains. This GBP-gold probe thus emerges as a potent tool to label an ever-increasing repertoire of GFP-tagged proteins in numerous biological organisms and models.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}

H.; Stegmayer, G.", "abstract": "Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are involved in many important biological processes. In particular, non-coding RNAs are crucial regulators of cellular processes, playing a significant role in gene expression. RNA secondary structure is key to infer their specific function and for understanding how they interact with other molecules. Many computational models have been developed in the last decade to predict the secondary structure, achieving increasingly higher success rates. However, each new method has its own input-output interface, programming language, computational requirements and, sometimes, a dedicated server to run the model or just a source code in a repository. Thus, nowadays it is very hard to obtain predictions from multiple methods and compare them at once. A unified interface is urgently needed, which allows accessing several methods at the same time, visualizing and comparing predictions among them, and also with a reference structure when available. We introduce here RNAcomp2D, a web-based tool that allows users to enter an RNA sequence, or select one from RNAcentral, and obtains predictions of RNA secondary structures using several state-of-the-art methods. Both classical thermodynamic methods and the latest deep learning models are packaged in containers and accessible in an unified web- site. All the predictions, and the reference structure if available, are shown at the same time in a single graphical interface. Moreover, as new models continue to be developed, this tool is designed to be scalable, allowing the addition of more prediction methods in the future.

K.; Minary, P.", "abstract": "The development of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage activity prediction tools hinges on data produced from high-throughput guide-target lentiviral library screens for different Cas9 variants. However, the majority of such tools remain limited to predictions for one or few Cas9 variants, making it difficult to quantify the effects of Cas9 residues on cleavage activity. To bridge the gap, we introduce 4 interpretable DeepEmbCas9 models for the cleavage activity prediction of 40 type II- A and II-C Cas9 variants -- DeepEmbCas9, DeepEmbCas9-MVE, DeepEnsEmbCas9_naive, and DeepEnsEmbCas9 -- leveraging protein and RNA language model embeddings to encode Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively. Among the 4 neural network models, DeepEnsEmbCas9 naive performed the best in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, where DeepEnsEmbCas9_naive outperformed individual Cas9 cleavage activity prediction tools on 18 out of 51 and 17 out of 48 benchmark test sets, respectively, and performed comparably otherwise. Concerning uncertainty quantification, DeepEnsEmbCas9 yields quantile-calibrated uncertainty estimates while keeping a minimal performance drop compared to DeepEnsEmbCas9 naive. SHAP importance analysis on DeepEmbCas9 reaffirms the importance of Cas9-target PAM binding as a first step for Cas9 cleavage, and reveals the L2 linker and PLL-WED-PI as important Cas9 domains modulating DeepEmbCas9's predicted activity change when introducing increased-fidelity and PAM-altering Cas9 mutations, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of protein language model embeddings in uncertainty-aware Cas9 cleavage activity prediction. More generally, DeepEmbCas9 models serves as an initial step towards cleavage activity prediction modelling for the whole Cas9 protein family.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": ""}
