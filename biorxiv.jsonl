A.", "abstract": "Segmenting individual instances of mitochondria from imaging datasets can provide rich quantitative information, but is prohibitively time-consuming when done manually, prompting interest in the development of automated algorithms using deep neural networks. Existing solutions for various segmentation tasks are optimized for either: high-resolution three-dimensional imaging, relying on well-defined object boundaries (e.g., whole neuron segmentation in volumetric electron microscopy datasets); or low-resolution two-dimensional imaging, boundary-invariant but poorly suited to large 3D objects (e.g., whole-cell segmentation of light microscopy images). Mitochondria in whole-cell 3D electron microscopy datasets often lie in the middle ground - large, yet with ambiguous borders, challenging current segmentation tools. To address this, we developed skeleton-oriented object segmentation (SKOOTS) - a novel approach that efficiently segments large, densely packed mitochondria. SKOOTS accurately and efficiently segments mitochondria in previously difficult contexts and can also be applied to segment other objects in 3D light microscopy datasets. This approach bridges a critical gap between existing segmentation approaches, improving the utility of automated analysis of three-dimensional biomedical imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of SKOOTS by applying it to segment over 15,000 cochlear hair cell mitochondria across experimental conditions in under 2 hours on a consumer-grade PC, enabling downstream morphological analysis that revealed subtle structural changes following aminoglycoside exposure - differences not detectable using analysis approaches currently used in the field.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we explore the regulatory role of non-coding RNAs, which dramatically expanded during brain evolution, in synapse development of human-induced pluripotent stem-cell derived neurons. We found that inhibition of a human-specific microRNA, miR-1229-3p, alters the trajectory of human neuronal maturation and enhances excitatory synaptic transmission. Transcriptome analysis following miR-1229 knockdown revealed a downregulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes. We further show that miR-1229 regulates mitochondrial morphology, mtDNA abundance and matrix calcium concentration, and that stimulation of mitochondrial metabolism rescues decreased calcium buffering in miR-1229-3p depleted neurons. Accordingly, miR-1229 directly targets an entire network of genes involved in mitochondrial function and ER-associated protein homeostasis. Our findings reveal an important function of human-specific miR-1229-3p in developmental timing of human synaptogenesis and generally implicate non-coding RNAs in the control of human connectivity and cognition.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Among these, airinemes play a crucial role in pigment pattern formation in zebrafish by mediating long-distance Notch signaling between pigment cells. Remarkably, airinemes exhibit large vesicle-like structure at their tips, which are pulled by macrophages and delivered to target cells. The interaction between macrophages and Delta-ligand carrying airineme vesicles is essential for initiating airineme-mediated signaling, yet the molecular detail of this interaction remains elusive. Through high-resolution live imaging, genetic in vivo manipulations and in vitro adhesion assay, we found that adhesive interactions via the extracellular domain of CD44, a class I transmembrane glycoprotein, between macrophages and airineme vesicles are critical for airineme signaling. Mutants lacking the extracellular domain of CD44 lose their adhesiveness, resulting in a significant reduction in airineme extension and pigment pattern defects.

Numerous ecological and geochemical constraints on OP have been proposed, but the role of environmental stressors at the physiological and ecosystem level is poorly understood. Here we show that Chl-f-harboring cyanobacteria in a high-altitude Andean microbial mat - an analog for Precambrian ecosystems - switch from OP to arsenite-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis (AP) under high light. Using microsensor profiling, mat incubations, and metatranscriptomics, we show that this shift is triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, which suppresses OP. Instead of ceasing activity, cyanobacteria reroute electron flow, using arsenite as the electron donor to sustain photosynthesis while avoiding both intracellular ROS from OP and extracellular ROS from aerobic arsenite oxidation. This switch is reversible and coordinated with diel cycles of light and arsenic speciation, sustained by a cryptic arsenic redox cycle, continuously regenerating arsenite for AP. Although the enzymatic basis remains unresolved, these findings reveal a hidden layer of metabolic plasticity in cyanobacteria and suggest that oxidative stress-responsive metabolic shifts may have supported early phototroph survival while limiting oxygen release - potentially contributing to Earth's protracted oxygenation.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

By combining large-scale atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations with analysis of cryo-electron microscopic data and statistical as well as kinetic models, we show here that the formation of the mammalian I/III2 supercomplex reduces the molecular strain of inner mitochondrial membranes by altering the local membrane thickness and leading to an accumulation of both cardiolipin and quinone around specific regions of the SC. We find that the SC assembly also affects the global motion of the individual ETC proteins with possible functional consequences.

R.; Nicola, W.", "abstract": "Training spiking recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) presents significant challenges compared to standard recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that model neural firing rates more directly. Here, we investigate the origins of these difficulties by training networks of spiking neurons and their parameter-matched instantaneous rate-based RNNs on supervised learning tasks. We applied FORCE training to leaky integrate-and-fire spiking networks and their matched rate-based counterparts across various dynamical tasks, keeping the FORCE hyperparameters identical. We found that at slow learning rates, spiking and rate networks behaved similarly: FORCE training identified highly correlated weight matrix solutions, and both network types exhibited overlapping hyperparameter regions for successful convergence. Remarkably, these weight solutions were largely interchangeable--weights trained in the spiking network could be transferred to the rate network and vice versa while preserving correct dynamical decoding. However, at fast learning rates, the correlation between learned solutions dropped sharply, and the solutions were no longer fully interchangeable. Despite this, rate networks still functioned well when their weight matrices were replaced with those learned from spiking networks. Additionally, the two network types exhibited distinct behaviors across different sizes: faster learning improved performance in rate networks but had little effect in spiking networks, aside from increasing instability. Our results indicate that some of the difficulties in training spiking networks stem from the inherent spike-time variability in spiking systems--variability that is not present in rate networks. These challenges can be mitigated in FORCE training by selecting appropriately slow learning rates. Moreover, our findings suggest that the decoding solutions learned by FORCE for spiking networks approximate a cross-trial firing rate-based decoding.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

However, it remains uncertain whether anatomical ultra-low-field neuroimaging can be used to reliably extract quantitative measures of brain morphometry, and to what extent such measures correspond to high-field MRI. Here we scanned 23 healthy adults aged 20-69 years on two identical 64 mT systems and a 3 T system, using T1w and T2w scans across a range of (64 mT) resolutions. We segmented brain images into 4 global tissue types and 98 local structures, and systematically evaluated between-scanner reliability of 64 mT morphometry and correspondence to 3 T measurements, using correlations of tissue volume and Dice spatial overlap of segmentations. We report high 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T across 64 mT scan contrasts and resolutions, with highest performance shown by combining three T2w scans with low through-plane resolution into a single higher-resolution scan using multi-resolution registration. Larger structures show higher 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T.

A.; Zhou, C.; Chen, K.; Chen, H.", "abstract": "Background: The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the liver plays a crucial role in clearing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream. This process takes place mainly in the liver. Under atherogenic conditions, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9), secreted by the liver, binds to LDLR on hepatocytes, preventing its recycling and enhancing its lysosomal degradation. This process reduces LDL-C clearance, promoting hypercholesterolemia. Epsins, a family of ubiquitin-binding endocytic adaptors, are key regulators of atherogenesis in lesional cells, including endothelial cells and macrophages. Given epsins' canonical role in regulating endocytosis of cell surface receptors, we aimed to determine whether and how liver epsins contribute to PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degradation, thereby impairing LDL-C clearance and accelerating atherosclerosis. Methods: Liver-specific epsin knockout (Liver-DKO) atherosclerotic models were generated in ApoE-/- and PCSK9-AAV8-induced atheroprone mice fed on a Western diet. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing, along with molecular, cellular, and biochemical analyses, to investigate the physiological role of liver epsins in PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. Additionally, we explored the therapeutic potential of nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNAs targeting epsins 1 and 2 in ApoE-/- mice with established atherosclerosis. Results: Western diet (WD)-induced atherosclerosis was significantly attenuated in ApoE-/-/Liver-DKO mice compared with ApoE-/- controls, as well as in PCSK9-AAV8-induced Liver-DKO mice compared with PCSK9-AAV8-induced wild-type (WT) mice accompanied by reductions in blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing of hepatocytes and aortas isolated from atherosclerotic ApoE-/- and ApoE-/-/Liver-DKO mice revealed epsin-deficient Ldlrhi hepatocytes with diminished lipogenic potential. Notably, pathway analysis of hepatocytes showed increased LDL particle clearance and enhanced LDLR-cholesterol interactions under WD treatment in ApoE-/-/Liver-DKO mice compared with ApoE-/- controls, correlating with decreased plasma LDL-C levels. Furthermore, pathway analysis of the aortas showed attenuated inflammation and endothelial activation, coupled with reduced lipid uptake, and enhanced cholesterol efflux under WD treatment in ApoE-/-/Liver-DKO mice compared with ApoE-/- controls. Moreover, the absence of liver epsins led to an upregulation of LDLR protein expression in hepatocytes. We further demonstrated that epsins bind LDLR via the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), enabling PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. Depleting epsins abolished this degradation, thereby preventing atheroma progression. Lastly, targeting liver epsins with nanoparticle-encapsulated epsins siRNAs effectively ameliorates dyslipidemia and inhibits atherosclerosis progression. These results are consistent with findings showing an increased epsin1 and epsin2 expression in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients. Conclusions: Liver epsins drive atherogenesis by promoting PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation, thereby elevating circulating LDL-C levels and heightening lesional inflammation. As such, targeting epsins in the liver represents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate atherosclerosis by preserving LDLR and enhancing LDL-C clearance in the liver.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

This model predicts a doublet rate higher than the rate included in the documentation for the 10X Flex protocol. This was motivated by our use of doublet-finding software, scDblFinder, on experimental data using the Flex protocol, which identified several times more doublets than we expected based on the documentation. Our original model produced better agreement with the results of scDblFinder in 9 of our own data sets as well as one public dataset made available by 10X. During revisions, however, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of doublet formation that were inconsistent with the results of our model, and much closer to the predictions from the documentation. This prompted us to reanalyse the assumptions of our model. A longer version of this withdrawal statement that explains in detail the errors in the model and includes updated figures is available at \\url{https://github.com/Oshlack/flex-doublets}, but in brief, our initial assumptions over-predicted the doublet fraction, and our revised model is now consistent with both the Monte Carlo simulations and the predictions from the Flex documentation.

Mutations in the lamin protein have been associated with diverse diseases collectively known as laminopathies. In this study, we focused on two lamin A mutants - E161K and K97E - associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Through confocal imaging, we established that these mutations cause large scale disruption of the peripheral lamin and consequent heterochromatin organisation, along with the formation of lamin aggregates inside the nucleoplasm. Using coarse-grained polymer simulations, we uncovered the role of lamin-lamin, lamin-membrane and lamin-chromatin interactions in maintaining wild-type lamin and chromatin organisation and showed that disruptions in these interactions can reproduce the experimental observations in the lamin mutants. These predictions were verified using 3D-FISH experiments to quantify the reorganisation of chromosome territories in these mutants. Using advanced imaging methods, we characterised the dynamical properties of the lamin aggregates in the mutants to show for the first time a liquid-like state of the lamin aggregates through a liquid-liquid phase separation. The altered lamin and chromatin interactions in the mutants thus manifest as liquid-like aggregates in the nucleoplasm leading to disruption of the spatial organisation of the genome in these laminopathy-associated mutants.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

These observations suggest additional damage sensing or protection mechanisms. Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM) compacts mtDNA into nucleoids and binds differentially to certain forms of DNA damage. As such, TFAM has emerged as a candidate for protecting mtDNA or sensing damage. To examine the possibilities that TFAM might protect DNA from damage or act as a damage sensing protein for irreparable forms of mtDNA damage, we used live-cell imaging, cell-based assays, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-throughput protein-DNA binding assays to characterize the binding properties of TFAM to ultraviolet-C (UVC) irradiated DNA and the cellular consequences of UVC irradiation. Our cell data show increased TFAM mRNA after exposure and suggest an increase in mtDNA degradation and turnover without a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential that might trigger mitophagy. Our protein-DNA binding assays indicate a reduction in sequence specificity of TFAM following UVC irradiation and a redistribution of TFAM binding throughout the mitochondrial genome. Our AFM data show increased compaction of DNA by TFAM in the presence of damage. Despite the TFAM-mediated compaction of mtDNA, we do not observe any protective effect of increased compaction on DNA damage formation in cells or in vitro. Taken together, these studies indicate that UVC-induced DNA damage alters TFAM binding and promotes compaction by TFAM, suggesting that TFAM may act as a damage sensing protein, sequestering damaged genomes to prevent mutagenesis by facilitating removal or suppression of replication.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Developing agonists with different signalling profiles, or that exert some tissue selectivity can circumvent these on-target, unwanted effects. Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) offer the potential to do both, through modulation of agonist binding and signalling, as well as surface expression. The GLP-1R was found to interact with RAMP3, with the heterodimer able to bind agonist at the cell surface. RAMP3 expression biased the receptor towards Ca2+ mobilisation, away from the canonical cAMP-driven signalling. When examining G protein coupling, the interaction with RAMP3 reduced activation of the cognate Gs, but increased secondary couplings to Gq and Gi. These increased couplings led to an elevation in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion when cells overexpressing RAMP3 were stimulated with GLP-1.

Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, which label a specific SPN subtype characterized by a patchy distribution of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum, we found that these patchy striatonigral neurons constrain motor vigor in response to valence differentials. In a modified light/dark box test, mice exhibited differential walking speeds between the light and dark zones. Genetic ablation of these patchy SPNs disrupted restful slowing in the dark zone and increased zone discrimination by speed. In vivo recordings linked the activity of these neurons to zone occupancy, speed, and deceleration, with a specific role in mediating deceleration.

Here, we take a whole-transcriptome approach to identify Rnt1 cleavage sites throughout the yeast transcriptome in vivo, at single-nucleotide resolution. We discover previously unknown Rnt1 cleavage sites in many protein-coding regions and find that the sequences and structures necessary for cleavage mirror those required for the cleavage of known targets. We show that the nuclear localization of Rnt1 functions as an additional layer of target selection control and that cleaved mRNAs are likely exported to the cytoplasm to be degraded by Xrn1. Further, we find that several cleavage products are much more abundant in our degradome sequencing libraries than decapping products, and strikingly, mutations in one Rnt1 target, YDR514C, suppress the growth defect of a RNT1 deletion. Overexpression of YDR514C results in slow growth, further suggesting that Rnt1 may limit the expression of YDR514C to maintain proper cell growth.

Here we summarize the types of variants and their prevalence in the literature, and we present a comprehensive comparison of differences between them. A key finding is that a common variant that uses the minimum of assimilation rates rather than the minimum of carboxylation rates, which we call the \"min-A variant,\" makes different predictions than the original \"min-W variant,\" yet appears in approximately half of highly-cited publications and software tools that use the FvCB model. Another concern is that although leaf biochemistry restricts the range of CO2 partial pressures where limitations due to triose phosphate utilization (TPU) can occur, this restriction is commonly omitted from the model's equations. Among other potential issues, these variations can introduce errors exceeding 20% when estimating photosynthetic parameter values from CO2 response curves. It is therefore important to be aware of this source of error when fitting the model, to avoid using the min-A variant, and to include the biochemically-derived CO2 threshold for TPU limitations.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

M.; Frye, M. A.", "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) is a hormonal messenger that confers state-level changes upon the nervous system in both humans and flies. In Drosophila, lobula columnar (LC) cells are feature-detecting neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain, where each population forms an anatomically-distinct glomerulus with heterogeneous synaptic partners. Here, we investigated serotonin's effect on two LC populations with different 5-HT receptor expression profiles. Receptor expression does not predict neuromodulatory effects: LC15 expresses inhibitory 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, yet serotonin increases the amplitude of calcium responses to visual stimuli. LC12 expresses inhibitory 5-HT1A and excitatory 5-HT2A receptors, yet serotonin application does not influence visual responses. Serotonin targets select visual response properties, potentiating LC15 responses to a motion-defined bar and tuning the gain of responses to varying object velocity but has no influence on contrast sensitivity. Serotonin does not significantly facilitate LC15 responses in postsynaptic dendrites, only in the presynaptic terminals of the glomerulus, which suggests that the neuromodulatory effects are strongest in the central brain. Connectomics confirms that LC12 and LC15 share neither presynaptic inputs nor postsynaptic outputs in the central brain. The wiring diagram shows no synaptic interactions between the LC15 circuit and major serotonergic 5-HTPLP neurons, nor to other serotonergic neurons of the central brain, suggesting that endogenous 5-HT acts via paracrine transmission on non-serotonergic pathways. Lobula- and glomerulus-specific GABAergic and glutamatergic inhibitory partners, positioned to filter visual stimuli, are putative 5-HT targets. These results provide a comparative framework for the neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in visual processing.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a systematic framework for repurposing generative neural networks trained on one physiological context to build large-scale kinetic models tailored for another context, thereby offering a new avenue for efficiently constructing models with targeted desired properties suitable for various physiological scenarios. We showcase the effectiveness of this method through three case studies: (i) adjusting the modeled response speed of cellular metabolism in aerobic E. coli cultures, (ii) improving interpretability by identifying key enzymatic steps that limit the dynamic response speed of the metabolic models, and (iii) adapting our neural network to capture the distinct dynamic behavior of anaerobic E. coli.

Here, we established a highly efficient conditional knockout method in zebrafish by using homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated knockin and knockout technology, and generated betaPix conditional trap (betaPixct) allele in zebrafish. We found that betaPix in glia, but neither neurons, endothelial cells, nor pericytes, was critical for glial and vascular development and integrity, thus contributing to the formation of blood-brain barrier. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that microtubule aggregation signaling stathmins and pro-angiogenic transcription factors Zfhx3/4 were down-regulated in glial and neuronal progenitors, and further genetic analysis suggested that betaPix may acted upstream on the PAK1-Stathmin and Zfhx3/4-Vegfaa signaling to regulate glia migration and angiogenesis.

Supporting this, our population genetic simulations showed that structural variants accumulate more readily under higher outcrossing rates. These findings contradict classical population genetic expectations, showing that outcrossing can hinder the removal of structural mutations and complicate mutation purging by trapping small variants within larger mutations.

D.; Maisel, K.", "abstract": "The lymphatic vasculature plays a vital role in clearing interstitial fluid from tissues and guiding immune cell transport. Junctions between lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are important for preserving vascular integrity. Tight junction proteins like ZO1 work alongside adherens proteins such as VE-cadherin to regulate barrier function and vascular permeability. Fibroblasts contribute to the lymphatic interstitial environment by producing extracellular matrix components and affecting lymphatic functions and lymphangiogenesis. Despite their known roles, the direct impact of fibroblasts on LEC barrier function remains poorly understood. Here, we established a non-contact in vitro co-culture system to investigate how fibroblasts influence LEC junctions and permeability. We began by assessing the effect of secreted factors (secretomes) from normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) on human LECs (hLECs) that led to a 126% increase in the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the hLEC monolayer. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a >4-fold increase in the junctional expression of ZO1 and VE-cadherin, with no changes observed in PROX1 and LYVE1, key lymphatic markers. Additionally, transport of FITC-dextran across hLECs reduces by 24% upon NHDF secretome treatment. Co-culture of hLECs with growth factor-activated, NHDF(G) and inactivated, NHDF(B) fibroblasts increase TEER by 143% and 106%, respectively, indicating improved monolayer integrity. Confocal microscopy revealed that ZO1 expression increased by 2.1- and 2.0-fold, and VE-cadherin levels rose by 1.6- and 1.3-fold in the NHDF(G) and NHDF(B) groups, compared to untreated controls. Dextran permeability dropped by 30% with NHDF(G) and 15% with NHDF(B), confirming reduced permeability. A junction analyzer program (JAnaP) showed a rise in continuous ZO1 junctions from 84% in controls to over 96% in NHDF co-cultures. Besides, NHDFs significantly reduced discontinuous junctions, with a decrease in punctate junctions by 89% and 97% and perpendicular junctions by 64% and 62% with NHDF(G) and NHDF(B), respectively. Surprisingly, we found an opposite effect with normal human lung fibroblast (NHLF) secretome on hLEC junctional integrity and permeability. NHLFs significantly lowered TEER, along with ZO1 expression, and doubled dextran permeability across the hLEC monolayer. Treatment of hLECs with thrombin, a potent inflammatory mediator, led to impaired cell junctions, more profoundly in the presence of NHDFs. The RNA-seq data showed upregulation of key lymphatic markers in fibroblast-induced hLECs such as LYVE1, FOXC2, junctional genes CLDN5 and GJA4, and actin-related genes including ACTG1, RACK1, and RHOG, suggesting potential modulation of junctional integrity and cytoskeletal organization. In contrast, genes associated with endothelial adhesion to surrounding cells and extracellular matrix, such as ICAM1, VCAM1, ITGB1, ITGA, and SELE were downregulated, indicating reduced cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Fibroblast coculture also enhanced the expression of genes involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and increased levels of ECM-degrading metalloproteinases, potentially impairing ECM-LEC interactions. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes highlighted significant changes in biological pathways related to cell adhesion, ECM remodeling, inflammatory responses, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and angiogenesis. This study highlights the role of fibroblasts in regulating lymphatic barrier function by modulating endothelial cell-cell junctions. Notably, their impact on LECs varies based on fibroblast tissue origin, revealing functional heterogeneity. These findings offer valuable insights for developing targeted lymphatic delivery strategies to modulate lymphatic functions and improve therapeutic outcomes, including vaccine performance.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Columbiformes (pigeons and doves) are commonly found on poultry premises, yet little is known about their potential role in contemporary HPAIV disease ecology. Here we investigated the epidemiological role of pigeons (Columba livia) by determining their susceptibility using decreasing doses of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV (genotype AB). We investigated infection outcomes and transmission potential between pigeons and to chickens. Following direct inoculation, pigeons did not develop clinical signs, and only those inoculated with the highest dose shed viral RNA or seroconverted to H5N1-AB, revealing a MID50 of 105 EID50. Even in the high-dose group, only low-level shedding and environmental contamination was observed, and low-level viral RNA were present in the tissues of directly inoculated pigeons, with no distinct pathological lesions. Pigeons did not transmit the virus to pigeons or chickens placed in direct contact. We observed distinct differences in sialic acid receptor distribution in the pigeon respiratory tract compared to chickens and ducks. Together, these findings suggest that pigeons have low susceptibility to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV and are unlikely to contribute significantly to virus maintenance, transmission to poultry, or zoonotic infection.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear to what extent these differences reflect individual levels present at young adulthood or diverging aging trajectories at later ages. In this study, we analyze the aging dynamics of the volume of six brain structures based on MRI scans from a large cross-cohort longitudinal sample of cognitively healthy adults (n = 8,311 with 18,520 MRIs, ages from 18 to 97 years). From general assumptions about structural brain dynamics and measurement noise, a stochastic dynamical model was fit to the data to estimate both the variability and persistence of structural changes across adulthood. Using this model, we calculated how much of the variance in individual volumetric differences can be attributed to stable levels from young adulthood versus systematic changes at older ages, as well as the theoretical sensitivity of longitudinal studies to detect individual differences in changes. The findings were as follows: 1) Before age 60 years, inter-individual differences in neuroanatomical volumes almost exclusively reflect stable differences between individuals, while the influence from systematic differences in rate-of-change increases thereafter; up to 40 % of the variation being due to differences in change at 80 years. In contrast, ventricular volume reflects differences in change from early adulthood. 2) Current brain age-models are unlikely to be sensitive to detect differences in aging trajectories. 3) Imaging studies have a low reliability to detect inter-individual brain change before age 60. After 60 years, the study reliability increases sharply with longer intervals between scans and more modestly with additional intermediate observations. In conclusion, it is critical to distinguish stable levels from early adulthood from systematic differences in change when studying adult brain aging.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Although Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC; OSKM) can override identity in normal cells, PDAC resists reprogramming, indicating active epigenetic barriers preserving its memory. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin state and cell identity, yet their role as enforcers of cancer-specific transcriptional memory has been unknown. Using CRISPR interference screens, we identified PDAC-enriched lncRNAs whose depletion suppresses malignant programs, enhances OSKM-mediated reprogramming, and reduces tumorigenicity in vivo. Two of the most potent--ATXN7L3-AS1 and AC079921.2--are minimally expressed in normal pancreas but upregulated in PDAC. ATXN7L3-AS1 harbors pathogenic PDAC variants and is linked to mitotic progression, potentially ensuring faithful inheritance of malignant programs, whereas AC079921.2 is associated with a mesenchymal-like, invasion-prone transcriptional state that resists suppression during OSKM reprogramming. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for cancer-associated lncRNAs as active gatekeepers of transcriptional memory and malignant identity in PDAC, providing a conceptual and therapeutic framework to reset the epigenetic state, erase cancer cell memory, and re-sensitize tumors to differentiation- or reprogramming-based therapies.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

However, the developmental trajectory during the adolescent years is understudied and the underlying neural correlates of pragmatic development are unknown. In this study, we used an established fMRI paradigm contrasting indirect and direct speech act processing in a newly acquired adolescent sample (n = 51) and a previously collected adult sample (n = 57). The adolescent sample was split into two groups: Young (ages 13-15) and Mid (ages 16-18); and the adult sample (Old, ages 18-36) into two groups based on pragmatic skill level, established in separate behavioral tests. We observed increased activity with age in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex, and a combination of age-related differences and individual differences in adults in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the posterior cingulate cortex. These clusters were all located outside of the classical perisylvian language areas (\"the language network\"). The posterior cingulate cortex cluster overlapped with core nodes of the DMN network. We interpret the IPS finding in terms of its overlap with two relevant networks (one of them is the \"multiple demand\" network related to cognitive control). The results indicate that young adolescents and adults with low pragmatic skill may be over-interpreting direct speech acts as potentially indirect. The similarity between these two groups across results in turn indicate that a delayed adolescent development may lead to persistent difficulties in adulthood. We have shown that aspects of pragmatic development depend on cognitive abilities other than language and Theory of Mind. By studying adolescence, a presumably uniquely human extended developmental period, we provide a rare empirical angle on the question of which aspects of brain and cultural evolution contributed to the human communicative faculty.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata (CA) rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

However, linking the molecular identity of neurons to circuit architecture remains a key challenge. Here, we present a high-resolution developmental transcriptional atlas for the Drosophila melanogaster nerve cord, the central hub for sensory-motor circuits. With an unprecedented 38x coverage relative to its reference connectome1,2, our atlas captures extensive molecular diversity and enables robust alignment to the adult connectome. We identified three developmental principles underlying neuronal diversity in the nerve cord. First, timing of neurogenesis shapes molecular identity: embryonic-born neurons adopt discrete molecular identities, while larval-born neurons form continuous identities within lineages, a distinction we also found in the adult connectome. Second, we discovered that the continuous molecular progression is mirrored by the expression dynamics of 17 transcription factors. These factors are common to neurons from all lineages and provide a global molecular identity code based on birth order. Lastly, by mapping sex-specific transcriptional profiles to the connectome, we uncovered female-specific apoptosis and transcriptional divergence as key global drivers of sex-specification.

It is well established that the chemokine fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), expressed by cochlear macrophages, influences the density of those macrophages and promotes synaptic repair and spiral ganglion neuron survival in the injured cochlea. As CX3CR1 is expressed on both RM and Mo/Mo-M, it remains unclear if CX3CR1-expressing RM and Mo/Mo-M are distinct and differentially promote SGN survival after cochlear injury. Here, we demonstrate the use of fate mapping via a tamoxifen-inducible CX3CR1 mouse model (CX3CR1YFP-CreERT2/wildtype:R26RFP) wherein CX3CR1-expressing RM and Mo/Mo-M are endogenously labeled with different fluorescent reporters to define the heterogeneity in cochlear macrophages regarding their origin, turnover, spatiotemporal distribution, morphology, and fate following a loud acoustic trauma. After 60 days of tamoxifen injections at 4 weeks of age, long-lived cochlear RM were YFP+ RFP+ with 98.0 +/- 1.7% recombinant efficiency, and short-lived blood-circulating CX3CR1 lineage (Mo/Mo-M) were YFP+ RFP- with 2.5 +/- 1.1% recombinant efficiency. Following an acoustic trauma of 112 dB SPL at 8-16 kHz octave band for 2 hours, morphologically similar RM and Mo/Mo-M were observed in the spiral ganglion, lamina, ligament, and around the sensory epithelium. Quantification of RM and Mo/Mo-M in the spiral lamina and ganglion revealed distinct spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Furthermore, recruited Mo/Mo-M expressed classical monocyte markers such as Ly6C and CCR2. Both RM and Mo/Mo-M were positive for proliferation marker, Ki67, and negative for apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that the overall increase in macrophage numbers in the noise-injured cochlea is a contribution of both the proliferation of RM and recruitment of Mo/Mo-M. Probing for blood-clotting protein, fibrinogen, showed its presence in the cochlea after acoustic trauma, suggesting vascular damage that positively and strongly correlated with the time course of recruitment of blood-circulating Mo/Mo-M in the noise-injured cochlea. These data imply that macrophages in the noise-injured cochlea are heterogeneous regarding their ontogeny, distribution, and fate.

The spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus combined to the massive use of pyrethroid insecticides to limit arbovirus transmission resulted in the rise of resistance in various continents. Here, we investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying the recent adaptation of this mosquito to deltamethrin in La Reunion island. Bioassays confirmed the presence of resistance alleles in field populations. The resistance phenotype was further enhanced in the laboratory following a few generations of controlled selection. Combining whole genome Pool-seq and RNA-seq revealed no evidence of target-site resistance mutations but the over-expression and variant selection of detoxification enzymes associated with pyrethroid metabolism including cytochrome P450s, transferases and ABC-transporters. Among over-expressed detoxification genes, only one was linked to a gene duplication while polymorphism data suggest most of them being trans-regulated. Genome-wide selection signatures revealed a 9 Mb inverted superlocus responding to insecticide selection whose phenotypical importance remains uncertain. Altogether, this study indicates that the multigenic metabolic resistance phenotype observed in this insular territory mainly results from local adaptation. From an applied perspective, this study provides a set of markers to track pyrethroid resistance in the tiger mosquito in the South-West Indian Ocean. As this region is subjected to recurrent arbovirus outbreaks, the additive resistance phenotype that may arise from the introduction of Kdr mutations from other territories also calls for improving resistance surveillance at the regional scale.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile novel vector control strategies are being developed, chemical insecticides remain widely used to control mosquitoes transmitting human diseases such as the Asian tiger mosquito.

By combining two complementary genomic approaches, we showed that resistance is mainly caused by an increased insecticide detoxification while classical  Knock down resistance mutations affecting the target of the insecticide were not detected. We also showed that resistance is underlain by multiple genetic changes spread across the genome, supporting the local selection of resistance rather than the introduction of resistance alleles. Furthermore, we identified a large inverted supergene responding to insecticide selection. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic bases of insecticide resistance, enabling the implementation of molecular makers to improve the tracking of insecticide resistance in this major mosquito vector across the Indian Ocean.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

In addition, non-vocal motor impairments are reported in some individuals who stutter. Although its precise cause remains unknown, mutations in lysosomal trafficking proteins (such as GNPTAB) have been identified in a subgroup of people who stutter. To understand the functional significance of these mutations, transgenic Gnptab mice have been developed, and as expected, these mice exhibit vocal deficits throughout developmental stages. However, whether these mice also display non-vocal motor impairments is unknown. Our data reveal deficits in the breathing, locomotion, and grooming behaviors of the Gnptab mouse model, outlining a broader phenotype linked to GNPTAB mutations in stuttering. These findings suggest that lysosomal dysfunction may disrupt astrocyte-regulated motor circuits, affecting both vocal and non-vocal rhythmic behaviors that are central to stuttering neurophysiological symptoms.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Mathematical models have long been used to investigate disease dynamics in plants. An important component of such models is to account for spatial structure, since plant hosts are immobile and a majority of disease spread will often be localised. Here we apply a lattice-based mathematical modelling approach, a pair approximation, to model disease spread. While this method has previously been used to develop epidemiological theory, it has not been used to predict spread in a specific pathosystem. We fit our lattice-based epidemiological model to experimental data relating to Bahia bark scaling of citrus, an economically-important disease in north-eastern Brazil, and compare its performance to a more commonly used dispersal-kernel modelling approach. We show that the lattice-based model fits the data well, predicting a significant degree of near-neighbour infections, with similar estimated values of epidemiologically-meaningful parameters to the dispersal model. We highlight the pros and cons of the lattice-based approach and discuss how it may be used to predict disease spread and optimise control of plant diseases.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Background: Existing breast cancer risk models inadequately identify individuals at latent risk, particularly among women without known genetic mutations or family history. Risk is often underestimated or overestimated due to reliance on population-level data and neglect of cellular aging and mechanobiological alterations. Methods: We profiled primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) from women of varying ages and risk backgrounds using mechano-node-pore sensing (mechano-NPS), a high-throughput microfluidic platform that captures single-cell mechanical properties. Using machine learning, we developed a classifier, MechanoAge, to predict age-related mechanical phenotypes and introduce a novel index, mechano-RISQ, to quantify deviations linked to breast cancer risk. We further assessed the cytoskeletal protein keratin 14 (KRT14) as a molecular mediator of these mechanical states through overexpression and knockdown experiments. Findings: Cells from younger women carrying BRCA1/2 mutations or with a family history of breast cancer exhibited accelerated mechanical aging compared to age-matched controls. Elevated mechano-RISQ scores reflected an increased proportion of cells with \"older\" mechanical profiles. KRT14 overexpression induced an aged mechanical phenotype in younger cells, while knockdown partially reversed this state in older cells. CyTOF profiling and modeling showed KRT14 modulation impacted protein expression signatures associated with aging and risk, particularly in luminal cells. Interpretation: Mechanical properties of breast epithelial cells reflect biologic aging and cancer susceptibility. Mechano-RISQ offers a new approach for identifying individuals at elevated risk, especially among average-risk populations, and may complement existing risk models by incorporating biophysical measures of epithelial aging.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

H. gallinarum is of particular concern because of its role as a vector for the protozoan Histomonas meleagridis, the cause of blackhead disease. Currently, only the benzimidazole anthelmintic, fenbendazole (FBZ), is approved for use in poultry, and recently, FBZ resistance has been discovered and validated in populations of the turkey ascarid Ascaridia dissimilis and in ascarid of gallinaceous birds H. gallinarum. Here, we further explore the prevalence of resistance in poultry ascarids by testing FBZ efficacy against thirteen isolates of A. galli and eight isolates of H. gallinarum. Isolates were used to infect day-old naive chickens. Four weeks after infection, animals to be treated received the label-recommended dosage of FBZ (SafeGuard Aquasol) for five days, per the manufacturer's directions. One week after the fifth day of treatment, animals were euthanized and parasite burdens were counted to determine treatment efficacy between the untreated and treated groups. Resistance was identified and validated in a single isolate of A. galli, marking the first confirmed case in the species. All isolates of H. gallinarum were found to be resistant. The emergence of resistance in A. galli and the high prevalence of resistance in H. gallinarum highlight the growing concern of resistance in parasites of poultry. Without approved alternative treatments, the detrimental effects of infections cannot be mitigated in resistant populations, significantly impacting profit margins. Diagnostics that enable broader surveys are necessary to understand the full scope of the problem. However, we show that resistance is present across production species and should act as an impetus for the discovery of new treatments and the adoption of new management strategies.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Many tumors exhibit innate resistance or acquire resistance through immune evasion or neoantigen editing. A central factor in shaping these outcomes is the tumor mutational burden. However, cancer mutations can enhance or impair both cellular replication and immune recognition, reflecting the non-trivial role of mutational load in immunotherapy success and failure. Here, we present a minimal eco-evolutionary model that captures trade-offs between oncogenic and immunogenic mutations in cancer cell replication. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals a rich phase space, including an evolutionary bistable regime where both immunologically silent and mutationally active tumor strategies can coexist. Notably, the model explains two key eco-evolutionary mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy: preexisting resistance, driven by the persistence of silent clones within genetically unstable tumors; and immunoediting, where immune pressure selects for reduced antigenicity over time.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

NDE1 knockout leads to a caudal identity shift of neural progenitor cells in the organoids and mouse brains, coinciding with aberrant ERK signaling. Notably, downstream activation of the ERK pathway restored rostral PAX6 expression in human brain organoids.

Here, we assess how properties of the genetic architecture of gene expression constrain the space of plausible gene regulatory networks. We describe a structured causal model of gene expression regulation and consider how it interacts with biologically relevant properties of the gene regulatory network to alter the genomic distribution of expression heritability. Under our model, we find that the genetic architecture of gene expression is shaped in large part by local network motifs and by hub regulators that shorten paths through the network and act as key sources of trans-acting variance. Further, simulated networks with an enrichment of motifs and hub regulators best recapitulate the distribution of cis and trans heritability of gene expression as measured in a recent twin study. Taken together, our results suggest that the architecture of gene expression is sparser and more pleiotropic across genes than would be suggested by naive models of regulatory networks, which has important implications for future studies of complex traits.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

This spatially heterogeneous biomechanical remodeling was accompanied by upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammatory, and senescence pathways, and suppression of neurodevelopmental and synaptic gene networks.

This process is regionally heterogeneous, with cortical areas developing at different paces and trajectories. Leveraging submillimetre T1-weighted/T2w-weighted (T1w/T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from pre- and full-term neonates (n = 599, 0-7 weeks), we sampled intracortical microstructure profiles across the cortex and characterised the profiles' shapes according to their central moments. We found that gestational age at birth dominated the effects on early cortical development, with significant, global increases in microstructural density, increasing intracortical homogeneity and a bimodal change of the microstructural balance between superficial and deeper cortical layers. On the other hand, weeks since birth (i.e. postnatal age) exhibited different effects on microstructure, with density increasing at a slower pace, increasing intracortical heterogeneity, and intracortical balance only shifting towards deeper layers in posterior temporal, occipital, medial parietal areas and some prefrontal areas. These effects align with low spatial-frequency geometric eigenmodes of the human cortex, specifically the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and central-polar axes. Our findings demonstrate that separating prenatal from postnatal influences, and analysing intracortical profiles rather than macroscale features, provides finer-grained insights into how human cortical microstructure changes during perinatal development and lays the groundwork for investigating the biological underpinnings that govern normative cortical maturation.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

In plants, the histone demethylase INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION1 (IBM1) prevents heterochromatic silencing marks from accumulating on actively transcribed genes. Through a genetic screen of mutants defective in IBM1 production, we identified suppressor mutations in genes essential for maintaining balanced genome-wide epigenetic states. The gyrb3 mutation partly reversed DNA hypermethylation in IBM1-deficient plants, revealing a novel role for GyrB3, a nuclear protein combining domains from cyanobacterial gyrases and ELM2/SANT proteins involved in histone acetylation. In gyrb3 mutants, TEs exhibit transcriptional activity, showing reduced DNA methylation and increased histone H3 acetylation, both of which are epigenetic marks associated with expression activation. GyrB3 physically interacts with histone deacetylases like HISTONE DEACETYLASE6 (HDA6), likely mediating their activities at TEs. The functional overlap between HDA6 and GyrB3 is further supported by the observation that, similar to gyrb3, a mutation in hda6 suppresses the Ibm2 phenotype.

Melatonin treatment substantially improved root biomass, nodulation, nitrogen balance index, and yield-related traits, with the highest response observed in the genotype Kainong 308. Amplicon sequencing revealed that melatonin induced distinct genotype and compartment specific shifts in bacterial community composition, with the root bacteria showing the increased remodeling, including a 45.9% increase in unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Melatonin selectively enriched key Proteobacteria taxa such as Rhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Enterobacter hormaechei, known for their plant-growth promoting and biocontrol capabilities. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that melatonin-treated roots harbored more complex bacterial networks, and module #4 dominated by melatonin-induced Proteobacteria was strongly correlated with most of the plant traits.

Using super-resolution microscopy (SIM/STORM), we show that upon AAV2 endocytosis, the host upregulates microtubule detyrosination via GSK3{beta} CLASP2 signaling axis. Single particle tracking of the virus reveals that detyrosinated microtubules form a physical and functional barrier, restricting AAV2 motility and promoting lysosomal trapping.

Though a VAB-PxP interface has been identified for the mitochondrial adaptor Mcp1, whether other adaptors use identical binding mechanisms is unknown. Moreover, not every Vps13 function is connected to a known PxP adaptor, suggesting other adaptors may exist. Here, we validate the significance of the shared VAB-PxP interface by showing that mutations within this region inhibit both adaptor binding and Vps13 membrane targeting in vivo. Using predictive modeling, we demonstrate that while adaptors share a common Vps13-binding interface, slight differences between these interfaces may contribute to preferential binding and adaptor competition. Notably, we find that the VPS pathway functions independently of the PxP motif binding site, and extensive scanning mutagenesis did not reveal a dedicated VPS-specific adaptor interface.

This low-level signaling lipid drives vacuolar fragmentation and activates the V-ATPase proton pump, which acidifies the vacuole and drives salt sequestration. The vacuole-resident V-ATPase subunit Vph1 interacts with PI(3,5)P2 via its N-terminal domain (Vph1NT), directly linking lipid signaling to proton pump regulation. Under NaCl stress, PI(3,5)P2 rapidly accumulates, triggering increased V-ATPase activity and vacuolar remodeling; these responses are impaired by deficient PI(3,5)P2 synthesis. A Vph1NT-GFP fusion protein with no membrane domain is cytosolic without salt, but upon NaCl addition, rapidly relocalizes to a region adjacent to the vacuole in a PI(3,5)P2-dependent manner. The intensity and duration of this response depend on salt concentration. Vph1NT-GFP returns to the same location upon repeated salt challenge, suggesting that PI(3,5)P2 synthesis occurs at a localized domain/contact site.

Predicting conversion yields of cell wall-derived sugars during hydrolysis is challenging due to the complex underlying mechanisms and the labor-intensive nature of conventional assays. This study introduces an innovative pipeline that accurately quantifies cell wall autofluorescence intensity and morphological descriptors during enzymatic hydrolysis. The pipeline incorporates a novel adaptive drift compensation strategy which dynamically adjusts to the progression and extent of deconstruction ensuring robust analysis. Applied to time-lapse images of spruce wood enzymatic deconstruction, the pipeline revealed strong negative correlations of conversion yields during hydrolysis with both the dynamics of cell wall autofluorescence intensity and morphological descriptors. Phase-specific analysis uncovered distinct correlation patterns dependent on hydrolysis stage and sugar type. This non-destructive pipeline eliminates the need for extensive sampling and time-consuming chemical assays, establishing plant cell wall autofluorescence and morphological descriptors as accurate predictive real-time biomarkers of dynamics of sugar conversion yields. The findings provide a framework for accelerating the development of optimized biotechnological conversion processes.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Multi-omics approaches enable comprehensive profiling of different biological layers, yet integrating these data to understand the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe symbiosis, particularly under drought stress, remains a major challenge. We integrated genomic, metabolomic, and microbiome data from 198 soybean accessions grown under both control and drought conditions to identify environment-specific predictive features of plant phenotypes. We compared best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), genome-wide association study (GWAS), and a nonlinear machine learning model (Random Forest; RF) to evaluate their ability to detect informative features. RF models provided flexible variable selection and outperformed linear models in capturing nonlinear dependencies. Model interpretation using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that the isoflavone derivative daidzin and the drought-tolerant Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus are major contributors to phenotypic variation, specifically under drought stress. SHAP-based interaction networks revealed cross-omics links, such as connections between daidzin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Paenibacillus. The application of an interpretable machine learning approach to the plant phenotype prediction framework identifies multi-omics biomarkers and interactions, providing insights into plant adaptation to drought stress through environment-dependent rhizosphere networks and symbiotic associations.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Amino acids taken up from soil or synthesized in source tissues and transported to sink tissues influence plant development and NUE. Amino acid permeases (AAPs) mediate amino acid uptake and transport and influence plant development, yield and NUE. NUE is a complex trait critical for improving rice productivity under variable N supply. Amino acid permeases such as OsAAP3, OsAAP5, and OsAAP11 have been shown to function as negative regulators of NUE in Japonica rice, yet their roles in Indica rice remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we evaluated selected Indica genotypes under contrasting N regimes seedlings were tested under high nitrate (HN), high ammonium (HA), and low N (LN) conditions, and field performance was assessed under N120 (optimum N) and N0 (low N). Our aim was to relate performance differences to the SNP status in these three genes, thereby clarifying their influence on N uptake, assimilation, yield potential, and N stress adaptation. ARC 10799 had non-synonymous SNP in OsAAP3, OsAAP5 and OsAAP11. Rice accessions like Local, NCS901, and Bhainsa Mundariya, showed superior biomass accumulation relative to MTU1010. Interestingly, the trend observed in the NUE calculated in seedling stage was similar to those proven in field evaluation and this proves that in general, genotypes with non-synonymous mutation in AAP3, AAP5 and AAP11 in comparison to Japonica showed better growth and N content. Data suggests an N induced regulation of physiological parameters and the changes in NUE parameters was at least in part, related to variation in biomass, plant height, photosynthesis and pigment content related parameters. The comparatively dissimilar trends in shown by different AAP haplotypes indicates the possibility of high or low correlation trait-wise, offering an opportunity to identify significant contrasts in a divergent set of AAP haplotypes. The previous reports and current findings opens new avenues and insights for improving rice yield, quality and NUE by changes in AAP haplotypes that occur naturally or created by precise genome editing.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

An alternative proposition is use of microalgal biomass for fertilisation, which adds carbon to the soil, is as effective as mineral fertiliser when comparing the vegetative grown of wheat and barley, and has the advantage of accumulating nutrients present in wastewater if used as a growth media, with 80-90% removal efficiencies for N and P. This means algae can both be used as a fertiliser and wastewater treatment, which supports the possibility of recycling nutrients within the barley to malt to whisky value chain, as nutrients from pot ale and spent lees could be reclaimed and used on the subsequent barley crop. This study is the first step in realising that circular economy. We sought to quantify the phenology, reflectance indices, yield components (including yield itself) and malt quality of barley cv. Laureate grown with either Chlorella vulgaris powder or mineral fertiliser, with both treatments providing equal amounts of nitrogen at the appropriate level for malting spring barley, 118kg(N)/ha accounting for soil mineral nitrogen. We performed three glasshouse experiments to assess the repeatability of our findings and performed a field trial from which we malted the grain. Both lines of inquiry showed that plants grown with algae and mineral fertiliser do not significantly differ in any yield component, yield or malt quality, with the exception of total malt nitrogen.

One of the most predominant of such diseases is esca, which is a major cause of vineyard dieback, with rising incidence worldwide over the past decade. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying esca symptom development remain unclear. In this study, we leveraged the heterogeneous expression of esca-symptoms within individual grapevines to investigate molecular responses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic leaf tissues. By combining metabolite profiling, RNA-seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we show that metabolic alterations and extensive transcriptomic reprogramming are restricted to symptomatic leaves and are partially associated with local changes in DNA methylation. Asymptomatic leaves display distinct DNA methylation changes, some of which are shared with symptomatic tissues, suggesting a systemic response to the disease at the epigenetic level. Notably, subset of these methylation marks are observable prior to symptom emergence, highlighting the potential of epigenetic biomarkers for the early detection of trunk diseases in perennial plants.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Using a combination of advanced bioimaging techniques - including confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and X-ray nano-computed tomography (nano-CT), we mapped the uptake and distribution pathways of nPAA-MnO2 compared to ionic Mn. While soluble Mn2+ ions primarily enter through hydrophilic cuticular pores, nPAA-MnO2 penetrates leaves via stomata, facilitated by the application of an organosilicone surfactant and glycerol to enhance wetting and hydraulic activation of stomatal pores. Within a few hours, nPAA-MnO2 accumulated in the sub-stomatal cavity and mesophyll apoplast, gradually releasing bioavailable Mn ions in the acidic apoplast environment. Moreover, labeling experiments with tracer ions revealed nPAA-MnO2 hot-spots around the vascular bundles and a limited but significant basipetal translocation of intact nanoparticles out of the foliar application zone, a pivotal step towards converting immobile nutrients such as Mn into mobile ones. Importantly, and unlike ionic Mn solutions, nPAA-MnO2 could be applied at high doses without causing leaf scorching and cytotoxicity, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient foliar fertilization practices.

PDOs model tumorigenesis and allow for screening of novel therapeutics personalized to individual patients. However, acquiring cells to generate PDOs is cumbersome. We demonstrate the feasibility of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for harvesting cells for PDOs modeling ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Methods: Surgical specimens from patients with biopsy-proven DCIS were used for this study. Core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed on fresh specimens in the operating room, and tissue was mechanically dissociated before culture in basement membrane extract (BME) and organoid medium to generate PDOs. FNAB was performed in the gross room on fresh specimens, and the remaining aspirate was similarly submitted for PDO culture. Results: PDOs were successfully generated in 15/18 specimens obtained by CNB and 7/11 specimens obtained by FNAB. The average time to initial organoid growth was 4 days for FNAB specimens compared to 19.3 days for CNB specimens. Tumor cells were seen on 7/11 FNAB smears and 16/18 CNB touch preps. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of both luminal and myoepithelial cells in derived PDOs. Conclusions: FNAB effectively obtains cells for PDOs modeling DCIS. CNB after mincing yielded PDOs with a high success rate, but they were slow to establish. Notably, the time to organoid growth was significantly shorter for FNAB specimens.

Here, we reconstitute LD formation in vitro using purified LDAC and membranes containing physiologic levels of TG, demonstrating that the LDAC is both necessary and sufficient to catalyze oil-phase formation below the threshold of spontaneous phase separation. Structural studies of the LDAC reveal that LDAF1 forms a central ring within a seipin cage, creating a toroidal, membrane-spanning structure. Molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical assays show that this structure forms a selective chamber within the ER bilayer that limits phospholipids but allows TG to access a reaction compartment between the inner and outer rings of the LDAC. Within this compartment, TG interacts with LDAF1 and each other to form an oil phase to initiate LD formation. Thus, the LDAC acts as a protein catalyst for oil-phase separation in cells, revealing a fundamental mechanism for how cells resolve the biophysical challenge of storing oils within a hydrophilic environment in an organized manner.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

This is particularly true for keloids, the example of pathological scarring exploited in this study, as there is no animal model. Our emerging appreciation of fibroblast heterogeneity from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information leaves a knowledge gap about what is represented in typical fibroblast cultures. Specifically, it is important to know whether quantitative differences in fibroblast subtypes observed in pathological tissues are represented and/or whether disease-associated molecular alterations of subtypes are maintained. This study performed scRNA-seq on patient-matched keloid and normal adjacent dermis immediately following surgical removal, which was compared to sc- and bulk-RNA-seq on primary dermal fibroblast cultures from the same samples after 4+ passages. Freshly dissociated tissue showed anticipated differences in cell proportions in keloid versus normal skin; however, comparably for both tissue types, there was an assimilation of fibroblast subtypes after culture. Cultured cells clustered conspicuously from the original populations, with evidence of only minor heterogeneity persisting. Cells displayed, to varying degrees, elements of each of the original subset signatures, with FAP+/SFRP2+ mesenchymal features the strongest. Pseudo-bulk analysis of mesenchymal subpopulations ex vivo showed cell-intrinsic keloid versus normal skin transcriptional differences consistent with current disease understanding; however, only a subset of these persisted in vitro.

While patterning is well studied at the level of multicellular organisms, even single cells need to undergo morphogenesis and form spatial patterns. Stentor coeruleus is a large ciliate that has been a classical system for studying patterning and morphogenesis due to its distinctive shape and organization of easily visible cortical structures which show a clear localization along the anterior-posterior body axis. The cortex of Stentor is made of two cytoskeletal layers, one composed of microtubules, and one composed of a network of centrin-family EF hand proteins, which form a branched network in the anterior half of the cell and long thick bundles known as myonemes in the posterior half. Sfi1 family proteins scaffold the assembly of centrin filaments throughout the eukaryotes, and function as scaffolding proteins in myonemal contractile systems found in some ciliates. A set of Sfi1 proteins upregulated during regeneration in Stentor were found to have a role in maintaining anterior/posterior differences in centrin patterning. Loss of this distinct anterior-posterior patterning leads to defects in regeneration and contraction. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Sfi1 genes, we have found that cells fail to regenerate their oral apparatus, with early expressed Sfi1 genes more critical for oral primordium (assembly of organized basal bodies that become the new oral apparatus) formation than those expressed later. Additionally, different Sfi1 proteins appear to be recruited sequentially to the growing primordium in an order that matches the time at which they are required for progression of regeneration. Knockdown of Sfi1 isoforms that results in reduced myoneme cables impairs contraction such that cells fail to contract in response to a stimulus or do not fully contract.

By combining DNA methylation sequencing data across a range of timescales with a statistical modeling-based approach, we show that DNA methylation aging is governed by a three-fold hierarchy of processes that dominate on distinct timescales: individual stochastic events in which enzymes interact with the DNA and with each other (milliseconds); the convergence of molecular concentrations to steady states (days to months); and stochastic transitions between these steady states (years to decades).

Still, under physiological conditions, they show no apparent signs of cellular injury. We hypothesized that the study of transcription factors (TFs) enriched in MCD cells might identify pathways of stress resilience. Methods We generated single-cell expression data from mouse kidneys and predicted in silico candidate TFs with MCD-enriched expression and activity. To investigate the transcriptomic effects of perturbing these candidate TFs, we devised a single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. Results We found that perturbation of interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (Ilf2), Krueppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), and JunB proto-oncogene (Junb) significantly impacted IMCD3 cells' gene expression programs, including genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and stress-related intracellular signaling, highlighting these TFs as potential regulators of cell-specific resilience. We then focused on Ilf2, validated its impact on gene expression signatures by RNA sequencing, and identified a further role of Ilf2 in the splicing of genes involved in epithelial cellular dynamics and stress responses. Loss of Ilf2 function in IMCD3 cells resulted in nuclear atypia, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased cell death in response to osmotic stress.

Individual species vary in their contributions to -diversity (Species Contribution to {beta}-diversity, species-{beta}), yet our understanding of how species characteristics shape these contributions remains limited. Additionally, although the ecological processes influencing {beta}-diversity are known to vary with spatial scale, we lack understanding of how species contributions, or their underlying determinants, change across scales. Here, we modelled how plant functional traits, phylogenetic relatedness, and introduction status influence their contributions to {beta}-diversity using plant community data from 429 plots surveyed from 2017-2023 across three nested spatial scales (up to 1 km2) in nine sites spanning four countries. We extended the analysis to broader spatial extents (100 km2 to the entire UK) using GBIF occurrence data. We found that functional traits associated with competitive ability influenced species-{beta}, but the direction and strength of their effects varied with scale. Likewise, phylogenetic novelty increased species-{beta} at small scales but reduced it at larger ones. After accounting for traits and phylogeny, introduced species consistently contributed less to {beta}-diversity than native species - especially at broader spatial extents. These results demonstrate that species ecological and evolutionary characteristics shape their contributions to {beta}-diversity, but that these effects are scale-dependent. Our findings highlight the importance of scale-explicit approaches in understanding both the determinants of {beta}-diversity, and how we can combat its loss to mitigate biotic homogenisation.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Neurons are particularly vulnerable to proteostasis collapse due to their post-mitotic and long-lived nature and thus represent a unique cell type to understand the dynamics of proteostasis throughout development, maturation, and aging. Here, we utilized a dual-species co-culture model of human excitatory neurons and mouse glia to investigate cell type-specific, age-related changes in the proteostasis network using data-independent acquisition (DIA) LC-MS/MS proteomics. We quantified branch-specific unfolded protein response (UPR) activation by monitoring curated effector proteins downstream of the ATF6, IRE1/XBP1s, and PERK pathways, enabling a comprehensive, unbiased evaluation of UPR dynamics during neuronal aging. Species-specific analysis revealed that aging neurons largely preserved proteostasis, although they showed some signs of collapse, primarily in ER-to-Golgi transport mechanisms. However, these changes were accompanied by upregulation of proteostasis-related machinery and activation of the ATF6 branch, as well as maintenance of the XBP1s and PERK branches of the UPR with age. In contrast, glia exhibited broad downregulation of proteostasis factors and UPR components, independent of neuronal presence. Furthermore, we quantified stimulus-specific modulation of select UPR branches in aged neurons exposed to pharmacologic ER stressors. These findings highlight distinct, cell-type-specific stress adaptations during aging and provide a valuable proteomic resource for dissecting proteostasis and UPR regulation in the aging brain.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the potential of taurine, a close chemical analogue of tramiprosate, to modulate ApoE4-mediated pathological processes. Using an integrated approach, including molecular dynamics simulations, static light scattering, mass spectrometry, and cerebral organoid models, we investigated taurine's effects on ApoE4 aggregation. We found that taurine effectively inhibits ApoE4 aggregation.

UCH37 (also known as UCHL5), a proteasomal DUB, plays roles in protein degradation, DNA repair, and transcription and is overexpressed in several cancers. Despite its relevance, the precise functions of UCH37 within the proteasome and the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex remain unclear. Current small-molecule inhibitors exhibit broad, off-target effects, limiting their utility both therapeutically and as probes for UCH37 function. Here, we report the development of highly potent, selective nanobody-based inhibitors for UCH37. Using yeast surface display, we generated nanobodies targeting distinct Ub-binding sites on UCH37, with binding specificity confirmed by X-ray crystallography and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We find that the nanobody targeting the canonical Ub binding site serves as a pan-UCH37 inhibitor, while the one binding to the K48 chain-specific site selectively inhibits Ub chain debranching. Expression of this Ub chain debranching-specific nanobody in cells enabled identification of proteins whose degradation depends on UCH37.

Recently, the first Actinomycete biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the production of a tambjamine (BE-18591) was discovered in Streptomyces albus, and bioinformatic analysis suggested the alkylamine tail component is constructed using disparate biosynthetic logic than employed by Proteobacteria to assemble structurally similar tambjamines YP1 and MYP1. Here, we report the experimental characterization of four novel streptomycete proteins and demonstrate that these enable the unique, late-stage assembly of the alkylamine component of BE-18951. Specifically, a fatty acyl-carrier protein (TabQ) is loaded with a 12-carbon acyl chain, selected for, in part, through the action of an editing type II thioesterase (TabJ). The resulting C12-TabQ adduct is then processed to an aldehyde by a novel acyl-ACP reductase (TabE) that harbors none of the telltale amino acid signatures that typically identify these proteins. The resulting aldehyde is finally converted to the amine by an {omega}-transaminase (TabA) that demonstrates some degree of promiscuity. These four proteins encoded by the BE-18591 BGC in Streptomyces albus enable the assembly of the fatty amine that is ultimately incorporated into the tambjamine.

We show that tau promotes the organization of MTs into diverse architectures, including bundles, clusters, and networks, depending on its concentration and vesicle size. In vitro assays confirm that while tau binds and bundles MTs, it does not directly bundle actin. However, tau facilitates MT-actin colocalization in the presence of actin crosslinkers with distinct properties. Fascin, which forms rigid actin bundles, significantly enhances MT-actin colocalization with tau, whereas -actinin, which forms flexible actin bundles, induces colocalization in vesicles but not in bulk conditions.

They are fluid-filled cavities surrounded by an epithelial monolayer. Cysts grow during development and their interactions shape organs. While their growth dynamics as single structures are well characterised, the physical mechanisms underlying their interaction remain poorly understood. Here we design a minimal assay of interacting cyst doublets based on microfabrication, quantitative biology, and theory to show that Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cyst interactions are essentially determined by the rheological properties of their epithelial monolayers. We report two phases of interaction between epithelial cysts: coalescence of cellular monolayers and lumen fusion, with similar speeds of 0.3 m/h. We modulate the distribution of interaction phenotypes by reducing cell-cell adhesion using E-cadherin knock-out MDCK cells and we report that E-cadherin depletion promotes lumen fusion. Remarkably, the dynamics of coalescence and fusion are conserved between both cell lines. To understand the conserved speeds and the effect of cell-cell adhesion, we model the mechanical behavior of cyst doublets as a complex fluid to predict a speed determined by viscosity, a stretch-dependent monolayer tension, and the adhesion energy between cells. We measure these parameters through rheological experiments using micropipette aspiration and lumen drainage, which span the full range of stretch. A key insight from this analysis is that accounting for the tension dependence on stretch is is essential to capture the different dynamics observed during cyst interaction. Using these rheological measurements, we successfully recapitulate the conserved speed.

Given that the size of the capsid is comparable to the pore dimensions, these new findings raise questions regarding the energetics and dynamics of capsid passage across the significant entropic barrier created by the disordered FG nucleoporins (FG nups) in the NPC central channel. Here, we develop an analytical model for the transport of the HIV-1 capsid that considers the geometry of the capsid and pore, the free energy barrier due to the FG nups, and capsid-nup interactions. Our results show that capsid entry into the pore is favorable if the narrow end enters first, consistent with experimental observations, and that increasing the capsid-nup interaction strength enhances inward capsid flux. However, capsid-nup interaction alone is insufficient for complete capsid nuclear import and competitive binding by the nuclear factor CPSF6 to FG-binding sites on the capsid can serve as a ratcheting mechanism for full nuclear import. We show that nuclear import is arrested below a minimum CPSF6 concentration, consistent with experimental observations, and that pore dilation or capsid deformation can accelerate the translocation process.

One strategy to overcome this limitation is to aggregate mutations from proteins sharing the same protein domain. Here we constructed a benchmark of cancer driver and passenger mutations, based on the known experimental and clinical studies, and systematically evaluated the applicability of methods that aggregate mutations across different mutation types and protein domains. We found that accounting for evidence mutations from different types of amino acid substitutions occurring in the same protein position enhances the classification performance. Furthermore, accounting for evidence mutations from paralogous proteins in the domain family increased the precision but compromised the overall classification accuracy.

We further combine this approach with spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and patient-derived organoids to uncover a dynamic, co-evolutionary relationship between tumor architecture and cell states. We identify clinically relevant architectural interfaces in CRC tissue that diversify cellular identities by favoring distinct cancer stem cell states and thus promote evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Specifically, tissue fragmentation and associated compressive forces promote loss of classic stem cell signature and acquisition of fetal/regenerative stem cell states, which initially emerges as a hybrid state with features of epithelial-to-mesenchyme (EMT) transition. Additional tumor stroma communication then diversifies these states into distinct stem cell and EMT states at the invasive margins of tumors.

We show that families with TP53 p.R181H and p.R181C variants have an attenuated cancer risk phenotype compared to patients with hotspot dominant negative loss of function TP53 variants. Despite this phenotype, we find that p53 R181H and R181C variants have significantly reduced ability to bind to p53 promoter/enhancer target sequences and transactivate p53 target genes, similar to null variants. However, p53 R181H and R181C retain wild-type p53 structure and tetramerization. In addition, R181-mutant cells undergo apoptosis through wild-type p53 activity at the mitochondria.

Due to its aggressive behavior and limited therapeutic options, patient prognosis is generally poor. Tumor cells produce excess lactate via anerobic glycolysis, and it regulate gene expressions through histone lactylation in response to cellular metabolic conditions. However, how histone lactylation affects biological behavior under glucose-limited conditions in HSA remains unknown. Here, we established canine HSA cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models and investigated the role of histone lactylation during glucose deprivation. HSA cells exhibited higher global histone lactylation levels than normal endothelial cells. Although glucose restriction reduced global histone lactylation levels, Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) analysis revealed enrichment of lactylation peaks at transcription-start sites (TSSs) of ATF4-regulated stress-response, asparagine biosynthesis and immune-related genes. TSSs of stress-response genes were co-occupied with RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 and showed increased gene expressions, suggesting that lactylation at TSSs activated transcription under glucose-deprived conditions. [U-13C]glutamine tracing indicated that HSA cells synthesized asparagine from glutamine when glucose was scarce. Asparagine supplementation modestly activated cell proliferation. In HSA patient tissues, H3K18la levels were heterogeneous, and M2-like macrophages preferentially infiltrated tumor regions showing low histone lactylation levels. Consistently, glucose-starved HSA cells attracted macrophages and induced M2-like polarization in vitro. These findings demonstrate that lysine lactylation, possibly histone lactylation, persists even under glucose-deprived conditions and regulate transcription that supports tumor cell survival and fosters a pro-tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

To identify genetic drivers of ET resistance, we conducted an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in MCF7 cells implanted into ovariectomized nude mice under estrogen-deprived conditions. NFKB1 emerged as a top candidate whose loss promoted estrogen-independent tumor growth and recurrence. Functional studies confirmed that NFKB1 deficiency enhanced tumorigenicity and conferred resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that NFKB1 loss activated canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling, leading to inflammatory gene induction and hyperactivation of ER signaling. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of NF-{kappa}B signaling restored ET sensitivity in NFKB1-deficient cells. Clinically, NFKB1 downregulation was enriched in ER+ breast tumors and associated with poor patient outcomes. Collectively, these findings establish NFKB1 as a key suppressor of ET resistance, uncover a mechanistic link between inflammation and ER reactivation, and highlight NF-{kappa}B signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in NFKB1-deficient ER+ breast cancer.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

While the genetic and transcriptomic drivers of PDAC progression have been well studied, the mechanisms by which these molecular changes translate into functional, invasive behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we uncover a striking level of tissue organization, characterized by previously unrecognized spatial and geometric properties within and among tumor structures. Leveraging the first large-scale, AI-assisted, human-curated PDAC atlas from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, we annotated, classified, and characterized 144,474 malignant and normal structures from treatment-naive (n=118) and neoadjuvant-treated PDAC patients (n=50). Additionally, we developed a new computational tool, SHAPE, to investigate PDAC aggressiveness through a comprehensive geometrization of cancer progression. Using traditional H&E-stained slides and three-dimensional (3D) tissue reconstruction experiments, we observed that invading tumor structures display an eccentric morphology with pronounced local angular coherence. These geometric and spatial properties revealed coherent architectural patterns, with invasive structures closely tracking vessels and nerves as they infiltrate surrounding tissue. Mechanistically, integration of morphological features from 39,045annotated tumor structures with whole-genome and RNA sequencing data revealed that PDACs with numerous eccentric structures exhibit increased copy number alterations (CNAs), loss of heterozygosity (LoH) on the p-arm of chromosome 17, and a quasi-mesenchymal/basal-like molecular subtype. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of 1,650 tumor structures from six additional PDAC patients further confirmed upregulation of invasive cellular programs within highly eccentric structures, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, coagulation, and complement pathways, underscoring their infiltrative nature. Finally, cross-validation of our AI-based method enabled a fully automated, highly interpretable computational approach to assist pathologists and clinicians in evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, predicting patient survival, and guiding chemotherapy in adjuvant settings.

This variability impacts the design and effectiveness of fluorescence sensing systems used in medical imaging and diagnostics. Aim: Provide the first excitation-emission matrix (EEM) characterization of ICG in different microenvironments to comprehensively understand spectral shifts, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions, and 3D-printed (3DP) resin. Approach: EEMs and absorbance spectra of ICG in DMSO, BSA solutions, and 3DP resin were acquired using a CCD-based fluorescence and absorbance spectrometer. The study investigated the impact of these microenvironments and varying concentrations on ICG's fluorescence behavior. Results: ICG in DMSO exhibited symmetric spectra across varying excitation wavelengths, confirming conventional fluorophore behavior. In contrast, ICG in BSA solution and 3DP resin showed a notable 'rotation' of central spectral features, indicative of red-edge excitation shifts (REES), such that fluorescence emission varied with excitation wavelength. Furthermore, varying ICG concentration measurements showed fluorescence quenching, concentration-dependent red shifts (CDRS), and disparities between absorbance and emission spectra due to inner filter effects (IFE). Conclusions: This study provides the first EEM characterization of ICG alongside the first report of REES in FGS fluorophores. These results highlight the importance of considering excitation wavelengths in spectral comparisons, illustrating that EEM data offers more comprehensive analysis than conventional fluorescence spectra collected at a single excitation wavelength. This study lays the groundwork for improved fluorophore characterizations for advancing fluorescence sensing in clinical applications, including FGS imaging.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

The study of chromatin has mostly been restricted to defining its function in the nucleus, where histone proteins fulfil vital roles in packaging genomic DNA and regulating transcription. However, chromatin components can be released into the extracellular space, either intentionally via cellular secretion or during disease-induced cell death. These extracellular chromatin components, depending on the context, can consist of: free histones, free DNA, intact nucleosomes (histone octamers wrapped by DNA), or heterogeneous, higher order structures such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). They have been associated with diverse pathologies such as inflammation, cancer, and sepsis, and distinct toxic effects. However, there is a widely acknowledged lack of methods that distinguish between them and between their unique functions. Here, we now address protein observer effects to explore the fate and function of extracellular free histones by utilizing FIRESCAPE ([18F]-Fluorine Isotopic Radiolabeling Enabling Scanning of Clearance After Proteolytic Events), a novel radiolabeling concept that leverages the unique, high-sensitivity properties of the radioisotope fluorine-18, 18F, and residue-specific protein editing chemistry. By installing close and then 'true' 18F-containing protein sidechain mimics site-specifically, FIRESCAPE enables the hierarchical in vivo scanning of the half-lives, proteolytic susceptibility and clearance of single residues in a protein of interest, and at microdoses far below toxic levels (low nanomole). These 'radioequivalent' proteins bearing near-zero-size, zero-background labels now precisely reveal the strikingly distinct distribution, half-lives, damage-inducing abilities and accumulation of free extracellular histones in cellulo and in vivo compared to intact nucleosomes. Free extracellular histone H3 is rapidly cleared from circulation, mediated first by proteolysis of the histone tail. By contrast, direct injection of free histones vs nucleosomes into tissue that is unprotected by such proteolysis (brain), provokes a starkly different response; free histones exhibited limited diffusion and swiftly promoted damage both in cell culture and in vivo, whilst intact nucleosomes were essentially passive and benign. Remarkably, synthetic extracellular histone H3 was observed to enter cells and integrate into chromatin, indistinguishable from native H3 in both localization and post-translational modification (PTM) accumulation, yet paired with cellular and tissue damage. The exploratory studies described here now provide much needed clarity to the distinct fates and effects of extracellular histones vs nucleosomes, in particular the strongly damaging effects of free histones, their rapid uptake into cells, and an associated histone-specific proteolysis pathway via the removal of the histone tail.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

As cross-links are typically of lower abundance than linear peptides, only a small fraction of tandem mass spectra (MS2) obtained by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) is informative for cross-link identification. To improve MS2 of low-abundance ions/species, we optimized a previously described targeted mass spectrometry method called Accurate Inclusion Mass Screening (AIMS) and named the modified method TAIMS for Target-enhanced AIMS. Compared to DDA, TAIMS significantly improved the quality of MS2 as indicated by enhanced fragment ion coverage, E-value, and seven other metrics. Of an E. coli lysate cross-linked with disuccinimidyl sulfoxide, the percentage of high-quality MS2 among identified cross-link precursor ions increased from 43% by DDA to 95% by TAIMS. Additionally, 43% of the inclusion-list entries generated from unidentified cross-link-spectrum matches gained identity through TAIMS, of which 76% turned out to be linear peptides and 14% being cross-links, including 13 inter-molecular cross-links missed entirely by DDA. Overall, TAIMS increased high-confidence cross-link identifications by 53 to 129%, counting precursor ions. Additionally, TAIMS markedly improved the precision of cross-link site localization and prevented sensitivity loss in cross-link search against large databases. We also demonstrate that TAIMS is a general method for identification of low-abundance, post-translationally modified peptides.

Using protein purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified MED16 as a binding partner of UBP1-TFCP2. Gene expression analyses showed that UBP1 interacts with MED16 to activate a subset of silenced genes involved in lung homeostasis, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Conversely, the MED16-UBP1 interaction suppresses HIV-1 transcription, thereby reinforcing viral latency. Mechanistically, MED16 and UBP1 cooperatively bind the HIV-1 transcriptional start site (TSS) to inhibit preinitiation complex assembly.

Completeness alone is not an appropriate metric, as a nominally complete dataset can be obtained with a much smaller number of images, and thus multiplicity, than is needed to produce a final dataset with well estimated merged intensity values. Insufficient data result in alarmingly reasonable processing statistics and plausible electron density maps that contain almost no experimental signal, instead being dominated by the phases from the phasing model. We have therefore established a simple electron density-based test to determine whether enough data have been collected, and implemented this in the autoprocessing pipeline at the T-REXX endstation on beamline P14 at PETRA III.

How these physical behaviors manifest inside a living animal remains unclear due to limitations of conventional imaging and analysis approaches. Here, we establish a quantitative framework for imaging and tracking neutrophil and macrophage dynamics in larval zebrafish, spanning a large fraction of the animal for multi-hour timescales with few-minute temporal resolution. We focus especially on the gut, examining innate immune responses to different preparations of the intestinal microbiome. Using light sheet fluorescence microscopy and trajectory analysis of hundreds of individual cells, we characterize speeds, directional persistence measures, and cellular morphology to reveal distinct population behaviors. Individual immune cells exhibit stable motility phenotypes, favoring predominantly motile or non-motile states rather than frequent transitions between them. Gut architecture constrains migration patterns as demonstrated by preferential anterior-posterior movement and a high probability of cells remaining in the vicinity of the gut throughout the imaging duration. Macrophages display significantly reduced sphericity during motile periods compared to non-motile periods, providing a morphological signature that may enable inference of dynamic behavior from static snapshots. Surprisingly, migration patterns remain consistent across diverse microbial conditions -- germ-free, conventionally reared, and colonized by two strains of a zebrafish-native Vibrio species -- indicating that tissue structure exerts a stronger influence than bacterial stimuli on immune surveillance dynamics. Previously observed tissue damage by the wild-type Vibrio strain, and the resulting recruitment of immune cells towards the damage site, provided the only microbe-specific cellular behavior.

However, the small oligomers that are critical early species in the aggregation cascade are difficult to monitor directly owing to their heterogeneity and transience, complicating efforts to define aggregation mechanisms and target oligomers therapeutically. Here, we observe changes in oligomer populations directly using single-molecule mass photometry (SMMP). Studying the pathogenic P301L mutant of tau protein linked to frontotemporal dementia, we globally fit the growth/decay kinetics for every oligomer population observed by SMMP to microscopic models of aggregation. A simple extension to the best-fit model also accounts for amyloid fibril kinetics, as monitored by Thioflavin T fluorescence, providing the first quantitative model of aggregation kinetics across all stages of the cascade based on direct observation. Crucially, we find that models fitting amyloid kinetics alone fail to capture oligomer behavior, implying that -- contrary to standard practice -- amyloid kinetics cannot be relied on to deduce aggregation mechanisms. Furthermore, there is no single rate-limiting nucleation step preceding rapid growth, as generally assumed, suggesting that standard models of aggregation are overly simplistic. Repeating the analysis in the presence of aggregation inhibitors allows identification of the discrete steps in the cascade affected by the inhibitors.

We showed that at saturating [ATP], ClpA translocated at ~20 aa s-1, with the kinetic step size, i.e., the average number of amino acids (aa) translocated between two rate-limiting steps being ~14 aa step-1. Adding ClpP increased the rate to ~36 aa s-1 and decreased the kinetic step-size to ~5 aa step-1. Here we apply this method to substrates containing folded Titin I27 domains. We report that at saturating [ATP], ClpA unfolded and translocated at ~12 aa s-1, nearly half the rate of translocation alone. However, in the presence of ClpP, ClpA exhibited a rate of ~40 aa s-1, representing no reduction in rate over translocation alone. Interestingly, unlike translocation alone, the kinetic step-size for unfolding and translocation was ~29 aa step-1 for both ClpA and ClpAP. Examining the [ATP]-dependence of the unfolding reactions revealed that the increased kinetic step-size results from the averaging of a large unfolding step-size of ~97 aa, representing cooperative unfolding of a single Titin I27 domain, followed by multiple smaller translocation steps on the newly unfolded chain. Moreover, just like translocation alone, the introduction of folds into the substrate results in different kinetics between ClpA and ClpAP. These observations further support a model where ClpP allosterically impacts ClpA-catalyzed processes.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

To assess expression of target antigens in B-ALL, we compared mRNA profiling of 559 patient leukemia samples across 18 molecular subtypes with that of representative cell lines. The latter served as target cells to compare human IgG1 or IgA2 variants against CD19, CD20 or CD38 in antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Interestingly, antibodies against broadly expressed CD19 were negligibly effective in mediating ADCP or ADCC. Antibodies against CD20 or CD38, the former variably expressed across subtypes, triggered ADCP by macrophages both as IgG1 and IgA2. However, PMN mediated ADCC against CD20 or CD38 was only observed with IgA2 variants, but not with respective IgG1 antibodies. Blocking the myeloid checkpoint molecule CD47 with a CD47 antibody or a soluble SIRP-Fc fusion protein enhanced ADCP and ADCC by IgA2 antibodies. The binding site for SIRP on CD47 contains an N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu), whose formation is catalyzed by glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase like (QPCTL). The direct involvement of pGlu in CD47/SIRP interactions was shown by using engineered CD47 variants. Both CD47 and QPCTL were broadly expressed across BCP-ALL subtypes, indicating QPCTL inhibitors as additional therapeutic option. Importantly, the combination of anti-CD38 IgA2 and CD47 blockade was effective against xenografted B-ALL cells in human FcRI (CD89) transgenic NXG mice.

This represents the main driver of morbidity and mortality for peritoneal cancer patients. Mechanisms necessary for cancer cells to survive matrix detachment and initiate transcoelomic metastasis remain poorly defined. To address this, we identified a conserved detachment-sensitive gene signature activated shortly after matrix-detachment across multiple ascites-derived cancer cell lines. RHOV, an atypical, constitutively active and understudied member of the Rho GTPase family, emerged as a top upregulated transcript, which was confirmed in patient ascites-derived tumor cells. Functionally, loss of RHOV impairs anoikis resistance, multicellular aggregate integrity, migration and invasion, and completely abolishes transcoelomic tumor progression in vivo. RHOV enhances c-Jun signaling and cytoskeletal remodeling, which is dependent on both RHOV GTP-binding and membrane localization. These findings define RHOV as a novel detachment-sensitive Rho GTPase and establish RHOV as a critical regulator of peritoneal metastasis for the first time.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Although these therapies have shown success, antibodies face limitations in bioavailability compared to low molecular mass compounds. An alternative strategy is to stabilize PD-L1 homodimers to prevent their immunosuppressive activity. The homodimer interface forms a tunnel-like cavity that can accommodate small molecules. However, no small drugs targeting PD-L1 homodimers have been approved for cancer treatment. Drug repurposing offers a promising approach to bridge this gap. In this study, we sought to identify potential PD-L1 inhibitors among FDA-approved drugs using virtual screening, followed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/PBSA binding energy calculations. Our results indicate that daclatasvir, an FDA-approved antiviral for hepatitis C, forms a stable and energetically favorable complex with the PD-L1 homodimer, suggesting it as a promising candidate for further investigation in cancer immunotherapy. Due to its symmetry, daclatasvir simultaneously interacts with both PD-L1 monomers in an equivalent manner, bridging the dimer interface. Its biphenyl core anchors at the center of the tunnel, the imidazole rings position at the entrances, and the pyrrolidine rings remain exposed to the solvent.

L.; Bowman-Gibson, S.; Bhakta-Yadav, M.; Brown, T. L.", "abstract": "Successful pregnancy is dependent on extensive coordination between maternal, placental, and fetal units. Alterations in maternal-placental signaling or abnormal placental development can lead to a wide variety of pregnancy complications. This commonly includes preterm birth and fetal growth restriction, which are associated with a high rate of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Maternal-placental signaling is in part mediated by the release of extracellular vesicles. These lipid-bilayer nanoparticles are secreted by various cell types and act as key regulators of both normal and pathogenic cell-cell communication. In a healthy pregnancy, maternal plasma extracellular vesicle concentrations increase as gestation progresses. However, in the pregnancy-associated disorder, preeclampsia, excessive extracellular vesicle secretion occurs and may be involved in the pathogenesis of the condition. Thus, there is a critical need - as a first step - to understand if modifying extracellular vesicle concentration, specifically during pregnancy can attenuate or exacerbate gestational pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of administering a reported extracellular vesicle inhibitor, dimethyl amiloride, on maternal extracellular vesicle concentrations in healthy pregnant mice and assessed maternal and fetal outcomes. Maternal administration of dimethyl amiloride resulted in a significant decrease in maternal weight as well as fetal growth and substantially increased the rate of preterm birth. In contrast to previous reports in non-pregnant animals, we found that dimethyl amiloride did not significantly reduce maternal extracellular vesicle concentrations in pregnant mice. Our data demonstrate that systemic administration of dimethyl amiloride drastically impacts the mother and fetus during gestation and caution is suggested against its use during pregnancy.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Prior applications of this formalism have built landscapes in low-dimensional spaces without explicit reference to gene expression. Here, we present a computational geometry framework for fitting dynamical landscapes directly to high-dimensional single-cell data.

We demonstrate the applicability of this framework to multicolor flow-cytometry and RNA-seq data. Applied to a stem cell system that models ventral neural tube patterning, we recover a family of morphogen-dependent landscapes whose valleys align with canonical neural progenitor types. Remarkably, simple linear interpolation between landscapes captures signaling dependence, and chaining landscapes together reveals irreversible behavior following transient morphogen exposure.

Given the dynamic nature of proteasome composition, we searched for additional pDUBs. USP15 was found to be associated with 26S proteasomes purified from cultured cells. In proteasome preparations from erythrocytes, USP15 was identified as the most abundant transient pDUB. It was even feasible to separate proteasomes containing USP15 from those containing USP14. Although USP15 utilizes an internal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain for positioning itself at the proteasome, it did not compete with the UBL-containing USP14. USP15 facilitated substrate selection at the proteasome by efficiently disassembling short polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, while sparing K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin conjugates from deubiquitination. This feature may aid the proteasome in differentiating between substrates to be rescued from those committed to proteolysis.

For ultrasound neuromodulation studies in mice, current transducers can successfully reach shallow and middle brain depths; however, accessing deep-brain regions, especially those near the lower skull bone, remains challenging due to skull-induced attenuation, reflection, and acoustic aberration. To address this issue, this study presents a machine learning-based computational framework for optimizing single-element transducer designs to achieve precise deep-brain targeting in a mouse model. This framework includes a surrogate model and an evolutionary optimization approach. The surrogate model, which consists of Random Forest regressor and classifier models, was trained on acoustic simulation results to predict acoustic performance from design parameters. A total of 72 simulations were performed across coronal and sagittal planes, systematically varying parameters of frequency (1-6 MHz), radius of curvature (5-7 mm), and f-number (0.58-1.0). Each design was evaluated using five performance metrics: focal length, focal shape, maximum pressure at the focal region, pressure maximum location, and sidelobe suppression. The surrogate was combined with an evolutionary algorithm, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, to perform multi-objective optimization and identify high-performing transducer designs. The optimized design resulted in more compact, symmetric focal regions and accurate energy delivery to deep targets, with minimal off-target exposure, even in the presence of complex skull anatomy. Results indicate that lower f-numbers, moderate radius of curvature, and higher frequencies facilitate precise deep brain targeting. Overall, this data-driven approach enables the effective design of single-element transducers for deep-brain neuromodulation in mice and provides a framework for designing transcranial transducers for other brain targets, potentially accelerating the clinical translation of focused ultrasound technologies.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

We compare automated and manual assembly methods using the NGS Hamilton Microlab STAR across two plasmid backbones to evaluate efficiency and reliability. As a proof of concept, we use this modular platform to construct 144 total plasmids encoding riboregulators targeting diverse viral targets along with their cognate trigger sequences.

However, the time to design, produce, and screen high-performance RNA sensors remains a critical challenge. The fundamental rules governing RNA-RNA interactions--specifically the structure-function relationships that determine sensor performance--remain poorly understood. Here, we present a method enabling versatile in-silico RNA-targeting analysis (VISTA), a machine learning-guided framework for the rapid design of RNA sensors. VISTA integrates biophysical modeling of both sensor and target RNAs with a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) machine learning framework. Using high-throughput experimental measurements with sequence-structure feature extraction to train predictive models, we capture the key determinants of RNA sensor performance. We find that by using toehold switches as a model RNA sensor, Toehold-VISTA successfully designs RNA sensors with improved function against SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Building upon recent progress in copy number control, this report presents a genetic circuit that enables dynamic regulation of circuit gain through the regulation of plasmid copy numbers. To illustrate the underlying concept, we first developed a mathematical model describing the relationship between plasmid copy number and circuit gain and simulated the circuit dynamics to examine how gain responds to copy number changes. We then constructed the circuit and experimentally confirmed that plasmid copy number, i.e., circuit gain, can be externally controlled in E. coli. In particular, we demonstrate communication-based gain control using AHL-mediated quorum sensing from co-cultured cells. These results support the feasibility of plasmid copy number control as a practical and predictable strategy for tuning synthetic gene circuit behavior.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Pseudomonas putida KT2440, renowned for its metabolic versatility in this niche, uses largely uncharacterized regulatory and enzymatic strategies to utilize these compounds. We investigated two IclR-type transcriptional regulators, LigR1 and LigR2, that control expression of the uncharacterized lig1 and lig2 operons. We demonstrate that ligR1 deletion caused growth defects on glucose and 4-hydroxybenzoate accompanied by cell elongation and aggregation. Structural and functional analyses reveal that LigR1 and LigR2 activate the lig1 operon but repress the lig2 operon. LigR1 binding of 4-hydroxybenzoate induced repression by triggering tetramerization and increasing DNA-binding activity. In contrast, LigR2 responded to quinate, protocatechuate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to potently induce lig2 operon expression by relieving repression. While both operons cooperate in metabolizing these compounds, we propose the lig1 operon mediates influx through its major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (PP_2604), whereas the lig2 operon catalyzes breakdown via a protocatechuate intermediate and the meta-cleavage pathway, supplying oxaloacetate to the TCA cycle. Importantly, we show that P. putida repurposes shikimate pathway intermediates for energy production. These findings challenge the canonical biosynthetic view of the shikimate pathway and redefine the metabolic flexibility of soil pseudomonads. We reveal a novel mechanism enabling P. putida to thrive in the chemically complex rhizosphere and open new avenues for exploring alternate roles of the shikimate pathway, emphasizing transcriptional regulators as tools to deconvolute complex metabolic landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

In mice, PPE2 caused fat loss, adipocyte hypertrophy, immune cell infiltration, impaired glucose tolerance, reduced expression of PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-alpha, adiponectin and higher insulin resistance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed PPE2 altered expression of genes associated with chemokine/cytokine, ribosomal biogenesis and lipase signaling. PPE2 induced lipolysis by activating cAMP-PKA-HSL axis, increased circulating free fatty acids, a feature also observed in TB patient sera.

Here we show that fucoidans are degraded through synergistic interactions between specialized bacteria with conserved metabolic functions. Using metabolomic analysis of a reconstructed marine consortium, we uncovered functional guilds of bacteria that target either the sulfated fucose backbone or the side-branches of rare monomers. This division of labor leads to an unexpectedly high number of positive interactions between different degraders that enhanced degradation efficiency up to 97.1%. Despite variation in fucoidan structure across different types of algae, the metabolic functions of degraders remained conserved, enabling quantitative prediction of degradation outcomes based on community composition. Our findings suggest that the environmental turnover of complex macromolecules depends not only on individual metabolic capabilities but also on ecological interactions shaped by substrate architecture.

While endurance training has been shown to beneficially modulate the microbiome, the effects of resistance training remain less clear, with some studies reporting minimal changes. This project aims to investigate whether structured resistance training elicits significant changes in gut microbiome composition and diversity in sedentary, healthy adults. Methods: 150 participants completed an 8-week supervised resistance training program. Session-level training data, including weights and repetitions, were recorded alongside metrics like load and compliance. Fecal samples were collected throughout the study period at designated timepoints for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess microbiome composition and for metabolomics analyses to evaluate microbial metabolic activity. Results: No differences in microbial diversity were observed, and there were no significant changes in microbial community composition or fecal metabolomics across all participants post-training. However, within-individual microbial community changes significantly correlated with strength improvement, and significantly stronger shifts in beta diversity were observed in participants with high average strength gains compared to those with smaller gains. In these high responders, differential abundance analysis revealed time-dependent microbial changes, with more taxa enriched or depleted by week 8 of training. Notably, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia hominis - both associated with a healthier, anti-inflammatory microbiome - were significantly enriched. Many differentially abundant taxa belonged to the Lachnospiraceae family. Conclusion: Resistance training drives significant, time-dependent gut microbiome changes, particularly in those demonstrating greater improvements in strength. These shifts mirror endurance training effects and may reflect improved overall health.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

In a suckling mouse model, the bacterial L-lactate dehydrogenase (LldD) conferred a fitness advantage to V. cholerae but not to the {triangleup}ctxAB mutant incapable of producing CT. Finally, the fitness advantage conferred by LldD was significantly reduced in mice lacking epithelial-cell specific LDHA, demonstrating that epithelial-derived L-lactate is a major contributor to CT-dependent pathogen expansion.

Despite its epidemiological importance, the molecular and microbial determinants of A. darlingi susceptibility to P. vivax remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated vector-parasite-microbiota interactions using experimental infections with field-derived P. vivax gametocytaemic blood, which produced two distinct infection phenotypes: low and high oocyst burdens. Transcriptomic profiling of mosquito midguts across key parasite developmental timepoints revealed that low-infection mosquitoes mounted an early and sustained response characterised by activation of detoxification pathways, redox regulation, aromatic amino acid catabolism, and purine depletion, likely coordinated through neurophysiological cues, which collectively create a metabolically restrictive environment for parasite development. These physiological changes were accompanied by reduced bacterial diversity and enrichment of Enterobacteriales and Pseudomonadales, taxa previously linked to anti-Plasmodium activity. Conversely, high-infection mosquitoes exhibited limited metabolic reprogramming, expansion of Flavobacteriales, and transcriptional signatures consistent with permissive physiological states, potentially associated with reproductive trade-offs. Importantly, low infection outcomes consistently arose from bloodmeals with the lowest gametocyte densities, suggesting that host- and parasite-derived components of the bloodmeal act as early conditioning factors that prime the mosquito midgut for either resistance or susceptibility. These findings reframe A. darlingi vector competence to P. vivax not as a fixed immune trait but as a dynamic outcome of early redox, metabolic, and microbial interactions.

In this work, we introduce a computational method for optimizing CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNA that combines PAM diversity, local efficiency penalties, and weighted off-target scoring to find high-performing guides across a range of genome compositions. To capture a variety of natural genomic complexity, we simulated five sample genomes: AT-rich, GC-rich, balanced GC content, and high-repeat variations. All twenty-nucleotide target sequences were scanned for each genome, and off-target potential was assessed by permitting up to two mismatches with weighted penalties for seed region sites. To accommodate for any secondary structure impacts, efficiency assessment included both local sliding window penalties and global GC content. Furthermore, we looked at several PAM sequences that were pertinent to various Cas9 variations in order to assess how they affected guide selection. The findings show that efficiency scores vary by genome composition, with the highest scoring guides consistently displaying zero anticipated off-target events. While balanced genomes showed intermediate tendencies, GC-rich genomes tended to choose slightly higher efficiency guides than AT-rich genomes. PAM type affects guide efficiency, according to analysis across several genomes, and the combination of efficiency and off-target score consistently indicates guides with good expected performance. Three-dimensional scatter plots of efficiency and off-target counts versus genomic position, violin plots of off-target distributions, and genome-wide heatmaps emphasizing the best guide positions were used to illustrate these findings. In addition to offering a generalizable computational method for choosing CRISPR/Cas9 guides that optimize specificity and efficiency, our study gives fresh insights into the interactions among genome composition, PAM selection, and guide design criteria. By taking into account weighted off-target penalties, genome complexity, and local efficiency effects, this in silico framework overcomes some of the main drawbacks of earlier simulations. It is also easily applicable to direct selection for experimental research on a variety of organisms.

The cone shape of the capsid is particularly important for packaging the viral genome and coordinating nuclear entry. Lenacapavir (LEN), a potent long-acting inhibitor, has been shown to disrupt capsid morphogenesis by binding at the FG-binding pocket located between neighboring CA subunits. Interestingly, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), a cellular polyanion, binds within the central pore of capsid pentamers and some hexamers while playing a key role in regulating the hexamer/pentamer switch. As LEN and IP6 interact with overlapping structural elements, they can compete to influence the capsid assembly pathway and outcomes. Using coarse-grained molecular simulations, we examined capsid assembly across varying IP6 and LEN conditions. Our results reveal a concentration-dependent shift in assembly outcomes: LEN accelerates hexamer assembly and reduces pentamer incorporation, leading to malformed, multilayered, or incomplete capsids. Simulations including a model for the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex further show that LEN-treated capsids frequently fail to encapsidate the RNA genome, indicating impaired maturation.

Integrating decision-making with willingness revealed drivers of adoption and barriers persisting despite positive attitudes. NVEI scores strongly predicted both willingness and cultivation decisions, with regional contrasts evident. In the Forested region, farmers anticipated greater economic and agronomic benefits but had lower expectations for biodiversity, suggesting a knowledge gap and a need for communication providing comparative evidence on biodiversity benefits. In the Lowland region, higher expectations for environmental benefits highlight the need for tailored information on biodiversity, landscape value, and ecological connectivity.

Strikingly, model predictions and experimentally determined activity in pooled sgRNA experiments in Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium showed an [~]10-fold reduced SaCas9 activity at sites with 5'-NNGGAT[C]-3' PAM [+1] sequences. Cleavage assays using plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli inactivated for DNA adenine methyltransferase (DAM) and SaCas9/sgRNA combinations targeting sites with NNGGAT[C] PAM sequences confirmed that adenine methylation impacts SaCas9 cleavage. Moreover, ablation of a GATC DAM site in a PAM sequence en- hanced SaCas9 in vitro activity, whereas creation of a DAM site reduced activity, providing a mechanistic link between adenine methylation and SaCas9 activity. Our results show that a general purpose machine learning architecture can provide biologically relevant insights into SaCas9-PAM interactions that can better inform activity predictions for bacterial applications. Avoidance of adenine methylated PAM sites by SaCas9 may be a mechanism of self versus non-self discrimination or reflect an evolutionary adaptation to counter methylation as an anti-restriction strategy by phage or plasmids.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

However, the genetic factors that establish gut colonization and virulence remain elusive due to the lack of a system for genetic modification. This study develops several genetic tools, including a shuttle vector, an inducible promoter, fluorescent proteins, and gene disruption or deletion systems in R. gnavus to identify the genes involved in R. gnavus colonization. Using these genetic tools, we found the respective sortase enzymes necessary for both cell wall localization of the superantigens and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) production in R. gnavus ATCC 29149. We identified the putative new gene cluster responsible for CPS production in the adjacent region of the sortase gene and confirmed that CPS production is crucial for competitive fitness during colonization in germ-free mouse intestines and that CPS production is inversely correlated with the inflammatory activity of R. gnavus. Furthermore, CPS cluster-possessing strains tended to be more prevalent in healthy human isolates compared to those from Crohn's disease patients. This implies that CPS production is involved in their inflammatory activities and pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as IBD. We highlight the potential of precise gene modification systems to identify the genetic factors that facilitate intestinal colonization and pathogenesis in gut bacteria.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

The phages were isolated using a motile E. coli K-12 BW25113 strain, whose motility is conferred by an IS5 insertion upstream of the flhDC operon, the master regulator of flagellar synthesis. The isolated Escherichia phages include Lubas (LuPh1) and Lucat (LuPh2) of the genus Tequatrovirus; Lupin (LuPh3) and Lucris (LuPh4) of the genus Tequintavirus; and Kompetensportalen (LuPh5) of the genus Chivirus. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed myovirus and siphovirus morphologies consistent with these genera. As expected for phages in the flagellotropic Chivirus genus, LuPh5 failed to infect a poorly motile BW25113 strain lacking the IS5 element upstream of flhDC. By testing a panel of eight previously described anti-phage defense systems, we found that LuPh1 and LuPh2 are inhibited by the toxin-antitoxin-chaperone CmdTAC system; LuPh5 is inhibited by both the restriction-modification system EcoRI and the abortive infection reverse transcriptase AbiK; and all five phages are sensitive to the hybrid artificial CmdTA-HigC system.

Lung viral replication in RAB/6N mice remains steady for several days before a decline in viral titers. Delayed initiation of infection clearance is marked by increased lung T-cell extravasation and type-2 immune responses, leading to maladaptive lung consolidation.

Convalescent RAB/6N mice display systemic inflammation and decreased antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, persistent viral RNA and prolonged lymphoid infiltration in the lungs. These animals also exhibit signatures of multi-organ dysfunction, cognitive impairment, cardiac inflammation, hyper-immunoglobulin production, and various autoimmune disorders, illuminating the molecular correlates of various pathologies associated with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).

MC at 200 mg significantly improved eclosion rates and starvation resistance in the Harwich strain, while 150 mg showed the strongest hypoglycemic effect in the indigenous NgD3 strain. The extract alleviated heat stress and reversed sucrose-induced Malpighian tubule dysfunction, (p<0.001), which elevated creatinine (1.92 mg/dl and 1.59 mg/dl) both sexes and sodium levels (1.67 mg/dl), particularly in male flies.

We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of this approach for assessing biodiversity across ecological and biological scales, from holobionts to diverse ecosystems. In addition, we provide an automated bioinformatic workflow to support the standardised and reproducible analysis of the JEDI marker in future studies.

Previous molecular phylogenetic studies failed to resolve the infrageneric relationships of the genus.

Here, we generated de novo transcriptomes from 82 accessions representing 22 Hordeum species, including barley and identified 257 single-copy orthologs present in all accessions to infer a robust phylogeny of the genus. By combining phylogenetic network inference with ABBA-BABA tests, we detected four well-supported cases of interspecific hybridization, three of which coincided with major long-distance dispersal events across continents. Comparative climatic niche analysis indicated that annual Hordeum species tend to inhabit environments characterized by higher temperatures and greater interannual temperature variability, as well as increased human disturbance, compared to their perennial relatives, although no consistent differences in precipitation were observed. Using our well-resolved phylogeny as a comparative framework, we analyzed patterns of selection, gene expression, and gene copy-number variation to uncover genomic changes associated with life-history strategy while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. These analyses yielded 174 candidate genes spanning a wide range of biological functions, suggesting that the genetic architecture underlying life-history evolution is more complex than previously assumed. Candidate genes grouped into six major functional categories, with the most prominent being signal transduction and development, which includes regulators of flowering, dormancy, and meristem activity, metabolic and biosynthetic processes related to carbon allocation and storage, and stress response and defense, reflecting the long-term resilience of perennials compared to the accelerated growth strategies of annuals. Together, our study not only reconstructs the evolutionary history and climatic niche differentiation of Hordeum species but also demonstrates that convergent life-history evolution is driven by multifaceted and functionally diverse genetic mechanisms.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Within-species individual variation has been gaining increased attention in ecological studies of species interactions. Yet, these studies rarely consider genetic variation and potential genetic correlations among traits. Moreover, traits beyond those associated with trophic interactions are mostly overlooked. Filling these gaps is important to fully understand the relevance of trait variation in both the ecology and evolution of species interactions. 2. We addressed this using inbred lines of Tetranychus cinnabarinus, a spider mite species that often engages into antagonistic interactions with its congeneric T. urticae. Specifically, we measured (a) the intrinsic growth rate and the sex ratio in the absence of any interaction; (b) food competition against a density gradient of con- or heterospecific competitors in absence of reproductive interference; (c) reproductive interference in absence of food competition; and (d) body size of adult females and males. 3. We found significant genetic variance (i.e., broad-sense heritability) among lines for all variables except for the effect of the focal species on its heterospecific competitor via food competition. Moreover, we showed that lines with higher intrinsic growth were more sensitive to competition for food but exerted stronger reproductive interference on heterospecifics. In addition, the higher the proportion of sons produced by a line, the more resilient it was to reproductive interference but also the lower its growth rate. No genetic correlations were found between any variable and body size. 4.

Our main goal was to uncover whether the ecologically successful hybrids are evolutionary dead ends, or initiate further speciation and novel sexual recombination. We investigated flower development, pollen viability, seed set and seed germination in hybrids and their parental species and characterized genome size and genetic markers in the progenies. Intraspecific crosses yielded fertile progeny, but all dihaploid and triploid interspecific hybrids were male sterile. Only an established allotetraploid hybrid reproduced sexually, while colchicine-induced allotetraploids from dihaploids did not re-gain sexual competence so far.

Often mediated by loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, this activation causes increased NRF2 transcriptional activity and constitutive activation of the antioxidant response. While KEAP1 mutations have been well documented in various cancers, their presence and role in thyroid carcinoma have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we sequenced pediatric thyroid tumors and analyzed publicly available datasets, identifying 81 KEAP1 mutations in tumors across a range of histologies. In these tumors, we further identified frequent biallelic loss of KEAP1 via 19p13.2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). MAPK-activating alterations were found in a subset of KEAP1-mutant cases, but they were mutually exclusive with 19p13.2 LOH. Transcriptome analysis also revealed significant activation of the NRF2 pathway in KEAP1-mutant tumors. Four additional cases with similar transcriptional profiles but lacking mutational data were identified, likely representing putative KEAP1 mutants. Using in vitro cell line models, we then profiled the functional consequences of KEAP1 knockout in cells with and without known driver alterations. In these models, we show that KEAP1 loss leads to an NRF2-dependent upregulation of AKR1C3, GCLC, NQO1, along with increased proliferation and migration, irrespective of MAPK mutational status. We also demonstrate that loss of KEAP1 reduced sensitivity of RET fusion-positive cells to selpercatinib, consistent with previous reports that these alterations promote drug resistance in other malignancies.

Unlike predominant Fov races in US cotton production, which require root-knot nematodes to cause damage, Fov4 is known to infect cotton independent of nematodes. However, molecular mechanisms of Fov4 virulence in cotton are not clearly understood. Secondary metabolites are often identified as the culprits in pathogen virulence toward plant hosts. To investigate these factors in Fov4, we analyzed the genomes of Fov1 and Fov4 using Fungal antiSMASH and identified a Fov4-specific nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene FNP1.

Furthermore, the mutant exhibited defect in cotton root rot virulence and significant decrease in Fusaric acid production. Microscopic observation of GFP-labeled FNP1 deletion mutant showed impeded infection progression in cotton roots compared to the wild type (WT), which further explained the impeded virulence in FNP1 mutant.

Using a circuit model, we show that when sensory signals align with shared variability, behaviorally relevant information is amplified without compromising coding fidelity. Analyses of neural population recordings from multiple brain areas and tasks reveal that the dominant axis of shared variability consistently aligns with task-relevant stimulus features and action plans. Finally, the behavioral impact of microstimulation can be explained by the extent to which it changes projections onto the shared variability axis.

These results suggest that alpha band oscillations may play a role in directing attention and filtering relevant visual information, while theta band oscillations might facilitate the integration of visual elements into coherent percepts by engaging memory processes and enhancing neural communication across brain regions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how neural oscillations coordinate to support perceptual organization, potentially informing future studies and therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing visual perception and cognitive function.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

T.; Schwab, J. A.; Palmer, S.; Jones, K. E.", "abstract": "Mammals exhibit remarkable diversity in brain size and morphology, shaped by numerous ecological radiations throughout the Cenozoic. Although previous studies have demonstrated the influence of phylogeny, allometry, and various ecological variables on endocranial morphology in certain mammalian lineages, the extent to which locomotor behaviour influences brain shape evolution remains unclear. The suborder Caniformia, or 'dog-like' carnivorans, is an ecologically diverse clade, containing terrestrial, arboreal, fossorial, and semiaquatic species, each facing a unique set of sensory and motor challenges. Here, we evaluate the impact of phylogeny, allometry, and locomotor mode on brain shape evolution in caniforms. We examine endocranial morphology in 73 species using high-density 3D geometric morphometrics, principal component analysis and phylogenetic comparative methods. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial-to-aquatic transition significantly impacts endocranial shape across caniforms, which is associated with maximum dive duration. This effect is more pronounced in pinnipeds than in other semiaquatic fissipeds, such as mustelids and ursids, likely due to their more derived ecology and greater commitment to aquatic life. Aquatic caniforms tend to exhibit expanded neocortices alongside reduced paleocortices and olfactory bulbs. These morphological changes likely reflect selection pressures acting on both the brain and the surrounding cranial architecture in aquatic environments.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

SEs preferentially form multiway chromatin interactions with other SEs and highly transcribed regions in embryonic stem cells. However, the properties of the interacting SEs and their specific contributions to complex regulatory interactions in differentiated cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we compare the structural and functional properties of SEs between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and dopaminergic neurons (DNs) by combining Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM), chromatin accessibility, histone modification, and transcriptome data. Most SEs are cell-type specific and establish extensive pairwise and multiway chromatin interactions with other SEs and genes with cell-type specific expression. SE interactions span megabase genomic distances and frequently connect distant topologically associating domains. By applying network centrality analyses, we detected SEs with different hierarchical importance. Highest network centrality SEs contain binding motifs for cell-type specific transcription factors, and are candidate regulatory hubs. The functional heterogeneity of SEs is also highlighted by their organisation into modular sub-networks that differ in structure and spatial scale between ESCs and DNs, with more specific and strongly connected SE modules in post-mitotic neurons. Our results uncover both the high complexity and specificity of SE-based 3D regulatory networks and provide a resource for prioritizing SEs with potential roles in transcriptional regulation and disease.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Sur, M.", "abstract": "Complex behaviors are thought to be built by combining simpler cognitive components. Computational modeling has shown that artificial neural networks can perform a variety of tasks by flexibly combining small functional modules of neurons, each specialized for a specific computation, to construct a complex task. However, empirical evidence for such reusable modular networks in the brain has been lacking. Neural recordings in mice performing a delayed match-to-sample with delayed report (DMS-dr) task identified subspaces of neural activity that were specialized for stimulus processing and memory maintenance. These subspaces were reused during the task to represent new stimulus inputs and different types of memories, respectively. Clustering analyses showed each subspace was supported by a functionally distinct cluster of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Recurrent neural networks trained to capture the observed neural dynamics demonstrated that silencing specific clusters disrupted specific computations, highlighting the modular and reusable organization of these networks. By bridging theoretical predictions with empirical evidence, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly reuse computational components to perform a complex cognitive task.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Genetics studies have discovered many dozens of genes with causal roles in autism, and functional analyses have demonstrated that ASD-associated mutations affect a diverse range of brain regions and cell types. However, the precise mechanisms by which these genetic alterations lead to autism-related phenotypes remain unclear. Psychiatric cognitive and behavioral traits are believed to arise from dysfunction of specific brain circuits formed by anatomically and functionally connected brain areas. To identify the circuits and cell types primarily affected by ASD mutations, we developed an unbiased approach, GENCIC, which computationally integrates genome-wide genetic data with a brain-wide spatial mouse transcriptome and an anatomical mesoscale connectome. Applying this approach to ASD reveals a convergence of mutations on cohesive brain circuits that are enriched in long-distance connections and span both cortical and subcortical brain structures. Furthermore, our analysis of brain-wide single-cell spatial transcriptomics shows that the heterogeneity of circuit structures affected in ASD is matched by the substantial diversity of strongly impacted circuit cell types. Notably, the implicated circuits and cell types play a central role in the integration of multimodal sensory and emotional information and in decision-making based on this information. We also find that different circuit structures exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns that correlate with cognitive phenotypes in ASD. Overall, our study demonstrates how ASD-related genetic mutations impact multiple levels of brain organization, ultimately disrupting functional circuits that drive core autism-related behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

M.; Khatibi, N.; Matthews, R. T.; MacDonald, J. L.", "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in MECP2, is a complex neurological disorder characterized by myriad physiological disruptions, including early closure of the critical period of developmental plasticity and precocious formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are lattice-like substructures of extracellular matrix (ECM) that enwrap specific subpopulations of neurons. PNNs are essential in the modulation of neuronal plasticity and brain maturation, and their enzymatic disruption can partially restore plasticity in adults and improve memory. Although precocious PNN formation is well-established in RTT, little is known of the cellular, molecular, or biochemical underpinnings of their precocious formation, or whether precocious PNN formation is due to cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. While PNNs form on subsets of neurons throughout the brain, astrocytes secrete many ECM components that form PNNs, and they play a central role in controlling closure of the critical period. We find that Mecp2-null astrocyte conditioned media induces the expression of the key PNN component Hapln1 and causes enhanced PNN formation on wildtype neurons, suggesting that Mecp2-null astrocytes play a key role in the precocious formation of PNNs in RTT. Further, we identify increased expression of HAPLN1 and other PNN / ECM components in the developing Mecp2-null cortex, and demonstrate that PNNs are structurally and biochemically mature at an earlier developmental stage. These results provide essential insight into the mechanisms and structure of aberrant PNNs in Mecp2-null cortex and identify potential new avenues for targeted rescue or reversal of the precocious closing of the critical period in RTT.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}

Precise modulation of neuronal responses is achieved by multiple cellular mechanisms that operate over a range of timescales. Primary sensory neurons rapidly adapt their sensitivities via posttranslational mechanisms including regulated trafficking of sensory molecules but also alter their transcriptional profiles on longer timescales to adapt to persistent sensory stimuli. How diverse transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways are coordinated in individual sensory neurons to accurately adjust their functions and drive behavioral plasticity is unclear. Here we show that temperature experience modulates both transcription and trafficking of thermoreceptors on different timescales in the C. elegans AFD thermosensory neurons to regulate response plasticity. Expression of the PY motif-containing adaptor protein (PYT-1) as well as the GCY-18 warm temperature-responsive guanylyl cyclase thermoreceptor is transcriptionally upregulated in AFD upon a temperature upshift. We find that as GCY-18 begins to accumulate at the AFD sensory endings, the GCY-23 cooler temperature-responsive thermoreceptor9 exhibits altered subcellular localization and increased retrograde trafficking, thereby increasing the functional GCY-18 to GCY-23 ratio in the AFD sensory compartment. Altered GCY-23 localization and trafficking requires PYT-1-dependent endocytosis, and we show that PYT-1-mediated modulation of the GCY-18 to GCY-23 protein ratio at the AFD sensory endings is necessary to shift the AFD response threshold towards warmer values following the temperature upshift. Our results describe a mechanism by which transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms are temporally coordinated across sensory receptors to fine tune experience-dependent plasticity in the response of a single sensory neuron type.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": ""}
