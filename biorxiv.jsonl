We analyzed population activity recorded from M1 of macaques during a sequential arm movement task with target updates requiring online adjustments to the motor plan. Using Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), we separated neural activity into two components: intrinsic dynamics and inferred external inputs influencing those dynamics. Inferred input timing was more strongly locked to target appearance than to movement onset, suggesting that variable reaction times reflect interactions between inputs and ongoing dynamics. Inferred inputs were tuned similarly for both initial and corrective movements, suggesting a shared input encoding across visually-instructed and corrective movements that was previously obscured by M1 dynamics. Because input inference can suffer from the challenge of nonidentifiability, where different models fit the data indistinguishably, we used ensembles of models with varied hyperparameters to diagnose when inputs are identifiable or nonidentifiable. In the monkey data, ensembles produced consistently similar results, suggesting that inputs could be meaningfully inferred and that their encoding was not simply a result of model bias. These results highlight the challenges of nonidentifiability and the potential of model ensembles to identify inputs in ongoing dynamics, at least in some cases.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Its cavities represent an essential microhabitat for many other forest species and the knowledge on landscape factors linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker is needed to support the conservation of this species and associated species. Such relationships should thus be quantified at different scales ranging from the stand to the extended home range. We used cavity maps established by foresters and naturalists to build a large (2689 cavity bearing trees) database distributed over several sites in France. Based on this and on a set of background points, i.e. randomly selected points devoid of cavity in the vicinity, we analysed the effects of stand composition and landscape features (forest cover, forest connectivity and fragmentation) at three different scales around each cavity and background point corresponding to a forest management unit (10ha), the core (100ha) and extended (250ha) home range scales. We showed that indices describing forest continuity (cohesion, landscape shape index) and forest tree species composition (especially the presence of mixed forests) had significant positive effects but that the magnitude varied across the three scales. We notably observed the strongest effects at the core home range scale (100ha), indicating that Black Woodpecker requirements for cavity excavation are more pronounced at this scale. The Black Woodpecker tends to avoid pure conifer-dominated stands to excavate cavities, but benefits from mixed forests, that couple favourable foraging and cavity excavation sites. The bird also prefers continuous forest landscapes with high cohesion and low edge densities. We also showed that the positive effects of forest landscape were generally at higher elevation, indicating context-dependence. Forest planning rarely integrates the landscape patterns. A better understanding of the features linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker may hence help to better integrate their conservation in forest management planning. Our results also show the importance to maintain mixed broadleaf-conifer forests as well as continuous and well-connected forest landscapes to favour features that benefit primary and secondary cavity nesters.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

No effective therapeutics exist to reduce the incidence and severity of brain injury of prematurity. Hypoxic events are the most important environmental factor, along with inflammation. Among other developmental processes, the second half of in utero fetal development coincides with the migration of cortical interneurons from the ganglionic eminences into the cortex; this process is thus prone to disruptions following extremely preterm birth. To date, no studies have directly investigated the migration of human cortical inhibitory neurons under hypoxic conditions. Using multi-day confocal live imaging in human forebrain assembloids (hFA) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and ex vivo developing human brain tissue, we found a substantial reduction in the migration of hypoxic interneurons. Using transcriptomics, we identified adrenomedullin (ADM) as the gene with the highest fold change increase in expression. Based on previous literature about the protective role of supplemental ADM for other injuries, here, we demonstrated that addition of exogenous ADM to the hypoxic media restores the migration defects of iinterneurons. Lastly, we showed that one of the mechanisms of protection by ADM is through the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and subsequent pCREB-dependent rescued expression of a subset of GABA receptors, which are known to promote migration. Overall, in this manuscript we provide the first direct evidence for hypoxia-induced deficits in the migration of human cortical interneurons and identify ADM as a possible target for therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Gedunin treatment decreased GL261 cell proliferation and triggered apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Gedunin also reduced GL261 cell migration and metalloproteinase-2 activity, suggesting that it impairs glioblastoma cell invasion. Despite the reduction of total protein content in gedunin-treated cells, the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways was enhanced within 24 h. In situ treatment with gedunin did not significantly reduce tumor volume, but reduced the presence of vascular structures in xenograft glioblastoma in C57BL/6 mice, a clinical feature associated with morbidity and mortality.

We compared the relative performance of a deep learning approach, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and outline analyses via geometric morphometrics using elliptical Fourier transforms (EFT) at identifying pairs of plant taxa. We used their seeds and fruit stones that are the most abundant organs in archaeobotanical assemblages, and whose morphological identification, chiefly between wild and domesticated types, allows to document their domestication and biogeographical history. We used existing modern datasets of four plant taxa (barley, olive, date palm and grapevine) corresponding to photographs of two orthogonal views of their seeds that were analysed separately to offer a larger spectrum of shape diversity. Sample sizes ranged from 473 to 1,769 seeds per class, which constitute a relatively small dataset for training CNN models yet typical within archaeobotanical research. On these eight datasets, we compared the performance of CNN and EFT coupled with linear discriminant analyses. Our objectives were twofold: i) to test whether CNN can beat geometric morphometrics in taxonomic identification and if so, ii) to test which minimal sample size is required. We ran simulations on the full datasets and also on subsets, starting from 50 images in each binary class. For CNN networks, we deliberately used a candid approach relying on pre-parameterised VGG19 network. For EFT, we used a state-of-the art morphometrical pipeline. The main difference rests in the data used by each model: CNN used bare photographs where EFT used (x, y) outline coordinates. This \"pre-distilled\" geometrical description of seed outlines is often the most time-consuming part of morphometric studies. Results show that CNN beats EFT in most cases, even for very small datasets. We finally discuss the potential of CNN for archaeobotany, and how bioarchaeological studies could embrace both approaches, used in a complementary way, to better assess and understand the past history of species.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here we show that, while net tonic inhibitory current remains unchanged, the main source of tonic GABA switches from synaptic spillover (neuronal activity-dependent) to astrocytic Best1 (activity-independent) throughout adolescence (4-8 weeks) in mice. Computational modeling based on experimental data demonstrated that this switch down-regulates the internally generated network activity mediating mutual inhibition between GC clusters receiving different inputs, thereby enhancing their independence. Consistent with simulations, 3D-posture analysis revealed an age-dependent increase in independent limb movements during spontaneous motion, which was impaired in Best1 knockout mice. Our findings highlight the late-stage development of complex motor coordination driven by the emergence of astrocyte-mediated tonic inhibition.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

From a large cohort (N = 620), cortical heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs) were characterized and their sources were pinned to frontotemporal regions. Phase-based analyses demonstrated that cardiac signals affect phase of ongoing neural oscillations in the theta frequency band, rather than altering overall power, with this effect consolidating in older adults. Advanced statistical analysis further indicated that these changes are primarily driven by enhanced bottom-up heart-to-brain influences, revealing that altered interoceptive signaling can shape the age-related changes in time perception.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) is a pleiotropic cytokine acting as a key regulator of T-cell differentiation with activating and suppressive effects on their immune function. Here we systematically analyze the cellular responses of CD4+ T cells to TGF{beta} across diverse cytokine environments in the presence or absence of TGF{beta}. We found that TGF{beta} had a profound dominant effect independent of the presence of other cytokines, modulating the expression of more than 4,000 genes. In the presence of TGF{beta}, cells exhibit lower expression of translation-related and apoptosis-related genes, accompanied by increased survival of activated T cells. Notably, cells cultured in the presence of TGF{beta} were smaller in size while preserving their proliferative ability. Accordingly, we identified a dense network of transcription factors that were modulated by TGF{beta}, suggesting a core gene set connecting TGF{beta} signaling to the regulation of T-cell size. We found N-Myc to be at the center of this network, and we directly show that TGF{beta} regulates its gene expression level, protein level, and nuclear localization.

The rodent continuous performance test (rCPT) is a translational task that can be used to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying sustained attention. Electrophysiological single unit and local field potential (LFPs) recordings reflect changes in neural activity in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) in mice performing sustained attention tasks. While evidence linking PrL neuronal activity to sustained attention is compelling, most studies have focused on single-cell activity surrounding behavioral responses, overlooking population-level dynamics across entire sessions that could offer additional insight into fluctuations in attention during task performance. Here, we used in vivo endoscopic calcium imaging to record patterns of neuronal activity in PrL neurons using the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6f in mice performing the rCPT at three timepoints characterized by differing levels of cognitive demand and task proficiency. We analyzed single-cell activity surrounding behavioral responses and population-level dynamics across sessions to determine how PrL neuronal activity evolves with sustained attention performance. A higher proportion of PrL neurons were recruited during correct responses in sessions requiring high task proficiency. Moreover, during rCPT sessions, mice intercalated responsive-engaged periods with non-responsive-disengaged periods. Applying a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with two states to global PrL activity, we found neuronal states associated with task engagement. These states are characterized by different levels of correlated neuronal activity within PrL neurons. Overall, these findings illustrate that task proficiency, and task engagement differentially recruit activity in PrL neurons during a sustained attention task.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

I.; Gritsenko, V.", "abstract": "Background Quantitative movement analysis is increasingly used to assess motor deficits, but joint angle calculations depend on assumptions about limb segment lengths. These lengths are often estimated from average anthropometric proportions rather than measured directly. The extent to which such assumptions influence joint angle accuracy and variability remains unclear. Methods In prior studies, we recorded reaching movements in nine healthy adults using active-marker motion capture system. In this study, we computed arm joint angles with a dynamic model scaled using either measured segment lengths (Individual method) or proportions based on body height (Average method). We compared segment proportions and the variability in joint angle trajectories arising from segment length assumptions (between-subject variability) with within-subject variability across repeated movements. Results Segment length proportions remained unchanged despite increases in population height. Joint angle trajectories derived from the two scaling methods were very similar. Segment length assumptions had only minor effects on joint angle amplitudes, primarily due to kinematic redundancy, and these effects were substantially smaller than the within-subject variability observed across repeated movements in most individuals. Importantly, while segment length estimates shifted absolute joint angle amplitudes, they did not alter the shape of angular trajectories. Conclusions/Significance Morphological variability in segment lengths contributes less to joint angle variability than the variability expressed by individuals across repeated movements. This indicates that movement variability is driven more by how the nervous system selects among redundant motor solutions than by body morphology. These findings suggest that clinical assessments of range of motion and movement quality are robust to the method of segment length estimation, supporting the reliability of motion capture-based assessments in both research and clinical settings.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Kabuki syndrome (KS), a rare multisystem disorder associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, results from mutations in either KMT2D (KS1) or KDM6A (KS2), encoding a histone methyltransferase and demethylase, respectively. The mechanisms underlying intellectual disability in KS remain poorly understood. Here, we generated human iPS cells carrying conditional Cre/lox-dependent loss-of-function mutations in KMT2D or KDM6A and differentiated them into excitatory or inhibitory neurons. Analysis revealed that KS1 and KS2 inhibitory neurons unexpectedly showed increased GABAergic synapse formation, whereas excitatory neurons displayed reduced synapse development and impaired synaptic transmission. We confirmed these findings in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo using a mouse model for KS1 demonstrating a bidirectional shift: increase in inhibition and decrease in excitation. Synapse numbers and synaptic transmission in brain slices were shifted to increased inhibition/excitation ratio. Mechanistically, KS1 mutations activated neuroinflammatory signaling, impaired astrocytic function, and promoted glia-driven inhibitory synapse formation in human neurons. By integrating human neuron models with conditional KMT2D/KDM6A deletions and a Kmt2d-mutant mouse model, we identify a novel synaptic disease mechanism in KS that links chromatin remodeling defects to disrupted information transfer in neural circuits, providing a mechanistic explanation for intellectual disability.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

An important mechanism of collective resistance against widely used beta-lactams is the production of drug-degrading beta-lactamases. Here, we integrate experiments with mathematical modeling to understand the collective survival of Escherichia coli challenged with cefotaxime. At near-lethal cefotaxime concentrations, we observe complex dynamics, involving initial biomass growth due to filamentation, followed by death, and subsequently growth recovery. We show that production of AmpC, a chromosomal beta-lactamase, is responsible for cefotaxime degradation, allowing the resumption of cell division in surviving filaments. The detoxification of the environment proceeds through CTX hydrolysis by AmpC in the periplasm of intact cells, as well as extracellularly after cell lysis. Our model predicts the recovery time from molecular parameters, and quantifies the relative roles of periplasmic and extracellular degradation for two strains of E. coli that differ in the degree of privatization of AmpC hydrolysis.

Metabolic processes and products regulate aspects of B cell proliferation and differentiation into germinal center (GC) and PC states as well as Ab diversification. However, there is little information about lymphoid cell-intrinsic functions of enzymes that mediate ether lipid biosynthesis, including a major class of membrane phospholipids. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) results had indicated that concentrations of a number of these phospholipids were substantially enhanced in GC compared to the background average in spleens. However, it was not clear if biosynthesis in B cells was a basis for this finding, or whether such cell-intrinsic biosynthesis contributes to B cell physiology or Ab responses. Ether lipid biosynthesis can involve the enzyme PexRAP, the product of the Dhrs7b gene. Using combinations of IMS and immunization experiments in mouse models with inducible Dhrs7b loss-of-function, we now show that B lineage-intrinsic expression of PexRAP promotes the magnitude and affinity maturation of a serological response. Moreover, the data revealed a Dhrs7b-dependent increase in ether phospholipids in primary follicles with a more prominent increase in GC.

IDE has a hollow catalytic chamber formed by two ~55 kDa N- and C- domains (IDE-N and IDE-C, respectively), in which peptides bind, unfold, and are repositioned for proteolysis. IDE is known to transition between a closed state, poised for catalysis, and an open state, able to release cleavage products and bind new substrate. Here, we present five cryo-EM structures of the IDE dimer at 3.0-4.1 Angstrom resolution, obtained in the presence of a sub-saturating concentration of insulin. Combining cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified the structural basis and key residues for IDE conformational dynamics that were not revealed by IDE static structures. Notably R668 serves as a molecular latch mediating the open-close transition and facilitates key protein motions through charge-swapping interactions at the IDE-N/C interface. Our small-angle X-ray scattering and enzymatic assays of an R668A mutant indicate a profound alteration of conformational dynamics and catalytic activity. By integrating coarse-grained Upside MD simulations, our analysis reveals that IDE unfolds its substrates through the coordinated motion between IDE-N and IDE-C, as well as {beta}-sheet formation between IDE and insulin.

This analysis revealed high infiltration of CD4+ T cells in Mtb infection, but not in HIV or coinfection. Coinfected mice also showed a minimal number of NK cells compared to the other groups. In addition to infection status, histological features also influenced the immune cell infiltration pattern in the lungs. Two distinct airway regions with distinct immune cell abundance patterns were detected by spatial transcriptome profiling. A lymphoid cell aggregate detected in coinfection lung exhibited distinct transcript profile. The cellular architecture in the lymphoid cell aggregate did not follow the spatial patterns seen in mature granulomas. However, lymphoid cell aggregates exhibited granuloma gene expression signatures, and pathways associated with reactive oxygen species production, oxidative phosphorylation, and TGF{beta} and interferon signaling similar to granulomas. This study revealed specific transcription patterns, immune responses and morphological alteration signaling in the early stage of HIV and Mtb infections.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

How the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which plays a critical role in many cellular processes, impacts EV biogenesis is unclear. The primary cilium, a sensory organelle protruding from most non-dividing cells, transmits signals by shedding EVs called ectosomes. Here, we altered ciliary PI(4,5)P2 by manipulating expression of the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K1) PPK-1 and deletion of the phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase (INPP5E) inpp-1, then determined the impact on release of EVs that carried cargos tagged with fluorescent proteins. We discovered that increasing PI(4,5)P2 differentially affected ectosome shedding from distinct compartments, decreasing biogenesis of an EV subpopulation from the ciliary base, but enhancing budding from the cilium distal tip. Altering PI(4,5)P2 levels also impacted the abundance and distribution of EV cargos in the cilium, but not the sorting of the protein cargos into distinct subsets of ectosomes. Finally, manipulating PI(4,5)P2 did not affect cilium length, suggesting that changing PI(4,5)P2 levels can serve as a mechanism to regulate ectosome biogenesis in response to physiological stimuli without impacting cilium morphology.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Numerous findings hint at a link between dreaming and sleep-dependent memory processing, however, studies investigating day-residue incorporation in dreaming led to mixed results so far. In this study, we used a naturalistic learning paradigm aimed at biasing dream content by manipulating pre-sleep experience. Participants listened to one of four different audiobooks while falling asleep and were awoken several times during the night to report their dreams. Afterwards, we tested how well they remembered the content of the audiobook. We then asked three blind raters to guess, based solely on anonymized dream reports, which audiobook someone had listened to before experiencing a dream. Our findings show that dreams across the whole night and from both NREM and REM awakenings contain specific information about the content of narratives studied before sleep. Moreover, participants with stronger incorporation of the audiobook in their dreams showed a tendency to recognize more audiobook content across the sleep period. Together, these findings suggest that salient day-time experiences resurface in dreams and that content selected for consolidation during sleep is more strongly incorporated.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the consequences of FGF23 excess in kidney disease. Methods This study used three independent disease models: i) anti-glomerular basement membrane (Anti-GBM) disease in male C57BL/6 mice, ii) Adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced nephropathy in female BALB/c mice, and iii) male DBA/2J mice fed an adenine-containing diet. Anti-GBM and Adriamycin mice and matched control mice received intravenous injections of recombinant FGF23 1g or vehicle for six consecutive days (Anti-GBM) or once (Adriamycin model), with dissection 24h after the last injection. Adenine mice underwent organ harvesting after 15 weeks to establish ex vivo precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) and 24h treatment with recombinant FGF23 or vehicle. In addition to histological and biochemical profiling, we assessed serum cytokines, biochemistry and renal transcriptomes and histology of mice and patients with IgA nephropathy. RNAseq data and published transcriptomes underwent gene set enrichment, bulk ligand-receptor interaction analysis and cell-type decomposition. Results Mice with Anti-GBM disease showed decreased glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria and renal tubular casts. FGF23 treatment increased phosphaturia, but also circulating soluble TNF receptor-1. Renal transcriptomes revealed FGF23-driven proinflammatory transcriptional signatures in murine Anti-GBM and also adverse Vcam1, Pdgfrb and chemokine ligand-receptor signaling in Anti-GBM but not in healthy mice. FGF23 increased transcriptome-inferred renal macrophage content in Anti-GBM mice. Findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence. In Adriamycin-induced nephropathy and in PCKS from the adenine nephropathy model, a short-term FGF23 excess caused expression of proinflammatory transcripts. Finally, human data revealed associations between histopathological or transcriptome-inferred renal immune cell infiltration and circulating FGF23 concentrations. Conclusion FGF23-driven patterns of proinflammatory gene and protein expression or leukocyte overabundance in the kidney were observed in several different models or states of FGF23 excess. The present data provide evidence that excess FGF23 directly drives inflammation in kidney disease and may serve as a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In a preregistered study (OSF), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants (12 male, 20 female) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Although single-cell RNA sequencing can resolve this complexity, its cost and technical demands limit its large-scale use. Bulk RNA-seq data provide a scalable alternative, but most deconvolution methods depend on predefined references, restricting their ability to detect novel malignant states. Unsupervised approaches avoid these constraints but are not tailored to capture heterogeneity within the malignant compartment. To address these limitations, we introduce CDState, an unsupervised method for inferring malignant cell subpopulations from bulk RNA-seq data. CDState utilizes non-negative matrix factorization improved with sum-to-one constraint and a cosine similarity-based optimization to deconvolve bulk gene expression into distinct cell state profiles. We demonstrate robustness of CDState on bulkified single-cell RNA-seq datasets from five cancer types, showing that it outperforms existing unsupervised deconvolution methods in the estimation of both cell state proportions and gene expression profiles. Applied to 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, CDState reveals recurrent gene programs, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, MYC targets, and oxidative phosphorylation, as major contributors to malignant cell ITTH. We further link malignant states to patient clinical features, identifying states associated with poor prognosis. We propose an intratumor heterogeneity index and show its association with patient survival, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic response. Finally, we identify mutations and copy number alterations in genes such as TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, SOX2, and SATB1 as potential genetic drivers of malignant cell ITTH across cancer types.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Especially in homogeneous environments, the question why - and how - heterogeneous structure emerges is intriguing. We find a novel function of self-organisation in biology at the colony margin of the fungus Aspergillus niger. Here, the collection of interconnected hyphae splits into two sub-populations with differential expression of amylolytic enzymes. These enzymes are secreted and together break down starch in a multi-step process. We show with a mathematical model that concentrating all enzymes at part of the hyphae results in more efficient substrate degradation, as compared to equal distribution over all hyphae. This model result is corroborated by experimental observations of increased metabolic activity of the wild type that displays hyphal heterogeneity as compared to a mutant that lost this heterogeneity. The intermediate product maltose is known to induce upregulation of amylolytic enzymes. Incorporating this in the model enables the formation of hyphal heterogeneity through self-organisation. We generalize our results to a large class of multi-step processes and demonstrate wide applicability. Importantly, this shows that self-organisation may not be incidental, but favorable, since it enhances efficiency.

B.; Schranz, K.; Hadorn, R.; Chakrabarti, S.; Mu\u0308hlemann, O.", "abstract": "The ATP-dependent RNA helicase Up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) is an essential protein in mammalian cells and a key factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a translation-dependent mRNA surveillance process. UPF1 is mainly cytoplasmic at steady state but accumulates in the nucleus after inhibiting CRM1-mediated nuclear export by Leptomycin B (LMB), indicating that UPF1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Consistent with its dual localization, there is evidence for nuclear functions of UPF1, for instance in DNA replication, DNA damage response, and telomere maintenance. However, whether any of UPF1's biochemical activities are required for its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling remains unclear. To investigate this, we examined two UPF1 mutants: the well-described ATPase-deficient UPF1-DE (D636A/E637A) and a newly generated RNA-binding mutant UPF1-NKR (N524A/K547A/R843A). Biochemical assays confirmed that the UPF1-NKR mutant cannot bind RNA or hydrolyze ATP in vitro but retains interaction with UPF2, UPF3B, and SMG6. Overexpression of UPF1-NKR exerted a dominant-negative effect on endogenous UPF1 and inhibited NMD. Subcellular localization studies revealed that UPF1-DE accumulates in cytoplasmic granules (P-bodies), even in the presence of LMB, whereas UPF1-NKR shuttles normally. This indicates that UPF1's shuttling does not require its RNA-binding or ATPase activities. Notably, the UPF1-DE.NKR double mutant restored nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and prevented accumulation in P-bodies, suggesting that the shuttling defect of UPF1-DE arises from its tight binding to RNA. Overall, our findings demonstrate that UPF1's shuttling is independent of its ATPase and RNA-binding activities, with RNA binding itself being a key determinant of its cytoplasmic retention.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Many bacteria carry phage genome(s) in their chromosome, which intertwines the fitness of the bacterium and the phage. Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carry filamentous phages called Pf that establish chronic infections and do not require host lysis to spread. However, spontaneous mutations in the Pf repressor gene (pf5r) can allow extreme phage production that slows bacterial growth and increases cell death, violating an apparent detente between bacterium and phage. We observed this paradoxical outcome in an evolution experiment with P. aeruginosa in media simulating nutrients from the cystic fibrosis airway. Bacteria containing pf5r mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into pf5r mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: cheater miniphages lacking capsid genes and the superinfection exclusion gene (pfsE) invade populations of full-length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that causes complete prophage loss. The entire cycle, from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss, can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that P. aeruginosa, and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Though most people with CF have one or two copies of the delF508 mutation, there are hundreds of other distinct CF mutations that vary in their mechanistic effects and response to therapeutics. Endogenous chaperones are known to have divergent effects on the druggability of CF variants. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how this proteostatic modulation is related to the underlying mechanistic effects of distinct classes of CF mutations. Here, we survey the effects of a previously discovered effector (calnexin, CANX) on the expression and pharmacological rescue of 232 CF variants using deep mutational scanning. We find that CANX is generally required for robust plasma membrane expression of the CFTR protein- particularly for CF variants that perturb its second nucleotide binding domain. CANX also appears to be critical for the pharmacological rescue of CF variants with poor basal expression. Though corrector selectivity is generally dictated by the properties of mutations, we find that CANX enhances the sensitivity of CF variants within a domain swapped region of membranes spanning domain 2 to the type III corrector VX-445. Overall, mutagenic trends suggest CANX modulates the later stages of CFTR assembly and disproportionately affects variants bearing mutations within the C-terminal domains. Interestingly, we find that the loss of CANX results in widespread perturbations of CF variant interactomes and that the proteostatic effects of CANX are generally decoupled from changes in CFTR activity. Together, our findings reveal how the proteostasis machinery may shape the variant-specific effects of corrector molecules.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we introduce MENDELSEEK, a machine learning framework that predicts Mendelian genes by integrating residue variation scores with pathway participation, Gene Ontology processes, and protein language model features. In benchmarking across 16,946 human genes with 10-fold cross-validation, MENDELSEEK achieved an AUC of 0.869 and an AUPR of 0.737, substantially outperforming the next best methods, ENTPRISE+ENTPRISE-X (AUC 0.781; AUPR 0.626), and REVEL (AUC 0.585; AUPR 0.401).

While the ventral striatum (VS) plays a central role in reward anticipation, its functional connectivity with the default mode network (DMN)-critical for self-referential processing and value integration-potentially represents a key mechanism through which trait differences manifest in reward-related behavior. In the present study, we examine how trait reward sensitivity and state-level behavioral motivation relate to connectivity between the DMN and VS during reward anticipation. Forty-six participants completed the Monetary Incentive Delay task while undergoing fMRI, with trial types reflecting varying levels of reward and loss salience. Behavioral motivation, indexed by reaction time modulation across high-stakes and low-stakes trials, and self-report measures of anhedonia and reward sensitivity were assessed. Reward sensitivity interacted with anhedonia to predict behavioral motivation, such that individuals with higher anhedonia showed stronger behavioral motivation when reward sensitivity was greater, while those with lower anhedonia showed weaker behavioral motivation when reward sensitivity was greater. Critically, during high-stakes trials, reward sensitivity was associated with stronger DMN-VS connectivity in highly motivated individuals and weaker connectivity in less motivated participants. This moderation effect was consistent across gain and loss contexts, though with distinct directionality patterns. These findings provide novel insights into the neural correlates of individual differences in reward processing, demonstrating that trait reward sensitivity, anhedonia, and behavioral motivation are associated with distinct patterns of DMN-VS interactions during reward anticipation.

This migration occurs through three-dimensional complex behaviors-translation, swinging, and rolling-characterized by periodic patterns that align with cavity oscillations. Embryonic durotaxis is initiated from asymmetric adhesion forces and is driven by embryonic protrusive forces, generated from Marangoni-like tissue flows. The intrinsic cavity oscillations further amplify and sustain embryonic durotaxis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of embryonic durotaxis significantly reduced CSP incidence in the mouse model.

The CASP16 Conformational Ensembles Experiment included two challenges to predict the interdomain pose distribution of a Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) D-L-D construct, called ZLBT-C, in which two of SpA's five nearly identical domains are connected by either (1) a six-residue wild-type (WT) linker (KADNKF), or (2) an all-glycine (Gly6) linker. The wild-type linker has a highly conserved sequence and is thought to contribute to the energetic barrier for binding with host antibodies. Ground truth was provided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data on WT protein and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data on both proteins in solution. Twenty-five predictor groups submitted 35 sets of predicted conformational distributions, in the form of population-weighted finite ensembles of discrete structures. Unlike traditional CASP assessments that compare predicted atomic models to experimental atomic models, the accuracy of these predictions was assessed by back-calculating NMR RDCs and SAXS curves from each ensemble of atomic models and comparing these results to respective experimental data. Accuracy was also assessed by using kernelization to compare ensembles to the continuous orientational distributions optimally fit to experimental data.

Accuracy of such estimates rests on correctly classifying recurrent infections developed during follow-up as recrudescences or new infections. Genotyping is used to guide classification, but polyclonal infections and alleles matching by chance make classification challenging, especially in high transmission settings. Match-counting algorithms currently recommended by World Health Organization are unreliable and produce biased results, necessitating development of principled statistical approaches. Modern genotyping methods such as multiplexed amplicon sequencing hold great potential for resolving recurrences and motivate the need for corresponding statistical methods able to utilize the rich data they provide. We propose an Adaptive Statistical framework for Therapeutic Efficacy and Recrudescence (Aster) that delivers accurate and consistent results by explicitly incorporating complexity of infection (COI), population allele frequencies, and imperfect detection of alleles in minority strains. Using an identity by descent approach, Aster accounts for alleles matching by chance and for a background infection relatedness structure that can otherwise lead to misclassification. The flexible framework can also use external information, such as parasite density and performance characteristics of a genotyping panel. Using simulations, we show that Aster dramatically outperforms match-counting algorithms in a wide variety of transmission settings and demonstrates consistently balanced performance that improves with more informative genotyping panels. Aster is implemented in a fast, fully scalable, and user-friendly R software package asterTES and provides accurate estimates of treatment failure for TES with any type of genotyping data, facilitating reliable evaluation of drug efficacy and effective management of malaria.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Applying multiple combinations of deconvolution methods and signatures often results in hundreds of redundant or contradictory cell type features describing the composition of complex tumour samples. Benchmarking efforts are inherently limited by the lack of bias-free ground truth, often yielding inconsistent results or no consensus. To address these limitations, we present multideconv, an R package that reduces dimensionality and eliminates redundancy in deconvolution results, through unsupervised filtering and iterative correlation analyses. Built on top of existing frameworks, multideconv harmonizes outputs across methods to identify robust cell type proportion estimates and mitigate signature-driven heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Whether these developmental regulators are redeployed during adult tissue maintenance and regeneration is an open question in regenerative biology. Here, we investigate the role of the Schmidtea mediterranea BRN3/POU4 homolog, Smed-pou4-2 (pou4-2), in the regeneration of mechanosensory neurons. We find that pou4-2 is regulated by the SoxB1 homolog, soxB1-2, and is expressed in a distinct population of ciliated sensory cells that detect water flow. Transcriptomic analysis of pou4-2-deficient planarians reveals enrichment for conserved genes associated with human auditory and vestibular function, suggesting that planarian rheosensory neurons share molecular features with mammalian inner ear hair cells. Expression of these conserved genes is significantly reduced following RNAi-mediated knockdown of pou4-2. To determine whether these transcriptional changes have functional consequences for mechanosensory neuron identity or behavior, we assessed the impact of pou4-2 knockdown on sensory function. pou4-2 RNAi results in impaired mechanosensation in both uninjured and regenerating planarians. Together with the loss of terminal differentiation markers in mechanosensory neurons, these findings identify Smed-pou4-2 as a key regulator of mechanosensory neuron identity in planarians and support the idea that conserved sensory specification programs are redeployed during adult tissue regeneration.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Constrained by the anatomical and electrophysiological data, we developed a multi-regional model of the marmoset neocortex that captures the observed timescale hierarchy phenomenon. Furthermore, we used the model to investigate how the neocortex reconciles information integration on distinct timescales in local areas with reliable signal propagation globally across regions. We found that a near-criticality state is optimal for both localized signal integration within areas and reliable signal propagation across areas in the multi regional neocortex.

The high conformational flexibility of glycans hindered detailed atomistic investigations of and glycan-bNAb interactions, including glycan shielding of bNAbs. Importantly, how these interactions vary across different HIV-1 clades remains unclear. The variability in the number and location of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) on the envelope (Env) protein across clades can lead to differences in glycan dynamics and topology, potentially affecting Env-bNAb interactions and the clade-specific efficacy of bNAb-based therapies. Here, we combined comprehensive glycan conformational sampling, using the software glycoSHIELD, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model fully glycosylated trimeric Env for six HIV-1 strains, one from each of the clades A, B, C, G, CRF01 AE (01 AE) and CRF07 BC (07 BC). We assessed the interactions of 50 different bNAbs, drawn from all the major bNAb classes, with each of these strains, quantifying glycan shielding, glycan-bNAb interactions, and their clade-specific variations for each bNAb in microscopic detail. Our findings reveal that while glycans cover most of the exposed surface area in all clades, the amount of accessible surface varies, with clade B having the minimum and clade 07 BC the maximum antibody accessible surface area. The number of glycan conformers per glycosylation site also varies with clades, even for conserved sites. Overall, we observed that bNAbs interact with more glycans than previously reported in experimental and computational studies. Important variations emerge in Env-bNAb interactions with clades and bNAb-class. These atomic-level insights will be valuable for improving bNAb-based therapies and vaccine design strategies against HIV-1.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

The wild boar, a highly adaptable species, is expanding its range and increasingly observed in urban and peri-urban areas, where it can cause accidents, damage, and health concerns. To mitigate their presence, non-lethal control strategies such as vegetation clearing in peri-urban parks and wastelands are being implemented to reduce the number of suitable resting sites. However, the ecological consequences of such habitat modifications on other wildlife species remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap limits the development of effective urban wildlife management strategies that seeks to balance ecological, social and economic considerations without harming wild boar populations and urban ecosystems. In this context, we used camera trapping to study the covariation between wild boars and other mammal species in a peri-urban area, with the aim of guiding targeted and effective management strategies. Here, we show a widespread presence of wild boars but no spatial or temporal covariation between the wild boars and the other species. In contrast, we found strong spatial structuring in mammal communities, primarily driven by small carnivores (mustelids, genets, cats, foxes) and a minimal influence of temporal variation, confirming that spatial factors, rather than seasonal changes, largely shaped species distributions. The study of the temporal variation across months indicated minimal seasonal structuring but revealed substantial within-site variability in month-to-month species abundance, with a general abundance gradient driven by common species like wild boar, cat, and fox. In conclusion, our results show that the lack of spatial covariation between wild boar and other species prevents reliable predictions, supporting a targeted rather than general approach to vegetation management.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

The most abundant marine microorganisms, SAR11 (order Pelagibacterales), exhibit canonical genome streamlining, but the consequences of this genotype on core cellular processes like cell division remain unexplored. Analysis of several hundred SAR11 genomes revealed widespread absence of key cell cycle control genes, and growth experiments demonstrated that, although SAR11 bacteria maintain a normal cell cycle under oligotrophic conditions, they exhibit growth inhibition and aneuploidy when exposed to nutrient enrichment, carbon source shifts, or temperature stress. Detailed temporal sampling showed that these phenotypes occurred because of cell division disruption with continuing DNA replication, leading to heterogeneous subpopulations of normal and polyploid cells.

How can one assess proximity to criticality when control parameters are unknown, difficult to manipulate experimentally, and fluctuating in response to changing environmental or internal conditions? Here we meet this challenge with a rigorous theoretical framework and data-analytic strategy for measuring proximity to criticality from observed system dynamics. We developed a temporal RG, well-suited to commonly measured time series, and an information theoretic quantification of proximity to criticality that is independent of model parameterization. After benchmarking our approach on diverse ground-truth cases, we apply it to recordings of spiking activity in the mammalian brain, addressing a long-standing controversy.

Conversely, as shown by our previous study, cross pollination frequency (CPF) would be very high (>80%) if the overlap of FEDs of the PP and OP is considerably long. In continuation of our previous study conducted in 2019, we subsequently conducted crossing experiments with 19 pairs of rice landraces during short-day flowering season and 8 pairs during long-day flowering season.

While several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been proposed, little is known about how performance is influenced by (a) the number of trainable parameters and (b) the patch size used for prediction. Moreover, existing studies rely primarily on quantitative metrics and overlook biological relevance of predictions. In this study, we systematically evaluated multiple convolution based models (including a Vision Transformer (ViT) model) with different patch sizes on the Xenium based Autoimmune Machine Learning Challenge (AMLC) dataset. We assessed model performance on both globally expressed genes and subsets enriched for immune or disease associated pathways.

Hard gold coated and custom designed microelectrode arrays with individual electrode radius of 100 m were used to identify spikes with frequency components between 150-3000 Hz. The dispersed mycelial cultures were estimated to comprise of a total of 177 spiking units across triplicates (T1= 83, T2=44, T3=50). The triplicates had a combined mean trough-to-peak time of 1.58 {+/-} 0.14 ms. Dehydration and H2O2 fungicidal assays showed reduction of the spiking units to zero. Differences in power spectral density (PSD) and Fourier transform analysis of the respective traces suggest that physical structures in the dehydration assay were preserved but that the interface between the mycelium and the electrodes was removed. Biofilm formation was not, therefore, required to detect extracellular spikes using the methods described here. The fungicidal assays removed the discrete unit electrophysiological spike resulting in zero spiking units detected confirming the physiological origin of the extracellular signals.

However, whether reactive cortical microglia also exhibit changes in purinergic signaling, cytokine levels, and purinergic receptors are unknown. Thus, we seek to evaluate region-based differences in microglial reactivity in the TMEV model. We employed a custom triple transgenic mouse line expressing tdTomato and GCaMP6f under a CX3CR1 Cre promoter and exogenously applied ATP/ADP to acute brain slice preparations from TMEV-infected mice and controls. Interestingly and in contrast to what is observed in hippocampus, we found that despite microglial reactivity in the cortex, microglia can respond to purinergic damage signals and engage calcium signaling pathways, comparable to PBS controls. Using a cytokine panel, we also found that pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-{gamma}) are brain-region dependent in mice infected with TMEV. Using RNAScope-FISH, we observed increases in expression of purinergic receptors responsible for microglial motility (P2Y12R) and inflammation (P2X7R) in the cortex.

Host morphology measurements and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were used to track microbiome assembly across three early developmental stages of the host. We identified 143 ASVs that differed between plants from surface-sterilized versus intact seeds, highlighting the strong influence of epiphytic bacteria on microbiome assembly.

Loss-of-function mutations in GDF2 are found in heritable PAH, suggesting its function as an endothelial quiescence factor, while agonizing or antagonizing BMP9 signaling are both reported to ameliorate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study sought to resolve the contribution of BMP9 to pulmonary vascular disease and its status as a potential therapeutic target. The function of BMP9 in experimental PH was interrogated using recombinant BMP9, BMP9/BMP10 ligand trap ALK1-Fc, two anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies, and the activin/GDF/BMP ligand trap ACTRIIA-Fc (a.k.a., sotatercept). Disulfide-linked, prodomain complexed BMP9 was not protective in SUGEN-hypoxia or monocrotaline-induced PH models, in contrast to previous studies using incompletely disulfide-linked BMP9. In contrast, selective and non-selective BMP9 antagonism exerted prophylactic and therapeutic effects across PH models. Anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc had comparable impact on hemodynamics, RV hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling, while single nucleus RNA-Seq revealed similar inhibition of SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3 transcriptional activity, and highly overlapping DEGs, particularly in the endothelial compartment (r=0.83, p=2.54e-43, Spearman), suggesting overlap of mechanism in targeting BMP9. A multi-omic approach using lung tissues from human PAH, experimental models of pulmonary hypertension, and transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from PAH patients revealed that BMP9 is critical for regulating several endothelial gene products that are overexpressed in human and experimental disease and implicated in disease pathogenesis including CXCL12, PDGF-BB, EDN1, COL18A1, and IGFBP4, and are inhibited by administering anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibodies or ligand traps. Co-culture studies revealed paracrine effects of BMP9-stimulated PMVEC on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) phenotypic plasticity, which could be attributed in large part to endothelial-derived CXCL12. In summary, endothelial BMP9 signaling is a key coordinator of vasoactive endothelial gene products that modulate PASMC phenotype and appears to be a shared target of anti-BMP9 and ACTRIIA-Fc.

To meet this challenge, we introduce Contrastive Learning Sequence-Structure (CLSS), an AI-based contrastive learning model trained to co-embed sequence and structure information in a self-supervised manner. We trained CLSS on large and diverse sets of protein building blocks called domains. CLSS represents both sequences and structures as vectors in the same high-dimensional space, where distance relates to sequence-structure similarity. Thus, CLSS provides a natural way to represent the protein universe, reflecting evolutionary relationships, as well as structural changes. We find that CLSS refines expert knowledge about the global organization of protein space, and highlights transitional forms that resist hierarchical classification. CLSS reveals linkage between domains of seemingly separate lineages, thereby significantly improving our understanding of evolutionary design.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To overcome current limitations in imaging and genomic technologies, we developed a cluster-based phasing strategy using long read nano-NOMe-seq to link distinct CTCF binding states--captured at the single molecule level--to the transcriptional status of genes. By stitching partially overlapping long reads and clustering them by shared GpC-accessibility patterns, we stratify CTCF into graded binding states on individual molecules, classify RNA polymerase states at promoters/gene bodies, and infer when spatially separated loci are coordinately activated and occupy loop-competent configurations on the same molecules. When applied to Sox2, Hoxa, and Klf1 regions, cluster-based nano-NOMe-seq phasing reveals how specific topologies bias polymerase behavior and multi-locus activity in ways that bulk assays or locus-engineered imaging cannot fully capture.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to examine how head motion-related exclusions and participant retention shape sample composition over time. At baseline (ages 9-10), Black, Hispanic, and Asian youth were significantly more likely than White youth to be excluded due to excessive head motion; these disparities were not observed at the two-year follow-up (ages 11-13). In contrast, disparities in retention persisted; Black participants were less likely to return for follow-up, even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and motion.

Here, we demonstrate that LRE mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagic capacity are critical for efficient nutrient uptake and maintenance of their specialized identity, as disruption of either process leads to premature differentiation into postweaning enterocytes (PECs) with diminished endolysosomal and metabolic activity. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that neonatal LREs exhibit a distinctive antioxidant signature, which preserves redox balance and safeguards the expression of the transcriptional regulators MAFB and BLIMP1, both central repressors of the neonatal-to-adult metabolic transition. These findings establish the mitochondria lysosome axis as a key determinant of LRE function and neonatal metabolic programming.

In present study, samples for patients with FTD were obtained from GEO dataset [GSE92340]. The samples were pre-processed followed by differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2. The patient sample was analyzed for 1882 upregulated genes. Hub gene out of DEGs was identified using CytoHubba Plugin of Cytoscape based on eleven parameters (Degree, Edge Percolated Component (EPC), Maximum Neighbourhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighbourhood Component (DMNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), Bottleneck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress). HDAC1 gene was identified as hub gene and key target in case of FTD. CADD pipeline was used to identify phytochemicals against HDAC1 gene. A list of eighty-one phytochemicals found in Indian spices was analyzed for their drug likeness abilities using molinspiration and toxicity prediction using ProTox-II, which identified twenty-three phytochemicals as safe drug-like compounds. PatchDock was employed to examine interactions between phytochemical compounds and HDAC1. Molecular interactions revealed rosmarinic acid derived from rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) as the most effective drug for FTD having lowest ACE value of -395 kcal/mol.

Yet this raises a paradox: if there is such strong selection for optimal display choreography within species, how do courtship displays diversify so extensively between species? To address this, we measure how the choreography of courtship changes among allopatric populations of the dancing dune fly - Apotropina ornatipennis Malloch (Diptera: Chloropidae) - a species in which males and females spend their days cavorting on Australias hot sandy beaches. Merging population genetics with detailed quantification of the courtship display we explore which elements of the display are the first to diverge between isolated populations, whether new behaviours arise rapidly, and whether sequence rearrangements occur in the modular structure of the display. We find that these tiny flies express courtship repertoires approaching the levels of visual complexity seen in birds of paradise. Yet despite clear genetic and geographic isolation, the complex choreography of courtship displays is stable among populations. In contrast to the notion that courtship behaviour should be highly evolvable and rapidly diverge among allopatric populations, our findings suggests that the complex choreography of courtship can instead act as a stabilising feature that limits divergence over short evolutionary timescales.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Although often both sources jointly drive sequential behavior, previous research has primarily examined them in isolation. To address this, we trained participants to perform sequences of rapid finger presses in response to numerical cues. Sensory influence was measured by varying the number of visible cues, and memory influence by comparing repeating and random sequences. Early in learning, participants integrated sensory and memory information: repeating sequences were performed more quickly when more cues were visible. After learning, when repeating sequences were predictable with certainty, participants relied solely on memory and ignored sensory cues. However, when this certainty was manipulated by introducing occasional violations within repeating sequences, participants reverted to integrating memory with sensory cues. We propose a computational model that successfully predicted both speed and accuracy of individual presses. Critically, this model relied on the assumption that multiple movements are planned independently of each other. This independence assumption was then validated by examining response patterns to isolated violations in repeating sequences. Finally, we provide evidence into how sequence memories can be flexibly deactivated and reactivated in response to these violations.

AD patients with PSEN2 variants have increased risk of unprovoked seizures versus age-matched healthy controls, yet few studies have interrogated PSEN2 contributions to seizures, and fewer have done so with aging. PSEN2 variant mice also do not exhibit amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation, allowing for the assessment of A{beta}-independent contributions to seizure risk in AD. Critically, PSEN proteolytic capacity may regulate hippocampal kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), with PSEN deletion reducing KAR availability and synaptic transmission in vitro (Barthet et al 2022). Kainic acid (KA) is a naturally occurring KAR agonist that acutely evokes severe seizures in mice. We thus hypothesized that PSEN2 knockout (KO) mice would have reduced latency to acutely evoked seizures and status epilepticus (SE), increased convulsive SE burden, worsened 7-day survival, and altered hippocampal KAR expression vs age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Using a repeated low-dose systemic KA administration paradigm, we quantified the latency to acute seizures and convulsive SE, then quantified neuropathology in 3-4-month-old and 12-15-month-old male and female PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. GluK2 and GluK5 KAR subunit expression was colocalized in astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry 7 days after KA-SE or sham-SE to define the interaction between PSEN2 loss and acute seizures on hippocampal KARs. Regardless of sex, young PSEN2 KO mice were more susceptible to KA-induced acute seizures than WTs. Young PSEN2 KO mice of both sexes also entered SE sooner than age-matched WT mice. In aged mice, there was no significant difference in latency to first seizure or SE onset between genotypes in either sex. However, regardless of genotype, aged females entered SE sooner than young females and experienced greater mortality. This was not observed in males. Among young animals, there was no difference in KAR expression between genotypes and regardless of treatment group. In both genotypes, hippocampal CA3 astrocytes expressed GluK5 following KA-SE, however, astrocytic GluK2 expression only occurred in WT mice. GluK5 expression was significantly reduced in untreated aged PSEN2 KO mice versus untreated WT mice, while total GluK2 expression did not differ between genotypes or seizure groups. Following KA-SE, astrocytic GluK5 expression was only present in WT animals in CA3, while both genotypes presented with astrocytic GluK5 expression.

To study these behaviors and the neural signals that underlie them, we introduce face-rhythm, a tool for quantitatively tracking, extracting, and interpreting facial movements. The approach utilizes markerless point tracking, spectral analysis, and tensor component analysis to extract demixed components of behavior from videos of facial movements. Face-rhythm is fully unsupervised and allows for the discovery of uninstructed behaviors; when applied to videos of facial behavior, face-rhythm identifies interpretable behaviors such as whisking, sniffing, and snout movements. Analysis of videos of mice in various behavioral conditions, including a classical conditioning protocol, a brain-machine interface (BMI) task, and natural behaviors outside of a task structure, revealed robust signatures of uninstructed facial movements in all regimes. The expression of these facial movements predicted internal belief states during classical conditioning and was correlated with instructed neural activity when the BMI was activated. Furthermore, facial behaviors identified by face-rhythm were highly represented in face-associated areas of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that M1 neural activity encodes a mixed representation of both the phase of facial movements as well as the phase-invariant spectral envelope of movement patterns, with higher-frequency facial movements being more likely to be represented as phase-invariant. Our results demonstrate that face-rhythm provides a novel and flexible approach for decomposing continuous face movements into natural behavioral motifs that are closely linked to neural activity patterns.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we first use structural neuroimaging data in two independent human cohorts (combined N=1,754; 967 females) to quantify and spatially resolve the differential contributions of SA and CT to observed sex differences in CV. These dissociable facets of sex-biased cortical organization are highly reproducible and align with distinct functional networks and histo-molecular signatures. We then leverage complementary neuroimaging data in clinical case-control cohorts (combined N=313) featuring variations in X and Y chromosome dosage (sex chromosome aneuploidies) and testicular hormone production (isolated GnRH deficiency) to establish that regions of sex-biased CV, SA and CT in humans are enriched for congruent anatomical effects of X-chromosome dosage (e.g., primary sensory and insular cortices) and gonadal hormones (e.g. dorsomedial frontal and temporo-parietal-occipital regions).

Here, we generated a spatiomolecular atlas of NAc cell types and spatial domains by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem NAc tissue from 10 neurotypical adult donors. We identified 20 transcriptionally unique cell populations and 8 spatial domains, including specialized D1 islands composed of distinct dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) MSN subtypes, which were enriched for OPRM1. In contrast to a discrete core vs. shell division, we observed continuous spatial gradients of gene expression across MSN domains, suggesting a more complex organization of DRD1 and DRD2 MSNs.

Many neurons modulate their firing rates at specific phases of theta (known as theta phase locking), creating discrete windows for information processing. Disrupted theta phase locking has been found across several neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., epilepsy), but gaps in technology have prevented its causal influence from being tested. Here, we developed PhaSER, a closed-loop optogenetic system designed to control the phase locking of specific interneurons, and demonstrate a causal role for inhibitory phase locking in seizure susceptibility. We first found that parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) show distinct theta phase locking profiles and are differentially impacted in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. In healthy mice, PV+ interneurons have extremely consistent phase-locked firing near the trough of CA1 theta, aligned with excitatory inputs to DG. However, in epileptic mice, PV+ interneuron activity is dispersed across the theta cycle, suggesting that altered inhibitory phase locking could be a causal mediator of seizure susceptibility in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we applied PhaSER to directly control the phase locking of DG interneurons during an acute test of seizure susceptibility. In epileptic mice, re-aligning DG PV+ interneuron theta phase locking reduced seizure susceptibility, while in healthy mice, disrupting normal phase locking of PV+ interneurons increased seizure susceptibility. Together, this provides the first causal evidence that inhibitory theta phase locking can directly control network function by shifting seizure susceptibility in the healthy and epileptic brain.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Yet current theoretical and statistical frameworks provide only a partial view of the dynamics and genomic consequences of introgression. An unexplored dimension is the possibility that introgression between two lineages can occur simultaneously in both directions at a single genomic locus-- a process we term reciprocal introgression. Although this type of introgression is plausible, especially in cases of bidirectional introgression across the genome, it remains largely undetectable under widely used statistical approaches, hindering evaluation of its prevalence in natural systems. Moreover, unrecognized reciprocal introgression may bias summary statistics commonly used to quantify gene flow, obscuring our ability to resolve introgression events. To address this, here, we develop theoretical expectations of the impact of reciprocal introgression on phylogenetic and site-pattern-based results. To test these expectations, we implement coalescent simulations to model genomes experiencing reciprocal introgression and apply sliding-window introgression statistics to these data. We find that reciprocally introgressed loci produce phylogenetic patterns opposite to those expected under unidirectional introgression. These mixed signals can dilute evidence of introgression or even generate false signals of introgression events that never occurred.

These metals often co-occur in contaminated environments, but their combined effects on brain development remain poorly understood. Objective: To test the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to a mixture of environmentally relevant levels of Pb, As, Cd, and Cr(VI), causes developmental defects in cognition, behavior, and neuronal function. Methods: Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either a single metal or the PACC mixture in drinking water. Exposure began two weeks preconception and continued until weaning at postnatal day 21. Juvenile mice were tested at 4-5 weeks of age in open field (locomotion), novel object recognition (short-term memory), Y-maze (working memory), and elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behavior). A subset of animals underwent Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Results: Perinatal exposure to PACC metal mixture increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired short-term memory but not locomotion or working memory. Pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampal CA1 displayed increased intrinsic excitability, mPFC neurons also showed elevated amplitude in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Discussion: Our findings suggest that perinatal exposure to the PACC metal mixture impairs cognition, increases anxiety-like behavior, and alters neuronal function in specific brain regions of juvenile mice, leading to disruption in neuronal function and behavior later in life.

The latter two harbor IDH1 mutations and exhibit slower progression than glioblastomas. Diffuse gliomas are composed of highly plastic tumor cells capable of transitioning between astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte-like, progenitor-like, and mesenchymal-like states, driven by genetic alterations and microenvironmental cues. The proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT), associated with increased malignancy, is notably influenced by cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. Endothelin cytokines (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3), primarily secreted by vascular cells, regulate not only vascular tone but also astrocyte and neural stem cell proliferation via the G-protein-coupled receptors EDNRA and EDNRB. Prior studies using serum-cultured glioma lines suggested pro-proliferative effects of endothelins; however, such models poorly recapitulate the in vivo glioma context. In this study, we comprehensively revisited endothelin signaling -covering receptor expression, regulation, downstream pathways, and cellular responses- using eleven serum-free, patient-derived glioma lines (glioblastomas, IDH-wt and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas), along with primary tumor samples. Multi-omics and electrophysiological analyses revealed EDNRB as the predominant receptor, enriched in astrocyte-like cells, upregulated by BMPs or growth factor withdrawal, and downregulated by interferons, IL-6 cytokines, endothelins, and Hippo/YAP activation. In contrast, EDNRA was expressed by a perivascular tumor subpopulation and induced by Notch signaling in glioblastomas but not in IDH1-mutant cells. Functionally, endothelins reduced proliferation across all models while promoting migration and PMT. Mechanistically, EDNRB activation increased intracellular Ca2+; and activated ERK, STAT3, and apamin-sensitive SK2/SK3 potassium channels. These findings identify endothelin signaling as an important regulator of glioma cell plasticity and behavior.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Neural crest-derived glial cells were previously implicated in neuroendocrine tumors arising in the pituitary and pancreas, yet these studies lacked a clear mechanism for these events. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that Men1-driven Hedgehog (HH) signaling redirects the glial cell fate to give rise to neuroendocrine tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. Using archived patient specimens and The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrated that GEP-NETs overexpress HH pathway components, including SHH and its cognate receptor PTCH1. We showed that patient-derived pancreatic NET tumoroids proliferate in response to SHH pathway agonists. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of GLI1/2, but not inhibition of SMO alone, attenuated tumoroid growth. Using two genetic mouse models, we showed that loss of Men1 in GFAP+ and SOX10+ glial cells causes the development of pancreatic and small intestinal NETs that overexpress HH proteins. Further use of tdTomato+ mice demonstrated the involvement of GFAP+ and SOX10+ glial cells in these tumors. Tumoroid cultures of mouse pancreatic and small intestinal NETs recapitulated the drug response shown by patient-derived tumoroids. Lastly, Men1-deficient enteric glial cultures showed a glial-to-neuroendocrine transition that was alleviated upon HH inhibition, and these events were reproduced in genetic mice harboring GFAP+ cells with impaired primary cilia. Our study implicates the HH signaling pathway in GEP-NET development and underscores a glial cell of origin for these tumors.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

S.; Lee, A. M.; Vulchanova, L.", "abstract": "Chronic pain and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are major health concerns that significantly impair quality of life. Persistent pain is common in individuals with alcohol dependence, and alcohol is commonly used by chronic pain patients for self-medication. The neural mechanisms linking these conditions remain unclear. We hypothesized that chronic alcohol exposure induces hypersensitivity in multiple modalities and increases the duration of recovery in acute and persistent pain models. Using the two-bottle free-choice alcohol consumption paradigm in adult mice, alcohol-induced hypersensitivity (AIH), indicated by reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds, developed after 4-6 weeks of alcohol consumption compared to age- and sex-matched water-consuming controls. Alcohol-consuming female mice, but not male mice, developed cold hypersensitivity after AIH emerged. To assess the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on acute and persistent pain, we used intraplantar capsaicin and sciatic nerve crush models, respectively. In the capsaicin model, water-treated, but not alcohol-treated, mice recovered from hypersensitivity by 24 hours post-injection. In the sciatic nerve crush model, alcohol-consuming mice exhibited slower recovery of mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared to water-consuming controls. While mechanical hypersensitivity in water-consuming mice returned to pre-surgical thresholds by 3-4 weeks post-surgery, recovery in alcohol-consuming mice was both delayed and partial. Surgical intervention did not impact alcohol intake. Overall, our results suggest that chronic voluntary alcohol consumption facilitates the transition to chronic pain by prolonging hypersensitivity and delaying recovery from injuries.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

IL-12{beta} KO in male and female mice significantly attenuated TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction as evidenced by improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and fractional shortening. IL-12{beta} KO also significantly ameliorated the TAC-induced increase of LV weight, left atrial weight, lung weight, right ventricular (RV) weight, and their ratios to body weight or tibial length in male and female mice. In addition, IL-12{beta} KO significantly attenuated TAC-induced LV leukocyte infiltration, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and the consequent lung inflammation and remodeling. Moreover, IL-12{beta} KO reduced TAC-induced alterations of LV gene profile associated with inflammation and fibrosis, as shown by bulk LV RNA sequencing. Furthermore, we found that IL-12{beta} KO significantly attenuated TAC-induced LV accumulation of multiple immune cell subsets, activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the percentage of central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the cardiac drainage lymph nodes. Finally, IL-12{beta} KO mice showed significantly reduced IFN{gamma}+CD8+ and CXCR3+CD8+ T cells in the drainage lymph nodes as compared with WT after TAC.

To address these challenges, we introduce scDMC, an innovative dual-stream contrastive pre-training framework designed to synergistically optimize information fidelity at both the gene and cell levels. Pre-trained on only 2 million cells far fewer than the datasets used by mainstream models, scDMC sets a new state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark tasks, including cell annotation, clustering, and data integration. More importantly, we demonstrate that scDMC can uncover functional gene modules, infer cell-type-specific regulatory networks in a data-driven manner, and exhibits a high degree of biological interpretability.

Our study aimed to improve ADC efficacy using a new integrated approach for custom ADC design and multiplexing. To nominate rational combinations of ADC targets and ADC payloads, we (1) examined protein co-expression of three clinically relevant surface antigens--B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate-1 (STEAP1)--in a series of human mCRPC samples and (2) screened established ADC payloads and their combinations in mCRPC cell lines with different phenotypes.

However, its clinical utilization is significantly hampered by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) constitutes the central component of the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) has been demonstrated to exert a cardioprotective effect and augment cardiac antioxidative capacity in settings of heart failure. However, the role of ATF4 in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC) remains unknown. Methods: To explore the role of ATF4 in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiac-specific ATF4 conditional heterozygous mice and AAV9 mediated ATF4 overexpression mouse models were utilized. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. The upstream regulator and downstream mediator of ATF4 were evaluated using RNA-seq analysis and further verified using ChIP assay and luciferase reporter assay. Results: We found a substantial decrease in ATF4 expression levels in the heart of DIC mice. ATF4+/- mice exhibited a higher degree of susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in comparison with ATF4flox/flox mice, as evidenced by the manifestation of more severe cardiac dysfunction and a significantly earlier mortality rate. In contrast, cardiacc-specific overexpression ATF4 by AAV9 confers robust cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Mechanistically, we identified the upstream regulator of ATF4 as KLF16, which was significantly suppressed during DOX treatment. Further, the decrease of ATF4 led to a reduction in cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE) transcription and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production in the context of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays revealed that ATF4 functioned as the transcription factor of the CSE gene. In contrast, the ectopic expression of ATF4 mitigated oxidative stress and apoptosis in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Conclusions: Our study revealed a novel function of ATF4 in counteracting oxidative stress in DOX cardiotoxicity by promoting the transcription of CSE. ATF4 may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined the effects of streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency or a high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance on cognitive function in knock-in AD mouse models expressing human mutant APP and wild-type tau. Both metabolic perturbations caused hyperglycemia, but only the HFHS diet resulted in weight gain and greater learning and memory deficits. The HFHS diet exacerbation occurred without changes in amyloid-{beta} or phospho-tau accumulation and with only subtle alterations in microglial morphology. The basis for functional deficits was explored with single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis. Prominent gene expression changes in glial cells and cerebral cortex Layer 2 inhibitory neurons correlated with the enhanced behavioral deficits. In HFHS-fed AD mice, we observed a shared metabolic impairment in neurodegeneration (MinD) state across multiple glial cell types. Additionally, the HFHS diet, with or without AD pathology, induced selective upregulation of the transcription factor Meis2 in cortical Layer 2 inhibitory neurons, in association with pathways involved in cell excitability. Overall, these findings suggest that HFHS-driven metabolic stress affects brain function and behavior through specific cellular programs distinct from amyloid or tau pathology, and identifies new targets that link diet-induced metabolic stress to cognitive decline in AD.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Using a validated transcriptional signature, we found that predicted tumor-reactive T cells (TRC) in untreated glioblastomas reside almost exclusively in a clonally expanded GZMKhi population with developmental plasticity, affording them the potential to differentiate into both tissue-resident and terminal effector T cells. Dual ICI therapy induced substantial clonal remodeling, characterized by the recruitment of new TRC from the periphery into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and differentiation into transitional effectors and ultimately terminal effectors along a gradient characterized by simultaneous acquisition of cytotoxic and exhaustion genes, regulated by specific transcriptional, metabolic, and epigenetic programs. Longitudinal clonal tracking in peripheral blood confirmed that with ICI treatment, most TRC expand transiently in circulation prior to tumor infiltration, with peripherally derived clones becoming the major contributor to the GZMKhi TRC that further expand in the tumor. Our study provides the first comprehensive map of T cell clonal dynamics and differentiation in glioblastoma following dual ICIs and highlights a potential mechanism of immune activation and peripheral recruitment of TRC in glioblastoma not previously described.

Using advanced light microscopy to resolve individual virions and receptors, we found instead that heparan sulfate (HS), not ACE2, mediates SARS-CoV-2 cell-surface attachment and subsequent endocytosis. ACE2 functions only downstream of HS to enable viral genome expression. Instead of binding single HS molecules that electrostatically interact with viral surface proteins weakly, SARS-CoV-2 binds clusters of ~6-137 HS molecules projecting 60-410 nm above the plasma membrane. These tall, HS-rich clusters, present at about one per 6 m{superscript 2}, act as docking sites for viral attachment. Blocking HS binding with the clinically used HS-binding agent pixantrone strongly inhibited the clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariant from attaching to and infecting human airway cells. This work establishes a revised entry paradigm in which HS clusters mediate SARS-CoV-2 attachment and endocytosis, with ACE2 acting downstream, thereby identifying HS interactions as a key anti-COVID-19 strategy.

Within minutes, chromatin in these cells re-expands and re-associates with the lamina (rewetting). This reversible chromatin lamina dewetting is mechanosensitive, requiring both the LINC complex and intracellular calcium. During compaction, calcium is stored within chromatin and is later released during ATR mediated expansion and lamina re-wetting. Chromatin re-expansion then triggers actomyosin contraction and promotes tissue repair through Jun kinase activation, straightening of the wound edge, and supracellular actin ring formation.

R.", "abstract": "Vernolac is a commercially available polyherbal nutraceutical capsule comprised of Vernonia zeylanica aerial parts, Nigella sativa seeds, Hemidesmus indicus roots, Leucas zeylanica aerial parts, and Smilax glabra rhizome. Different herbal formulations, organic extracts, and many isolated phytochemicals of the above plants have been reported to exhibit anticancer properties. However, the anticancer mechanisms of action of Vernolac, as a polyherbal formulation, remain unexplored. This study employed an integrative network pharmacology-based approach, complemented by in vitro experiments, to investigate the anticancer potential of Vernolac. Phytochemicals in Vernolac were retrieved from databases, screened for drug-likeness and oral bioavailability using SwissADME, yielding 155 drug-like phytochemicals, and their protein targets were predicted via SwissTargetPrediction. The intersection of targets of phytochemicals and cancer-related targets from GeneCards yielded 137 common targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis in STRING and Cytoscape identified key hub nodes, including AKT1, BCL2, CASP3, CTNNB1, EGFR, ESR1, GAPDH, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, IL6, JUN, SRC, STAT3, and TNF. Clustering, topology, and formula-herb-compound-target-disease and target-pathway networks highlighted key phytochemicals, including vernolactone, thymoquinone, quercetin, nigellidine, -hederin, and carvacrol. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment revealed that the identified targets are significantly enriched in multiple cancer pathways. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations identified novel target-ligand interactions. Overall, network analysis suggests that Vernolac may exert anticancer effects through apoptosis induction, immune modulation, antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antiproliferative, and chemoradiosensitizing mechanisms. Moreover, Vernolac may exhibit chemoradioprotective potential by alleviating therapy-induced toxicity, supporting its promise as a potential adjunct to conventional cancer treatments. The Sulforhodamine B assay demonstrated selective antiproliferative activity of Vernolac against cancerous cells MCF-7 (IC50 = 54.01 {+/-} 0.02 g/mL), Caco-2 (IC50 = 85.52 {+/-} 0.13 g/mL), NTERA-2 cl.D1 (IC50 = 42.41 {+/-} 0.06 g/mL), and non-cancerous MCF-10A (IC50 = 803.5 {+/-} 0.03 g/mL). Novel target-ligand interactions identified via molecular docking and dynamics simulations, and the underlying mechanisms of Vernolac predicted in this study, require further validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Using ultra-high-resolution 7T fMRI with dense within-subject sampling (N=3), we quantified whole-brain activity, functional and effective connectivity, cortical gradients, and eigenmodes, and related them to chemoarchitecture and cognitive maps. EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal gradient, and decrease in low-order global eigenmodes. Cognitive decoding linked EC to heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering, and co-varied with histaminergic H receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework.

Magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) may cause dizziness and confound behavioral and physiological measures in fMRI by introducing an unavoidable mixture of neural activation in vestibular projection areas, driven both by the signal of interest and by vestibular system activation. This study investigated how different head orientations within a 3T MRI scanner influence the MVS-induced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in complete darkness, with the goal of identifying a head position that minimizes or eliminates MVS effects. Results revealed a linear relationship between head pitch and the horizontal VOR (Experiment 1), as well as between head roll and the vertical VOR (Experiment 2). Across participants, the horizontal VOR was eliminated at an average forward head pitch of 24.4 degree, while the vertical VOR was nullified at an average roll angle of 15.9 degree towards the right shoulder. A head position combining this forward pitch with this rightward roll effectively minimized both horizontal and vertical VOR components across subjects (Experiment 3).

Analyses of six genetically distinct PLCs revealed that mitochondrial energy metabolism is largely dictated by oncogene identity. Kras-driven tumors required creatine metabolism to buffer energy demands during early tumorigenesis, whereas c-MYC-driven tumors relied on oxidative phosphorylation. Among c-MYC-driven PLCs, Pten-deficient tumors accumulated mitochondrial phosphoethanolamine, a precursor for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. Inhibition of PE synthesis selectively impaired the growth of Pten-deficient tumors and extended survival, in part through enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and sensitization to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, loss of PE elevated surface TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), promoting TNF signaling and pro-inflammatory response.

We show that PTHLH, which resides on a ccRCC amplicon on chromosome 12p, is a direct HIF2 transcriptional target in ccRCC. Further, we show that the increased PTHLH expression is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of hypercalcemia and cachexia in preclinical orthotopic cell line tumor models.

Here, we make the first advance towards engineered histone-driven chromatin organization. By expressing libraries of sequence variants of core histones in human cells, we identify variants that dominantly modulate chromatin structure. We further interrogate variants using a combination of imaging, proteomics, and genomics to reveal both cis and trans-acting mechanisms of effect. Functional screening with transcription factor libraries identifies transcriptional programs that are facilitated by engineered histone expression. Double mutation screens combined with protein language models allow us to learn sequence-to-function patterns and design synthetic histone proteins optimized to drive specific chromatin states.

Here, we find that NOD2, when triggered by its ligand, muramyl dipeptide, is unique among pattern recognition receptors in its ability to induce endothelial cell expression of chemokines and immune adhesion molecules. Consequently, NOD2 signaling promoted T cell homing specifically to gut-associated lymphoid tissue during intestinal infection. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of Nod2 resulted in fewer effector and memory T cells in the small intestine, impacting the host's ability to clear secondary infection.

B.; Cho, B.; McClymont, S.; Robertson, E. J.; Collignon, E. A.; Ramalho-Santos, M.", "abstract": "Cells and organisms can enter transient dormant states to survive unfavorable conditions during development, physiological adult contexts, and disease. One paradigmatic case of dormancy is diapause, whereby embryos transiently pause development and enter a state of suspended animation. In mammals, diapause occurs pre-implantation at the blastocyst state and involves global growth suppression and metabolic rewiring towards lipid usage as energy source. The molecular regulation of diapause remains poorly understood, including whether it occurs by default or requires active signaling. Here, we identify the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-{beta}) signaling pathway as an essential driver of transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming in diapause. TGF-{beta} signaling was thought to only be required post-implantation, but we show that the ligand Nodal and its downstream effector Smad2 are essential for the survival of paused embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and blastocysts. Mechanistically, we found that Smad2 represses peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), a transcription factor that is a master regulator of lipid storage, a process incompatible with pausing. Ablation of Pparg in Smad2-deficient ESCs rescues their survival and prevents excess lipid buildup in paused conditions. Our findings establish Nodal/Smad2 signaling as pivotal for sustaining the transcriptional and metabolic programs of embryonic diapause. This crosstalk between TGF-{beta} signaling and the Pparg pathway may be redeployed in other contexts, such as in cancer dormancy and metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, we introduce universal reporter circuit-based activatable sensors (URCAS), a highly programmable platform for the systematic creation of genetic sensors for MRI. In developing URCAS, we engineered protease-activatable MRI reporters using two distinct approaches: protein stabilization and subcellular trafficking. We established the applicability of URCAS in five diverse mammalian cell types and showcased its versatility by assembling a toolkit of genetic sensors for viral proteins, small-molecule drugs, logic gates, protein-protein interactions, and calcium, without requiring new customization for each target.

Among these, the phosphorylation of Ser5 is critical for initiator/promoter clearance and the recruitment of capping enzymes. However, the exact conformational consequences of these modifications are still not fully understood. This study investigates how Ser5 phosphorylation affects the local and global conformation of the CTD, its influence on proline isomerization, and how variations in the repeat sequence modulate these effects. We employed Gaussian accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) simulations on 3-heptad models of both the consensus CTD sequence and an Asn7 variant. We found that Ser5 phosphorylation promotes expansion of the peptide due to the repulsion between the negatively-charged phosphate groups, but also increases the population of cis-Pro6, which leads to compaction. We used a clustering algorithm to identify commonly populated conformations, with a focus on those conformations that change in population with Ser5 phosphorylation. Our simulations reveal that the expansion of the CTD due to Ser5 phosphorylation is accompanied by a change in local, intra-heptad interactions in both variants. Notably, phosphorylation significantly increases the population of cis-Pro6 due to steric repulsion between the Asn7 side chain and the large side chain of the phosSer5, but has a smaller increase in the consensus variant. These results clarify the underlying mechanisms by which phosphorylation can modulate the CTD's structural landscape to regulate the transcription cycle.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to identify and classify the differentially expressed (DE) exosomal miRNAs from chemoresistant HuH7 cells undergoing p-EMT. Out of the fifty-four miRNAs that were enriched in the exosomes from these cells compared to controls, thirteen were identified in the exosomes isolated from the serum of HCC patients.

Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that 11/13 miRNAs were associated with either favorable (n=4) or worse (n=7) prognosis.

One of the characteristics of AD is the accumulation of {beta}-amyloid peptide due to the proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the protein Presenilin 1 (PS1). The study of interaction between ischemia and AD has been limited due to lack of experimental models. The current study describes a novel model utilizing a brief transient ischemia (15 min MCAO) in an AD mouse model to assess mechanistic interaction. Here we investigate the effects of increased {beta}-amyloid peptide on motor coordination, behavioral and cellular memory, when subjected to brief focal ischemia. APP/PS1 or Wt male mice are initially subjected to either a 15-minute MCAO or Sham surgery. Injury volume using MRI is assessed at 3-days using T2 imaging and demonstrates that injury magnitude was not different between Wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. We observed that 15 min MCAO did not cause significant motor deficits in either WT or APP/PS1 mice, as measured by open field and tapered balance beam. Short-term memory was assessed 7 days after recovery from brief MCAO using the contextual fear conditioning task. APP/PS1 mice exhibited intact memory at 3 months of age and Wt mice also having intact memory 7 days after 15 min MCAO. In contrast, APP/PS1 + 15 min MCAO mice exhibited a significant reduction in freezing behavior suggesting impairment in short term memory. Consistent with our contextual fear conditioning, we observed impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in APP/PS1 + 15 min MCAO compared to their sham counterparts. Remarkably, we observed an additive effect of ischemia and AD, with cellular and behavior memory deficits observed in APP/PS1 mice exposed to brief ischemia that does not cause symptoms in WT mice.

We provide evidence that the terminal intrinsically disordered regions (tIDRs) of the non-SMC subunits suppress condensin I activity, and that this self-suppression is relieved by Cdk1 phosphorylation. Importantly, full activation of condensin I requires the phosphorylation of a conserved residue located in the central region of the kleisin subunit CAP-H.

We collected brain tissue from both sexes during the early breeding, late breeding, and nonbreeding season. Using quantitative PCR, we quantified mRNA expression of four genes--androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ER and ER{beta}), and aromatase (AROM)--in three song nuclei--HVC, Area X, and RA--and compared sexes. We found females had lower expression than males of AR, AROM and ER in most song nuclei, especially of AR in HVC in the breeding season. Both sexes, however, had low ER expression in Area X and RA. In males, expression differed seasonally: breeding males had higher expression of AR in RA and AROM in HVC than nonbreeding males. In both sexes, expression differed among song nuclei: in most genes, HVC had the highest expression, followed by RA, then Area X. These findings suggest singing female house wrens do not compensate for low plasma testosterone by upregulating steroid receptors beyond male levels or during early breeding, when they sing most.

For constructs larger than 8 kb, one-pot PASTA outperforms conventional HDR by 19-fold on average and prime-editing-assisted site-specific integrase gene editing (PASSIGE) by 5-fold. This enables the delivery of multi-cistronic cargo to generate dual-antigen targeting CAR T-cells with a safety-switch that overcome antigen escape in lymphoma models. Finally, one-pot PASTA can be further optimized with improved integrase enzymes, such as engineered variants of Pa01 or Bxb1, and plasmids with minimized backbones. In summary, one-potnPASTA represents a versatile and scalable platform for precise, non-viral gene insertion in T-cells.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

However, how primary sensory information transforms along pathways to the hippocampus into this single, combined map is largely unknown. Specifically, does the hippocampus generate or inherit the multisensory map of space? Here, we used multisensory virtual reality and large-scale functional imaging to determine if and how the main input regions to hippocampus, the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices (LEC and MEC, respectively), map olfactory and visual sensory spaces in navigating mice. We discovered that, in contrast to multisensory mapping in the hippocampus, LEC preferentially maps olfactory space while MEC preferentially maps visual space, regardless of the behavioral relevance of the spaces. This establishes the existence of largely independent brain maps for different sensory spaces, suggesting that the hippocampus builds the cognitive map by combining modality-specific maps from pre-synaptic cortical regions.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Hochman, S.", "abstract": "Various pre-sympathetic descending brain circuits recruit spinal cord preganglionic neurons to encode central sympathetic drive via their synaptic actions onto sympathetic postganglionic neurons (SPNs) - the final sympathetic output neurons. Thoracic paravertebral ganglia SPNs (tSPNs) provide distributed control over body tissue systems via functional subpopulations. High thoracic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) compromise descending excitatory drive to SPNs, causing dysautonomias including hypotension. In adult mice, we tested whether the SCI-induced chronic reduction in tSPN activity leads to homeostatic increases in their excitability. tSPN excitability spanned a >10 fold range in both sham and SCI populations, governed by a strong linear (ohmic) relationship between cell resistance and threshold depolarizing current (rheobase), with a clear trend towards increased excitability after SCI. Dendritic length was reduced, as was measured cell capacitance in Neuropeptide Y expressing (NPY+) tSPNs (putative vasoconstrictors), which represent >40% of tSPNs. NPY+ tSPNs also had changes in active membrane properties including an increased repetitive firing output gain ({uparrow}f-I slope), which modelling attributed to reduced delayed rectifier currents (IK). After SCI, spontaneous quantal excitatory synaptic frequency increased overall (226%) and in the NPY+ tSPN subpopulation (300%); their temporal summation recruited spiking in 10.5% of sham and 22.2% of SCI recordings. Computational modeling showed that spontaneous synaptic activity was particularly effective at recruiting spiking after SCI. Overall, tSPNs, including in vasoconstrictors, appear to undergo CNS-independent compensatory increases in excitability after SCI. The alterations further contribute to observed central and peripheral changes that limit hypoactivity and hypotension but exaggerate reflex responses.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In natural scenes, it is common to encounter spatially separated stimuli, such as distinct figure-ground regions, adjacent objects, and partial occlusions. Neurons in mid- and high-level visual cortex have large receptive fields (RFs) that often encompass multiple, spatially separated stimuli. It is unclear how neurons represent and segregate these stimuli within their RFs. We investigated this question by recording the neuronal responses in the middle temporal (MT) cortex from two male macaque monkeys to multiple moving stimuli. We placed a motion border between two spatially separated random-dot patches that moved in two different directions within the RFs. We varied the vector average direction of the stimuli to characterize the full direction tuning curves. Across motion directions, responses to multiple stimuli were systematically biased toward the stimulus located at the more-preferred RF subregion of the neuron. The sign and magnitude of this spatial-location bias were correlated with the spatial preference of the neuron measured with single patches presented in isolation. We demonstrated that neuronal responses to multiple stimuli can be captured by an extended divisive normalization model, as a sum of the responses elicited by individual stimuli, weighted by the spatial preference of the neuron. We also proposed a circuit implementation for the extended normalization model. Our results indicate that MT leverages spatial selectivity within the RFs to represent spatially separated moving stimuli. The spatial-location bias in neuronal responses enables individual components of multiple stimuli to be represented by a population of neurons with heterogeneous spatial preferences, providing a neural substrate for segregating multiple visual stimuli.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

The completion of this process is associated with the closure of sensitive windows for experience-dependent plasticity. Weaning is a critical time in the development of taste circuits as animals transition from depending on the mother for nutrition to eating independently. While there is some evidence for developmental changes in taste bud innervation and in membrane properties of neurons in brainstem circuits for taste, very little is known about postnatal changes in the gustatory cortex (GC), the primary cortical region for taste and taste-guided behaviors. Here, we focused on pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of GC and compared their membrane properties in pre- and postweaning age groups. We report dynamic changes in intrinsic excitability and a progressive shift of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance toward inhibition as pyramidal neurons reach their young adult properties. The increase in inhibitory drive accompanied a protracted process of postnatal maturation of inhibitory circuits mediated by parvalbumin expressing neurons (PV neurons) that showed a progressive increase in their association with perineuronal nets (PNNs) and refinement of their connectivity onto pyramidal neurons.

This study systematically evaluated how electrode position, size, orientation, and waveform influence the efficacy of forelimb motor activation in rats, with the goal of identifying configurations that minimize stimulation thresholds of evoked responses across multiple muscles. Approach: Custom microfabricated arrays of electrodes were implanted over the C6 dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) in eight adult female Sprague Dawley rats. A circular array was used to vary current orientation in 45 degree increments, while a linear array was used to optimize mediolateral electrode position. The linear array included both small (0.25 mm) and large (0.5 mm) contacts to assess size effects at mediolateral positions. Stimulation consisted of biphasic and pseudomonophasic waveforms with bipolar or distant return, and a high-definition montage to probe spatial focality around the DREZ. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded via implanted EMG electrodes were analyzed in six forelimb muscles. Thresholds, estimated from recruitment curves using a hierarchical Bayesian model, were compared within-rat using pairwise t-tests with correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Stimulation over the DREZ yielded the lowest thresholds and efficacy decreased progressively with medial or lateral displacement relative to DREZ. In the circular array, rostro-caudal current orientation was most effective, reducing thresholds by up to 58% relative to latero-medial orientation (p = 0.0007). In the linear array, large contacts were significantly more effective than small contacts at the lateral position, reducing thresholds by 45% (p = 0.034). Cathodal stimulation was more effective than anodal, and high-definition montages reduced efficacy compared to distant returns. Across all tested parameters, position and orientation had the greatest influence on efficacy, with optimal conditions combining DREZ targeting and rostro-caudal oriented current flow. Significance: Maximum efficacy was achieved for cervical SCS with electrodes positioned over the DREZ, rostro-caudal current flow, larger contacts, and cathodal stimulation. These design principles that more effectively engage spinal circuitry could reduce the current required and thereby improve SCS systems for upper-limb motor restoration.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

This boundary repulsion occurs in any encoding-decoding system that efficiently encodes, or Bayesian-decodes, bounded quantities, independent of specific priors or encoding functions. Our theory predicts: new, experimentally-induced boundaries should cause additional distortions; increasing cognitive noise should amplify distortions; and boundaries should reduce behavioral variability near them. We confirmed all predictions in three pre-registered experiments spanning risky choice and probability perception. Our findings further suggest that these changes originate largely during decoding.

This arrangement contrasts with the ancestral bilaterian cephalic pattern, where rhabdomeric photoreceptors dominate lateral eyes and ciliary photoreceptors are limited to unpigmented, non-visual median positions. We propose that the vertebrate retina evolved through the lateralization of a complex median photoreceptive organ already containing both photoreceptor types. This shift likely followed the loss of lateral rhabdomeric eyes in a burrowing, suspension -feeding deuterostome ancestor and the retention of a median eye. In the early chordates leading to vertebrates, this structure diversified into the pineal/parapineal complex and lateral retinas. Central to this transformation was the emergence of a bipolar cellular identity, linking ciliary and rhabdomeric circuits - an unusual feature in animal nervous systems. We suggest bipolar cells have dual evolutionary origins: Off bipolar cells from a ciliary 'effector' lineage and rod -On bipolar cells from a chimeric sensory cell. This model explains key similarities between retina and pineal and supports a scenario in which vertebrate vision emerged by integrating and repurposing preexisting circuits. It reframes the retina not as a de novo innovation, but as a modified and lateralized, solution to sensory challenges faced by early chordates.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Although Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists (DORAs) are clinically used as hypnotics, most preclinical studies with these drugs have been conducted in males, with limited research in females, leaving the postpartum period largely unexplored. Here, we examined the impact of the DORA Suvorexant on sleep and maternal behavior in lactating rats. Lactating and virgin female rats were implanted with electrodes for polysomnographic recording. Using a counterbalanced design, Suvorexant was orally administered at doses of 0, 10 (SUV10), and 30 mg/kg (SUV30) to virgin rats in diestrus and to lactating rats between postpartum days 4 and 8. Sleep recordings and maternal behaviors were assessed during the light phase for six hours following the administration of the drug. Suvorexant reduced wakefulness and increased slow wave sleep, intermediate state, and REM sleep in both groups, with a stronger effect in virgin females. In lactating rats, Suvorexant increased nursing time and milk ejections, while reducing active maternal behavior such as pup-licking. These findings demonstrate that dual hypocretin receptor antagonism produces hypnotic effects and selectively modulates maternal behavior, promoting nursing while reducing active maternal behavior.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

I.; Ciancone Chama, A.; Chehrazi, P.; Chattopadhyaya, B.; Di Cristo, G.", "abstract": "In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive stimuli, a phenomenon termed stimulus-specific adaptation. However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are enhanced. Mismatch negativity (MMN), the electroencephalography waveform reflecting rule violations, is a well-established biomarker for auditory deviant detection. MMN has been shown to depend on intact NMDA receptor signaling across species; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely elucidated at the neural and mesoscale levels. Using multi-electrode array recordings in awake mice, we identified a specific biphasic spiking response in a subpopulation of A1 neurons elicited by deviant, but not standard, sounds, whereby the second peak is abolished by acute subanesthetic injection of ketamine, a partial non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. We further showed that the posterior parietal cortex, a critical hub for multisensory integration and sensorimotor coordination, responds to unexpected and deviant, but not repetitive, sounds, and this response is dependent upon intact NMDA receptor-mediated signaling. Finally, to explore the effects of ketamine on inter-cortical communication during deviance detection, we performed Granger Causality and Weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) analyses during the presentation of deviant and standard sounds. This analysis showed a unidirectional functional connectivity from A1 to PPC during deviant detection, which is impaired by subanesthetic ketamine administration. By investigating how ketamine modulates neural and inter-regional communication, our findings provide novel insights into the NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms underlying the processing of novelty and regularity in auditory stimuli.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we asked human participants to perform a series of temporal bisection tasks, in either unimodal visual or auditory conditions, or in bimodal audiovisual conditions where vision and audition could be congruent or not. The validity of their temporal bisection was assessed by asking participants to choose which of two consecutive decisions they felt more confident of being correct, focussing only on the visual modality. We found that once multisensory information is integrated, participants could no longer access the unisensory information to evaluate the validity of their decisions. Comparing three generative models of confidence, we show that confidence judgments are fooled by the fused bimodal percept.

Larvae were exposed to fluorescently labeled polystyrene particles (3 m and 0.2 m) either directly from the water or indirectly via contaminated zooplankton prey. MPs and NPs were detected in digestive tracts of all exposed individuals, regardless of the exposure route. However, survival was significantly reduced in larvae that consumed NPs via rotifer predation, suggesting that ingestion of contaminated prey organisms may represent a greater hazard than direct uptake from water. In both groups, antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were elevated, suggesting induction of oxidative stress. Relative gene expression revealed greater upregulation of several stress and immune-related genes in larvae exposed to MPs via rotifer predation than via direct consumption.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to better characterize the dynamics and heterogeneity of involved cell types during different stages of zebrafish cutaneous wound healing, focusing on macrophages and fibroblasts. Macrophage subclusters display pro- and/or anti-inflammatory/repair characteristics, and fibroblast subclusters characteristics of extracellular matrix formation and degradation, which largely co-exist during all stages of wound healing. Strikingly, some fibroblasts display signatures of myofibroblasts, implicated in fibrotic healing in mammals. In addition, zebrafish fibroblasts express multiple genes with described pro-fibrotic effects in mammalian models. One of them is plod2, which encodes lysylhydroxylase 2. In cutaneous mouse wounds, Plod2 is induced in fibroblasts by macrophage-released Resistin-like molecule RELM encoded by the Retlna gene, promoting the formation of DHLNL collagen crosslinks and thereby less resolvable fibrotic tissue. retln genes are absent from the zebrafish genome; nevertheless, plod2 expression is initiated in zebrafish dermal fibroblasts upon wounding, in this case via TGF{beta} signaling, accompanied by increased collagen DHLNL crosslinking.

More recently, however, evidence has shown that many tissues instead establish patterns by translating the sequential activation of genes (organized into genetic cascades) into spatial domains. This translation is thought to occur through modulation of the speed or timing of cascade progression, but the mechanisms underlying such temporal control remain unclear. Two models have been proposed: the general kinetic modulation model, in which morphogens influence global kinetic factors such as transcription and decay rates, and the gene regulatory network (GRN) switching model, in which morphogens reconfigure regulatory interactions so that genes initially function within a genetic cascade driving sequential activation, but are later integrated into a stabilizing network that locks their expression into mutually reinforcing domains. This transition is hypothesized to occur through a shift from a dynamic GRN (a genetic cascade that drives sequential activations) to a static GRN (a stabilizing network that maintains gene expression domains). Using gap genes in Tribolium castaneum as a model, we combined HCR in situ hybridization, parental RNA interference, and computational modeling to test these hypotheses. We show that gap genes initially act in a genetic cascade producing sequential activations, followed by a morphogen-dependent reconfiguration that stabilizes spatial domains. In particular, we identify the Mlpt-Svb complex as a key stabilizing factor that maintains svb expression anteriorly after its initial activation in the posterior. Computational simulations reproduce experimental phenotypes and support GRN switching as the underlying mechanism.

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of lumen growth and the cellular mechanism driving this process, using advanced microscopy, molecular perturbations and computational modelling. We found that in secondary follicles, the interstitial gaps exist in a near-critical regime, characterised by a highly dynamic and interconnected fluid network with gap size obeying a power-law distribution. Above a critical size of 180 m, we observed an onset of cell death and the emergence of a stably growing dominant fluid cavity resembling phase separation. By modelling the granulosa cells and the interstitial fluid as a binary fluid, we reproduced the near-critical and phase-separated regimes and found that a spatial gradient of cell-fluid interfacial tension, as observed experimentally, is sufficient to robustly maintain the secondary follicles in a near-critical state. Reducing cell-fluid interfacial tension globally by weakening the cell-cell adhesion between granulosa cells leads to fragmentation of fluid and growth arrest of the dominant cavity, as predicted by the model. Importantly, perturbing the critical state in secondary follicles leads to impaired follicle growth. Altogether, our study reveals how collective spatiotemporal regulation of cell junction mechanics and cell death can contribute to the effective transition between distinct regimes of fluids, which are indispensable for functional maturation of follicles.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

By reducing ecdysone synthesis, the larval stage is prolonged. This extended developmental period provides larvae exposed to an HSD more time to reach an optimal size. Our findings highlight how different organs communicate to counteract the negative impact of an HSD during development and expand our understanding of Dpp function, showing that it acts not only as a local developmental signal but also as a systemic regulator.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "The presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is a transient embryonic tissue patterned along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of vertebrates that periodically generates somites at its anterior end. This process, termed somitogenesis, is driven by waves of gene expression that travel from the posterior to the anterior end of the PSM under the contol of the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator. Using a primary culture system, we performed a small-scale chemical screen targeting cellular mechanical properties and we identified Rac1, a small GTPase, as a key regulator. Inhibition of Rac1 markedly altered the periodicity of gene expression waves and disrupted somite spatial organization. Further analyses showed that Rac1 inhibition modified gene expression patterns, notably affecting markers of the Wnt and Notch pathways which are central regulators of segmentation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for Rac1-mediated signaling in coordinating the mechanical and molecular aspects of segmentation dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Using Drosophila leg muscles as a model, we uncover how naive mesodermal precursors progressively acquire lineage-restricted identities through a stepwise specification program guided by epithelial morphogens. Initially, multipotent mesodermal precursors become spatially and transcriptionally restricted into two broad lineages - proximal and distal - under the combined influence of Wg/Wnt1 and Dpp/BMP signals from the overlying epithelium. By tracing mesodermal precursors that eventually give rise to distal leg muscles, we reveal a second sequence of fate bifurcations that generate distinct muscle subtypes prior to myoblast fusion, as well as a separate lineage producing neuronal lamella cells. Focusing on a single muscle lineage, we show that Wg and Dpp act again during a second phase to control the spatial and temporal deployment of specific transcription factors, ultimately specifying a unique muscle identity. These findings demonstrate that epithelial morphogens not only pattern the epithelium but also orchestrate muscle diversity by promoting stepwise mesodermal specification. Mesodermal precursors translate morphogen signals over time and space to activate distinct transcriptional programs that operate in parallel with the general program of myogenesis, enabling the emergence of distinct muscle and non-muscle lineages whose unique identities underpin their specialized functions.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Notably, co-use of cannabis and nicotine is very common, and we previously demonstrated that nicotine enhances the self-administration of a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist and the primary psychoactive phytocannabinoid in cannabis, {Delta}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Methods Here we aimed to further investigate the patterns of nicotine and THC self-administration when available in a concurrent choice model, and to determine the effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) antagonists on nicotine-enhanced THC self-administration in male and female rats. Results During concurrent choice, nicotine availability increased THC self-administration in females without affecting THC metabolism, while THC availability decreased nicotine self-administration and preference in females relative to when nicotine and saline were concurrently available. In females, THC self-administration was reduced by the {beta}2/4 subunit-containing nAchR antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DH{beta}E) in both nicotine and saline concurrent availability groups; while nicotine self-administration was reduced in both sexes by the 7nAchR antagonist methylylcaconitine (MLA), but only in rats that had concurrent access to THC. The nonspecific nAchR antagonist mecamylamine had minimal effects in the concurrent choice model, but it prevented nicotine-induced enhancement of THC self-administration when nicotine was given prior to a single choice THC only self-administration session. Conclusions Thus, behavioral regulation of self-administration is differentially influenced by nAchR subtypes depending on the availability of other substances, which has implications for the efficacy of treatments in the context of polysubstance use.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

This trend is driven by the rising prevalence of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease within the aging population. Aluminum chloride is a well-established neurotoxicant which induces neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations that mimic key features of neurodegenerative disorders thus serving as a reliable experimental model for evaluating neuroprotective agents. This study assessed the neuroprotective efficacy of quercetin in a rat model of aluminum chloride induced neurotoxicity. Fifty adult male rats (n = 10 per group) were randomly assigned into five groups. Neurotoxicity was induced by oral administration of aluminum chloride (100 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Subsequently from days 14 to 35, rats received daily treatments of quercetin (100 or 200 mg/kg), donepezil (3 mg/kg), or vehicle control. aluminum chloride exposure significantly impaired body weight gain, feed intake, locomotor activity, grooming behaviour, and spatial memory performance. Quercetin treatment markedly ameliorated these deficits, as evidenced by improved performance in Y-maze and radial-arm maze tasks. Biochemical analysis revealed that quercetin significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced total antioxidant capacity, and modulated inflammatory responses by decreasing pro-inflammatory and elevating anti-inflammatory cytokines levels. Furthermore, quercetin restored acetylcholine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations and preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, as demonstrated by histopathological assessment. These findings highlight quercetin s therapeutic potential in mitigating aluminum chloride-induced neurotoxicity and suggest its utility in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Previous research has shown that OR also represents a cognitive phenotype that includes impaired attentional function and response inhibition, increased novelty seeking and, in females, resistance to extinction of conditioned place preference (CPP) for the stimulant drug amphetamine (AMP). The following experiments aim to increase our understanding of the OR cognitive phenotype in drug reward processing in male rats. In the first experiment, preference for AMP in males with or without an OR phenotype is assessed using CPP. In the second experiment, our understanding of OR as a predictor of AMP reward response is expanded by measuring potential behavioral mechanisms including affective and motor response to multiple AMP administrations. The results of the two experiments suggest that while the OR phenotype is not a predictor of resistance to extinction of AMP preference in males, OR as a discrete response variable predicts AMP preference after repeated exposures (i.e., AMP challenge). Moreover, we observed that rats with an OR phenotype had a higher positive affective response, measured via ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in the 50 kHz range, after multiple AMP administrations. OR scores predicted USVs but did not alter the gross motor response to AMP. Taken together, these results suggest that orienting behavior is a predictor of AMP preference in males, particularly after multiple exposures, and that one behavioral mechanism that could explain this is that male Orienters have a strong positive affective response to AMP.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In birds, communication networks are well studied in territorial species with long-range songs connecting individuals across space, where unintended listeners extract information from others signalling interactions. Yet acoustic signals also play important social roles at short range, forming communication networks that connect individuals within larger social units. Wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia castanotis) provide a unique model system to examine such communication networks in a non-territorial species with multiple males singing at shared locations in close temporal proximity. Zebra finches breed in loose colonies in the Australian arid zone, typically stay near their partner, move around in pairs or small groups, and gather at social hotspots, thus forming dynamic, potentially multi-level, societies. Here, we used the individually distinctive male song, recorded over 1,835 song bouts at two breeding sub-colonies and three social hotspots to quantify singing activity. We identified 163 males based on spectrographic similarities, verified by a deep learning model (BirdNET), and constructed communication networks based on temporal singing proximity at shared locations, social hotspots and the breeding colony. We reveal higher singing activity at social hotspots, with no dawn song and singing peaking at different times of day between breeding sites and social hotspots. Communication networks, with distinct males singing in close temporal proximity, were apparent in both contexts, with larger networks at hotspots. These networks were not strongly nested, yet many individuals met repeatedly at either the hotspot or breeding sites and some even maintained associations across breeding colonies and hotspots, providing building blocks for a multi-level society. These networks may facilitate synchronized foraging and breeding as adaptations to a harsh and unpredictable environment. Additionally, our approach offers a novel road map for widening the understanding of communication networks.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Unlike workers that optimise foraging to support the colony, males forage independently to collect nectar and deposit sex pheromones on selected plants. Using high-resolution 3D tracking in an indoor flight cage, we investigated how the spatial arrangement of nectar and scent-marking sites, along with nectar availability, influence male movement patterns. We manipulated the distribution of feeders (artificial flowers) and scent-marking locations (branches), and varied nectar delivery rates, to assess effects on foraging, scent-marking, and patrolling. Males responded strongly to spatial structure: in clumped arrays with evenly spaced resources, movements between consecutive visits were shorter and more localised, while in dispersed arrays with irregular spacing, transitions were longer and more variable. The combination of dispersed spacing and low nectar availability imposed the highest foraging demands, resulting in fewer feeding events and reduced total feeding time. Despite these increased costs, males maintained consistent investment in reproductive behaviours, suggesting a prioritisation of mate-seeking over energy gain. Rather than reducing signalling, males adjusted their foraging strategy, favouring fewer but prolonged feeding bouts when nectar availability allowed. These findings reveal a unidirectional behavioural adjustment, in which foraging is modulated to sustain reproductive effort, and show how spatial resource structure and nectar availability together shape movement decisions in male pollinators.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher reproductive division of labour exists, where a dominant breeding pair reproduces while subordinates help in rearing the offspring and perform various tasks to gain acceptance within the group. Larger helpers engage in territory maintenance and predator defence while smaller helpers focus on egg care and deterrence of egg predators. Here we investigated task specialisation, division of labour and the dynamics of coordination of tasks in N. pulcher groups of natural size and composition. In lab experiments, we assessed whether helpers consistently specialized in sand removal from territories or in egg predator defence when both tasks were presented simultaneously. While different size classes performed both tasks, task performance was not repeatable, and there was no clear division of labour. Dominant females did most work, with the helpers often remaining idle. Lag sequence analysis revealed that individuals were significantly more likely to take up a task if it had just been performed by another individual, rather than dividing labour between individuals - a phenomenon we term task contagion. This suggests that individuals respond to immediate group needs, offering new insights into how cooperative breeders can adapt to changing task demands by flexible behaviour and potentially enhance group efficiency.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we introduce the Towers Foraging Park, an experimental paradigm that captures the exploration-exploitation tradeoff faced by animals when foraging in patchy environments. In this new task, freely moving mice harvest rewards along the walls of square towers (patch) by making quarter-turns around them (exploit) and alternating between towers (explore) according to experimenter-controlled contingencies (patches deplete and must be harvested in one direction). Within just a few foraging sessions, naive mice learned to perform quarter-turns selectively in the rewarded direction. They underharvested patches, consistent with risk aversion, and executed reward-directed turns with increasing vigor and decreasing trajectory variability, consistent with utility-based modulation of movements. When the harvest direction was reversed, mice shifted their directional preference; notably, trajectory variability of these newly rewarded quarter-turns decreased immediately, whereas their vigor increased gradually across sessions. Mice challenged with daily reversals of the harvest direction became quicker at shifting their directional preference, revealing meta-learning. When later tested in a highly uncertain foraging protocol, they outperformed animals trained under more stable contingencies. Altogether, this simple and low-cost task uncovered sophisticated learning dynamics, adaptive exploration-exploitation tradeoff and showed how changes in reward outcomes differentially shape movement speed and variability. The Towers Foraging Park adheres to FAIR principles, supports protocol variations, and is fully compatible with neurophysiological approaches, paving the way for deeper insights into the biological processes underlying adaptive behavior.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

However, its expression is usually interpreted as indicative of antigen presentation. In parallel, CD74 expression has also been described in cancer cells across multiple tumor types, but interestingly in glioma its expression has been mainly identified in the microenvironment. However, the functional contribution of CD74 to disease progression in the brain, and specifically in secondary brain tumors, has not been directly addressed. Here we described that, in contrast to what it has been assumed, the presence of CD74+ microglia/macrophages, which is induced by increased levels of interferon gamma in the brain affected by metastases, does not relate to its canonical pathway. Instead, CD74's alternative function as cytokine receptor is pivotal. Rewired by increasing levels of its ligand MIF, produced by proliferating cancer cells, the CD74 receptor, upon binding to this ligand, translocates to the nucleus activating a NF-{kappa}B-dependent program promoting metastasis progression. A brain metastasis-associated CD74 signature involves a more aggressive progression of the local disease in patients, while it has no clinical correlation with the matched primary tumor. Furthermore, we identified the CD74+ myeloid population in additional brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, which shared a pan-disease non-canonical signature with clinical relevance. The brain-penetrant drug ibudilast, which prevents the binding of MIF to CD74, decreases brain metastases in experimental models in vivo and in patient-derived organotypic cultures ex vivo in a primary tumor-agnostic manner.

Using a silicon-based multimodal optrode, we simultaneously delivered NIR light and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across cortical layers in the primary somatosensory (S1Tr) and parietal association (PtA) cortices. NIR stimulation induced local tissue heating, resulting in reproducible and reversible changes in the properties of slow waves. Specifically, up-state durations were shortened, down-states prolonged, and MUA amplitudes during up-states increased, with steeper slopes at state transitions, indicative of enhanced neuronal synchronization. LFP amplitude and spectral changes varied across cortical regions: PtA exhibited increased slow wave (0.5 - 2 Hz) and high delta (2 - 4 Hz) band activity, while S1Tr showed a trend toward reduction. Our findings demonstrate that local infrared stimulation can reliably modulate cortical slow-wave dynamics, likely through temperature-mediated changes in neuronal excitability.

By profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility, we identified extensive cell type- and species-specific aging-dependent changes, with a much smaller number of broadly expressed and conserved genes that include regulators of inflammation and autophagy. We constructed predictive aging clocks for retinal cell types and observed dynamic, reversible shifts in cellular age following acute injury. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed region-specific aging signatures and proximity effects, with Muller glia exhibiting pro-rejuvenating influences on neighboring neurons. Targeted Muller glia-specific induction of Yamanaka factors reduced molecular age in rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells without altering glial age.

Forty participants completed both an active visual oddball task and a sentence processing task including both syntactic and semantic violations, while receiving continuous taVNS at the cymba conchae in one session and sham stimulation at the earlobe in another session. We observed robust P3 and P600 effects. Crucially though, taVNS had no effect on P3 or P600 amplitude. The physiological NE markers salivary alpha amylase level and baseline pupil size were also unaffected by the stimulation, suggesting that the taVNS protocol and/or task may not have been sufficient to successfully engage the norepinephrine system. Beyond the stimulation, however, exploratory analyses revealed correlations between the syntactic P600 and both the P3 and salivary alpha amylase levels, supporting the idea that the P600 might be related to both the P3 and NE.

In our framework, we tested three specialized models encoded as callable tools: (1) CNN-AD, a 3D DenseNet trained on T1w intensities only; (2) MOE-VLM, a vision-language model that jointly models the T1w with subject-specific demographics (age, sex, site) via a mixture-of-experts (MoE) projection head; (3) Retrieval engine, a similarity-search module that contextualizes a patient against others from the site and reports % prevalence of AD. A light-weight agent analyzes the user request and then routes the input (image, or image + text) to the appropriate tool, aggregates responses and returns the tool response augmented with its confidence derived from conformal prediction. Experiments were conducted using T1w images from the ADNI (N=4,098) and OASIS-3 (N=600) datasets. Single-site training baselines achieved ROC-AUC = 0.79 (CNN) and 0.82 (VLM) on ADNI. When trained jointly on both sites, MOE-VLM surpassed both image-only and standard vision-language models with ROC-AUC = 0.90 on ADNI and 0.81 on OASIS.

Analysis of 30,040 high-quality transcriptomes revealed 51 distinct immune subsets, including CD14CD33 monocytes, XCR1CD1D dendritic cells, CEACAM1CD24 neutrophils, and IL32BATF regulatory T cells, which were underrepresented in canFam3.1-based studies.

However, feeding on stranded adult sea turtles, particularly loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), have not previously been documented in the Mediterranean Sea. During a survey assessing ghost crab populations at Zikim Dunes Nature Reserve (southeastern Mediterranean, Israel) in August 2021, we observed five recently stranded C. caretta carcasses encircled by freshly dug O. cursor burrows, located inland from the high tide line. Burrows surrounding the carcasses were predominantly large-sized, suggesting relocation of adult crabs toward carrion situated landward of their typical supratidal zone. Our findings highlight the opportunistic scavenging behavior of O. cursor and underscore their ecological flexibility in exploiting substantial food resources beyond their usual distribution band.

Employing stringent variance filtering, unsupervised clustering, and differential expression analyses, we identified transcriptional patterns associated with key developmental transitions, notably the involvement of T. gondii Apetala2 (TgAP2) transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins. We highlight significant shifts in metabolic pathways essential for oocyst environmental resilience and infectivity, including lipid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and specialized secondary metabolism. Furthermore, we investigated expression profiles of genes associated with structural development of oocyst and sporocyst walls, environmental persistence, and host transmission. Importantly, combining these datasets with prior life cycle datasets covering intermediate and final host stages, we close an important knowledge gap by providing a genome-wide mRNA expression profile spanning the entire T. gondii life cycle.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that Chodl is highly enriched in quiescent SCs but downregulated in proliferating myoblasts. Using conditional knockout models, we show that deletion of Chodl in embryonic myoblasts (ChodlMKO) or adult SCs (ChodlPKO) does not affect muscle development but markedly impairs regeneration in both young and aged mice. Chodl-deficient SCs exhibit reduced self-renewal, diminish proliferation, and impair differentiation, leading to defective myofiber repair. In silico network perturbation further predicts disruption of ECM-ligand interactions and Notch signaling, consistent with our observation that a significant fraction of SCs in ChodlPKO mice localize outside the basal lamina and undergo precocious activation.

In these isolated populations, lineage sorting and genetic drift dominate, accelerating allele fixation and reducing shared genetic variation. Here, we investigated how sea-level transgression during the Early Holocene triggered rapid speciation in large vertebrates by studying macaques isolated on Dangan Island (DGD), located just 30 km from present-day Hong Kong. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that ~10,000 years of isolation drove the macaques' evolution into a distinct species, as indicated by pronounced genomic divergence (mean Fst > 0.462 vs. mainland), 1.94 million lineage-specific variants, and complete ancestral differentiation with no evidence of post-isolation gene flow. A severe demographic collapse (effective population size, Ne ~ 40) led to substantial genomic erosion (65.8% loss of genetic diversity). Paradoxically, this also enhanced resilience through drift-mediated genetic triage. Increased homozygosity exposed and purged lethal recessive alleles in lipid metabolism pathways (68% reduction in genetic load), while simultaneously fixing mildly deleterious variants, such as a splice-site mutation in SKAP2, thereby generating a form of genomic \"burden\" alongside rapid immune adaptation via 251 fixed missense mutations. These findings demonstrate that island isolation can drive vertebrate speciation within a few thousand years, with genetic drift playing a dominant role in shaping genomic architecture. Accordingly, conservation strategies should prioritize monitoring loss-of-function (LoF) variants in essential pathways and prescreening for deleterious allele combinations between donors and recipients prior to implementing genetic rescue in small, drift-sensitive populations.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

We employed multilevel meta-analytical models to pool our data. Our findings demonstrate a net beneficial effect of structural enrichment on macaque behavior, notably in significantly reducing negative behaviors such as stereotypies, self-directed harm, and aggression. This positive effect was evident even when enrichment was added to already enriched conditions. We found that enrichment that incorporates varied physical and feeding strategies were most effective, underscoring that complex, varied environmental elements are crucial for welfare improvement. Simple increases in unfurnished space, by contrast, showed minimal benefit. The promotion of positive, species-typical behaviors was less consistent across studies, but nonetheless highlights structural enrichment's potential to foster a broader natural behavioral repertoire. We also observed considerable variability in outcomes, suggesting that enrichment efficacy is influenced by multiple factors, and requires careful contextual assessment, as a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is rarely optimal.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To address these fundamental questions, we performed a zebrafish genetic screen informed by human genome-wide association studies. We found that mutation of serine/threonine kinase 32a (stk32a) results in increased sleep and impaired sleep homeostasis in both zebrafish and mice, and that stk32a acts downstream of neurotensin signaling and the serotonergic raphe in zebrafish. stk32a mutation reduces phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins, which are co-expressed with stk32a in neurons that regulate motor activity and in lateral line hair cells that detect environmental stimuli, and ablating these cells phenocopies stk32a mutation. Neurotensin signaling inhibits specific sensory and motor populations, and blocks stimulus-evoked responses of neurons that relay sensory information from hair cells to the brain. Our work thus shows that stk32a is an evolutionarily conserved sleep regulator that links neuropeptidergic and neuromodulatory systems to homeostatic sleep drive and changes in arousal threshold, which are implemented through suppression of specific sensory and motor systems.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

To gain mechanistic insight into the involvement of forebrain-expressed EPO, we deleted EPO in mice using as specific cre-driver Emx1.

The augmented expression of both EPOR and EphB4 and their regulatory intercorrelation may explain why EmxEPO mutants show an even superior performance in the most challenging working memory task. Using the previously published single-nuclei-RNA-seq dataset, we further confirm the suggested compensatory mechanism, wherein EPO loss or reduction drives elevated EPOR expression, adding another layer to the intricate regulation of EPO signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

Extracellular electrophysiology recorded single-unit activities when a rotating sinusoidal grating ball of a fixed spatial period (wavelength of 1, 2, or 4 mm) was presented on the fingerpad at various speeds (20-320 mm/s). The results showed that the rate code was commonly employed to differentiate the stimulus scanning speed, spatial period, and scanning direction across S1 regions. In contrast, the temporal code was used to faithfully represent the stimulus temporal frequency, which was defined as the speed divided by the spatial period. Notably, area 3b had a wider range of frequency responses than did areas 1 and 2. These findings demonstrate that S1 uses both rate and temporal codes to encode distinct aspects of tactile motion.

We developed a Hodgkin-Huxley-type computational model incorporating NMDA, AMPA, and GABA receptor kinetics to investigate how NMDA receptor closing rates (beta_NMDA) and glutamatergic stimulation frequency control neuronal dynamics. Systematic analysis of 2,942,093 inter-spike intervals across 1,961 parameter combinations revealed two mechanistically distinct pathways to firing irregularity. Pathway 1 involves rapid NMDA deactivation (beta_NMDA > 0.06 ms-1) at elevated stimulation frequencies, producing deterministic chaos with compromised information encoding (entropy: 1.441 bits, mutual information: 0.185 bits). Pathway 2 results from slow NMDA deactivation (beta_NMDA < 0.02 ms-1) under weak drive, creating irregularity through prolonged receptor activation and sustained calcium influx (entropy: 1.347 bits). An optimal kinetic window emerged at beta_NMDA = 0.028 ms-1, maximizing information transfer (0.275 bits) while maintaining stable dynamics. Entropy-Lyapunov correlation analysis confirmed deterministic chaos (r = 0.150, p < 0.001). Frequency-dependent chaos onset thresholds demonstrated systematic erosion from 0.000 ms-1 at low frequencies to 0.150 ms-1 at high frequencies. GABAergic inhibition provided frequency-selective stabilization, expanding stable parameter space by 34.2% while preserving gamma oscillations. CaMKII phosphorylation analysis revealed that prolonged NMDA activation maintains elevated phosphorylation levels (8.7 +/- 0.3 x 10-21 M vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1 x 10-23 M for normal kinetics), creating conditions for pathological long-term potentiation. These findings establish NMDA receptor kinetics as fundamental controllers of cortical excitability and information processing. The dual-pathway framework provides mechanistic insights into addiction-related memory formation, where prolonged NMDA activation enables pathological plasticity, and visual processing disorders, where altered kinetics disrupt retinal function and cortical oscillatory balance.

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, various studies have demonstrated that broadly inhibiting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) similarly disrupts sleep/wake cycles, suggesting that baseline ORN signaling is an integral component of olfactory modulation of sleep. However, due to the diversity of ORNs and combinatorial nature of olfactory processing, many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ORNs modulate sleep remain unclear. In this study, we addressed this gap of knowledge by characterizing the contributions of different ensembles of ORNs, individual ORN types, and a known modulator of ORNs on baseline sleep architecture. We find that the activity of distinct ORN types are important for day and nighttime sleep and heterogeneously shape parameters of sleep architecture. Importantly, the effects of ORN signaling on sleep are adjusted across mating status, suggesting that distinct ORN types are recruited within the context of sleep depending on the demands of the animal. Furthermore, the effects of ORN signaling on sleep are in part shaped by heterogeneous serotonin (5-HT) receptor expression. Together, this work identifies cellular and molecular pathways bridging olfaction and sleep, and helps establish a circuit model that can be used to further characterize the behavioral consequences of sensory dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Flowering plants are characterized by a double fertilization event, and the fertilized female gametes develop into the endosperm and embryo. Genomic imprinting promotes parental allele-specific gene expression in the endosperm by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. Similarly, gametophyte maternal effects influence gene function in the female gametophyte that affects development of the endosperm and embryo post-fertilization. While most imprinted genes do not display a seed phenotype upon mutation, gametophyte maternal effect mutants are characterized by distorted seed development upon maternal transmission of the mutant allele. Here, we have investigated the gametophyte maternal effect mutant capulet2 (cap2). We have established CAP2 to be encoded by ANAPHASE PROMOTING COMPLEX 6 (APC6), a subunit of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Investigation of further cap2/apc6 alleles revealed female gametophyte maternal effects both in mutant segregation and seed phenotype, and both cap2 and apc6 phenotypes were rescued by an APC6 transgene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APC6 is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, in line with the observed female gametophyte maternal effect phenotype. To this end, we observed irregular nuclear division of the endosperm coenocyte in cap2/apc6 mutants, suggesting a role for the APC/C in early endosperm development. We further demonstrate that similar endosperm defects are also produced by mutation of APC1, another subunit of the APC/C. Similar to cap2/apc6, APC1 is imprinted and only expressed from the maternal allele, suggesting a maternal bias in the control of APC/C in the developing endosperm.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here we report 14 genes essential for efficient iPSC generation, but dispensable for self-renewal. Of those, overexpression of Hic2, a transcriptional suppressor highly expressed in PSCs, enhances iPSC generation ~10-fold. This is achieved through a more direct transition towards pluripotency, bypassing an intermediate state with KLF4-dependent transient epidermal gene expression during iPSC generation. Mechanistically, HIC2 co-occupies these KLF4 targets and directly inhibits their expression. Our work demonstrates that master TFs necessary for cellular conversions can also activate obstructive genes during cellular reprogramming.

Here we show that a recently proposed class of small associative neural network, plastic attractors, can perform such flexible cognitive functions through the rapid formation of task-based attractors. We simulated a rule-based selective attention paradigm, in which agents respond to one task-relevant feature of a visual stimulus, while ignoring another, irrelevant feature, and respond to the attended feature according to a predefined stimulus-response mapping rule. The model consists of a broadly tuned prefrontal population with rapidly changing recurrent connections to sensory neurons that compete via lateral inhibition. In this framework, the rules governing the focus of selective attention are not coded explicitly, but arise as an emergent property of temporary associations between stimulus features and motor responses. The model exhibited activation properties that embody cornerstone concepts in current attentional theory including mixed selectivity, adaptive coding and biased competition, and reproduced a number of classic behavioral and neural findings. A causal test of the model using non-invasive brain stimulation concurrent with functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) in humans showed that network perturbation reproduced neural decoding and behavioural data. When features were task-relevant, they rapidly formed synaptic connections with frontal cortex binding them into an attracting state, which manifest as prioritized representation of attended information, but this state was readily corrupted by brain stimulation. The model shows mechanistically that rapid synaptic changes could explain flexible rule-based control of attention.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Scavenging seabirds, such as skuas, may act as both reservoirs and vectors, and have been linked to multiple outbreaks since 2021. Here, we report the detection of HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in three Tristan skua (Stercorarius antarcticus hamiltoni) carcasses on Gough Island in the central South Atlantic Ocean. To investigate potential incursion routes, we combined genomic analyses with year-round tracking data from global location sensors. Although migratory movement patterns suggested southern Africa as the most obvious pathway, the strain detected on Gough Island was more closely related to that found in South Georgia, suggesting infection may have occurred during the pre-laying exodus when skuas disperse into frontal waters south of the island. No further cases have been confirmed for Gough, but further systematic monitoring is needed to understand the dynamics of virus infection. The detection of HPAIV H5N1 in skuas on Gough Island highlights the importance of continued vigilance, coordinated surveillance, and proactive biosecurity across the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean, alongside efforts to reduce other pressures on globally important seabird populations to help strengthen their resilience.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

This subfamily has previously been implicated in pathogenic morphogenesis in Ascomycota, but their role in Agaricomycetes has not previously been addressed. In Coprinopsis cinerea, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of gcd1 resulted in strains with severely impaired fruiting body morphogenesis, with malformed cap, stipe, and gill tissues. Gcd1 deletion strains lacked universal veil, resembling species with open (gymnocarpous) development. We find that GCD1/Con7 homologs are widely distributed in most Dikarya species and are mostly encoded by a single gene in each species genome. Transcriptome analyses identified several misregulated genes in the gcd1 mutant, which pinpoint potential mechanisms underlying its developmental defects as well as provided insights into the morphogenesis of mushroom fruiting bodies. These findings establish GCD1 as a key regulator of multicellular development in C. cinerea and broaden the known functions of Con7-like transcription factors to include fruiting body morphogenesis in Agaricomycetes.

Acute murine Plasmodium infection at the time of rVSV/EBOV vaccination reduced vaccine-mediated protection against mouse-adapted EBOV (ma-EBOV) challenge. Decreased protection was associated with a Plasmodium-induced interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma})-mediated decrease of rVSV/EBOV replication in lymph node (LN) macrophages, resulting in reduced primary anti-EBOV glycoprotein antibody responses.

Here, we identify a transcriptional regulator, AstR, that specifically activates the expression of the A. baumannii ornithine utilization operon astNOP. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AstR was co-opted from the Acinetobacter arginine utilization astGCADBE locus and is specialized to regulate ornithine utilization in A. baumannii. Reporter assays in minimal media and mouse fecal samples show that astN promoter expression was activated by ornithine but inhibited by glutamate and other preferred carbon sources. astN promoter expression was similarly activated by incubation with fecal samples from conventional mice but not germ-free mice, suggesting AstR-dependent activation of the astN promoter responds to intermicrobial competition for amino acids.

One potential candidate is the natural compound thapsigargin (Tg). Tg potently induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies have demonstrated that Tg has robust antiviral activity against several human coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, although the specific antiviral mechanism(s) have remained unclear. Here, we aimed to characterize the role of the UPR in the antiviral activity of Tg against HCoV-229E, a model common cold CoV. Consistent with previous findings, we show that a short 30-minute priming of A549 cells with Tg potently inhibits HCoV-229E infection. Time-of-addition assays showed that Tg is most effective when added up to 8 hours post-infection. Furthermore, Tg inhibits the accumulation of double-stranded RNA in infected cells, suggesting that Tg inhibits early stages of viral RNA replication. Using selective UPR pathway inhibitors to narrow down the role of these pathways in mediating the antiviral effect of Tg, we show that the inhibition of IRE1 or ATF6 does not impair the ability of Tg to inhibit HCoV-229E infection. The use of stable knockdown A549 cells in which IRE1, PERK, or ATF6 expression was silenced further revealed that the antiviral activity of Tg is not dependent on the expression of any of the three UPR sensors individually. However, HCoV-229E replication is inhibited in A549-shIRE1 cells, or in cells treated with the IRE1 inhibitor (KIRA6), suggesting that IRE1 activation may play a pro-viral role during HCoV-229E infection. Selective UPR pathway activators were used to further probe down the role of each pathway during HCoV-229E infection. Selective activation of the PERK pathway, but not IRE1 or ATF6 pathways, inhibits HCoV-229E infection. Lastly, to more broadly test the antiviral role of PERK against CoV RNA replication, we used BHK-21 cells that stably express a SARS-CoV-2 replicon. We show that selective PERK activation robustly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, comparable to Tg.

BipA is essential for bacterial survival in stress conditions and functions through interactions with the prokaryotic ribosome, although its role is not fully understood.

Using ancestral sequence resurrection, we tested when cytonuclear Bs evolved their amyloid related functions. We found that their common ancestor with As, AncAB that has a ZnF does not facilitate disassembly of amyloid fibrils, while AncB, which lacks a ZnF, is active. Overall, our findings are consistent with the idea that, though the ZnF of class A JDPs is important for some roles, its loss allowed evolution of novel functions, as illustrated by the ability of BC and B'(ST) JDPs to control amyloid aggregate levels.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Overall, GR sustained fitness benefits over 20 generations. The benefits persisted under thermal stress lowering extinction risk regardless of the rescuer's morph and introduced load indicating their minimal importance.

Here, we analyzed the viral load of 31 DNA viruses in human blood and saliva using whole-genome sequencing data from UK Biobank (n=490,401), SPARK (n=12,519), and All of Us (n=414,817). Viral load varied markedly with age, time of day, and season, and was higher in men than women for most viruses. Human genetic variation at dozens of genomic loci associated with load of seven viruses: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, 45 loci), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7, 24 loci), HHV-6B, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and three anelloviruses. Variation at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex generated the strongest associations (p = 1.1x10-8 to 9.1x10-851). Effects of HLA alleles exhibited specificity to different viruses and varied by age and body site, and HLA-B*08:01 also exhibited a host-virus genetic interaction with EBV subtype (p = 2.3x10-44). Other human genetic effects involved genes encoding proteins that process peptides for antigen presentation, such as ERAP1 (HHV-7, p = 2.7x10-78) and ERAP2 (EBV, p = 4.6x10-111). Mendelian randomization analyses indicated that although EBV infection strongly increases risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), EBV DNA load is unlikely to further modulate risk of MS (p = 0.52). In contrast, EBV viral load exhibited a strong causal effect on increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 19.81 [3.04-129] per s.d. increase in EBV load, p = 1.8x10-3). This suggests that higher chronic EBV viral load increases lymphoma risk, whereas associations of EBV infection with autoimmune conditions reflect host immune responses to particular viral epitopes.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Current treatments such as angioplasty, stenting, and atherectomy are invasive and limited by restenosis, thrombosis, and incomplete long-term efficacy. Pulsed field ablation (PFA), a nonthermal electroporation-based modality, has demonstrated safety in other cardiovascular applications, but it has not been applied for the treatment of endoluminal vascular diseases. We investigated whether pulsed electric fields could be delivered within the coronary artery and if PFA could selectively ablate the cellular components of atherosclerotic plaques. Methods: A bipolar catheter-based PFA probe was fabricated using a balloon catheter with flexible electrodes and evaluated through a combination of ex vivo evaluations. The electrical conductivities of human atherosclerotic plaques were derived from previous impedance measurements for patient-specific multi-tissue and single-cell electroporation modeling. PFA was then evaluated for selective decellularization within an electrical conductivity-matched 3D fibrotic atherosclerosis tissue mimic using high concentrations of human macrophages and aggregated oxidized low-density lipoproteins, encapsulated within a collagen matrix. Results: Endoluminal bipolar probe evaluation demonstrated probe positioning and high voltage pulsed electric field delivery within the left coronary artery of ex vivo porcine hearts, with maximum ablations (6.99 cm2) and current (13 A) evaluated within live potato tissue. The multi-tissue model then indicated that endoluminal PFA can effectively cover >95% of severe and thick plaques with irreversible electroporation, with single-cell modeling supporting the electroporation of foam cells within the plaque. The 3D atherosclerosis mimic validated the ability of PFA to completely ablate the foam cells with fibrotic tissue at >1000 V/cm. Conclusions: This study provides the first demonstration of PFA for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. By combining experimental validation with computational modeling, we establish proof-of-concept that PFA can selectively ablate diseased cells while preserving extracellular architecture, laying the groundwork for future translational development of this therapy.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

We present Spatially Smooth Sparse Regression (S3R), a general framework that estimates location specific coefficients linking a response feature to high dimensional spatial predictors. S3R unites structured sparsity with a minimum spanning tree guided smoothness penalty, yielding coefficient fields that are coherent within neighborhoods yet permit sharp boundaries. S3R enables large scale data analysis with an efficient implementation using a reduced MST graph, multi GPU training, and parallel hyperparameter search. In synthetic data, S3R accurately recovers spatially varying effects, selects relevant predictors, and preserves known boundaries. Applied to human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, S3R recapitulates layer-specific target TF associations with concordant layer wise correlations in matched single cell data. In acute Haemophilus ducreyi skin infection, S3R converts spot level mixtures into cell type attributed expression fields and reveals spatial gradients; applying SVG tests to these fields increases concordance and recovers gradients missed by spot level methods. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, S3R constructs cross cell type, cross gene co variation tensors that prioritize interactions among cell types with interacting genes enriching pathways consistent with known biology. Because responses and predictors in S3R are user defined, it could flexibly address diverse ST questions within a single, scalable, and interpretable regression framework.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Despite its clinical significance, the nasopharyngeal microbiome remains poorly characterized with few resources available. A robust standardized framework for distinguishing healthy from dysbiotic communities is needed to advance nasopharyngeal microbiome research. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis that yielded 28 independent nasopharyngeal microbiome studies encompassing 7,790 uniformly reprocessed samples from public repositories. Further, we developed a newly introduced, three-stage large language model-assisted background decontamination pipeline that mitigates study-specific technical and environmental variation while preserving biological signal integrity. We identified six reproducible nasopharyngeal community state types (NPCSTs), each dominated by distinct genera: Moraxella (I), Corynebacterium-Dolosigranulum (II), Staphylococcus (III), Haemophilus (IV), mixed (V), and Streptococcus (VI). NPCSTs were key drivers of the sample diversity rather than disease status, requiring NPCST-stratified downstream analyses. Co-occurrence network analysis and functional pathway predictions revealed NPCST-specific microbial interactions and metabolic signatures. To bridge the translational gap from research to clinic, we developed the Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Health Index (NMHI), an independent continuous wellness score that achieves an AUC of 0.90 and 0.92 in internal and external validations, respectively. Unlike binary disease classifiers, the NMHI quantifies nasopharyngeal health along a spectrum, enabling risk stratification for respiratory infections, treatment monitoring, and dysbiosis identification in PCR-negative symptomatic patients. Our comprehensive framework establishes reproducible NPCSTs, validated decontamination protocols, and publicly available classification models, providing the analytical framework for advancing nasopharyngeal microbiome research toward clinical implementation.

These so-called shadow images can be acquired patch by patch in a 4D-STEM setup using a pixelated detector and assembled into a shadow montage. Due to parallel acquisition within each illuminated patch, an upscaled bright field (BF) image is rendered efficiently in time and with little additional computational demand compared to other STEM techniques. We show that in this shadow regime described by geometrical optics, the algorithm achieves the result of a tilt-corrected bright field image. Furthermore, the solution is equivalent to cone-beam reconstruction in a particular scenario of a scanning point illumination source in a plane. The contrast transfer is similar to that of conventional wide-field TEM, but like STEM the focus is insensitive to energy loss and objective lens chromatic aberration. By adjusting the overlap between shadow patch images in the diffraction plane, the shadow montage is synchronized to specific layers in the sample, rendering a 3D shadow volume from a single dataset. The method is also amenable to conventional tilt tomography, by adding a shadow montage or shadow volume to each tilt view prior to back-projection. This approach effectively circumvents the basic presumption of parallel-projection tomography that the depth of field must be greater than the specimen thickness.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Despite its extensive use, the endocrine effects of SRNm still remain unknown due to a lack of studies. This study examined the effect of SRNm administration on steroid and gonadotropin hormone profiles in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals received oral SRNm at a dose of 40 mg/kg daily for 28 days, whereas control rats received normal food and water. Serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total testosterone, progesterone, 17{beta}-estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were quantified and statistically analyzed to understand the effects of SRNm. SRNm treatment elicited a statistically significant elevation in serum progesterone, suggesting enhanced steroidogenic activity potentially relevant to its traditional antihypertensive use. DHEA-S and testosterone are slightly decreased, indicating a subtle modulatory influence on androgen biosynthesis without compromising basal production. Gonadotropin analysis revealed that LH levels have decreased, while FSH levels have slightly increased, but the change is non-significant. These findings show that SRNm had a selective effect on progesterone synthesis, while maintaining overall hormonal homeostasis.

Adaptation of these methods to high-throughput formats (96-, 384- or 1,536-well plates) is challenging due to both assay automation constraints and the lack of well surface area available for reliable analysis. Here, we present a scalable alternative to traditional methods that uses whole-well image thresholding to quantify infectious virions by measuring virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) via cell lysis and detachment. The CPE area assay is best positioned as a practical high-throughput preliminary screening tool, effectively quantifying samples within the assay range and flagging samples above or below the concentration thresholds. To improve analysis efficiency and reduce user bias in CPE area selection, we evaluated an nnU-Net model for automated image segmentation against images segmented by manually defined brightness thresholds. The model achieved perfect correlation with manual thresholding (R2=1.00), showing minimal differences in the identified CPE area and thus validating nnU-Net as a reliable alternative to manual analysis. This approach provides two complementary pipelines: manual thresholding, which tolerates adjustments of hyperparameters, and fully automated segmentation via nnU-Net, which streamlines analysis and enhances throughput. This flexible CPE area assay enables accurate and automated quantification in high-throughput screening formats, thereby greatly accelerating a routine laboratory task while decreasing subjectivity and bias.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Amylase and protease are two of the most demanded and widely used commercial enzymes. Amylases have many industrial uses: starch conversion (food/bakery industry), sizing agent (textile industry and paper industry), degradation of starchy residue from clothes (detergent industry), conversion of starch to fermentable sugar (fuel industry) etc. Their main source is of microbial origin. About two-third of the industrial enzymes (amylase, protease, cellulose, penicillinase, chitinase, nucleases, esterase, lipase etc.) are produced by Bacillus spp. Among bacteria, Bacillus species are specific producers of extracellular enzymes. Objective. The present work comprised the identification of amylase and protease producing Bacillus spp and exposure of the producers to various parameters for the maximum yield of the enzyme. Methods. To isolate and identify the amylase and protease producing strain, soil samples were collected from different vegetation from the altitude at 4367.35 feet above sea level. The isolates were screened and various biochemical tests and morphological observations were done to identify the isolates. The enzymes were produced by the submerged state fermentation (SmF) from the isolates and purified by dialysis. Effects of temperature, pH, and different carbon and nitrogen sources of the medium using SmF were optimized. Results. Among 95 isolates, 36 were identified. Among the identified isolates, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringiensis were optimized for the amylase and protease production respectively. The maximum amylase production was found at 42C temperature, in fructose as a carbon sugar, peptone as a nitrogen source and at pH 7. Similarly, the maximum protease production was found at 42C temperature, in sucrose as a carbon sugar, ammonium sulphate as a nitrogen source. The producers inhabited the soil of leguminous plant. Conclusion. In the present study, a natural polymer gelatin is used with the nutrient agar medium to help in cell immobilization for maximum production of alkaline protease by strains of Bacillus. More sophisticated process of purification might yield more enzyme compared to the dialysis in our process that yield 42U/ml/min and 52U/ml/min respectively.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated gut microbial metabolism of linoleic acid (LA), a predominant dietary fatty acid (FA), by the human gut microbiota, integrating isotopically labeled LA (ILLA), isotope tracking lipidomics, metagenomics, and pathway analyses. The findings were further validated within a dynamic gut-simulating environment using the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) and secondary analysis of a human dietary intervention trial. LA exposure led to a broad spectrum of lipids, including LA-derived microbial lipids and others produced as adaptive responses. These included various polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) like -linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid. ILLA tracing indicated that LA was primarily routed to {beta}-oxidation in several species within the class Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria, and the intermediates likely facilitated FA synthesis. Temporal patterns revealed that Clostridia (e.g., Enterocloster spp.) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated early-stage LA metabolism, while Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Klebsiella spp.) played later roles, producing overlapping lipids that primarily relied on de novo FA synthesis. The SHIME confirmed LA bioprocessing over the long term and indicated that a high protein-to-fibre feeding increased PUFA concentration in the colonic condition through its stimulating effects on Gammaproteobacteria. The effect of high protein-to-fibre ratio diet on gut microbial PUFA production was confirmed by the results of the human trial. Overall, this study maps the microbial taxa, pathways, and microbial lipids associated with LA, expanding the knowledge of monoculture experiments and predicting how one of the most abundant FAs is utilized by the human gut microbiota.

As a result, research on melanin in fungi is wide ranging including development of anti-fungals and surface interfacing bioelectronics. In-vivo polymerisation of compounds with electrical or ionic conductivity can provide a useful method to interface with the electrophysiology of biological organisms. However, the impact of such interventions is unknown where anti-fungal activity is present and interferes with the target signalling in the organism. Melanin compounds are promising for achieving bioelectronic interfaces with mycelium. However, the identification of the role of melanin in blocking calcium flux in airway epithelial cells and phagosomes underscores the significance of investigating its effects in more detail. Additionally, synthetic analogs such as polydopamine are thought to exhibit similar metal ion chelation properties, supporting the biochemical parallels between natural and artificial melanins. In this paper, we investigate the polymerisation of synthetic melanins in mycelium from the intracellular environment and onto microelectrodes in terms of extracellular electrophysiology. At concentrations of 5 mM and 10 mM extracellular electrophysiological activity is significantly inhibited suggesting a putative link to reduction in Ca2+ efflux and antifungal properties.

The types of environmental variables typically used for characterizing habitats in such ecological models, such as precipitation or tree cover, are frequently of low spatial resolution, with a single value for a spatial pixel size of, e.g., 1km2. This spatial scale fails to capture the nuances of micro-habitat conditions that can strongly influence species presence, and additionally, as many of these are derived from satellite data, there are aspects of the environment they cannot capture, such as the structure of vegetation below the forest canopy. We propose to combine high-resolution satellite \\textit{and} ground-level imagery to produce multi-modal environmental features that better capture micro-habitat conditions, and incorporate these multi-modal features into hierarchical Bayesian species occupancy models. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models to flexibly capture relevant information directly from raw imagery, in contrast to traditional approaches which rely on derived and/or hand-crafted sets of ecosystem covariates. We implement deep multi-modal species occupancy modeling using a new open-source Python package for ecological modeling, designed for bridging machine learning and statistical ecology. We test our method under a strict evaluation protocol on 16 mammal species across thousands of camera traps in Snapshot USA surveys, and find that multi-modal features substantially enhance predictive power compared to traditional environmental variables alone.

Dissociation of DRGs following temporary storage (4-16hrs) in Hibernate media resulted in similar neuronal and immune cell yield as acutely dissociated DRGs. Neurons derived from DRGs stored in Hibernate media prior to dissociation exhibited similar electrophysiological properties and capsaicin responses as acutely dissociated DRG neurons. Similarly, neurons from acutely dissociated DRGs stored in Hibernate media (>24hrs) and shipped to geographically distant laboratories produced neuronal cultures displaying comparable electrophysiological properties as acutely cultured neurons. This approach overcomes insurmountable logistical burdens and increases access to freshly recovered human DRGs.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Circadian disturbances are implicated in dysregulation of arousal and general neurobiological function, contributing to conditions such as bipolar disorder (BD). However, the behavioural and biological consequences of circadian disruption on arousal dysfunction remain poorly quantified. Here, we developed a novel unpredictable circadian disruption (UCD) protocol - consisting of unpredictable exposure to light and sound - to investigate its impact on locomotor activity and its association with metabolic, inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Forty-eight Wistar rats were exposed to UCD or control conditions, with or without corticosterone administration, for five weeks. Body weight was tracked throughout the study. Locomotor activity was assessed over the final two weeks (nine sessions) in an open-field arena. Real-time PCR was used to quantify NAc gene expression of inflammatory, metabolic, stress, and circadian markers, while liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measured neurotransmitter and central carbon metabolite concentrations. UCD animals exhibited initial hyperactivity at three weeks, followed by hypoactivity at four weeks. UCD was associated with increased NAc expression of inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers. Male UCD animals showed significant weight gain, an effect reversed in females. UCD also induced increases in NAc insulin resistance markers and reductions in central carbon metabolites, indicating disrupted striatal glucose metabolism. These findings highlight the central effects of circadian disruption on locomotor behaviour, stress, and immunometabolic signalling, offering mechanistic insights into arousal dysfunction in BD.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Yet, their evolutionary history and role in shaping Earths early biosphere remain entirely unexplored. Here, we trace the origins of microbial exoenzymes and reveal their previously unrecognized role in driving planetary oxygenation. Our results show that exoenzymes are more common in microorganisms utilizing high-energy metabolisms, likely reflecting the energetic costs of enzyme biosynthesis and secretion. They are especially advantageous in environments rich in particulate organic matter (POM). A refined carbon cycle model indicates that early Archean oceans offered few such habitats, as low productivity and intense UV radiation rapidly photodegraded POM. However, with a Paleoproterozoic rise of atmospheric oxygen, increased oxidative weathering boosted marine primary productivity and POM accumulation, creating conditions favoring exoenzyme evolution. Molecular clock analyses further indicate that alkaline phosphatase, a key phosphorus-releasing exoenzyme, had likely emerged with the permanent rise of oxygen, enabling more efficient phosphorus recycling. We propose that exoenzymes initiated a positive feedback loop: by accelerating nutrient regeneration, they fueled cyanobacterial productivity and oxygen release, which in turn favored greater exoenzyme capacity, reinforcing long-term oxygenation of the planet.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

The temporal dynamics of begomoviruses in non-agricultural environments have been largely overlooked, and little is known about how these viruses evolve in the absence of anthropogenic influence. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of begomoviruses in a small fragment of regenerating Atlantic Forest area in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Samples of Sida acuta, a wild plant native from South America, were collected at the same location over a 12-year period (2011-2022). Five distinct begomoviruses were detected infecting this host: OxYVV, SiYLCV, SimMV, MaYVV, and SiMV. OxYVV and SimMV were subdivided into multiple variants, revealing their potential as reservoirs of viral biodiversity. Several shifts in species and variant composition were observed in the viral community over time, with the most drastic change occurring in 2016, when SiYLCV outnumbered OxYVV. The reasons behind this turnover remain uncertain, but the most compelling clues point to a population expansion of SiYLCV. We detected a strong temporal signal in two of the most abundant viruses (OxYVV and SiYLCV), which allowed us to calibrate molecular clocks and estimate substitution rates for both of them. Our results indicate that, even in the natural environment, begomoviruses can evolve at rates similar to those reported in agricultural systems.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

In this context, recent vaccines developed for poultry could provide tools for the conservation of wild endangered birds populations. The king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), a long-lived seabird breeding in dense colonies with an extended chick-rearing period, was identified as a possible surrogate species for a vaccination trial in a sub-Antarctic natural setting. We investigate here the immune response of king penguin chicks to a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against a H5 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b protein. Thirty chicks were vaccinated (primo- and boost-injections), 20 were kept as controls. Along 250 days of monitoring, vaccinated chicks showed a high and persistent immune response, granting a strong seroneutralisation capacity against the virus, up to fledging. No adverse effects were observed. The screening for antibodies against unspecific avian influenza viruses suggested that no natural infection occurred over the entire trial. The emergence of HPAI in the Southern Indian Ocean in October 2024 highlights the timeliness of such experimental tests. Our results show the vaccine could provide a powerful tool for mitigation and emphasises the need for studies considering ethical and practical issues of vaccination for wildlife conservation.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

However, their success depends on species identity, demographic history, and the genomic architecture of sex determination, which remain poorly resolved for many non-model taxa. We integrated high-quality genome assembly, whole-genome resequencing, and population genomics to evaluate biocontrol feasibility in invasive suckermouth armored catfish (Loricariidae) in Texas. Mitochondrial phylogenies and genome-wide SNPs revealed cryptic diversity, with distinct lineages from at least two genera (Hypostomus and Pterygoplichthys) exhibiting strong drainage-level genetic differentiation. Effective population size estimates were exceptionally low, consistent with founder effects and moderate inbreeding. Genome-wide association analyses detected no large-effect loci for sex in either genus, despite high statistical power in Hypostomus, suggesting that sex determination is polygenic and/or environmentally influenced. These results identify key biological constraints for sex-ratio-based biocontrol and underscore the importance of genomic assessments prior to management interventions.

M.; Caliari, S. R.", "abstract": "In pulmonary fibrosis, excessive scar tissue accumulates in the alveolar interstitial space, impairing gas exchange and compromising lung function. This fibrotic remodeling results in tissue stiffening, but more complex lung mechanical properties critical to tissue function, such as viscoelasticity and stress relaxation, remain poorly defined. To address this gap, we use the bleomycin aged mouse model to characterize both bulk and spatially-resolved viscoelastic mechanical properties of normal and fibrotic lungs. Our analysis reveals that while bleomycin-induced fibrosis leads to heterogeneously increased lung stiffness, viscoelasticity as measured by tan delta (ratio of loss to storage modulus) and stress relaxation timescales remains remarkably consistent as a function of both age and bleomycin treatment. This unexpected preservation of viscoelasticity despite fibrotic stiffening highlights a previously underappreciated mechanical phenotype of fibrotic lungs. To model these distinct mechanical features in vitro, we utilize a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel system that largely recapitulates the viscoelastic mechanical properties observed in both normal and fibrotic lungs. These findings provide new insight into the mechanical consequences of fibrosis and establish a tunable in vitro hydrogel platform mimicking key tissue viscoelastic properties.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

These mechanisms are often confounded, yet dissociating them is essential for understanding neural circuit computations. We addressed this by performing two-photon calcium imaging from distinct cell types (excitatory, VIP and SST) in layer 2/3 of visual and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while awake mice passively viewed audio-visual stimuli under temporal contexts with different inter-stimulus interval (ISI) distributions. Computational modeling revealed distinct functional clusters of neurons, including stimulus-activated (ramp-down) and stimulus-inhibited (ramp-up) categories, with distinct kinetics and area/cell-type biases. Importantly, all functional clusters were invariant to temporal predictability, shifted immediately when temporal statistics changed, and were identical between naive and experienced mice. Population decoding revealed that clusters with heterogeneous kinetics differed in how well they represented interval information, such that together they tiled elapsed time and produced a distributed, learning-independent population code for time. These results provide strong evidence against temporal predictive processing in V1/PPC under passive conditions and instead demonstrate intrinsic coding of interval timing, redefining the mechanistic origin of ramping and omission-related activity in sensory cortex. We discuss how these dynamics align with stimulus-reset attractor frameworks, and propose that temporal predictive processing is more likely implemented in other circuits or recruited in V1/PPC during task-engaged behavior.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

The adult male zebra finch songbird is uniquely poised for these studies given vocally-dedicated brain nuclei and a quantifiable output (birdsong). Our prior publication revealed that injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) expressing the human (h) alpha-synuclein (hSNCA, a-syn) gene into basal ganglia vocal nucleus Area X results in higher levels of insoluble a-syn protein and changes reminiscent of human PD including softer, shorter, and reduced number of vocalizations compared to AAV5 controls. Here, we test the hypothesis that AAV-hSNCA overexpression reduces the firing rate of specific neuronal sub-types in Area X using in vivo recordings in anesthetized finches. Five classes of neurons were differentiated in AAV-treated finches based on waveform width (narrow vs. wide) and firing rates (low vs. fast). Wide-waveform/low-rate activity is a consistent feature of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a dominant cell type in Area X and in mammalian basal ganglia. Reduced firing rates and enhanced post-peak rebound were detected in the AAV-hSNCA group for putative MSN neurons compared to AAV controls. No differences in firing rate nor waveform shape were detected for the narrow waveform neurons.

Here, we apply a normative modeling framework to map cerebellar volumetric growth from infancy to young adulthood (N = 751; ages 1-21 years). Using lobular and functional cerebellar parcellations, we comprehensively characterize typical cerebellar development and examine how it aligns with cerebral development and behavioral outcomes. Across parcellations, posterior higher association areas consistently show steeper growth trajectories than anterior sensorimotor areas. Cerebellar and cerebral areas with similar functional roles demonstrate coordinated maturation, and volumetric growth in the posterior cerebellum relates to individual differences in socio-linguistic behaviors. These findings establish a comprehensive reference for typical cerebellar development, highlight cerebellar co-maturation with the cerebral cortex, and underscore the cerebellum's role in supporting emerging higher cognitive functions.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at ~10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants' visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}

Given the PPfpm's location, single case-reports of its association with the functional sensorimotor hand area, and evidence linking it to the somato-cognitive action network, it holds potential as an anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor region. To characterize the macroscopic morphology of the PPfpm and evaluate its relevance as a reliable and easily detectable anatomical landmark, methods for observer-independent characterization of cortical sulci and structures were adapted and developed to investigate the PPfpm in a large dataset. For 1112 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult S1200 Release, CS depth profiles were computed from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and an algorithm was developed to automatically extract the PPfpm from these depth profiles. Based on the extraction of two key features approximating the PPfpm at its peak height (PPfpm-I) and its lateral end (PPfpm-II), a principal description of the PPfpm's position and extent as influenced by hemisphere and sex was conducted. Analyses revealed the PPfpm as a near-universal cerebral fold in the adult human brain, consistently located at mid-height within the CS with a strong association to the CS sulcal pits. Though commonly of a small extent, the PPfpm can be reliably identified in CS depth profiles and in structural MRI data. By providing a systematic, modern macroanatomical characterization of the PPfpm in a large cohort with rigorous quality control, the present study demonstrates the potential of the PPfpm to serve as a robust anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor hand area of the human brain.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": ""}
