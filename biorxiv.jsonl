Difficulties in controlling avoidance behavior are the core maintaining factor of this impairing condition, hampering the efficacy of existing therapies. This preregistered study tested a physiologically-grounded non-invasive enhancement of control over social approach and avoidance behavior in socially anxious individuals. Their prefrontal and sensorimotor areas received dual-site phase-coupled electrical stimulation, to enhance endogenous inter-regional theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, a mechanism known to support emotion control in non-anxious individuals. We measured behavioral and fMRI-BOLD responses during in-phase, anti-phase, and sham stimulations, while participants performed a social approach-avoidance task, involving either automatic or controlled emotional actions. In-phase stimulation selectively enhanced control over approach-avoidance actions, and modulated neural responses in the same prefrontal region where stimulation-reactivity increased as a function of trait anxiety. These findings illustrate how human neurophysiological connectivity can be leveraged to improve control over social avoidance, opening the way for mechanistically grounded clinical interventions of persistent avoidance in anxiety disorders.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

R. d.", "abstract": "Background: Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering an alternative to costly experimental methods. The original GenPPi software advanced ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, but was limited by its reliance on high sequence similarity. This work introduces GenPPi 1.5 to enhance these predictive capabilities. Results: GenPPi 1.5 incorporates a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features from amino acid propensity indices, to classify protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting >65% identity). To manage computational complexity from the increased interactions generated by the RF model, especially in extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Extensive simulations across various configurations validated the methodology. RF integration significantly broadened GenPPi's predictive power; application to Buchnera aphidicola showed up to 62% overlap with STRING database interactions. Analysis of RIS demonstrated that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values greater than 100, indicating minimal compromise to network integrity. Conclusion: The combination of Machine Learning (RF) and the RIS algorithm in GenPPi 1.5 represents a significant advancement. It overcomes the high-similarity dependency of the previous version while efficiently handling complex genomes. GenPPi 1.5 provides a robust and scalable alignment-free PPI prediction solution, enabling users to train custom models tailored to specific genomic contexts. GenPPi is freely available on our website (https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/), its source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/santosardr/genppi), and it can be easily installed via the Python Package Index using the command pip install genppi-py.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we report a copolymer composed of methacrylic acid and styrene, which we term MAASTY, leveraging the inherent monomer reactivity ratios to create an anionic copolymer with a statistical distribution of monomers. We show that MAASTY can be used for high-resolution structural determination of a human membrane protein with single particle cryo-electron microscopy, preserving endogenous lipids including cholesterol and exhibiting an enrichment of phosphatidylinositol. Moreover, MAASTY copolymers effectively solubilize a broad range of lipid species and a wide range of different, eukaryotic membrane proteins from mammalian cells.

Mislocalization of certain LD-targeted membrane proteins, including HSD17B13 and PNPLA3, is implicated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the mechanisms governing the trafficking and accumulation of ER proteins on LDs remain poorly understood. Here, using MINFLUX and HILO single-molecule tracking combined with machine learning, we show that HSD17B13, GPAT4, and the model cargo LiveDrop diffuse at comparable speeds in the ER and on LDs, but become nano-confined upon reaching the LD surface. Mechanistic dissection of LiveDrop targeting revealed that this confinement, along with protein accumulation on LDs, depends on specific residues within its targeting motif. These residues mediate preferential and repeated interactions with nanoscale membrane domains, suggesting that LD-targeted proteins selectively partition into distinct lipid-protein environments that transiently retain and concentrate them at the LD surface. Single-molecule trajectories further revealed bidirectional trafficking of LiveDrop across seipin-containing ER-LD bridges, providing direct evidence for lateral protein transfer across membrane contact sites. These findings establish nanodomain-based confinement as a key mechanism driving selective protein accumulation on LDs and reveal how membrane bridges between organelles facilitate protein sorting.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Intermingled VTA GABA neurons are positioned to regulate dopaminergic systems, but we lack detailed insight into how this population contributes to conditioned motivation across learning contexts. Here, recording population calcium activity in VTA dopamine and GABA neurons during different conditioning paradigms, we found that, while dopamine neurons were selectively responsive only to appetitive stimuli, GABA neurons actively encoded both appetitive and aversive cues and outcomes. GABA neurons also signaled errors in violation of expectations for associations of either valence. Critically, we found that GABA neurons selectively integrated events when both valences were simultaneously present, reflecting motivational state under cost. In a motivational conflict task, where rats must weigh decisions to avoid shock or seek reward, VTA GABA neuron activity scaled with escalating cost, and was predictive of reward seeking motivation. Optogenetic inhibition of VTA GABA neurons disrupted reward seeking specifically under conditions of motivational conflict. Together, our data show that VTA GABA neurons reflect a broader learning signal, compared to dopamine neurons, one that is particularly important for directing appropriate behavioral responses in complex, multivalent environments. Our results reveal new insights into the functional landscape of the VTA, where distinct populations of neurons act in parallel to signal different aspects of motivation under various behavioral conditions.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Among them, Kremen1 was first described to induce cancer cell death in the absence of its ligand, DKK1. However, the precise mechanism of Kremen1-induced cell death remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Kremen1 induces cell death with autophagic features, contrasting with the apoptotic process typically associated with dependence receptors. Specifically, the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, or genetic silencing of key autophagy effectors, efficiently suppresses this cell death process. A biotin proximity labeling for protein-protein interactions identified SEC24C, a component of the COP-II complex, as a critical effector in Kremen1-induced autophagy and cell death. Our findings further reveal that Kremen1 is in proximity with SEC24C and ATG9A after vesicular trafficking and fosters the interaction of SEC24C with ATG8, ERGIC and ATG9A. This potentially underlies the increased number of autophagosomes leading to cell death. The induction of aberrant autophagy by Kremen1 deserves particular attention, especially as the Kremen1/DKK1 pair is frequently altered in cancers. Thus, targeting this pathway may offer a potential strategy for treating cancers resistant to current therapies.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

J.; Pezeshkian, W.", "abstract": "Among the fascinating shapes that biomembranes exhibit are stomatocytes with multiple membrane necks, found for example in nuclear membranes and open autophagosomes. These morphologies, characterised by a high topological genus, can be visualised as spherical double membranes connected by neck-like structures. The necks are often occupied by specific biomolecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex, which divide the space into three distinct compartments. Understanding how the size of these necks responds to pressure gradients is fundamentally important for unravelling the influence of mechanical stimuli on traffic control through the necks, for example, in nuclear mechanosensing. In this work, we use computer simulations and theoretical analysis to investigate how neck size responds to variations in pressure or tension. Our findings reveal a two-phase behaviour: below a certain threshold, necks constrict as the pressure gradient increases, while above that threshold, they dilate. This response stems from the pure membrane's mechanics and depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient, the initial diameter of the neck and the membrane bending rigidity. We also provide a simple equation that links the threshold tension, the neck diameter and the bending rigidity, offering a useful tool to quickly assess different scenarios. Our results furthermore show that protein complexes in the neck partially counteract both constriction and dilation, stabilising neck size while preserving the same two-phase response to membrane tension. These findings uncover a promising, previously overlooked membrane property with implications for organelle shape and function, as well as for synthetic membrane design.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

To gain mechanistic insights, monocytes stimulated with OA SFs were compared to M-CSF, LPS, and sialidase, to assess patient-specific inflammatory pathways and phenotypes.

However, due to rapid urban expansion and severe deforestation, this area is recognized as one of the top global conservation priorities. As in other tropical regions, the prevailing idea is that the decline of local biodiversity in this region is a direct result of the overwhelming environmental changes that have occurred over the last 80 years. However, paleoecological data indicate that tropical forests have been exploited by human populations since at least the Late Pleistocene, and forest clearance for farming began several thousand years ago. To gain a complete overview of the long-term evolution of vertebrate fauna in continental Southeast Asia, it is necessary to investigate the past. This task is currently out of reach, mainly due to the lack of paleontological and historical studies regarding small animals, including emblematic taxa like turtles. Indeed, although some evidence suggests that the biodiversity of turtles in continental Southeast Asia may have changed over the last millennia, the paucity of historical records and archaeological assemblages studies currently precludes further assessment of the potential effect of past environmental changes, including potential human disturbances. The present study consists of a paleontological analysis of turtle bone assemblages collected from four prehistoric sites in Thailand and Cambodia. The aim is to test the hypothesis of changes in turtle biodiversity over the last 10,000 years. Our results indicate that turtle assemblages in most areas have experienced only limited changes across the Holocene, except for Laang Spean in Cambodia. However, a few 45 rare taxa may represent extirpated or extinct species of Testudinidae in continental Southeast Asia at an unknown time during the Holocene. We also observed significant changes in the geographic distribution of some genera, such as Batagur, Cyclemys, and Amyda. The fact that turtle fauna has been rather resilient and unchanged for several millennia shows that past human impact in most investigated areas had limited effects on these taxa. The strong modifications observed in Cambodia could, however, serve as a warning about the potential fate of turtle biodiversity in this region if further loss of natural environments occurs.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, which regulate blood glucose and body weight, show sex-specific effects, with estradiol potentiating their metabolic benefits. However, research on GLP-1 cognitive and neuroprotective roles has largely been conducted in males. Here, we investigated the effects of GLP-1 conjugated to estradiol (GE2) on metabolism, cognition, cytokine levels and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of middle-aged male and female rats fed a standard (SD) or Western (WD) diet. In both sexes, WD increased body weight and plasma leptin levels, regardless of sex. GE2 treatment led to weight loss, enhanced cued and contextual fear memory, reduced cytokine levels in the hippocampus in SD rats, and increased neurogenesis in the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG), regardless of sex. Sex-specific differences were observed in fat distribution, glucose regulation, central cytokine levels, and neuroplasticity after WD and GE2 treatment. In females only, GE2 reduced visceral (gonadal) fat, reduced cytokines in the dorsal hippocampus, and improved basal blood glucose in response to a WD. In males only, GE2 restored neurogenesis in the DG after WD exposure, and reduced cytokine levels in the amygdala. These findings suggest that although WD increased body weight and GE2 improved associative learning in both sexes, both WD and GE2 had differential affects on metabolic hormones, insulin regulation, cytokine levels and neuroplasticity.

Excessive osteoclast activity leads to bone loss and contributes to conditions like osteoporosis. Osteoclasts form a specialized adhesion structure called the actin ring that is crucial for bone resorption and relies on both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Our previous studies identified the {beta}-tubulin isotype TUBB6 as a regulator of actin ring dynamics essential for osteoclast function, and found ARHGAP10, a negative regulator of the GTPases CDC42 and RHOA, as a potential mediator of TUBB6 function. Here we show that ARHGAP10 is a novel microtubule-associated protein critical for osteoclast function. ARHGAP10 directly binds microtubules through its BAR-PH domain, which requires positively-charged lysine residues K37, K41 and K44 within the BAR domain. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of Arhgap10 affects the morphology of the actin ring and impairs osteoclast resorption activity, correlated with altered actin ring dynamics. Complementation experiments reveal that the ability of ARHGAP10 to bind microtubules and to negatively regulate RHO-GTPases are essential for its role in osteoclast resorption activity. These findings uncover a novel cytoskeletal regulator in osteoclasts and suggest that targeting the microtubule-actin interface via ARHGAP10 could represent a therapeutic strategy in bone loss disorder.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

When assessing microbial diversity, taxa, functional gene profiles, and gut permeability biomarkers, no significant differences were found between OA and controls. Although this does not exclude a causal contribution of the microbiota in the gut-joint-axis, its dysbiosis does not seem to be linked with OA disease progression. Instead, age and BMI appeared as the main contributing factors to microbiome changes. Microbiome studies in complex diseases often face challenges such as small sample sizes, batch effects, and limited ability to match appropriate controls, particularly in single-cohort designs. By combining data from multiple large cohorts, we were able to mitigate these limitations and provide a more robust assessment of microbiome association with OA.

Yet, the study of their individual and functional role is hindered by their diversity in nematodes. This study aimed to dissect the role of specific PGPs in mediating IVM resistance. Thus, Caenorhabditis elegans strain IVR10, selected for IVM resistance and reported to overexpress pgps, was used as a model. We generated different IVR10 strains each lacking one of six key pgps, and assessed changes in IVM tolerance. Remarkably, only the deletion of pgp-9 significantly increased IVM susceptibility. Furthermore, transgenic expression of Haemonchus contortus pgp-9.1 rescued the resistant phenotype, demonstrating a conserved function across species. To explore drug dynamics, we developed a fluorescent IVM analog, which revealed reduced drug accumulation in IVR10, a phenotype reversed by pgp-9 deletion.

In ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and primary visual cortex (V1), neural patterns for novel stimuli (composites) could be predicted as a linear combination of signals for familiar stimuli (elements). In vmPFC, this composition occurred in a high-dimensional format, but in PPC and V1, it took place in a low-dimensional, spatial, response-consistent frame of reference.

We examined resting-state fMRI data from 417 participants in the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network (ASD=174, ADHD=130, Typical Development=113; Mean age=11.96{+/-}4.10). Timeseries data were extracted from the MSN and seven additional resting-state cortical networks (RSNs). Undirected and directed functional connectivity (FC) metrics were computed within the MSN and between the MSN and other RSNs. FC was compared across diagnoses and related to clinical sensory characteristics. The thalamus emerged as a hub region in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs. Some diagnosis-related differences were observed, with increased MSN-RSN FC particularly in ADHD; however, associations with sensory characteristics were stronger in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs, regardless of diagnosis. Converging evidence was seen in data-driven clusters based on FC metrics, which did not align with diagnosis, but instead mapped on to the overall level of sensory issues reported. That the data-driven clusters sorted not by diagnosis but by sensory characteristics suggests that these sensory characteristics and their underlying neurobiology are transdiagnostic in nature as opposed to specific to ASD or ADHD.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "The human hippocampus is studied via two competing frameworks: one dividing it into discrete anatomical subfields with distinct computational processes, and another describing it as a continuous, functional gradients along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes. How these organizational principles relate to one another, particularly regarding intrinsic neural timescales of the hippocampus, remains unknown. Here, we used high-resolution resting-state fMRI to investigate how single-voxel autocorrelation, a measure of intrinsic neural timescale, maps onto hippocampal subfields. We found evidence for a hybrid organization. First, consistent with our predictions, we observed significantly higher autocorrelation (longer timescales) in the subiculum compared to the other subfields. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that CA1, which is implicated in integration, had low autocorrelation whereas CA2/3 and CA4DG, which are linked to pattern separation, had intermediate autocorrelation. Second, we discovered that the overarching anterior-posterior and medial-lateral gradients of autocorrelation were recapitulated within each individual subfield. Finally, data-driven clusters of autocorrelation values aligned more strongly with the continuous gradients than with the discrete anatomical boundaries, particularly in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the discrete and continuous views of hippocampal organization are not mutually exclusive but coexist across different spatial scales. We therefore propose a new comprehensive model of hippocampal function that integrates both its modular, subfield-specific properties and its graded, large-scale organization.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Specifically, identifying how ecological factors determine the direct and indirect benefits that maintain cooperation has proven challenging, as these can vary significantly across species and environments. Here, we study this problem by using the social pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer (Hymenoptera) as a model system. During their larval stage, N. sertifer live in groups and collectively secrete a defensive fluid against predators. This behavior comprises a public good as it is costly to exhibit and beneficial to others, and individuals vary in their contribution to group defense. We experimentally manipulated individual contributions to defense to assess how these influence individual survival. Our results indicate that defense has a group-level benefit as individuals were more likely to survive in cooperative groups that had a higher proportion of defending larvae. Moreover, being able to deploy defensive fluid confers direct survival benefits to individuals, regardless of group cooperativeness. Genetic and phenotypic analysis of natural populations further shows that kin selection promotes collective defense, as groups of larvae are often composed of full siblings. We also find that contribution to defense is female-biased and diminishes in male-biased and in larger groups, indicating that individuals adjust their contributions based on the social context. Overall, we find that cooperation in anti-predator defense provides both direct and indirect benefits and that individuals regulate their contributions mainly based on the social environment, resulting in variation within and among natural populations.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Tractometry offers a powerful approach for the in vivo, 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, enabling the localization of microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations and those at risk. In this study, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to multi-cohort diffusion MRI data from a total of 1,908 participants: 606 participants in ADNI3 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 3) and 1,302 participants from the HABS-HD (Health and Aging Brain Study - Healthy Diversity). Using BUAN and along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized effects of amyloid positivity, potentially mediated by tau, on white matter pathways, with amyloid positivity quantified via amyloid-sensitive positron emission tomography (PET).

We explore supergiant formation from the perspective of life cycle, ecological strategy, and gene expression, demonstrating that supergiants are distinct, regulated, transcriptionally unique stages. These reversibly differentiated cells require both external and internal triggers to develop and have evolved regulatory loops to ensure coupling between environmental and physiological conditions.

While LRRC8A is broadly expressed, LRRC8B, C, D and E have tissue-restricted expression. Here, we identified 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRRC8C highly associated with elevated diastolic and systolic blood pressure in human genetic studies, implicating LRRC8C as a regulator of vascular function. While LRRC8A/B/C/D/E are expressed in endothelium, co-immunoprecipitation experiments from lung endothelium using Lrrc8a-3xFlag knock-in mice, Lrrc8c-HA knock-in mice and endothelium-specific Lrrc8a-3xFlag overexpression mice demonstrate the endothelial LRRC8 complex to be composed largely of LRRC8A/B/C heteromers. Lrrc8a/b/c knock-out studies in mice and knock-down studies in human umbilical vein endothelial cells show co-dependent expression of LRRC8A/B/C proteins, but not LRRC8D.

We defined the lipid droplet-associated proteome and lipidome in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes harboring the three common APOE genotypes: APOE2 (protective), APOE3 (neutral), and APOE4 (risk). Each APOE variant displays distinct lipid droplet-associated proteins and lipids. These molecular changes yield differences in lipophagy; lipid droplets in APOE2 astrocytes undergo autophagic turnover, whereas those in APOE4 astrocytes are resistant to degradation.

We examined two populations of myogenic precursor cells for their responses to FGF2 in vitro using both extraocular and limb skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate two different populations of myogenic precursor cells, the EECD34 cells [positive for CD34, and negative for Sca1, CD31, and CD45] and PAX7-positive cells, from tibialis anterior and extraocular muscles of mice. These cells were cultured and treated with either proliferation or differentiation media in the absence or the presence of FGF2, followed by assays to determine its effects on proliferation and differentiation. These cells were also assessed for expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, FGFR2, and FGFR4. Both the EECD34 cells and the PAX7-positive cells responded to FGF2 with significantly increased proliferation. Both myogenic precursor cell populations showed increased differentiation in the presence of FGF2, but also showed decreased rates of fusion into multinucleated myotubes in this in vitro system relative to control cells. FGF2 has pleiotropic effects on skeletal muscles. Contrary to the literature, FGF2 did not inhibit differentiation, but did appear to decrease fusion into multinucleated myofibers in vitro.

Although FATE1 shares sequence homology with the mitochondrial fission factor Mff, its role in regulating mitochondrial architecture has not been mechanistically defined. Here, we identify FATE1 as a novel modulator of mitochondrial morphology that acts through a mechanism distinct from Mff. Unlike Mff, FATE1 does not recruit Drp1 to mitochondria and therefore lacks canonical fission activity. Instead, FATE1 promotes mitochondrial hyperfusion and protects against mitochondrial fragmentation triggered by cytokines and mitochondrial uncoupler treatment. The pro-fusion activity of FATE1 requires its mitochondrial targeting and interaction with Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2). Our findings establish FATE1 as a cancer-selective regulator of mitochondrial dynamics that antagonizes fission and preserves network integrity under cytotoxic stress, revealing a potential mechanism by which tumor cells evade mitochondria-driven apoptotic signaling.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Combining whole-genome resequencing with population-level genotype-phenotype association analysis, we identify genomic regions associated with selection on dispersal. Identified candidate genes were significantly enriched for functions related to neuronal structure and function, as well as chemosensory behaviour and mating, suggesting that variation in dispersal is mediated by neural and chemosensory pathways. Our results demonstrate that dispersal propensity has a polygenic basis and support an interaction between dispersal and mating ecology in this system.

During subsequent exocytosis, the viral outer membrane fuses with the plasma membrane but retains a distinct identity, beneath which septins and clathrin are independently recruited. Clathrin enhances actin-dependent viral spread, while septins suppress virus release from the cell. We found that septin filaments run parallel to the inner surface of the plasma membrane beneath virions attached to the cell surface.

E.; Howard, S. R.; Agustin-Pavon, C.", "abstract": "Background: Mutations in the MECP2 gene, encoding the epigenetic reader Methyl-CpG binding protein 2, are the main cause of Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Besides severe symptoms such as profound intellectual disability, loss of speech and motor skills and epilepsy, loss of function of MECP2 has been associated with pubertal dysregulation, but the biological mechanisms leading to this remain unclear. Methods: We first carried out a patient survey to assess pubertal timing in a sample of Spanish patients with Rett syndrome. Second, using a mouse model of Rett, in which males are hemizygous and females heterozygous for Mecp2 loss of function mutation, we assessed the onset and progression of puberty, together with increase in body weight and onset of neurological symptoms in post-weaning mice until puberty. In brain samples of young adult mice, we analysed hypothalamic Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons by immunofluorescent labelling, and in plasma samples measured circulating GnRH and testosterone concentrations. Finally, we analysed testosterone dependent arginine-vasopressin circuits. Results: Our data in patients are in agreement with previous reports showing that a subset of female patients with Rett syndrome experience a delayed timing of menarche. Further, in our mouse model we found delayed puberty in Mecp2CD1-null males, associated with a reduced rate of weight gain, but with puberty onset occurring at a lower body weight than in wildtype controls. Despite later puberty onset, Mecp2CD1-null male mice were found to have an increased number of GnRH neurons, but displayed lower levels of circulating reproductive hormones. Consequently, Mecp2CD1-null males have deficient testosterone-dependent arginine-vasopressin innervation. In female Mecp2CD1-heterozygous mice, we found no overall significant differences in pubertal development or GnRH neurons, albeit in a subset of mice with early neurological symptoms, we found lower body weight, and a trend to delayed vaginal opening but precocious first oestrous, attributable to variable phenotypic penetrance. Conclusions: Our data supports that MECP2 is essential for typical pubertal development, with complete loss of Mecp2 in a male murine model resulting in abnormalities of pubertal timing with an observed increase in hypothalamic GnRH neurons.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify an adaptive response where G1-cyclin-Cdc28Cdk1 participates in error correction via the augmentation of its kinase activity towards substrates that activate Cdc42. The response involves temporal and spatial cell cycle reconfiguration via extended G1 cyclin expression, nucleocytoplasmic rerouting and signaling. However, this strategy has a cost: if the defect is irreparable, high G1-cyclin levels enforce inexorable cell cycle commitment in the absence of a daughter cell, generating multinucleate cells.

Although light varies greatly within coral colonies, the effects of this spatial heterogeneity on the subcellular organization and energy storage of symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) remain poorly understood. Here, we combined microscale measurements of light and oxygen across both light-exposed upper regions and shaded basal regions of a Favites abdita colony with three-dimensional subcellular imaging using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). Our multi-scale approach revealed subcellular heterogeneity among symbiont populations, suggesting different cell cycle stages and physiological states across a spatial stratification in the coral. Subcellular morphometrics revealed that symbiont cells at the top of the colony were twice more voluminous than those at the shaded base with similar plastid volume occupancy. Compared to symbionts at the top of the colony, symbionts in the basal region accumulated nearly three times more starch relative to their cell volume. These findings show that light gradients within coral colonies shape symbiont morphology and energy storage patterns, with important implications for coral stress tolerance and resilience.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

To this end, one key innovation compared to mitosis is the monopolar orientation of the pairs of sister kinetochores required for the proper separation of homologs at meiosis I. How monopolar orientation is imposed is unclear and seems to vary in eukaryotes. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically designed to identify the molecular components imposing monopolar orientation, based on mutants ability to restore fertility in spo11 osd1 haploid plants. We show that monopolar orientation involves all four cohesin subunits (REC8, SCC3, SMC1, SMC3), the cohesion establishment factors CTF18 and DCC1, and the cohesin protectors SGO1/2 and PANS1, the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C, and the desumoylase SPF2. The mutants show bipolar orientation of achiasmatic chromosomes, but monopolar orientation is maintained in the presence of crossovers despite splitting of sister kinetochores at metaphase I and reduced levels of cohesin. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that cohesion establishment and protection, kinetochore function, and deSUMOylation, together with crossovers, enforce monopolar orientation in plants and support a cohesion-driven model of kinetochore orientation at meiosis I that is conserved across kingdoms.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

To overcome these barriers, we developed a segmentation free framework for analyzing multispectral whole slide images (WSIs). By tiling WSIs into fixed sized regions and extracting quantitative tile features, we applied unsupervised machine learning to systematically reveal patterns of tissue organization at scale. This approach preserved spatial context without the need for cell-level delineation, recapitulating expected compartments such as epidermis, adipose, and scab, while also revealing subtle but coherent substructures within stromal and granulation regions. Applied to murine wound healing, the method distinguished wild type from diabetic repair dynamics without prior labels, uncovering both gross and nuanced differences in tissue composition.

Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized paracrine function of the primary cilium in fibroblasts. Conditioned medium from ciliated wild-type NIH/3T3 cells enhanced wound healing in primary cilium-deficient fibroblasts, in contrast to conditioned medium derived from primary cilium-deficient NIH/3T3-Kif3a-KO or NIH/3T3-Dync2h1-KO cells. Fractionation of conditioned medium revealed that the wound healing activity resided predominantly in the 100K x g soluble supernatant (Sup-100K), rather than in extracellular vesicle (EV) fractions. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (14:0) as a key bioactive metabolite enriched in WT-Sup-100K secretome. Supplementation of LPC(14:0) restored wound healing capacity in NIH/3T3-Kif3a-KO cells to levels comparable to WT-Sup-100K treatment. Transcriptomic profiling of target cells revealed that WT-Sup-100K upregulated expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes, including Ogn, Igf2, and Mfap4, while EVs modestly enhanced early ECM remodeling via induction of Nid2. Together, these findings demonstrate that the primary cilium coordinates a wound healing secretome in fibroblasts through the regulated release of LPC(14:0) and other soluble factors that activate ECM-remodeling pathways in recipient cells.

The role of auxins in promoting plant growth has been extensively investigated. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of indole-3-acetamide (IAM), an auxin precursor, results in the suppression of plant growth, particularly primary root elongation. This observation led to the hypothesis that IAM or an IAM derivative exerts negative growth regulatory effects. However, the molecular mechanism by which IAM inhibits plant growth remains largely unelucidated. To gain deeper insight into the molecular mode of action of IAM, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a highly diverse collection of 166 wild Arabidopsis accessions from the Iberian Peninsula. Consequently, we identified several genomic regions associated with a reduced response to IAM under controlled in vitro conditions, which included ABA3 and GA2ox2 as candidate genes. Sequence analyses, transcriptomics studies, and comparison of three-dimensional models generated for ABA3 proteins encoded by the two major natural alleles identified in the collection of wild accessions suggested that IAM-triggered inhibition of primary root elongation is closely associated with the formation of abscisic acid (ABA) in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Finally, physiological characterization of mutants for those candidate genes further corroborated that IAM activates ABA signaling. Our results demonstrate that IAM is intricately linked with ABA biosynthesis and signaling, thereby elucidating a novel node in plant hormone crosstalk.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Little is known, however, about how chloroplast homeostasis is maintained during stress responses that place high metabolic and bioenergetic demands on the cell. As a chloroplast-derived retrograde signal, jasmonate (JA) promotes broad-spectrum immunity by triggering the degradation of JAZ transcriptional repressors that act in the nucleus to control chloroplast metabolism. Here, we manipulated JAZ abundance to investigate how chloroplast integrity and function is maintained at high levels of defense. A jaz decuple mutant (jazD) lacking 10 of 13 JAZs exhibited strong growth-defense antagonism without loss of photosynthetic efficiency. Treatment of jazD with the JA-receptor agonist coronatine triggered rapid loss of chlorophyll and the turnover of chloroplast proteins and lipids, leading to the collapse of photosynthetic activity and cell death. These findings were supported by global transcript and metabolite profiling over a time course of coronatine treatment. Genetic screens identified MYC2 and the JAZ-destabilizing F-box protein, COI1, as positive regulators of coronatine-induced chloroplast dismantling in jazD plants. These results demonstrate how the progressive loss of JAZ repression drives a continuum of MYC2-dependent growth-defense tradeoffs, including disassembly of the photosynthetic apparatus as a terminal response. In highlighting the critical role for JAZ proteins in maintaining chloroplast integrity at high levels of defense, our results provide insight into the general mechanism by which jasmonate governs chloroplast metabolism to balance growth and stress responses.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

This alkalinization is essential for immune signaling mediated by diverse plasma membrane-localized receptor kinases (RKs) through modulation of ligand-receptor interactions. Notably, RKs transduce elicitor-triggered signaling via BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), which inhibits AHA activity by disrupting AHA-GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR (GRF) interactions through a conserved phosphorylation event.

High levels of PET-detectable A{beta} are widely thought to be the first imaging marker, with structural brain changes detectable on MRI scans thought to occur later. We combined 4570 longitudinal MRIs and 1684 A{beta} PET scans from three cognitively healthy cohorts to test the difference in cortical thickness and its change between those that subsequently converted to be A{beta}-positive or stayed A{beta}-negative, using MRIs acquired exclusively in the years before conversion. We found those that subsequently developed elevated A{beta} levels show both thicker cortex and less cortical thinning, even when the last MRI used to estimate their thickness trajectories was acquired at least seven years before conversion. Many effects remained when accounting for quantitative A{beta} levels, suggesting some cortical thickness effects may be partly independent of A{beta}. Differences in cortical thickness and its change between converters and A{beta}-negative individuals showed moderate alignment with patterns of A{beta} deposition, and the timing of thickness changes tracked the temporal progression of A{beta} accumulation. Thus, if amyloid is AD, we show that high levels of PET-detectable amyloid are not the first imaging marker of AD, as cortical thickness changes can be traced years before pathological amyloid.

EEG waveform patterns--rhythmic and irregular oscillations and transient patterns of sharp waves or spikes--are potential phenotypical biomarkers, reflecting genotype-specific neural activity. This is especially relevant to diagnosing epilepsy without direct seizure observations, which is common in clinical settings, as well as in animal models, which often have subtle neurological phenotypes without overt epilepsy. Herein, we investigate genotypic prediction from long-term EEG signals of freely behaving mice belonging to six groups defined by the presence or absence of a neurological disease-genotype (TSC1 gene knockout) in three different inbred strains with distinct genetic backgrounds. The potential complexity of genotype-related EEG patterns motivates a machine learning approach to automatically extract time-series descriptors, such as waveforms or spectral content, as biomarkers. We propose a machine learning approach to predict the genotypes of individual mice from the occurrence counts of waveforms that approximate short windows of the EEG. That is, a dictionary of waveforms is optimized to approximate windows from each genotype, and the vectors of waveform occurrence counts are the features for predicting genotypes via logistic regression models. Across two-fold cross-validation of the waveform dictionary learning, and leave-one-individual-out genotype prediction, we find that waveform counts pooled over multiple hour segments enable reliable prediction of mouse strain with an accuracy of 70% (chance rate of 38%), and for two of the three strains, DBA2 and C57B6, strain-specific classifiers reliably determined the epilepsy-genotype (TSC1 gene knockout) at a 67% sensitivity with a 100% specificity for DBA2 and 67% specificity for C57B6.

While RIFT has proven valuable for studying visuospatial attention, it has so far relied on costly projector systems, typically in combination with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The recent emergence of high-speed organic light-emitting diode (OLED) monitors for consumers suggests that RIFT may also be feasible with much more accessible hardware. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstrating successful RIFT using a consumer-grade 480 Hz OLED monitor in combination with electroencephalography (EEG). We also share practical recommendations for achieving precise stimulus timing at 480 Hz with minimal frame drops. In a central fixation task, participants viewed a tapered disc stimulus flickering either centrally or peripherally. Luminance was modulated sinusoidally at 60 Hz or 64 Hz, frequencies at which the flicker was barely visible. Photodiode recordings confirmed that the monitor delivered accurate frame timing with few dropped frames. Cross-coherence analysis between occipital EEG channels and a photodiode revealed robust, frequency-specific neural tagging responses for central stimuli at both frequencies. In comparison, weaker coherence was observed for 60 Hz peripheral flicker.

We conducted a population-level artificial selection experiment with the unicellular green microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana at both a benign temperature (25) and a mildly cold temperature (15). Four artificial selection regimes were established: random selection, selection for high biomass (i.e., cell yield), selection for high lipid production, and rotation between high-biomass and high-lipid selection. We did not observe significant differences among the four selection regimes in evolutionary changes of algal cell yield or lipid yield, suggesting that natural selection at the individual level had dominated the evolutionary changes in our experiment. Compared with the ancestral strain, selection lines that had evolved at 15 typically exhibited increased cell yield and reduced lipid content per cell, indicating a trade-off relationship. However, substantial increases in cell yield may compensate for the reduction in lipid content per cell. Notably, three out of 16 selection lines showed > 1-fold increase in cell yield, and one exhibited > 1-fold increase in population-level lipid yield. Selection lines that had evolved at 25 displayed even greater increases in both cell and lipid yields, with a positive relationship between cell yield and lipid content per cell.

Coral populations from six characterized thermal reef sites were subjected to short-term heat exposure to determine bleaching thresholds (ED50), using Visual Bleaching Scores and experimental Degree Heating Days. As in other studies, we found a wide range of heat tolerance within and among species. The massive starlet coral (Siderastrea siderea) exhibited the highest resistance to thermal stress, while the brain coral (Pseudodiploria strigosa) was the most susceptible. The mountainous star coral (Orbicella faveolata) and mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) showed intermediate heat resistance that varied by site.

However, inferring these interactions from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data remains challenging due to data compositionality, limited temporal resolution, and the inability of traditional correlation-based methods to capture directionality or mechanistic influence. Microbial communities dynamically restructure in response to environmental and internal pressures, yet the ecological mechanisms guiding these transitions remain elusive. Here, we present a novel network inference framework that reconstructs directed, signed, and weighted microbial interaction networks from cross-sectional compositional data, without relying on predefined dynamic models or time-series sampling. By estimating asymmetric slopes and applying a perturbation-informed inference strategy, the method infers ecological interaction polarity and strength while accounting for compositional constraints. Applied to a synthetic gut microbiome dataset, the framework revealed taxon-specific trajectories, directional ecological dependencies, and hierarchically organized interaction networks. Persistent Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) motifs identified keystone initiators, while other taxa emerged as resilient, high-connectivity hubs. A quadrant-based network visualization was introduced to enhance interpretability by distinguishing ecological influencers from responders based on interaction flow. The inferred networks demonstrated strong alignment between interaction polarity and abundance trends, revealing a robust ecological principle polarity-driven succession whereby the net balance of cooperative and antagonistic interactions predicts species abundance trajectories and community dynamics.

(2024) found that plant mutualisms with mycorrhizae, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and animal pollinators limit island colonization, weakening the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) on oceanic islands. Here, we examine whether ants and plants engaged in a common defensive mutualism mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFN) are similarly under-represented on oceanic islands and whether this mutualism also weakens the LDG on islands. We used global trait and occurrence databases to compare ant and plant species richness between oceanic islands and their likely source mainlands for taxa that do and do not interact mutualistically via EFNs. The species richness of EFN-visiting ants and EFN-bearing plants positively covary across islands and plants with EFNs and EFN-visiting ants are significantly over-represented on islands, equally so across latitudes. Thus, EFNs facilitate rather than limit colonization on islands, and not all mutualisms dampen the LDG on islands.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Narrow genetic base and lack of sufficient resistance to M. vitrata in existing cowpea germplasm, make them less effective in managing M. vitrata populations. To address this challenge, a transgenic approach is explored. In this study, we develop transgenic cowpea with enhanced resistance to M. vitrata by overexpressing a synthetic cry1Ab gene, driven by constitutive CaMV35S viral promoter, in an Indian cowpea cultivar. High expression of Cry1Ab was detected in leaves and pods. Bioassays with M. vitrata and Helicoverpa armigera larvae demonstrated significant resistance of transgenic lines to these lepidopteran pests. The transgenic lines exhibited reduced pod damage, decreased larval feeding, and increased insect mortality compared to non-transgenic controls. NMR analysis demonstrated absence of any new metabolites in transgenic plants. Furthermore, these transgenic lines showed no penalty on growth and development. The transgenic lines exhibited no observable phenotypic drawbacks, indicating their promise for sustainable agricultural practices. Our findings suggest that these transgenic cowpea lines could offer broad-spectrum protection against these pests, providing an effective pest management solution.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

C.; O'Halloran, T. V.; Strenkert, D.", "abstract": "Carbon and zinc (Zn) metabolism are intrinsically connected in phototrophs, as crucial components involved in CO2 assimilation, like carbonic anhydrases, are highly abundant Zn proteins. Utilizing these and other proteins, the eukaryotic green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can maintain phototrophic growth in low CO2 environments by inducing a carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). In this work we show that Chlamydomonas dynamically increases its Zn content to accommodate the higher intracellular Zn demand in low CO2 environments. This increase requires the presence of Cia5, a major regulator of the CCM in Chlamydomonas. How Cia5 regulates expression of thousands of low CO2-inducible genes remains enigmatic, its transcript and protein abundance is unchanged in different CO2 environments, even in the presence of an additional reduced carbon source, acetate. We show here that the Cia5 protein is not present in Zn-limitation, despite CIA5 transcription being unchanged. We used a CRISPR knock-in approach to express Cia5-HA from its endogenous locus and used two independent Cia5-HA expressing strains for affinity purification and identified a protein belonging to a conserved family of metal binding GTPases, ZNG3, as a constitutive interaction partner. Like Cia5, ZNG3 is constitutively expressed, co-expressed with Cia5 along the diurnal cycle and is Cia5-dependently induced in low CO2 environments. Surprisingly, zng3 mutants do not phenocopy cia5 mutants and grow well in low CO2 conditions. Instead, zng3 mutants are unable to grow like wildtype if excess carbon is available in the form of high CO2 or acetate. Transcriptomics of wildtype and zng3 mutants grown with different carbon sources revealed that transcriptional induction of the majority of genes involved in the CCM is maintained in low CO2 grown zng3 mutants, while the degree of induction in a subset of LCI genes is reduced (HLA3, CAH4 and CAH5). Genes encoding proteins involved in plastid quality control were induced in zng3 mutants grown on acetate and high CO2, as well as other, related metallochaperones. We hypothesize that Zn trafficking towards the plastid is mis-regulated in zng3 mutants resulting in protein mis-metalation and unfolding. Taken together, we propose that ZNG3 and Cia5 coordinate Zn and CO2 metabolism, affecting intracellular Zn trafficking and modulate the CO2 response.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

In plants, sucrose stimulates growth and developmental progression via the signalling sugar trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) which reflects sucrose availability. T6P acts, at least partly, by inhibiting the protein kinase SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING 1 (SNF1)-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identify a group of catalytically inactive T6P synthase (TPS) proteins, TPS5/6/7, as important factors for coupling the T6P signal to SnRK1 activity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, lack of TPS5/6/7 causes severe growth defects, particularly in roots. This is accompanied by a metabolic signature that is suggestive of T6P insensitivity and impaired sucrose utilization. Using a combination of genetics, SnRK1 activity assays, and imaging, we demonstrate that the growth defects of the tps5/6/7 mutant are due to SnRK1 misregulation and are reverted by knocking-down SnRK1 in this background. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further show that T6P promotes the interaction of TPS proteins with SnRK1 in a highly specific and dose-dependent manner. Our results support a model where TPS proteins act as T6P sensors, inhibiting non-nuclear SnRK1 activity when sucrose is abundant to promote biosynthetic processes and growth.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach to investigate how variations in soil composition affect the grapevine holobiont. Grape plantlets were grown in three distinct soil types, namely sand, peat, and peat-manure. To further assess how variation in soil and root conditions affects the holobiont response, we included treatments involving soil autoclaving and root surface sterilisation across all soil types. We found that soil type significantly influences leaf multielement composition and concentration, while also shaping the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the plant rhizosphere. This shift led to changes in taxa involved in nitrogen fixation, biocontrol, and pathogenicity. Autoclaving soils consistently reduced bacterial diversity across all soil types, whereas fungal communities were less affected. In contrast, thermal treatment of roots had only a minor impact on microbial community composition but did induce transcriptional changes in the root and altered leaf macronutrient concentrations. Our findings indicate that differences in soil composition reshape the entire root-soil continuum, ultimately affecting plant physiology at multiple levels from root function to leaf nutrient status. This highlights that the soil is not a passive growth medium but a key determinant of grape holobiont structure and function.

We show that CDM1 affects several meiotic processes, including chromosome recombination, condensation, and cytokinesis. CDM1 localizes to dynamic cytoplasmic foci that closely associate with components of processing bodies and stress granules, forming three-phase condensate assemblies. Biochemical and cellular assays reveal that CDM1 is an RNA-binding protein with an intrinsic ability to drive the formation of ribonucleoprotein condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDM1 binds mRNAs present in prophase I and represses their translation until later meiotic stages, coinciding with the disassembly of CDM1 condensates.

Summary Answer This study demonstrates that several water-based lubricants can effectively deliver bioactive HCA, and that a dimethicone-containing silicone lubricant can be modified into a stable emulsion suitable for antibody delivery. What Is Known Already The HCA-based vaginal film ZB-06 was shown to be safe and effective in a Phase I clinical trial for female contraception. Male contraceptive options remain limited. Using sexual lubricants as a delivery platform for HCA represents a novel and practical approach to male contraception. Study Design, Size, Duration We tested the stability of HCA for up to two years in a variety of commercially available sexual lubricants, and its delivery from a penile device using a simulated intercourse model. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods Fourteen commercial lubricants were initially screened for impact on sperm motility and viability, miscibility with HCA solution, and preservation of HCA activity (sperm agglutination test). From these, three water-based and one silicone-based lubricant were selected for further study. The silicone-based product was engineered into a novel emulsion (KY-DE) by incorporating 6% w/w PEG-10 dimethicone and 0.005% v/v TWEEN-20 for HCA integration. Formulations were tested for HCA functional stability and contraceptive efficacy over time using kinetic sperm agglutination assays and a capillary tube sperm penetration test. A novel simulated intercourse model was developed using a 3D-printed penile device and a vaginal analog (Fleshlight (R)). HCA-lube was applied to the penis, and concentrations of HCA delivered to the vagina during intercourse were measured by ELISA and sperm agglutination assay. Safety evaluations were conducted using a vaginal tissue model (EpiVaginal, VEC-100-FT). Viability (MTT assay), tight junction integrity (TEER), and cytokine release were assessed after application of HCA-lube. Main Results and the Role of Chance All selected lubricants were nontoxic and did not affect HCA's ability to agglutinate sperm. In the capillary tube sperm penetration assay, HCA-formulated lubricants significantly impaired sperm penetration; few motile sperm penetrated past a depth of 1 cm after 90 minutes in the HCA-lubricants vs >80 in most of the untreated lubricants. Importantly, the simulated intercourse assay confirmed successful delivery of HCA to the vagina. Water-based lubricants delivered an average of 24plus-or-minus sign 8.4 {micro}g/mL of HCA, the commercial silicone lubricant 11 {+/-} 5.2 {micro}g/mL, and the KY-DE emulsion 27.4 {+/-} 22.4 {micro}g/mL. Furthermore, the formulations did not compromise tissue integrity or viability, or induce significant inflammatory responses. Large Scale Data Not applicable. Limitations, Reasons for Caution While these in vitro results support the feasibility of using lubricants as HCA delivery vehicles, translation into clinical application requires further validation and clinical trials. Wider Implications of the Findings This work presents a new direction in male contraceptive development, leveraging the widespread use of personal lubricants to introduce antibody-based, reversible, on-demand contraception. Engineering a silicone-based lubricant that retains HCA activity under varied conditions and ensures higher mucosal delivery could further advance this approach.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

CCIs are more co-expressed than any other type of intracellular interactions and, likewise, they are the protein-protein interaction (PPI) class that is more co-evolved in sequenced genomes. Similar trends of stricter regulation and evolutionary pressure are observed when comparing extracellular vs intracellular interactions mediated by G protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), whose ligand interactions are also characterized by a higher mutational burden in later tumor stages when considering somatic mutations associated with tumor clonal evolution. CCIs undergo the most extensive rewiring of their tumor co-expression networks relative to healthy tissues, more so than any other PPI type, with a set of CCI hubs highly conserved across multiple tumor tissues, and a higher diversity on healthy ones. Cancer rewiring is also associated with the formation of recurrent circuits of co-expressed CCI pairs, represented by enriched network motifs such as triad or tetrad cliques. These act as integrative hotspots to facilitate the crosstalk of distinct processes and the interaction of the cancer cell with its tumor microenvironment (TME). Remarkably, many CCI circuits are significantly associated with patient survival and are predictive of patient response to immunotherapy. CCI circuits mapping to Allograft rejection and Inflammatory response inform immunotherapy response prediction, while those related to Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition are associated with poorer prognosis.

It enables researchers to characterize ecological structure, compare microbial communities, assess environmental or host-driven heterogeneity, and track longitudinal shifts over time. Although many diversity indices were originally developed with practical goals in mind, they lack a unified framework to ensure theoretical rigor and validity. This gap makes it challenging for researchers to evaluate and select appropriate beta diversity measures for microbiome analyses, potentially leading to biased analyses and invalid conclusions. To bridge the persistent knowledge gaps, we systematically evaluate the commonly used beta diversity measures according to key mathematical properties, including whether they are true metrics, conform to Euclidean geometry, and satisfy conditional negative definiteness. We show that their violations can compromise downstream analyses such as PCoA, PERMANOVA, and kernel-based tests. In addition, drawing on mathematical consensus, we introduce a novel four-category classification of beta diversity measures: scale difference, difference scale, Hamming difference, and distribution difference. Complementing this framework, we build diagnostic tools for assessing Euclidean validity and develop remedial strategies that correct problematic dissimilarity matrices while preserving ordination structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these solutions using real-world microbiome datasets.

For many patients with advanced disease, current chemotherapy regimens offer only modest benefit despite significant toxicity and surgical resection, the only treatment option with curative potential, is not possible. Therefore, while new treatments are much needed, diagnosing patients at an earlier disease stage when surgery remains possible and the window of opportunity for treatment response is longer will be critical to improving patient outcomes. In this regard, the identification of biomarkers from biospecimens that can be easily sampled from patients remains the focus of considerable research, however success has not been forthcoming. Using a suite of novel genetically defined murine isogenic models of early PDAC, engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we sought to address whether loss-of-function mutations in common driver genes, and thus the genetic heterogeneity inherent to the disease, may represent an important confounding factor in the identification of a one-size-fits-all biomarker suitable for early detection. Focusing on the multi-omics analysis of blood, we show that both loss of Cdkn2a and / or Smad4 on the background of a KrasG12D Trp53-/- genotype has profound effects on the profile of differentially expressed RNA species including protein coding RNAs, lncRNAs, snoRNAs, scRNAs, snRNAs and miRNAs, and on plasma protein expression, when compared to both healthy controls and chemically induced pancreatitis. In addition, we find that loss of Smad4, a genomic event that occurs following progression from PanIN to PDAC, substantially limits the availability of blood biomarkers. These findings identify the need to move towards genotype-specific biomarker signatures and uncover a potential role for Smad4 loss in limiting opportunities for the early detection of pancreatic cancer.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Y.; Socol, Y.", "abstract": "The relevance of ionizing radiation effects is high in the field of radiation oncology. Namely, radiation toxicity is a crucial limiting factor in dose administration. To address this concern, by adopting an empirical approach it is possible to uncover certain truths that might not be attainable through rigorous biophysical analysis, as the human body represents a complex system. That is, even possessing complete knowledge of interactions between its elementary units (cells) may prove insufficient in explaining the overall system's reactions. An empirical mathematical model for adaptive biological response to time-dependent irradiation of arbitrary time-shapes was developed. The model was based on the damped-oscillator analogy from physics. The research reported here is a generalization of the damped-oscillator model by introducing a biologically relevant inverted Gompertzian-like shape, rather commonly employed in adaptive response modeling, with practical implications for biologists and oncologists. Based on the developed model, a practical approach is suggested to improve radiation therapy protocols by radiation training (priming) through administration of low, gradually increasing total-body irradiation doses. Following this priming, individuals should be capable of withstanding higher therapeutic doses, maybe up to five times the regular amount.

While the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a known regulator of dietary salt-induced hormonal responses, the impact of adrenal cortisol remains unclear. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis in individuals (n=292) consuming a random diet. Dietary salt intake positively correlated with urinary cortisol and inversely correlated with plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone regulating phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Controlled salt diets in healthy individuals confirmed a dose-dependent increase in urinary cortisol and suppression of plasma FGF23. In mice, oral corticosterone, a cortisol analogue, reduced circulating FGF23 levels. RNA-seq analysis of corticosterone-treated MC3T3 osteoblasts identified suppression of FGF23 via glucocorticoid receptor activation, anti-inflammatory pathways, and reduced osteoblast activity.

A total of 135 goats were randomly selected, comprising 77 Landim and 60 Pafuri animals. Racial characteristics were assessed through visual inspection, while morphometric traits were measured using a zoometric tape. Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-tests were performed at a 5% significance level using SPSS version 27. In terms of racial traits, all Pafuri goats exhibited a convex facial profile, whereas Landim goats showed both convex (57.9%) and concave (42.1%) profiles. Approximately 75% of the goats presented a uniform coat colour. Morphometric comparisons revealed that Landim goats had higher average values for horn length (mean difference, MD: 0.21 cm), withers height (MD: 0.14 cm), and body length (MD: 0.24 cm). In contrast, Pafuri goats had greater head length (MD: 0.18 cm), head width (MD: 0.11 cm), ear length (MD: 0.09 cm), and thoracic perimeter (MD: 0.26 cm). Regarding zoometric indices, Landim goats recorded higher body (1.71), cephalic (0.31), and thoracic (1.31) index values, while Pafuri goats exhibited a slightly higher proportionality index (0.40). The morpho-structural differences identified between Landim and Pafuri goats demonstrate distinct phenotypic profiles that can support breed characterization. These results provide a valuable baseline for future genetic studies and contribute to conservation and sustainable utilization strategies for indigenous goat populations in Mozambique.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Jahanshad, N.; Thompson, P. M.; Hulshoff Pol, H. E.", "abstract": "White matter in the human brain is known to play a critical role in facilitating communication between different brain regions. White matter microstructure is often quantified using fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI, and is often considered a key measure of neural efficiency that is positively associated with motor and cognitive functioning. While lifespan trajectories of FA have been well studied in cross-sectional designs, it remains less clear how FA changes longitudinally with age across the lifespan, and whether the rates of change are influenced by genetic variation. We systematically reviewed the evidence of white matter changes, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging longitudinally across the lifespan, and the genetic influences on this change. Searches were conducted in Medline, PsycInfo, and EMBASE up to August 2023 with terms related to DTI/FA and longitudinal/change. Following this, genetic-related search terms were applied to the results and the search was broadened to include other measures of white matter change. Our systematic search resulted in 29 studies that met our criteria. In addition, 14 studies investigated genetic influences on FA change rates across the lifespan. A meta-regression using a thin-plate spline model was conducted to examine annual whole-brain FA change as a function of age. Across childhood and adolescence, FA increased, and the rate of increase slowed into early adulthood. Between ages 20 and 35, changes in FA were not statistically significant. This was followed by a significant decline in FA between ages 36 and 50. The decreases plateaued between ages 51 and 61, and then continued at a slightly slower rate towards the upper end of the age range assessed (77 years). Average FA change per year relative to baseline assessment reached a maximum of +1.1% during development, and -0.6% per year, during ageing. Significant heritability was found for change in local but not global FA during development. During ageing, common variants in genes that have been related to increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders (APOE, HTT, MAPT) were associated in some studies with accelerated local FA decreases over time. In conclusion, there are changes in white matter microstructure within individuals across the lifespan, with increases during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, followed by a period of relative stability during early to mid-adulthood, and subsequent gradual declines from midlife onwards. Evidence is emerging for genetic influences on white matter changes over time, shaping individual trajectories.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

The current study aims to compare how sleep and retrieval training impact the endorsement of semantically similar and different lures, as well as their episodic recollection using the parietal old/new effect on the late positive component (LPC) in subjects' EEG. Thirty subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) attended four sessions where they learnt different sets of 104 object-word pairs and completed one of four 120-minute memory interventions: retrieval training (i.e., cued recall practice), restudy (i.e., pair re-exposure), a nap opportunity, or a wakeful rest. EEG was recorded while subjects were tested on their recognition accuracy in an old/new paradigm with similar- and different-object lures. Our results revealed that retrieval training, but not sleep, lead to greater accuracy for identifying old pairs, but worse similar-lure discrimination. Whilst the parietal old/new effect did not differ between conditions, retrieval had lower LPC amplitudes for similar- than different-object false alarms, whilst restudy demonstrated the opposite. Sleep and wake demonstrated no differences in LPC amplitudes between hits and different false alarm types. Together, our study demonstrates evidence for gist-abstraction across retrieval training, and a task-relevant selective maintenance of episodic details across sleep. These results challenge theories that retrieval training replicates sleep-based consolidation mechanisms, instead acting as a fast route to semanticization regardless of the context.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

We previously developed a mouse model in which TDP-43 is selectively deleted from motor neurons (ChAT-Cre;Tardbpf/f) that mimics the early stages of ALS. Here, we demonstrate that intravenous delivery of a blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeable AAV capsid expressing our rationally designed splicing repressor CTR (AAV-PHP.eB-CTR) in symptomatic ChAT-Cre;Tardbpf/f mice markedly slowed disease progression and prevented paralysis. Systemic delivery of AAV-PHP.eB-CTR led to transduction of ~80% of spinal motor neurons, repression of TDP-43-associated cryptic exons within motor neurons expressing CTR, and attenuation of motor neuron loss. Notably, the addition of the TARDBP 3UTR autoregulatory element to CTR maintained its expression within a physiological range. In control littermates that received AAV-PHP.eB-CTR and were monitored for >20 months, grip strength and body weight remained normal, and no histopathological abnormalities were observed, underscoring a favorable safety profile for this gene therapy. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept that BBB-crossing AAV delivery of CTR can rescue motor neuron disease through the restoration of TDP-43 function, offering a promising mechanism-based therapeutic strategy for ALS.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Mutations in the gene GBA, which encodes the lysosomal glycoprotein Glucocerebrosidase, are together the most important genetic risk factor for PD and have been associated with lysosomal dysfunction, accumulation of pathological -synuclein as well as major changes in both the levels and properties of lipids. Ambroxol, a small molecule chaperone capable of binding and stabilizing Glucocerebrosidase, was found to revert changes in lipid levels and increase in -synuclein levels due to GBA mutations potentially via restoring lysosomal function. Here, we show that Ambroxol also has a direct effect on -synuclein-lipid co-aggregation by inhibiting the primary nucleation step in the aggregation process. We find that Ambroxol not only displaces -synuclein from negatively charged membranes but also prevents the formation of early -synuclein-lipid coaggregates during primary nucleation.

Here, we tested how commonly used exosporium and spore coat extraction methods, termed EBB, USD, and Laemmli, remove the spore coat and exosporium layers of C. difficile spores. We assessed the impact of these extraction methods on the spore through transmission electron microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, western blotting, and lysozyme triggered cortex degradation. Transmission electron microscopy shows that treatment with EBB and USD, completely remove the spore coat and exosporium layer while leaving decoated spores intact. Western blots revealed differences in the ability to extract spore surface protein markers (CdeC, CdeM, CotA). In addition, lysozyme was able to degrade the cortex in decoated spores regardless of the treatment employed. Western blot analysis of lysozyme treated-decoated spores, reveals that EBB and USD treatment allows for detection and release of the spore core germination protease, GPR.

We measured variation in the carbon isotopes of baobabs (Adansonia spp.) which reflect rainfall in southwest Madagascar. The record indicates a decreasing trend of rainfall over the last 700 years with high variability at a centennial-scale. The duration of wetter periods decreased over time with the wettest periods between 1350 - 1450 CE, after the onset of the Little Ice Age, while the driest period occurred between 1600 - 1750 CE, during the Maunder Minimum. The results suggest that decadal to centennial rainfall variability in southwest Madagascar is dominated by tropical forcing rather than subtropical forcing. Wetter periods are regulated by the movement and migration of easterly winds linked to the Intertropical Convergence Zone, while dry periods are influenced by the effect of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the sea surface temperature variation in the Southwestern Indian Ocean. The Southern Annular Mode is significantly correlated with the record, but its effect was only visible at the beginning of the record around 1300 CE. This evidence provides a new understanding of rainfall across southern Africa and the interaction of global forcing with regional factors. Further investigation is required to improve tree chronology from Southern Hemisphere and understand the migration of the westerlies and its potential future effect on the rainfall in Madagascar.

This study aimed to identify metabolic signatures of CHB-related MASLD and construct a predictive model using untargeted metabolomics integrated with machine learning. Methods: Serum metabolomics was performed on 160 subjects (80 CHB + MASLD and 80 healthy controls). Differential metabolites were identified and analyzed using KEGG enrichment and 4 machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and LASSO). Metabolite-clinical correlations and diagnostic model performance were evaluated. Results: A total of 924 differential metabolites were identified, with significant enrichment in pathways related to the TCA cycle, sphingolipid metabolism, and amino acid turnover. Machine learning prioritized six robust and biologically relevant metabolites - L-aspartic acid, succinic acid, caproic acid, sebacic acid, monomenthyl succinate, and glycolaldehyde, which consistently distinguished CHB + MASLD patients from controls (AUC > 0.75). These metabolites reflect key disruptions in mitochondrial function, lipid oxidation, and redox homeostasis. Integrated models combining metabolomics with clinical indices achieved perfect classification (AUC = 1.000). Conclusion: CHB-associated MASLD is driven by systemic metabolic remodeling centered on mitochondrial overload, oxidative stress, and impaired amino acid metabolism.

Second, using a large, age-diverse adult sample (N = 340, age 18-82), we show that cognitive-perceptual style shifts systematically across the lifespan, with older adults exhibiting more sensory-driven, ASD-like profiles. Third, a total of over 160,000 self-paced reading times reveal that individuals with more sensory-driven styles show heightened sensitivity to lexical predictability, particularly in older age. Fourth, individuals' intrinsic response dynamics, indexed by autocorrelations of reading times, did not covary with cognitive-perceptual style, suggesting a dissociation between linguistic prediction and non-linguistic temporal dynamics. Finally, in a separate experiment (N = 28, age 21-41), individuals with more ASD-like profiles showed reduced adaptation to latent-state volatility in a voice detection task, especially with increasing age.

Similarly, Above- and belowground NPP (26.47 g plant-1), vitamin C (124.65 mg 100 g-1; ), capsaicin content (1.22 %) and SPAD chlorophyll index (48.61) were higher in T4 treatment compared to T0 treatment. Furthermore, regression results showed that ANPP and yield significantly increased with increase the number of leaves (ANPP: R2; = 0.51, p = 0.02; Yield: R2; = 0.34, p = 0.002) and number of flowering (ANPP: R2; = 0.41, p = 0.014; Yield: R2; = 0.42, p = 0.037) as well. Our results suggest that mixed fertilization enhances both productivity and quality traits in chili.

M.", "abstract": "In non-mammalian synapsids, feeding and hearing are closely linked because some jaw bones are involved in both functions. The evolutionary decoupling of these two systems in early mammals likely catalyzed greater specialization of feeding and hearing. Although fossil osteological changes during this process are well documented, the corresponding evolutionary changes to soft tissue anatomy are less certain. The medial pterygoid muscle is a jaw adductor that is central to this evolutionary transition because in many fossil lineages it inserted near or possibly on jaw bones involved in both feeding and hearing. In therians (placentals and marsupials), the medial pterygoid muscle develops medial to Meckel's cartilage and inserts on the mandibular angular process. Similarly, non-mammalian cynodonts are often reconstructed with a medial pterygoid muscle passing medial to the ossified Meckel's cartilage, inserting on the dentary 'angular' (i.e., pseudangular) process. Thus, the traditional interpretation is that the medial pterygoid remained medial to Meckel's cartilage through the evolutionary transitions from early cynodonts to therians. Here we highlight issues with that interpretation: the medial pterygoid muscle inserts lateral (not medial) to Meckel's cartilage in monotremes and, presumably, early mammal groups (e.g., spalacotherioids) that lacked an angular process. This suggests at least two possible explanatory hypotheses: 1) the medial pterygoid muscle is evolutionarily labile, shifting in position relative to Meckel's cartilage multiple times or 2) the medial pterygoid muscle did not insert on the pseudangular process of non-mammalian cynodonts and instead inserted on the mandibular medial ridge, dorsal to Meckel's cartilage. We advocate for the latter hypothesis, proposed by Patterson (1956), which suggests that the medial pterygoid did not shift medial to Meckel's cartilage until the complete separation of the ear and jaw in cladotherians (therians and close relatives), with the shift in position possibly triggering the evolution of the therian angular process as an insertion site. Patterson's hypothesis is in line with a growing body of evidence that indicate concomitant evolutionary changes of muscles, ears, and jaws at the cladotherian node were important catalysts for the evolution of hearing and feeding specializations in extant mammals.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

HPAI viruses readily exchange gene segments with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses via reassortment, a mechanism that facilitates pronounced phenotypic change. Observations suggest changes in the seasonality and host range of panzootic viruses, however, data on the role of reassortment in determining such features are limited. Using phylodynamic approaches, we describe the emergence of the panzootic lineage and using a novel global genotype classification system we describe the subsequent emergence and global structuring of genotypes generated by reassortment. Focusing on evolutionary dynamics in Europe, we show reassortment has produced high fitness genotypes with enhanced capacity for transmission and further we show such advantages can be host-dependent, contrasting successful generalist genotypes with a specialist lineage (EA-2022-BB) adapted to birds of the order Charadriiformes. Experimental investigation of NS1-mediated shutoff indicates this Charadriiformes-specialist does not inhibit host cellular gene expression and hamper the defences of more typical hosts such as water- and land-fowl. We attribute this primarily to variation at position 127 of the NS1 protein. Our results emphasise that reassortment has driven phenotypic change, affected viral fitness, and caused diversification of host specificity and seasonality. Such factors should be considered in studies that seek to identify drivers of HPAI spread and map spillover risk. Additionally, relaxation of host specialisation, ecological diversification, and potential endemicity in atypical host populations present new reassortment opportunities that could result in further novel phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Building on recent advances in tissue engineering, we here leverage human colonic organoids (colonoids) to investigate the Ef's mechanisms of mucosal surface colonization across space and time. Using high-resolution microscopy, we visualized Ef growth within the natively formed colonic mucus layer in colonoids. Leveraging a custom perfusion chamber, we tracked Ef growth within the mucus of live colonoids over time under flow, which revealed specific colonization strategies, including biofilm-like microcolony formation. To identify Ef fitness determinants in this niche, we implemented transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) in the natively formed mucus of live colonoids. This approach revealed a large fitness rearrangement compared to typical liquid culture, mainly involving metabolic activity and regulatory response during mucosal colonization, as well as factors that may contribute to colony formation at the mucosal surface.

The human gut Bacteroidales harbor three distinct antagonistic Type VI secretion systems (T6SS), one of which is present only in Bacteroides fragilis, known as the GA3 T6SS. Although this is the best studied of the three T6SSs, little is known about how it is regulated. The gene upstream of the GA3 T6SS locus encodes a TetR family transcriptional regulator (TetRGA3), which we show represses expression of the GA3 T6SS locus. The gene immediately upstream and divergently transcribed from tetRGA3, designated here as lgsGA3, encodes a product of the -oxoamine synthase family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes with structural homology to the CqsA autoinducer synthase of the CAI-1 quorum sensing system of Vibrio spp. When lgsGA3 is deleted, transcription of the GA3 T6SS locus is repressed in a TetR-dependent manner. Strains synthesizing LgsGA3 produce a molecule present in the supernatant that likely serves as the TetRGA3 ligand, overcoming TetR transcriptional repression of the GA3 T6SS. We show that GA3 T6SS-specific immunity genes present on two acquired immunity defense islands are also regulated by LgsGA3 coordinating expression of GA3 T6SS antagonism with protection from competitor GA3 T6SS toxins. Production and firing of the GA3 T6SS and subsequent antagonism occurs in bacteria deleted for lgsGA3 when grown with bacteria containing this gene or their supernatants. These data show that the GA3 T6SS is regulated by a small molecule acting through TetRGA3 allowing the bacteria to coordinate antagonistic and protective systems.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Using RNA-Seq, we identified the CmrR and CmrT-dependent transcriptional differences in rough and smooth colonies. Further analysis showed that CmrT, but not CmrR, is required for differential expression of most of the genes. Two CmrT-regulated genes, herein named mrpA and mrpB, were together sufficient for restoring all CmrT-dependent invitro phenotypes in a cmrT mutant and alleviating selection of cmr phase ON cells during growth on an agar surface. MrpA and MrpB are uncharacterized proteins with no known function but are highly conserved in C. difficile. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify interacting partners, we found that MrpA interacts with the septum-site determining protein MinD and several other proteins involved in cell division and cell shape determination. Ectopic expression of mrpAB resulted in atypical cell division, consistent with MrpAB interference with MinD function. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism by which phase variation of CmrRST modulates colony morphology and motility: in cmr phase ON cells, CmrT-mediated expression of mrpAB interferes with normal cell division resulting elongated cells that enable expansion of the population across a surface while limiting swimming motility.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Such approaches risk obscuring critical, non-linear transitions and sex-specific trajectories that may better capture the biology of aging.

Insight into this challenge may be gained through a better understanding of evolutionary responses to past climate change. The rear edges of species' distributions are typically relict populations persisting in former glacial refugia at warmer range limits. As such, they form natural laboratories to study the evolutionary outcomes of past climate warming. Three such outcomes have been proposed for rear-edge populations: maintenance of high diversity due to long-term persistence, strong genetic drift following habitat decline, and strong local adaptation allowing persistence despite environmental change. Empirical studies rarely explicitly test these alternate outcomes limiting our understanding of evolutionary responses to warming climates. We tested all three evolutionary outcomes at the rear edge of the North American herb Campanula americana, by assessing genetic variation in a genome-wide population genetic study, drift load as measure of fitness decline due to drift in a controlled crossing study, and local adaptation in a transplant study. Rear-edge populations exhibited reduced genetic diversity within populations and high differentiation among populations, typically interpreted as evidence of genetic drift, yet show limited drift load. Instead, these populations expressed strong local adaptation, thriving in rear-edge habitats that were unsuitably warm for populations in the expanded range. This indicates that warm-edge populations may persist under warming climates by gradually adapting, even in the face of genetic erosion. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly testing for all evolutionary outcomes, and particularly going beyond measures of genetic variation, when inferring evolutionary history. More broadly, these findings identify rear-edge populations not as relics of decline, but as underappreciated models for studying successful adaptation under long-term climate change.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

This mechanism readily occurs in annual plants whose seeds do not necessarily germinate each year but instead remain dormant in a seed bank. Yet, how plasticity in germination timing affects genetic diversification and ecological speciation under temporally varying conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we use mathematical modeling and individual-based simulations to investigate the joint evolution of a combination of traits controlling plastic seed germination and plant fecundity under interannual environmental fluctuations. We show that adaptive plasticity in germination readily evolves via a genetic association between seed and plant traits, allowing seeds to germinate preferentially in years favorable for their subsequent growth and reproduction. Such adaptive plasticity enhances the storage effect and promotes genetic divergence among different morphs specialized to distinct yearly conditions. Because these morphs germinate preferentially in different years, plastic germination indirectly generates temporal assortative mating, thereby maintaining genetic associations among seed and plant traits despite the absence of physical linkage between loci controlling these traits. This temporal assortative mating ultimately leads to reproductive isolation between morphs, thus laying the foundation for ecological speciation. Our findings show that adaptive plasticity and genetic diversification are not mutually exclusive but can interact synergistically to enhance biodiversity.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, this paper introduces GIFT, a novel data analytic method that enhances the power of genetic analyses, enabling the use of smaller datasets without compromising precision. In a small cohort of 157 ponies, GIFT was applied to examine the complex trait of height at withers, comparing its performance to traditional GWAS. Only GIFT identified genetic loci linked to insulin physiology validating, in turn, a long-standing hypothesis that height at withers is associated with insulin physiology in equids, potentially promoting equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Additionally, by redefining correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), GIFT offers new insights into linkage disequilibrium and epistatic interactions that, through the development of a network centrality measure, distinguishes core from peripheral genes within gene networks involved in height at withers. By reducing the time and cost associated with large-scale genotype phenotype mapping studies, GIFT expands access to quantitative genetic research, enabling smaller-scale investigations to explore the genetic architecture of complex traits with greater resolution.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

While high-resolution and high-throughput methods have significantly advanced our understanding of how proteins interact with each other, the molecular details of many important protein-protein interactions are still poorly characterized, especially in non-mammalian species, including Drosophila. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have enabled the prediction of molecular details in various cellular pathways at the network level. In this study, we used AlphaFold2 multimer to examine and predict protein-protein interactions from both physical and functional datasets in Drosophila. We found that functional associations contribute significantly to high-confidence predictions. Through detailed structural analysis, we also found the importance of intrinsically disordered regions in the predicted high-confidence interactions. Our study highlights the importance of disordered regions in protein-protein interactions and demonstrates the importance of incorporating functional interactions in predicting physical interactions between proteins. We further compiled an interactive web interface to present the predictions, facilitating functional exploration, comparative analysis, and the generation of mechanistic hypotheses for future studies.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

The various stereoisomers of copalyl diphosphate establish the greater family of labdane natural products, many of which have environmental and medicinal impact. Understanding structure-function relationships in class II diterpene synthases is crucial for guiding protein engineering campaigns aimed at the generation of diverse bicyclic diterpene scaffolds. However, only a limited number of structures are available for class II cyclases from bacteria, plants, and humans, and no structures are available for a class II cyclase from a fungus. Further, bifunctional class II terpene synthases have not been investigated with regard to substrate channeling between the prenyltransferase and the cyclase. Here, we report the 2.9 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 63-kD class II cyclase domain from PvCPS. Comparisons with bacterial and plant copalyl diphosphate synthases reveal conserved residues that likely guide the formation of the bicyclic labdane core, but divergent catalytic dyads that mediate the final deprotonation step of catalysis. Substrate competition experiments reveal preferential GGPP transit from the PvCPS prenyltransferase to the cyclase, even when prepared as separate constructs. These results are consistent with a model in which transient prenyltransferase-cyclase association facilitates substrate channeling due to active site proximity.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Localized to distinct foci on the cell membrane, class A sortases (SrtAs) recognize a cell wall sorting signal (CWSS), and following cleavage at this specific binding motif, target proteins are ligated to precursors of the growing peptidoglycan layer. This activity of SrtA enzymes is utilized extensively in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) strategies, for a variety of protein engineering applications. Typically, engineered variants of SrtA are used for SML experiments considering the relatively low catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Understandably, most biochemical studies are conducted with the isolated catalytic domain of SrtA enzymes from various bacteria, and the stereochemistry of the endogenous interaction between SrtA and substrate is not well understood. Here, we used AlphaFold2 to create a model of the full-length SrtA enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes (spySrtA) with or without either a peptide substrate or a portion of M protein, a cellular target. We ran triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations for each model embedded in a lipid bilayer, which revealed several stereochemical features of this system. Contact map analyses revealed specific interactions between catalytic domain positions of spySrtA and the lipid bilayer, as well as between the enzyme and M protein residues outside the canonical LPXTG pentapeptide CWSS. We also characterized a potential transmembrane domain interaction between spySrtA and M protein that we predict orients and stabilizes substrate binding. Taken together, these interactions likely increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for its substrates in vivo, and may provide important stereochemical insights for SML uses.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

While FBXO22 was previously identified as capable of recognizing ligands bearing a primary amine degron, further investigation and development of recruitment ligands is required to enable its broader utility for TPD. Here, we describe the discovery of chemical probes that can either selectively degrade FBXO22 or recruit this ligase for TPD applications. First, we describe AHPC(Me)-C6-NH2 as a potent and selective FBXO22 degrader (DC50 = 77 nM, Dmax = 99%) that is suitable for interrogating the effects of FBXO22 loss of function. Further, we discovered that the simple hexane-1,6-diamine acts as a minimal FBXO22 self-degrader, whereas shorter C4 (putrescine) to C5 (cadaverine) analogs, found in mammalian cells, do not induce degradation. Finally, we found that 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2-PCA) functions as a novel electrophilic degron capable of forming a reversible thioketal with cysteine 326 for recruiting FBXO22.

Infections caused by these pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, lead to high rates of complications, particularly in compromised patients such as cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The need to counteract and minimize the forecast future impact has led to the rescue of phage therapy. The use of bacteriophages has important advantages, including highly specific targeting, self-amplification at the infection site, minimal disruption of the microbiome, safety and biocompatibility. However, the capacity of bacteria to escape these entities results in a form of resistance that compromises the effectiveness of the therapy. This involves the search for potential alternatives, such as the phage tail-like bacteriocins (PTLBs), also named as tailocins. These high molecular weight particles resemble the tail structure of bacteriophages and are characterized by the absence of genetic material, avoiding the development of resistance, one of the major handicaps associated with phage therapy. In this study, we detected 34 different PTLBs in 75 P. aeruginosa genomes, with different serotypes and sequence types, 11 of which were characterized as novel F-type PTLBs subtypes (F13-F24). Furthermore, we report that four selected PTLBs (R1, F15, F19, R3-F24) can deal with bacterial infection, with the R1 and the F15 PTLBs being the most efficient in clearing infection in vitro, yielding a survival rate of more than 75% in the Galleria mellonella larvae in vivo model.

However, the direct effects of these cytokines on trophoblast differentiation and invasion remain unclear. Using human trophoblast organoid models, we demonstrate that IFN- and TNF- impair EVT invasion while preserving their differentiation capacity. High-resolution imaging of untreated organoid-decidua co-cultures revealed extensive invasion of organoid-derived trophoblasts into the decidual stroma and spiral arteries. In contrast, organoids treated with IFN-, in particular, exhibited markedly reduced invasion within this system. Transcriptome profiling indicated altered expression of several pathways involved in invasion upon cytokine treatment.

Yet the spatiotemporal organization of Ca2+ activity and its regulation across a vascular plexus is poorly understood in an in vivo mammalian context, largely due to technical barriers. To overcome this gap in knowledge, we developed an approach to resolve Ca2+ activity with single cell resolution in the skin vasculature of live adult mice by multi-photon imaging. Here, we tracked thousands of Ca2+ events in the skin capillary plexus during homeostasis and observed signaling heterogeneity between ECs, with just over half displaying Ca2+ activity over minutes. Longitudinal tracking of the same mice revealed that the same ECs maintain Ca2+ activity over days to weeks. Interestingly, activity dynamics, such as frequency and event duration, are not conserved at a single cell level but at an EC population level. To identify the molecular underpinning of this spatiotemporal Ca2+ activity, we conditionally deleted in ECs the most expressed gap junction protein - Connexin 43 (Cx43). We found that loss of Cx43 initially causes a subset of ECs to display sustained Ca2+ activity and biases the dynamics of the whole network towards chronically persistent activity over time. Lastly, through pharmacological targeting of a small panel of known Ca2+ mediators, we showed that inhibition of L-type Voltage Gated Ca2+ channels largely restores physiological Ca2+ activity after loss of Cx43, but has no effect on signaling dynamics in homeostatic settings.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

Single-cell populations in the pigtail macaque were strikingly similar in their identity and frequency to those found in the human placenta, including cells from trophoblast, stromal cell, immune, and macrophage lineages. An advantage of our approach was the deep sequencing of three tissues at the maternal-fetal interface, which yielded a rich diversity of common and rare single-cell populations.

Here, we leveraged these tools to develop a generalizable method for designing novel self-assembling proteins starting from AlphaFold2 predictions of oligomeric protein building blocks. We used the method to generate six new 60-subunit protein nanoparticles with icosahedral symmetry, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of three of them revealed that they were designed with atomic-level accuracy. To transform one of these nanoparticles into a functional immunogen, we reoriented its termini through circular permutation, added a genetically encoded oligomannose-type glycan, and displayed a stabilized trimeric variant of the influenza hemagglutinin receptor binding domain through a rigid de novo linker. The resultant immunogen elicited potent receptor-blocking and neutralizing antibody responses in mice.

We applied this approach to two DNA sequences previously predicted to exhibit strongly preferred poloidal orientations. The observed relative positions of NeutrAvidin shifted between the inside and outside of the minicircle with different phases, indicating distinct poloidal orientations for the two sequences. Coarse-grained simulations revealed narrowly distributed poloidal orientations with different mean orientations for each sequence, consistent with the AFM results.

Cancer patients had higher serum levels of CLEC11A [odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.26, p = 0.004], IL-7 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.48-5.04, p = 0.014), IL-8 (OR 6.30, 95% CI 2.23-20.0, p = 0.017), and IL-13 (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.33-5.37, p = 0.041). The CCL5 levels were lower in cancer patients compared with controls (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.60, p = 0.014). Conclusions: In a large cohort of 239 patients, we identified five biomarkers for which serum levels associated with gastric cancer: CCL5, CLEC11A, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-13. High serum levels of CLEC11A have not previously been associated with gastric cancer. Our results provide new support to further explore the effect of these inflammatory molecules and the role they play in gastric cancer. This may help identify novel noninvasive diagnostic methods as well as potential new druggable targets.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

J.; Booth, C. J.; Smith, K.; Hayter, E. A.; Cartwright, E. J.; Trafford, A. W.; Dibb, K. M.", "abstract": "Dysferlin is a membrane-associated protein that supports skeletal muscle function such that mutations in the DYSF gene can cause muscular dystrophy. Growing evidence suggests dysferlin regulates cardiac function, but this is less well understood. Tight regulation of the cardiac transverse-(T)-tubule network and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling mechanism is essential for healthy cardiac physiology. Remodelling of T-tubules and the EC coupling mechanism is observed during periods of cardiac stress and pathologies, promoting arrhythmias. However, little is known about how these processes are regulated and any protective mechanisms which may limit detrimental effects. Using a global dysferlin knockout (KO) mouse we have shown that the loss of dysferlin leads to a decrease in T-tubule density and the amplitude and rate of decay of the systolic Ca2+ transient but a narrowing of the dyadic cleft. Electrical mapping of ex vivo DYSF KO hearts shows they are more susceptible to ventricular arrhythmias. To induce stress, we used hypo-osmotic shock injury (OSI) to damage T-tubule networks in cardiac myocytes, in vitro. OSI increased T-tubule fragmentation and caused dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ handling in dysferlin KO cells relative to WT controls. Finally, we observed that a natural decline in WT cardiac dysferlin abundance, which may contribute to the natural age-dependent maladaptive T-tubule remodelling that occurs in the mammalian ventricle. In summary, these findings demonstrate an essential role for dysferlin in cardiac physiology, especially during conditions of stress, which is decreased in normal ageing.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}

N.; Klepacki, D.; Zhurakovskaya, A. I.; Vazquez-Laslop, N.; Mankin, A. S.; Polikanov, Y. S.; Gagnon, M. G.", "abstract": "The development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is essential to address the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. Protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic bottromycin (BOT), a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP), has long been known for its potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria but was largely neglected due in part to the lack of understanding of its mechanism of action. Here we uncover the unprecedented mode translation inhibition strategy employed by BOT. Using biochemical, microbiological, genetic, and structural approaches, we show that BOT acts by selectively trapping elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) in complex with glycyl-tRNA on the ribosome. BOT binds at the interface between EF-Tu and the CCA-end of Gly-tRNA, stabilizing the EF-Tu/Gly-tRNA complex in a pre-accommodated A/T-state on the ribosome, and specifically arresting translation at glycine codons. This mode of action is mechanistically distinct from that of other EF-Tu-targeting antibiotics, which act in a tRNA-agnostic fashion. Point mutations in EF-Tu confer high-level resistance to BOT, confirming EF-Tu as the direct and essential target of the drug. Our findings establish BOT as a founding member of a new class of antibiotics that stall the ribosome at defined mRNA sites by trapping a specific elongation factor-tRNA complex.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": ""}
